It features orcust and phantom knight engines for extra disruption. The deck runs 45 cards for the extra resources because the deck sends so many cards to the graveyard. The main goal when going first is to set up fog blade(s) and dingirsu to paralyze your opponent. Sea archiver, psychic wheeleder, and edge imp sabers serve as extenders. Forbidden Droplet is a good board breaker which synergizes well with a deck that wants to discard certain cards to the graveyard while crippling the opponents field.&nbsp;</p>"

For the Prediction Princess portion of the Deck, we are playing 2 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, 2 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>, and 3 <strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong>. We are playing a much smaller amount of Prediction Princess cards because we still want access to them, but we want to access them solely from the Deck. If you draw 1 piece, it is fine, but drawing more than that will mean that we are not drawing any combo pieces. To go with them, we have 2 <strong>World Legacy Guardragon Mardark</strong> and 2 <strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong>. Mardark is a Level 9 for <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> and is also a World Legacy monster in name to turn on <strong>Lib the World Key Blademaster</strong>. As for Deus-X, it will be Summoned off of Tarotreith. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">For the Dark Sage package, we are playing 1 <strong>Dark Sage</strong>, 1 <strong>Dark Magician</strong>, 2 <strong>Blue Dragon Summoner</strong>, 2 <strong>Time Wizard</strong>, and 3 <strong>Second Coin Toss</strong>. Dark Sage can be Summoned straight from the Deck, so we only need the 1 copy. Dark Magician is searchable off of Blue Dragon Summoner which you will get off of <strong>Rescue Ferret</strong>. The same goes for Time Wizard, whom we are playing the Second Coin Tosses for as they help ensure that we call the toss right. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">For the Isolde package, we are playing 2 <strong>Destiny HERO Malicious</strong> and 3 <strong>Vision HERO Vyon</strong>, 3 <strong>Neo Space Connector</strong> and 2 <strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</strong>, 1 <strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong>, and 1 <strong>Armageddon Knight</strong>. Mali and Vyon get you to Isolde through 1 card and the same goes for Connector and Aqua Dolphin. Armageddon Knight is what we are getting off of Isolde. We are not playing the whole <strong>D.D.R. - Different Dimension Reincarnation</strong> and <strong>Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite</strong> mumbo jumbo because we only need the 1 send off of Armageddon Knight. For our Equips, we are playing 1 <strong>Broken Bamboo Sword</strong>, 1 <strong>Cursed Bamboo Sword</strong>, 1 <strong>Moon Mirror Shield</strong>, 1 <strong>Living Fossil</strong>, 1 <strong>Phoenix Gearblade</strong>, and 1 <strong>Overdone Burial</strong>. Living Fossil can just bring back a Level 4 or lower monster from GY if you do draw it. Overdone Burial discards a monster to target a monster in Gy whose Level is lower than the discarded monster's Level and Special Summon it. It's not great, but it is still a reborn spell at the end of the day that does something for us if we do accidentally open it. Cursed Bamboo Sword and Phoenix Gearblade both have the ability to add a Spell to your hand if sent to GY. Cursed Bamboo Sword gets you Broken Bamboo Sword from Deck to hand while Gearblade adds itself from GY back to hand. This ensures that you have a Spell in hand to discard to activate <strong>Summoner Monk</strong>'s effect. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">For the extra Level 4 enablers, we have 3 <strong>Photon Thrasher</strong>, 1 <strong>Instant Fusion</strong>, 3 <strong>Ready Fusion</strong>, and 1 <strong>Monster Reborn</strong>. Thrasher just Special Summons itself from hand if you control no monsters. Instant Fusion can get us <strong>Master of Ham</strong>, but it can also get us <strong>Karbonala Warrior </strong>which is Level 4 for a free Level 4 on field for us to use to make Dugares. The same goes for Ready Fusion. Reborn can bring back a Neo Space Connector that you used as Link Material for Isolde as long as you didn't add a Connector to hand off of Isolde's effect on Link Summon. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">For everything else in the Main Deck, we have 2 <strong>Rescue Ferret</strong>, 3 <strong>Summoner Monk</strong>, 3 <strong>Magical Mallet</strong>, 3 <strong>Reload</strong>, 1 <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>, and 1 <strong>World Legacy Succession</strong>. Ferret can shuffle itself from field into Deck to Special Summon monsters from your Deck whose total combined Levels equal 6 to zones Link Monsters point to. This is how you are accessing Blue Dragon Summoner and Time Wizard as Summoner is a Level 4 and Time Wizard is a Level 2. You Special Summon Ferret from Deck through Summoner Monk who discards a Spell to Special Summon a Level 4 monster from Deck. Monk is what you are always going to be dumping off of Armageddon Knight so that Dugares can bring it back. Mallet and Reload allow you to try to correct your hand and it can also shuffle a Dark Sage back into Deck because you want that it in Deck as it is a hard brick. Monstrosity is searched off of Dark Sage on Summon and it is what gets you to Bibliomuse and Mardark from Deck. Succession is set from Deck off of Lib and it allows you to get a Level 9 back from Gy to have material for <strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong>. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Extra Deck: 1 <strong>Master of Ham</strong> which you usually don't summon even if you have Instant Fusion because Ham itself and the monster you get off of it blocks your zones which you need for Link Summoning and Rescue Ferret stuff. 1 <strong>Karbonala Warrior</strong> as an accessible Level 4. 1 <strong>Herald of the Arc Light </strong>which searches a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell if sent to Gy. 1 <strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> which dumps Herald from Extra Deck on Xyz Summon and detaches to reattach Herald from GY for another send when sent to Gy. 1 <strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1 <strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong> for our Rank 9 interruption option. 1 <strong>Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</strong> which detaches 2 to Special Summon a monster from Gy which you use to get back Summoner Monk you dumped off of Armageddon Knight. 1 <strong>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</strong> which you could go into if you are interrupted and are unable to continue comboing. 1 <strong>Saryuja Skull Dread</strong>. We are using it's 3 mat effect to Summon Dark Magician from hand and using its 4 mat effect to dig for Second Coin Tosses. 1 <strong>Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</strong> to Link off Time Wizard to refresh it as Ferret negates its effects. 1 <strong>Lib the World Key Blademaster</strong> to get us Succession to bring back a Level 9 for Rank 9 plays. 1 <strong>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</strong> to access Armageddon Knight. 1 <strong>S:P Little Knight</strong>, 1 <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, and 1 <strong>Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</strong>. </span></p>"

I wanted to make a pure, honest build that didn't need to run engines like the machina junk and I think I mostly succeeded? Obviously the deck is ashable (and just interruptable in general in a lot of ways) but if they are unfamiliar with the deck (which a lot of people should be) then you could definitely play around ash on your merchant and you can also setup a negate before you go for your plays with the super heavy samurai engine. Speaking of which, as someone who skipped the meta where those were added to the game, this deck loves + 6 rotas that can also make baronne before your normal summon. Well I'm sure a lot of decks do but it's nice we get to play them and we even have some setups where we can unbrick booster out of hand by going into musashi. I'm sure this deck isn't anything to write home about but consistent + gets to play a lot of hand traps is usually a pretty decent recipe.</p><p>Your combos are pretty simple but it's basically merchant search bonze and then have any of barrel, gama, oil, another merchant, komachi, or cash cache in your hand (you can also search oil if you have bonze in hand already to combo). Alternatively komachi then cash cache to search merchant also combos. Your end board isn't crazy at all: 2 super shoguns with 1-2 gamas in gy (and 1 more super shogun if you drew an extra 3rd card for your combo), BUT your combo pieces replace themselves over the course of your combo thanks to steel shogun so you end with 4-5 cards in hand. In my testing I've never comboed off and only had the 2 interruptions at the end, you always draw into/start with at least a hand trap and often more. Usually you end turn 1 (assuming you weren't interrupted) with 4-5 forms of interruption and even if you were you still have your high handtrap count to fall back on.</p><p>Anyways, enjoy. Deck isn't perfect by any means and there are still a couple things I'm unsure I want to be on (like rafflesia) and some I would love to find room for (anatomy) but this was the best list I've been able to come up with.</p>"

Due to hits on the masterduel banlist, Kashtira is a middling deck on ladder, bricking constantly and folding to interruption very easily. It also struggles to put two 7's on board with out XYZ locking itself, preventing it from utilising galaxy tomahawk. By using only the good kashtira cards and instead combining them with an engine of Armed Dragons and Dragon rulers, you end up with a more consistent deck that can make galaxy tomahawk with ease, occasionally with protection due to sauravis. The decks main goal is to make galaxy tomahawk and end with Spright Elf, Borreload and Colossus with at least 2 but potentially 3 or 4 cards in hand left at the end. While stronger boards can be made by commiting more bricks into the main deck and synchros into the extra deck, it is often&nbsp;<span class=""yKMVIe"" role=""heading"" aria-level=""1"">unnecessary</span> and ruins any potential followup if the board is broken. It also makes room for toolbox XYZ like Dark Armed Dragon and Big Eye. After interruption or in a weak hand Kashtira Arise Heart or Voloferniges are strong backup plans. The dragon rulers in particular have great synergy with Arise-Heart, allowing them to trigger their effects when banished and then be recovered if they are detached from him. They are also good endboard pieces to extend into after the tomahawk line is done. The side deck is not tested due to the BO1 format and will need refining. This deck is quite modifiable depending on personal preference, with cards like Blaster, tidal and burner dragon rulers, Koaki Meiru Drago as a tempest search target, Pot of Prosperity and Armed Thunder Dragon Lvl 10 are all potential includes. Extra deck options such as mountain smasher, shangri-ira and draccossack are also very good. This is my personal favourite configuration of the deck, having got me to Master 4 playing a similar list last season.</p>"
