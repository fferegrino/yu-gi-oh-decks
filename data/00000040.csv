It features orcust and phantom knight engines for extra disruption. The deck runs 45 cards for the extra resources because the deck sends so many cards to the graveyard. The main goal when going first is to set up fog blade(s) and dingirsu to paralyze your opponent. Sea archiver, psychic wheeleder, and edge imp sabers serve as extenders. Forbidden Droplet is a good board breaker which synergizes well with a deck that wants to discard certain cards to the graveyard while crippling the opponents field.&nbsp;</p>"

For the Prediction Princess portion of the Deck, we are playing 2 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, 2 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>, and 3 <strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong>. We are playing a much smaller amount of Prediction Princess cards because we still want access to them, but we want to access them solely from the Deck. If you draw 1 piece, it is fine, but drawing more than that will mean that we are not drawing any combo pieces. To go with them, we have 2 <strong>World Legacy Guardragon Mardark</strong> and 2 <strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong>. Mardark is a Level 9 for <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> and is also a World Legacy monster in name to turn on <strong>Lib the World Key Blademaster</strong>. As for Deus-X, it will be Summoned off of Tarotreith. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">For the Dark Sage package, we are playing 1 <strong>Dark Sage</strong>, 1 <strong>Dark Magician</strong>, 2 <strong>Blue Dragon Summoner</strong>, 2 <strong>Time Wizard</strong>, and 3 <strong>Second Coin Toss</strong>. Dark Sage can be Summoned straight from the Deck, so we only need the 1 copy. Dark Magician is searchable off of Blue Dragon Summoner which you will get off of <strong>Rescue Ferret</strong>. The same goes for Time Wizard, whom we are playing the Second Coin Tosses for as they help ensure that we call the toss right. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">For the Isolde package, we are playing 2 <strong>Destiny HERO Malicious</strong> and 3 <strong>Vision HERO Vyon</strong>, 3 <strong>Neo Space Connector</strong> and 2 <strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</strong>, 1 <strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong>, and 1 <strong>Armageddon Knight</strong>. Mali and Vyon get you to Isolde through 1 card and the same goes for Connector and Aqua Dolphin. Armageddon Knight is what we are getting off of Isolde. We are not playing the whole <strong>D.D.R. - Different Dimension Reincarnation</strong> and <strong>Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite</strong> mumbo jumbo because we only need the 1 send off of Armageddon Knight. For our Equips, we are playing 1 <strong>Broken Bamboo Sword</strong>, 1 <strong>Cursed Bamboo Sword</strong>, 1 <strong>Moon Mirror Shield</strong>, 1 <strong>Living Fossil</strong>, 1 <strong>Phoenix Gearblade</strong>, and 1 <strong>Overdone Burial</strong>. Living Fossil can just bring back a Level 4 or lower monster from GY if you do draw it. Overdone Burial discards a monster to target a monster in Gy whose Level is lower than the discarded monster's Level and Special Summon it. It's not great, but it is still a reborn spell at the end of the day that does something for us if we do accidentally open it. Cursed Bamboo Sword and Phoenix Gearblade both have the ability to add a Spell to your hand if sent to GY. Cursed Bamboo Sword gets you Broken Bamboo Sword from Deck to hand while Gearblade adds itself from GY back to hand. This ensures that you have a Spell in hand to discard to activate <strong>Summoner Monk</strong>'s effect. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">For the extra Level 4 enablers, we have 3 <strong>Photon Thrasher</strong>, 1 <strong>Instant Fusion</strong>, 3 <strong>Ready Fusion</strong>, and 1 <strong>Monster Reborn</strong>. Thrasher just Special Summons itself from hand if you control no monsters. Instant Fusion can get us <strong>Master of Ham</strong>, but it can also get us <strong>Karbonala Warrior </strong>which is Level 4 for a free Level 4 on field for us to use to make Dugares. The same goes for Ready Fusion. Reborn can bring back a Neo Space Connector that you used as Link Material for Isolde as long as you didn't add a Connector to hand off of Isolde's effect on Link Summon. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">For everything else in the Main Deck, we have 2 <strong>Rescue Ferret</strong>, 3 <strong>Summoner Monk</strong>, 3 <strong>Magical Mallet</strong>, 3 <strong>Reload</strong>, 1 <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>, and 1 <strong>World Legacy Succession</strong>. Ferret can shuffle itself from field into Deck to Special Summon monsters from your Deck whose total combined Levels equal 6 to zones Link Monsters point to. This is how you are accessing Blue Dragon Summoner and Time Wizard as Summoner is a Level 4 and Time Wizard is a Level 2. You Special Summon Ferret from Deck through Summoner Monk who discards a Spell to Special Summon a Level 4 monster from Deck. Monk is what you are always going to be dumping off of Armageddon Knight so that Dugares can bring it back. Mallet and Reload allow you to try to correct your hand and it can also shuffle a Dark Sage back into Deck because you want that it in Deck as it is a hard brick. Monstrosity is searched off of Dark Sage on Summon and it is what gets you to Bibliomuse and Mardark from Deck. Succession is set from Deck off of Lib and it allows you to get a Level 9 back from Gy to have material for <strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong>. </span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Extra Deck: 1 <strong>Master of Ham</strong> which you usually don't summon even if you have Instant Fusion because Ham itself and the monster you get off of it blocks your zones which you need for Link Summoning and Rescue Ferret stuff. 1 <strong>Karbonala Warrior</strong> as an accessible Level 4. 1 <strong>Herald of the Arc Light </strong>which searches a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell if sent to Gy. 1 <strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> which dumps Herald from Extra Deck on Xyz Summon and detaches to reattach Herald from GY for another send when sent to Gy. 1 <strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1 <strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong> for our Rank 9 interruption option. 1 <strong>Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</strong> which detaches 2 to Special Summon a monster from Gy which you use to get back Summoner Monk you dumped off of Armageddon Knight. 1 <strong>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</strong> which you could go into if you are interrupted and are unable to continue comboing. 1 <strong>Saryuja Skull Dread</strong>. We are using it's 3 mat effect to Summon Dark Magician from hand and using its 4 mat effect to dig for Second Coin Tosses. 1 <strong>Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</strong> to Link off Time Wizard to refresh it as Ferret negates its effects. 1 <strong>Lib the World Key Blademaster</strong> to get us Succession to bring back a Level 9 for Rank 9 plays. 1 <strong>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</strong> to access Armageddon Knight. 1 <strong>S:P Little Knight</strong>, 1 <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, and 1 <strong>Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</strong>. </span></p>"

I wanted to make a pure, honest build that didn't need to run engines like the machina junk and I think I mostly succeeded? Obviously the deck is ashable (and just interruptable in general in a lot of ways) but if they are unfamiliar with the deck (which a lot of people should be) then you could definitely play around ash on your merchant and you can also setup a negate before you go for your plays with the super heavy samurai engine. Speaking of which, as someone who skipped the meta where those were added to the game, this deck loves + 6 rotas that can also make baronne before your normal summon. Well I'm sure a lot of decks do but it's nice we get to play them and we even have some setups where we can unbrick booster out of hand by going into musashi. I'm sure this deck isn't anything to write home about but consistent + gets to play a lot of hand traps is usually a pretty decent recipe.</p><p>Your combos are pretty simple but it's basically merchant search bonze and then have any of barrel, gama, oil, another merchant, komachi, or cash cache in your hand (you can also search oil if you have bonze in hand already to combo). Alternatively komachi then cash cache to search merchant also combos. Your end board isn't crazy at all: 2 super shoguns with 1-2 gamas in gy (and 1 more super shogun if you drew an extra 3rd card for your combo), BUT your combo pieces replace themselves over the course of your combo thanks to steel shogun so you end with 4-5 cards in hand. In my testing I've never comboed off and only had the 2 interruptions at the end, you always draw into/start with at least a hand trap and often more. Usually you end turn 1 (assuming you weren't interrupted) with 4-5 forms of interruption and even if you were you still have your high handtrap count to fall back on.</p><p>Anyways, enjoy. Deck isn't perfect by any means and there are still a couple things I'm unsure I want to be on (like rafflesia) and some I would love to find room for (anatomy) but this was the best list I've been able to come up with.</p>"

Due to hits on the masterduel banlist, Kashtira is a middling deck on ladder, bricking constantly and folding to interruption very easily. It also struggles to put two 7's on board with out XYZ locking itself, preventing it from utilising galaxy tomahawk. By using only the good kashtira cards and instead combining them with an engine of Armed Dragons and Dragon rulers, you end up with a more consistent deck that can make galaxy tomahawk with ease, occasionally with protection due to sauravis. The decks main goal is to make galaxy tomahawk and end with Spright Elf, Borreload and Colossus with at least 2 but potentially 3 or 4 cards in hand left at the end. While stronger boards can be made by commiting more bricks into the main deck and synchros into the extra deck, it is often&nbsp;<span class=""yKMVIe"" role=""heading"" aria-level=""1"">unnecessary</span> and ruins any potential followup if the board is broken. It also makes room for toolbox XYZ like Dark Armed Dragon and Big Eye. After interruption or in a weak hand Kashtira Arise Heart or Voloferniges are strong backup plans. The dragon rulers in particular have great synergy with Arise-Heart, allowing them to trigger their effects when banished and then be recovered if they are detached from him. They are also good endboard pieces to extend into after the tomahawk line is done. The side deck is not tested due to the BO1 format and will need refining. This deck is quite modifiable depending on personal preference, with cards like Blaster, tidal and burner dragon rulers, Koaki Meiru Drago as a tempest search target, Pot of Prosperity and Armed Thunder Dragon Lvl 10 are all potential includes. Extra deck options such as mountain smasher, shangri-ira and draccossack are also very good.

Today, we are focusing on two Level 9's:&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Immortal Phoenix Gearfried</strong>. I originally was planning to write off Charles as a Level 9 Synchro you can simply just go into off of the Assault Mode package with&nbsp;<strong>Psi-Reflector</strong> back in my <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/synchro-prediction-princess-341817"">Synchro Prediction Princess</a> list, but I have reconsidered because I completely forgot about the existence of the DUNE Infernoble Knight support up until they started topping recently. The new support provides a much easier time getting to Charles and even gives you more to work with in&nbsp;<strong>Emperor Charles the Great</strong> which essentially copies Charles' effect and adds on a Spell/Trap card/effect negate. Immortal Phoenix Gearfried was already easy to Summon as all you need to do is banish an Equip Spell from field or Gy to Special Summon it from hand. However, Equip Spells just don't go well in Prediction Princess because the ones that are generically good or are Ritual-related just act more as bricks unless you have a good way to access them with the same going for Immortal Gearfried. Access to Angelica basically gives you access to the whole Infernoble line. We cannot play <strong>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</strong> in this Deck because we don't have space for starters which get you to Isolde and we definitely don't have space for the rest of the Equips to send off of Isolde. The benefit of playing Isolde in Infernoble is that she accesses a your combo pieces straight from the Deck which prevents you from having to actually draw all of the pieces of your combo. You only need to get to Angelica in order to facilitate the rest of your Infernoble combo, so you realistically only need to play a small Infernoble package and have a lot of room for non-engine in the Deck. We don't get that benefit in this Deck as we can't play Isolde and have to actually draw our combo pieces. However, that isn't too difficult as we have a lot of ways to actually search for our combo pieces. The only card that is relatively harder to search is&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> because you are very easily able to access your Infernoble stuff through cards like&nbsp;<strong>Noble Arms Museum</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>""Infernoble Arms - Durendal""</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Heritage of the Chalice</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong>, and even&nbsp;<strong>Terraforming</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong> to get to those cards. Full combo requires you to have access to Angelica as well as&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>. However, if you do draw Immortal Phoenix Gearfried and are able to Summon him while you have Monstrosity in hand, you achieve full combo as well, just possible not along with the benefits of going through and ending on the Infernoble line.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Main Deck: 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on field face-up or face-down and during the End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down. Tarotreith must be either Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei's End Phase effect. Her Flip Effect allows you to Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down and while she is on field, she can Quick Effect flip any of your monsters face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from Gy if she was Tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect allows you to add a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand and while she is face-up on field, she gives your Ritual Monsters targeting and destruction protection from your opponent's effects. 2&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's side of the field after is has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it. 1&nbsp;<strong>Immortal Phoenix Gearfried</strong> which can be Special Summoned from hand by banishing an Equip Spell from field or GY. If it attacks, it can equip a face-up monster on the field to itself as an Equip Spell that gives it 500 ATK at the start of the damage step. And when a monster effect is activated, you can send a face-up Equip Spell you control to the Gy to negate the activation and destroy that monster. If you are able to draw this and Monstrosity with the ability to Summon it right on the spot, you will have immediate access to all of your Prediction Princess plays. And while that does come with a monster negate along with your Prediction Princess plays, you really don't need a monster negate when you have access to Deus-X Krawler. If you are unable to get to your Infernoble lines but have Immortal Gearfried, that gives you a way to potentially have the ability to do all of your Prediction Princess combos. For your Infernobles, we are playing 3&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Ogier</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Turpin</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Renaud</strong>. Ogier sends a Noble Arms or FIRE Warrior monster from Deck to GY on Normal or Special Summon. This can help you get Turpin into the GY so it can Summon itself back or so that you can target Angelica to attempt to Equip Turpin to trigger Angelica. Ogier can also Equip itself to a Warrior monster from GY to give that monster protection from being destroyed by card effects. Turpin can Special Summon itself from hand or GY if you control a monster equipped with an Equip Card but it is banished if it leaves field if you Summoned it from GY. You can also equip it from GY to a Warrior monster you control as an Equip Spell that allows you to treat the equipped monster as a Tuner if used as Synchro Material. Because Turpin is often just a free Summon, it is nice to max out on him, especially since we need as free Summons to get to Angelica as we do need to draw all of our combo pieces for Infernoble. Renaud can Special Summon itself from hand as a Tuner if you control a FIRE Warrior monster and if it is Special Summoned you can target a FIRE Warrior in GY or an Equip Spell that is banished or in Gy to add it back to hand. This is good if you use Ogier to dump a card like <strong>""Infernoble Arms - Durendal</strong><strong>""</strong> to add it back for a search, Turpin for a free Summon and since you added it back to hand, Special Summoning it from hand will put it back into the Gy when it leaves field and not banish it, or you can send Immortal Phoenix Gearfried to add it back and Summon it for either a monster negate or a Monstrosity target.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Spell/Traps: 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion&nbsp;</strong>for<strong> Master of Ham</strong>. As much I would like to play a Level 4 FIRE Warrior Fusion target for Instant Fusion to get material for Angelica, there doesn't exist one. 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can banish it from GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which can either Special Summon a Level 9 monster from hand or target a Level 9 monster you control and Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from Deck with a different Type and Attribute than it and with different names. 1&nbsp;<strong>Terraforming</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Noble Arms Museum</strong> which is a soft once per turn that allows you to pay 1200 Life Points to add a Noble Arms card from Deck to hand except itself. It has another soft once per turn that allows you to target a Noble Knight Monster Card in your Spell/Trap Zone and Special Summon it but you cannot Special Summon monsters for the rest of the turn if you did not control <strong>Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles</strong> on activation. Museum searches you for Durendal which gets you a search for a Level 5 or lower FIRE Warrior to access your plays. And it being able to Special Summon a Noble Knight from your Spell/Trap Zone gets you your Emperor Charles that you equipped to Charles the Great so that you can make use of Charles the Great as a Spell/Trap negate while also getting Emperor Charles back onto the field as a Level 9 target for World Legacy Monstrosity. 3 <strong>""Infernoble Arms - Durendal""&nbsp;</strong>which can add a Level 5 or lower FIRE Warrior from Deck to hand while equipped and destroys itself afterwards. If it is sent to Gy because the equipped monster is sent to the Gy, you can target and Special Summon back a Level 5 or lower FIRE Warrior monster from GY at the cost of Warrior-locking you for the rest of the turn. 3&nbsp;<strong>Heritage of the Chalice</strong> which adds a Noble Arms or Noble Knight card from your Deck or GY to your hand. And if a Noble Knight monster that's equipped with a Noble Arms Equip Spell is destroyed by battle and sent to GY, you can add this card from GY to hand. 1&nbsp;<strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham&nbsp;</strong>which Special Summons a Flip Monster from Deck face-down on Fusion Summon. 1&nbsp;<strong>Cloudcastle&nbsp;</strong>which is a card that you can make on a following turn which Special Sumons back a Level 9 monster from GY on Synchro Summon for a Rank 9 play. 1&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles</strong> which pops a cardon field if an Equip Card becomes equipped to a monster on field and it can Equip an Equip Spell from hand or Gy and then Equip a FIRE Warrior monster from Deck to itself during the End Phase. 2&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Captain Roland</strong> which we are always Summoning off of Angelica and as a Quick Effect during the Main Phase, he can Equip himself from GY to a Warrior monster you control to give it 500 ATK. This triggers Emperor Charles or Charles the Great that copied the effect of Emperor Charles on your opponent's turn. 1&nbsp;<strong>Angelica, Princess of Noble Arms</strong> which adds a <strong>Horn of Olifant</strong> or a card that mentions&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles</strong> from Deck to hand where our only target is&nbsp;<strong>Noble Arms Museum</strong>. Also, if Angelica is targeted for an attack or by a card or effect while on field, she can Quick Effect send a FIRE Warrior monster from your Deck to the GY and banish herself until the End Phase to Special Summon a Roland monster from Deck or Extra Deck. We are always getting Infernoble Knight Captain Roland with this effect to have access to a Level 5 Tuner, which when combined with a Level 4 non-Tuner, gets you to Emperor Charles. 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> which adds a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell to hand if sent to GY. 1&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>. So how are we getting Aggregator into the GY when we can't make Gravity Controller with it as Charles the Great is going to be in our EMZ and since Masquerena cannot use Link Monsters as material? Well, you can just use an Infernoble Knight's effect in GY to equip to Charles the Great, proccing its effect to pop a card on field to pop Aggregator and get it and the Herald it has attached into GY for a search. 1 <strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>S:P Little Knight</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Gravity Controller</strong>. And 1&nbsp;<strong>Emperor Charles the Great</strong> which requires a Level 9&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles</strong> that's equipped with an Equip Card as Link Material. On Link Summon, you can target and Equip Emperor Charles from GY to Charles the Great to change its name to Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles and gain its effects, and gains 500 ATK. Also, Charles the Great is a soft once per turn Spell/Trap card/effect negate by sending an Equip Spell from hand or face-up field to GY to negate the activation and destroy the card. This is great against non-targeting Spell/Traps that may deal with your board like Evenly Matched since Bibliomuse can't deal with those cards.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 3 <strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Kashtira Fenrir</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Called By the Grave</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Lightning Storm</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>"

This Deck utilizes an engine that I like to call the World Legacy engine which is a 1-card combo that gets you to&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> while also setting you up for a good position to go into a Level 9 Synchro monster to turn on said Monstrosity. I would be calling it the ""Knightmare engine"" but since&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Mermaid&nbsp;</strong>is banned, we can't really call it that, as with Mermaid, it is a 1-card combo to both Monstrosity and a Level 9 on field in <strong>Knightmare Incarnation Idlee</strong> which you get from Deck with Mermaid. I always knew that this engine was a thing but I really never experimented with it much because I just felt like not even attempting to do anything with it while Mermaid is banned. So,&nbsp;<strong>Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</strong> serves as a 1-card combo to get you to&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> and also gives you adequate set-up to go into a Level 9 Synchro monster to have a target on field for the Monstrosity you searched for. Normal Summon Girsu and activate its effect on Summon to send an Orcust or World Legacy card from Deck to GY. Send a copy of&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy - ""World Armor""</strong> from your Deck to the GY. Since you control no other monsters, you can Special Summon a&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Token</strong> to both player's field in Defense. Link off Girsu and the Token to go into&nbsp;<strong>Lib the World Key Blademaster</strong> which we are able to do because we have a World Legacy card in GY. And because a World Legacy monster is in GY, we can activate Lib's effect to set a World Legacy Spell/Trap from Deck which you are using to get a copy of&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Succession</strong>. If you get World Legacy Monstrosity with this effect, you are not able to actually activate it, even if you already have a World Legacy monster in GY which you do, because it's a Quick-Play Spell, meaning that it cannot be activated the turn it is set. With our set copy of Succession, we Special Summon back World Armor to a Zone Lib points to. World Armor on Special Summon searches for a World Legacy card from Deck, getting you Monstrosity. Now, if&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Mermaid&nbsp;</strong>were legal, we would Link off Lib and World Armor into&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Cerberus</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Phoenix</strong>, Link whatever we Summon into <strong>Knightmare Mermaid</strong>, discard a card and Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Incarnation Idlee</strong> to our field from Deck. But that isn't possible, so what we can do after getting Monstrosity off of World Armor is Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Assault Synchron</strong> from hand and Synchro it with World Armor into a Synchro 9 for a target on field for Monstrosity. So what are we playing the Synchron cards for? Other than Assault Synchron who we are using to Synchro into a Synchro 9, we are using&nbsp;<strong>Junk Converter </strong>to either search for Assault Synchron for the aformentioned reasons or to search <strong>Junk Synchron</strong> in order to Normal Summon and bring back said Converter to go into&nbsp;<strong>Accel Synchron</strong>. Just like&nbsp;<strong>Denglong, First of the Yang Zing</strong>, Accel Synchron can send a monster from Deck to GY to modify its Level. While Denglong sends a Wyrm from Deck to GY to copy its Level, Accel Synchron sends a Synchron monster from Deck to GY to either increase or decrease its Level by the Level of the sent monster. We are sending the Level 4&nbsp;<strong>Stardust Synchron</strong> (because IDK why you would choose to play&nbsp;<strong>Hyper Synchron, Road Synchron</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>Bri Synchron</strong>) in order to increase Accel Synchron's Level by 4, making it a Level 9, meaning that it can now be targeted with Monstrosity. Another benefit of playing the Synchron stuff is because it gives you a good&nbsp;<strong>Small World</strong> bridge to either Girsu or Assault Synchron. There's nothing really special about this Deck other than being able to actually search for Monstrosity easily and consistently, but I guess you could compare it somewhat to Ham Prediction Princess. However, while this Deck gives you good Monstrosity access, if you are unable to access Girsu or Prediction Princess plays, you really have nothing to work with as opposed to what you can do in Ham Prediction Princess.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the monsters: We are playing 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotreith must be either Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned by Tarotrei's End Phase effect. Her Flip Effect allows you to Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down and she can Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster face-up or face-down and can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down during the End Phase. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from the GY if she is tribtued and sent there. Her Flip Effect adds you a Prediction Princess other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck and while face-up on field, she gives your Ritual Monsters targeting and destruction protection from your opponent's effects. 2&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's side of the field after it has been flipped face-up. And if it is destroyed on field, you can add a Level 9 monster from Deck with a different Type and Attribute than it. 1<strong> World Legacy - ""World Armor""</strong> which can Special Summon itself from hand when a monster is Flip Summoned. You are usually never going to be able to do this because when you flip a monster using an effect like Tarotrei's or Tarotreith's, that is not a Flip Summon, meaning that World Armor does not trigger. So, you are usually only going to be Special Summoning it with Lib setting Succession like I explained earlier. On Normal or Special Summon, it can add a World Legacy card from Deck to hand which is always going to be&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Succession</strong>. It's last effect is not relevant as we are never going to be Normal Summoning or Setting this card. 3 <strong>Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</strong> which dumps an Orcust or World Legacy card from Deck on Normal Summon and if you control 2 or more other cards its column, you can treat it as a Tuner this turn. All you need to worry about this effect is dumping World Armor from Deck with it. If you control no other monsters, Girsu can also Special Summon a <strong>World Legacy Token</strong> to both fields in Defense. 1&nbsp;<strong>Stardust Synchron</strong> which we need to send off of Accel Synchron to modulate its Level. Accel Synchron can only send from Deck which means that we need to keep Stardust Synchron in Deck if we are going through with that line. 3&nbsp;<strong>Junk Synchron</strong> which Special Summons back a Level 2 or lower monster from GY in Defense with its effects negated on Normal Summon. 3&nbsp;<strong>Junk Converter</strong> which sends itself and a Tuner from hand to GY to search for a Synchron monster. You are either getting Junk Synchron or Assault Synchron with this. And it is sent to GY as Synchro Material, you can target a Tuner in GY and Special Summon it in Defense but you cannot activate its effects this turn. If anything the monster you Summon back is extra Link Material to go into I:P alongside the Aggregator you possibly make. 2&nbsp;<strong>Assault Synchron</strong> which you can Special Summon from hand and take 700 damage and it also Synchro locks you while its on the field this way. This along with World Armor turns into a Synchro 9 for Monstrosity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction&nbsp;</strong>which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can banish it from GY to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess monster from Deck face-down. 2&nbsp;<strong>Tuning</strong> which adds a Synchron Tuner from Deck and then sends the top card of the Deck to the GY. This basically acts as your extra copies of Assault Synchron or even Junk Synchron if necessary. 2&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which can either Special Summon a Level 9 from hand or target a Level 9 you control and Special Summon 2 Level 9's from Deck with a different Type and Attribute than it with different names. 1&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Succession</strong> to be set off of Lib which Special Summons a monster from GY to a zone a Link Monster points to. 3&nbsp;<strong>Small World</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Psychic End Punisher</strong> as we can make it with Assault Synchron and a Level 9. 1&nbsp;<strong>Cloudcastle</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys</strong> which are our Synchro 9's. Cloudcastle on Synchro Summon brings back a Level 9 from GY and Crocodragon draws a card. 1&nbsp;<strong>Accel Synchron</strong> which can send a Synchron monster from Deck to GY to increase or decrease its Level by the Level of the sent monster. 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> which searches for a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell if sent to GY. 2&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>S:P Little Knight</strong> which we can Link off Aggregator and Lib to go into. It's not as good as using I:P to go into it on your opponent's turn, but it is still interruption and a generic Link. 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>. 1 <strong>Lib the World Key Blademaster</strong> which can only be made while you have a World Legacy card in GY. During your Main Phase, you can set a World Legacy Spell/Trap from Deck but it cannot be activated unless you have a World Legacy monster in GY, and if it is sent to the GY as Link Material, you can shuffle a card on field into the Deck, including the World Legacy Token you gave your opponent off of Girsu to prevent your opponent from possibly using it as Link Material themselves.

This deck has a crap ton of interruptions when going first.</p><hr /><p>So, what about going second? This deck isn't completely screwed going second. If it's game 2/3 and you're going second, side out a few of the trap cards, since they aren't as useful going second.

I tried to look up Dino-related cards in order to see if I could spice the Deck up, and I found and read <strong>Evolsaur Lios</strong>. And that is when I figured that I could just play Evol instead and have a more fun time tinkering with the Deck. I'll still make the Dinosaur one, so look forward to that. Today's Level 9 is <strong>Jurrac Titano</strong>...kind of... We are only playing Titano as a FIRE Dinosaur target to send off of Lios in order to modulate the Levels of 2 monsters on the field to 9. If you control a Lios that was Normal Summoned or Special Summoned by the effect of a FIRE monster, you can semd a FIRE Reptile or a FIRE Dinosaur monster from your Deck to the GY to change the Level and Type of 2 monsters on the field to be the same as the sent monster's. The Type modification is meant to help you Summon&nbsp;<strong>Evolzar Dolkka </strong>and <strong>Evolzar Laggia</strong>, but we are mainly focusing on the Level modulation here. If you think about it, Lios and another monster on your field gives you 2 Level 9's to go into <strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> or if you control Lios and your opponent controls a monster, you can make both monsters Level 9 and have Lios be a Level 9 FIRE Dinosaur target on field as a target for <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>. So, all we really need is a free monster on your field and Lios or a monster on your opponent's field and Lios. And because the first sentence on Lios says that you can set an <strong>Evolutionary Bridge</strong> or an <strong>Evo-Singularity</strong> from Deck on Normal or Special Summon, you also have access to Laggia for a negation of a Spell/Trap Card or a Normal or Special Summon, Dolkka for 2 monster effect negates, or <strong>Evolzar Lars</strong> to target and negate the effects of 2 face-up cards your opponent controls through <strong>Evo-Singularity</strong> in addition to all of your Prediction Princess stuff. We are playing the Snake-Eye engine with <strong>Snake-Eyes Populus</strong>, <strong>Snake-Eye Ash</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Original Sinful Spoils - Snake-Eye</strong> in order to get to <strong>Evoltile Megachirella </strong>from Deck which can tribute itself and discard a card to get Lios from Deck with the Snake-Eye engine giving you that extra monster on field for Lios to make into a Level 9.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Main Deck monsters: 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on field face-up or face-down and during the End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down. Tarotreith must be either Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei's End Phase effect. Her Flip Effect allows you to Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. If it was worthwhile to play&nbsp;<strong>Evoltile Pholis</strong> who can Special Summon an Evoltile from hand or GY face-down on Summon in&nbsp;<strong>Evoltile Westlo</strong>, I would be running 3 Tarotreith instead, but needing to get Pholis on field and have Westlo in hand or GY is just too much of a burden for me to consider it. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from GY if she was tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand, and while she is face-up on field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent's cards and effects. 2 <strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can add a Level 9 monster with a differnet Type and Attribute than it from Deck. 1 <strong>Jurrac Titano</strong>. This card is just awful: ""Cannot be Special Summoned. Cannot be targeted by Trap or monster effects. Once per turn: You can banish a ""Jurrac"" monster with 1700 or less ATK from GY; this card gains 1000 ATK until the End Phase."" Despite it being another Level 9 Dinosaur monster to <strong>Mighty Dino King Rex</strong>, it is actually better to play Titano in both Evol and Dino Prediction Princess because Titano is a FIRE Dino that can be sent off of Lios and because&nbsp;<strong>Double Evolution Pill</strong> ignores Summoning Conditions whereas King Rex is an EARTH which is not Monstrosity-friendly in this Deck. 3 <strong>Evolsaur Lios</strong> which can set&nbsp;<strong>Evolutionary Bridge</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>Evo-Singularity</strong> from Deck on Normal or Special Summon. And during your Main Phase, if you controlled Lios that was Normal Summoned or Special Summoned by the effect of a FIRE monster, you can send a FIRE Dinosaur or Reptile monster from Deck to GY and then you can choose to make 2 monsters on field become the same Type and Level as the sent monster. We are always sending Titano to make monsters Level 9 to make Aggregator. If you control just Lios and your opponent controls a monster, you can also make your opponent's monster and Lios Level 9 to make Lios a target on field for&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Evoltile Megachirella</strong> which can Tribute a Reptile and discard a card to Special Summon a Level 6 or lower FIRE Dinosaur from Deck which you are using to get Lios. Also, you can banish it from GY to target a Dragon Xyz Monster you control with no material and attach up to 2 Reptile and/or Dinosaur monsters with different names from hand and/or GY to it as material. This doesn't come up often, so just keep it on the backburner. 3&nbsp;<strong>Kashtira Fenrir</strong> as a good piece of interruption or good for going second and as a free Summon for Lios to make a Level 9. 3&nbsp;<strong>Snake-Eye Ash</strong> which adds a Level 1 FIRE mosnter from Deck to hand on Normal or Special Summon. I am not playing the Diabellstarr stuff, nor <strong>Snake-Eyes Flamberge Dragon </strong>since it will just take up valuable Deck space for cards we don't need. Flamberge Dragon is good for getting more monsters for Link Material or setting up something for your opponent's turn which you really don't need when your Prediction Princess monsters and Flips take up so much of your endboard's field. The Diabellstarr stuff does get you to Megachirella, but it doesn't leave you with an additional monster on field for Lios to modulate Level. 1&nbsp;<strong>Snake-Eyes Populus</strong> which can be Special Summoned from hand if added to hand except by drawing. On Normal or Special Summon, it can add a Snake-Eye Spell/Trap from Deck to hand. You are always using this to get&nbsp;<strong>Original Sinful Spoils - Snake-Eye</strong>. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can banish it from GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess monster from Deck face-down. 3&nbsp;<strong>Bonfire</strong> which searches a Level 4 or lower Pyro monster which gets you to your Snake-Eye stuff. 1&nbsp;<strong>Original Sinful Spoils - Snake-Eye</strong> which sends another face-up card you control to GY to Special Summon a Level 1 FIRE monster from hand or Deck and you can banish it from GY to target a Snake-Eye or Diabellstarr monste rin GY and place it on the bottom of the Deck and add a Level 1 FIRE monster from Deck to hand. 2 <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which Special Summons a Level 9 monster from hand or targets a Level 9 monster you control and Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from Deck with a different Type and Attribute but with different names. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for <strong>Master of Ham</strong> which can also be your free Summon for Lios. 1&nbsp;<strong>One for One</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Called by the Grave</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Evo-Singularity</strong> which targets an Evoltile and Evolsaur monster in GY and Special Summon an Evolzar Xyz Monster from Extra Deck, attaching the targeted monsters to the Summoned monster. We are not playing&nbsp;<strong>Evo-Diversity</strong> because it is relatively easy to search for Snake-Eye Ash to get you to Megachirella and then Lios. We don't really need Evo-Diversity with all of our currently-present search power.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong> which Special Summons a Flip Monster from Deck face-down on Fusion Summon. Theoretically, you could use this to get Westlo, but at the same time, why would you do that when you can just get Bibliomuse. 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> which searches for a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell if sent to GY. 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>. 1 <strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows </strong>and 1&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Evolzar Lars</strong> which your opponent cannot target with monster effects while it has material. When your opponent activates a card or effect, you can Quick Effect detach 2 materials or 1 if it only has Reptile or Dino monsters as material to target a face-up card your opponent controsl and negate its effects until the end of the turn. This is essentially 2 negates of pretty much anything on field and it also helps to deal with boardbreakers like&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong> and whatnot. 1&nbsp;<strong>Evolzar Laggia</strong> which can detach 2 Xyz Materials to negate the Normal or Special Summon of a monster(s) or the activation of a Spell/Trap Card and destroy it.

I came up with it since I noticed that no one seemed to give my boy Tyrant Dragon much love, so I decided to construct a deck to suit him. A good portion of the strategy hinges on using Metamorphosis on Fusilier Dragon to get King Dragun onto the field in order to start freely summoning dragons to the field. It can also be used to bring out Gatling Dragon if you're having trouble with your opponent's trump card. The other strategy at work is getting Horus to grow all the way up to Lvl 8, which King Dragun can be pretty helpful in making that happen. Once you have both Horus lvl 8 and Tyrant Dragon on the field, you've pretty much won the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a sideboard strategy you can swap out several cards to add in Buster Blader, Lord of D and King of the Swamp as well as Polymerization in order to play Dark Paladin and have him power up off your own dragons. I recommend swapping out Tryrant Dragon, Flame Ruler as well as one of the Cyber-Steins and one of the Fusilier Dragons for the monsters. Then swap one of hte Metamorphosis cards and any spell card of your choosing for Polymerizations.</p>"

The main idea for this is to be backrow negation by sending it to the GY in addition to Solemn Judgement.<br /><br />Sided the Forbidden Chalice and Lance because of the (currently) limited cardpool of the format<br /><br />Main'ed D.D. Crow and Ghost Ogre as both are always live in any match up. I also added an each of them in the side decks because having too much of them in the main deck will brick the already bricky Dark Magician deck.<br /><br />The goal of this deck is to rush out ""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"" because it protects your backrow from being targeted and destroyed by your opponent's card effects. In addiction to it's stat line, it's also treated as ""Dark Magician"" on your field and GY so Dark Magician support cards will be live once it hits the field. Amulet Dragon as back up to banish Spell Cards in both GYs to bump it's attack stat to above 3000 to beat over 3000 beaters like ""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"" and ""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"".&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><p>Dark Magical Circle and Eternal Soul works in tandem since it creates a disruptive combo by making ""Dark Magician"" immune to card effects and banishes an opponent's card whenever a ""Dark Magician"" hits the field. ""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"" will protect both cards and since it's treated as ""Dark Magician"" while in the GY or on the field, you can constantly revive it with ""Eternal Soul"" and banish an opponent's card after.&nbsp;</p>"

And right now...</p><p>It's actually fairly solid. Not meta, not something you should be worrying about dominating the format, but one that can compete surprisingly well as an anti-meta strategy. Purrely, for instance, I don't think actually has an out to Alba Zoa once he hits the field. Without any further ado, let's get into the card by card.</p><h2 id=""mcetoc_1hgtq9oeb3"">Dogmatika Engine</h2><ul><li>3x Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous. Being our archetypal Stratos, she's obviously a three of. She can even special herself for free if there is an ED monster on the field (which includes your own, for strategies involving cards like Iblee or the upcoming Ken and Gen package you can use Almiraj to link said monsters away as your normal then special Ecclesia using her own effect).</li><li>2x Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted. While opening her without Ecclesia or a way to get into another Dogmatika monster is an effective brick as she does little on her own, being a quick effect monster negate is very useful. Use this to shut down Epurrely Plump or Mathmech Alembertian while your opponent is trying to set up on Turn 2, or to help crack open a board and then hopefully OTK on later turns.</li><li>1x Dogmatika Maximus. SS him by banishing an ED monster from your Graveyard, then you can dump 2 monsters from your Extra Deck each turn and then force your opponent to dump 2 from their ED (of their choice, tragically). Only 1 copy because he can be a brick on his own and typically just bolsters good hands.</li><li>1x White Relic of the Dogmatika. She's our OTK tool, being able to add the attack points of any monster on the field to any other monster on the field. Since we have a huge 4K beater in this deck, usually you'll be targeting that monster to add to Relic. Also needed for Pre-Preparations of Rites to search anything. All Ritual Monsters are run at 1 in this build, as we'd typically rather search them with Ecclesia/Nadir Servant/Pre-Prep/Dogmatikamatrix and they're useless in hand if you didn't open Dogmatikalamity.</li><li>1x White Knight of the Dogmatika. One of the Ritual monsters you want to end on turn 1. After a card or effect has been activated by your opponent, White Knight will allow you to dump 1 ED monster each from both players' Extra Decks. This allows you to double disrupt, both through the potent effects of your own ED monsters when they're sent to the grave and by removing a key tool from your opponent's extra. It will also gain attack equal to half the attack of both monsters sent by its effect, but this rarely every ends up relevant (I summon it in Defense anyway on turn 1 for safety and by turn 3 we're usually gearing up for OTK with Relic and Alba Zoa).</li><li>1x Dogmatika Alba Zoa. The big boy, the boss monster of this archetype, the other thing you would want to end on going first, and the beast that ties this strategy together. Unaffected by the activated effects of Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link monsters (which applies to all Dogmatika monsters on the field, not just Alba Zoa), Alba Zoa is sometimes impossible to stop via a lot of decks engine, especially with being a 4K beatstick. On top of that, you can force your opponent to either mill half their Extra Deck each turn or bounce all of the Fusion/Synchro/Xyz/Link monsters back to the ED. On turn 1, this gives you valuable knowledge of what your opponent is playing, and on later turns makes the grind game more and more difficult as the turns pass by.</li><li>3x Nadir Servant. The archetypal search spell that doesn't share the archetype's name, a surprisingly common trope in Yugioh cards. Dump an ED monster, add a Dogmatika with equal or less Attack to the monster you sent. On turn 1, this typically means sending Garura, Wings of Resonant Life to draw 1 while searching out Ecclesia.</li><li>3x Dogmatikalamity. The primary Ritual spell, allowing you to use a monster from the Extra Deck as material. Generally we use this turn 1, so we really would prefer to open it to summon our Rituals with.</li><li>2x Dogmatikamacabre. The secondary Ritual spell, allowing you to banish Fusion/Synchro monsters from grave as material. More of a later turns card, since it often relies on us having a Fusion/Synchro in grave if you don't want to minus like crazy. I run two so Pre-Prep doesn't go offline if I open one, but count is flexible depending on player preference.</li><li>3x Dogmatikamatrix. Our searcher for all Dogmatika Rituals, and if your opponent controls a monster you can then add any Dogmatika card to your hand. And, on top of that, if you control a Dogmatika Ritual you can dump a monster from either player's ED. Always run at 3, it's just a crazy solid card.</li><li>3x Dogmatika Punishment. I feel this one is self-explanatory, it's the most famous Dogmatika card for its use in all sorts of decks, and it's excellent in its home deck.</li></ul><h2>Non-engine</h2><p>From here, everything is non-engine that is flexible. One can shift this around, switch in or out cards as you see fit depending on the meta. This is what I'm running right now, but whether that's the ideal choice is for you to determine.</p><ul><li>3x Ash Blossom, 3x Maxx 'C', 2x Called by the Grave. The Master Duel standard, a pretty much expected package of cards we will almost always use. Even if Maxx 'C' wasn't legal, I'd still advise running Ash because it can hamper almost any deck in the game (and you have to cast your net wide in Master Duel, since you have no sidedeck in this format to prepare). And CBTG hits (almost) all handtraps, including blowouts like Dimension Shifter and Droll &amp; Lock Bird.</li><li>2x Kashtira Fenrir. Free Special Summon, searches another copy of itself, big body, targeting face-down banish of any face-up card. Both shores up endboards going first and helps crack boards going second. Very few cards can boast to be this versatile, and we of course are going to take advantage of it.</li><li>2x Pre-Preparation of Rites. One of the best Ritual search spells in the game, allowing us to add a Ritual Spell and a Ritual Monster mentioned in the Spell's text. This means we can add Dogmatikamacabre and either White Knight or White Relic.</li><li>1x Triple Tactics Talent. Highly versatile card, excellent if you get interrupted by an Ash. Also good going second, either to get into more cards to extend plays or to steal a monster to make it easier to come back.</li><li>2x Triple Tactics Thrust. Allows you to search any normal Spell/Trap if your opponent has activated a monster effect this turn (setting it if your opponent controls no monsters, and adding it to your hand if your opponent does control a monster). This includes Nadir Servant, Dogmatika Punishment, Triple Tactics Talent, Infinite Impermanence, and Evenly Matched in this specific decklist.</li><li>1x Infinite Impermanence. Generally solid card going first or second, I personally prefer this over Effect Veiler but YMMV on that front.</li><li>1x Evenly Matched. Board-breaker of choice, forcing your opponent to banish cards face-down so that they control an equal number of cards as you do (so 1 card, since Evenly will be on the field if your opponent didn't blow it up).</li></ul><h2>Extra Deck</h2><p>Many of these cards are to be sent to GY using Dogmatika Punishment, or through our other plethora of methods of dumping monsters from Extra Deck to GY. Ratios and the exact specific cards chosen are fluid, dependent on the current meta and player preference. This is what I am currently running.</p><ul><li>1x Elder Entity N'Tss. The most well-known Dogmatika Punishment target, allowing you to destroy a card on field when it's sent to the GY.</li><li>1x Garura, Wings of Resonant Life. Draw 1 when sent to the GY, usually sent with Nadir Servant.</li><li>1x Fossil Machine Skull Wagon. You can banish this from your GY to destroy a Spell/Trap on the field. This effect can be done during your turn whenever you want (well, during open game state since it's not a Quick Effect), so you can dump this card whenever and then destroy a Spell/Trap when needed.</li><li>1x Fossil Warrior Skull Knight. You can banish this from your GY to destroy a monster on the field. Like Skull Wagon, this card can be used at your leisure, not when the card is sent.</li><li>1x Granguignol the Dusk Dragon. It's theoretically summonable if you have Cartesia, but I found Cartesia to be bricky and not accomplish much. Instead, this is our Level 8 to summon White Knight of Dogmatika using Dogmatikalamity, and can banish itself from the GY to summon Lulawalilith from your Extra Deck.</li><li>1x Five-Headed Dragon. Literally just a big body for Dogmatika Punishment (biggest monster in the game, so it can be used with Punishment to destroy anything that hasn't boosted its attack) and as a Level 12 to summon Alba Zoa.</li><li>3x Herald of the Arc Light. Send this to the GY to search a Ritual Monster/Spell. Not a once per turn, by the way.</li><li>2x Golden Cloud Beast - Malong. Newly added with Beginning of the Next Journey, this card bounces a face-up card on field to the hand when sent to the GY, making it a really solid card to dump when you need something gone without destroying it.</li><li>1x Despian Luluwalilith. A Level 12 to send for Alba Zoa with a useful effect, and a target for Granguignol. The GY effect of Luluwalilith allows you to summon Ecclesia from your deck, and then Ecclesia can search whatever card you want (probably Fleurdelis).</li><li>1x Mereologic Aggregator. Negates a card on field when sent to the GY.</li><li>2x Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom. She lets you draw 1 then place one card from your hand to the bottom of your deck. She's mostly here as the last thing to run since I had her. Ideally, in her place should be an extra copy of both N'tss and Garura.</li></ul><h2>General Play Tips</h2><ul><li>Turn 1 (going first): The goal is to set up at least one of White Knight or Alba Zoa (which one is better is dependent on the deck you're up against and player preference, I typically favor Alba Zoa myself but use your own judgment), preferably backed up by Punishment and/or Fleurdelis (and any other tools you have on hand like Imperm or Ash). If you can't get into those, try to pivot to pre-Alba Zoa strategies using Fleurdelis and Punishment to buy time and force your opponent into a grind. This doesn't always work, Mathmech OTKs just by breathing for instance, but it's your best shot to lasting the turn.</li><li>Turn 2 (going second): Once it hits your turn, get into Alba Zoa ASAP if your opponent is reliant on an ED monster. Purrely can only stop you if they bounce Dogmatikamatrix (or negate your Ecclesia search), for instance. Mathmech is a problem, thanks to Desavewurm's Spell/Trap negate and the sheer amount of interactions they vomit out in general, but once you can get over the initial hurdle the grind is a fair bit more managable since they'll have burned half their Extra Deck on turn 1 plays.</li><li>Turn 3 (going first): Once it hits the third turn, it's time to start prepping for OTK. White Relic plus Alba Zoa is 8500 damage, but we can generally get into lethal without too much difficulty across the Dogmatika engine. Even if you don't kill, you should have dump most of your opponent's ED across the last few turns.</li><li>VS Purrely: Get into Alba Zoa ASAP. Purrely itself cannot out it at present (relying on Kaijus and Fenrir to out it). From there, start milling their ED away, eventually forcing them to bounce Expurrely Noir back to the ED if it had made it onto the field. I suggest getting rid of ZEUS then the Expurrely Noirs from their ED first, as those two cards are the most consequential.</li><li>VS Dragon Link and Mathmech: As they are both similar decks, I'll group them together. These can be troublesome, but not impossible. Bystial Druiswurm/Branded Beast (for D Link) and Accesscode/Terahertz (for Mathmech) are the primary outs to Alba Zoa, so try to watch out for them and do what you can to stop them. Otherwise, milling half their ED can severely hamper plays (especially if you get into targetted mills via White Knight and Dogmatikamatrix, which will let you remove Borrelend, Chaos Ruler, Transcode Talker, Accesscode Talker, Alembertian, or Darkfluid).</li><li>VS Kashtira: By far our worst match-up, Fenrir alone hard-counters Alba Zoa by not being a Fusion/Synchro/Xyz/Link and being able to easily remove it. If you're going second against Kashtira and they get into Ariseheart, it's probably game over if you don't have a way to turn him off. All of our ED monsters need to be sent to the Graveyard, not banished, so we are completely cut off from half our tools straight off the bat.</li><li>VS Vanquish Soul: Another difficult match-up, but not quite as infuriating going second. Their Extra Deck is relatively unimportant and most of their tools are via main deck monsters and Spell/Traps, which we obviously have difficulty with. And, on top of that, destruction protection is incredibly common among their cards, so Punishment often doesn't work. But, despite all that, we can still grind things down across multiple turns with smart use of our tools and careful play. It's not easy, you will often just have to hope that your opponent drew poorly, but it's not quite as much of a blowout as Kashtira is.</li><li>VS Branded: Well, you probably found out your opponent is playing Branded by activating Alba Zoa's effect. In which case, you've probably been taken to a losing position, and will probably die next turn. GG go next. If you haven't, be wary that Mirrorjade's effect to blow up all monsters is not an activated effect by game mechanics, and can thus destroy Alba Zoa. Focus on using your non-mill control tools, and you can hopefully clinch out a win.</li></ul>"

Depending on the cards in-hand and whatever interruptions your opponent has, your resulting endboard from this combo vary in power, depending on how much you bricked and how many times you've been interrupted.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This deck can also sustain being hit by several handtraps and keep on comboing, since it offers many extenders and different lines of play.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Going second, this deck naturally breaks boards with Primitive Planet Reichphobia, Astraloud, Baronne and Chaos Angel removing cards. However, as it combos, the strategy is vulnerable to interruption, preferring to go first. The good news is that the Mannadium ""ball"" combo pieces float (not once per turn btw) when they are destroyed, so you can keep on going if your opponent opts to destroy them.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""ContentPasted10"">Mannadium can easily churn out over 9000ATK on board with at least 4 removals requiring minimal investment. When you've baited out all their interruptions going for the regular combo, you can pivot your strategy for the Astraloud + Accesscode OTK. First Link two monsters for Cross-Sheep on board. Contact fuse Visas Starfrost + Visas Clone in GY for Astraloud (1 pop) to a zone Cross-Sheep is pointing to so you can summon another monster from the GY. Link Cross-Sheep + another monster for Knightmare Unicorn (1 spin). Link Knightmare Unicorn + monster for Accesscode Talker (2 pops). And there we have it, 4 removals and over 9000ATK on board for OTK!</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div><div><div style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">GENERAL TIPS</span></strong></div><div><div class=""elementToProof""><ul data-editing-info=""{""><li><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">As you combo, be aware of the zones you're summoning in, or else you may stop your combo in it's tracks! For Light-Heart, keep the monster zone below it empty, so you can summon Reichheart below it. For Cross-Sheep, make sure to leave space for both a synchro and fusion monster to summon underneath it so you can get an ATK boost and a monster reborn.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">High impact handtraps like Dimension Shifter, Droll &amp; Lockbird, Nibiru and most importantly, Maxx ""C"" all stop this deck in it's tracks and severely limit it's play. While it is possible to play through these cards if your starting hand is strong, your board will be weaker. <br /></span></li><li><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">Don't play into Maxx ""C"" unless you know you can end the game right then and there! It's never worth it giving your opponent 20 cards since they'll undoubtably break your board no matter how many negates and interruptions they put up!</span></li><li><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">Is your combo stopped by a pesky floodgate? No problem! One of your combo pieces, Primal Planet Reichphobia, destroys 1 card on the field! All it needs are at least 3 monsters on the field in defense position, which is an easy feat for this deck.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">Vicious Astraloud is an incredible boardbreaker. Try to get Visas + a 1500ATK/2100DEF monster in the GY to contact fuse for this card!</span></li></ul></div></div><div><p class=""MsoNormal""><em><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">Want to see the deck in action?

The playstyle is a straightforward combo with little variance. I find that there is no uniqueness with this deck, since its only used as an engine to turbo out generic boss monsters, (Baronne, Apollousa, Dis Pater, etc.) rather than something in-archetype. Even their iconic level 10 boss synchro, Mannadium Prime-Heart is abandoned in favour of more competitive level 10s! With my complaints being said, I believe the next wave of support will give this deck an actual personality and identity with ""Visas Amritara."" When that buster blade wielding badass is released, Mannadium will be more thematic, rather than merely being a shell to summon generic boss monsters.</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">In honour of the inferior Mannadium Prime-Heart who will never be competitively viable (card designers what are you thinking?!), here is the infamous Mannadium copy-pasta, ran through the ""OwOifier:""</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof ContentPasted6""><em>""Mannadium Pwime-Heawt has a speciaw defensive abiwity thawt stops youw opponent fwom tawgeting iwt with cawd effects.

That's not his only strength. His bounce effect returning face-up spell and trap cards is where he shines. If you bounce at least 2 its a free pop. Couple this with value cards like call of the haunted, Fiendish chain and meta pick cards like imperial iron wall and Prohibition you gain advantage fast.<br /><br />But how do i get Gol'gar? well that's where Alien Ammonite comes in. Like debris dragon, alien ammonite summons a Alien (lvl4 or lower) from grave for free. Which makes him a 1 card Gol'gar.To Search Alien Ammonite from the deck you play One for one, Sangan and even Mystic Tomato to get the sangan. Being creative you can also use call of the haunted or Limit reverse in tandom with foolish burial to get Alien Ammonite to the field or in the and through sangan. With 7 other Alien's this should be enough to get Gol'gar rolling.<br /><br /></p><p>Being a control deck you can use cards like Level limit area B, gravity bind, Swords of reveiling light, Prohibition and neo-spacian grand mole to be a nuisance and to stall. Till you get your pieces ready to push hard.<br /><br />Why play heavy storm maindeck i play all these backrow i never want to active the card. Well you can use it offensely as well. Being a backrow heavy deck you play 2 Starlight road. This allows me to summon a stardust dragon if I trade in my heavy and starlight road. Also in tandom with Gol'gar i can bounce my high value stall cards, play heavy to clear opponents backrow while gaining A-counters to pop a monster with Gol'gar.&nbsp;</p><p>If all tactics fail to maintane control we have a back-up plan in the form of Evil Dragon Ananta. This does banishes all reptiles from field and grave but gains 600 attack for each. But that's not all, besides being a giant beatstick during the end fase you need to destroy 1 card on the field. This allows you to go for another 2 for 1 play.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's probably not the most fun to play against being a floodgate type of deck. It does gives a lot of top tier decks its run for its money.&nbsp;<br />i highly recommend it to try it out!</p>"

Previously used as an engine, Dogmatika can now stand on it's own two legs and play toe-to-toe vs. meta decks in higher ranks!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Nadir Servant is now at 3 and functions like a similarly extremely busted card - Sky Striker Mobilize Engage, since the card searches then draws one if it sends Garura to the GY!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The strategy also has a surprising amount of synergy with Iblee.

The distribution of Dogmatika cards are fairly standard - except this time the ritual package for the deck is extremely small. Only 2 Dogmatika Alba Zoa, 1 White Relic, 1 Dogmatikalamity and 1 Dogmatikamacabre are used. The rest of the ritual cards are omitted in favour of staples that are required in Masterduel like the ""Maxx C"" package and the ""TTThrust"" package.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">A small cybverse package is played with x3 Iblee and x2 Cynet Mining, enabling the ""Iblee lock"" where your opponent can only special summon Link Monsters. The combo also leaves Extra Deck monsters in the field and GY, enabling the special summon of the Dogmatika monsters. Iblee is also on the opposite side of the field, allowing Dogmatikamatrix an additional search upon activation.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Quem allows Albaz to be played in this deck, since Quem can potentially summon from the GY Albaz during the opponent's turn and Albaz can fuse away your opponent's monsters. Cartesia can also fusion summon during the opponent's turn.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">In addition to Dogmatika's traditional win condition which is milling out the opponent's Extra Deck, the strategy now can easily generate giant beatsticks, lock your opponent out and reliably field boss monsters like Mirrorjade and Alba Zoa. This is best done going first, but is also possible when going second thanks to many handtraps and boardbreakers.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The following is the deck's main combo:&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Nadir Servant + Iblee = <em>Mill most of your opponent's Extra Deck (</em>2-4 left in opponent's Extra), <em>Alba Zoa</em>&nbsp;(4K beatstick and towers), <em>Fleurdelis </em>(monster negate), <em>Swordsoul Iris </em>(variety of effects when opponent special summons), <em>Secure Gardna</em>&nbsp;(battle dmg protection) and <em>+1-2 draw</em>.</span></div><ol style=""list-style-type: decimal;"" start=""1"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_1""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; list-style-type: '1.

Giant hard to kill monsters that control the board, coupled with most of the opponent's Extra Deck out of action means that it is a functional FTK vs. most decks of the format! Oh boy, Dogmatika certainly has come a long way!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Of course, Dogmatika has a bit of a harder time going second, but that is helped by the deck that the deck fields many handtraps and several going-second cards (Triple Tactics). This deck also naturally generates easy to summon giant beatsticks like Ecclesia + Fleurdelis and a 4k Alba Zoa so you can beat over your opponent's board. Nadir Servant is also an excellent all-purpose removal spell, since N'Tss can destroy a card and the recently released Malong can return a card to the hand.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></div><ul style=""list-style-type: disc;"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; list-style-type: disc;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">When milling your opponent's deck, you may inadvertently benefit them since their milled Extra Deck monsters may grant them resources.

That's why Cartesia is in the deck, so you can possibly summon Mirrorjade or Granguignol during your opponent's turn. You can also synchro summon using your level 8s + Cartesia/Quem for Luluwalilith to push for game on turn 3.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; list-style-type: disc;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The best cards to side out other than your staples when going-second is the cyberse package of x3 Iblee and x2 Cynet Mining.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; list-style-type: disc;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you make room for Bystial cards, Dogmatika can easily make Chaos Angel with all its effects active.</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; list-style-type: disc;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Summon Dragoon and Granguignol in the Extra Monster Zone.

Most of the time your trying to make dis pater commonly done through a mystical and a LV 4 tuner. From there, you can use your other bodies such as the runicks or monsters summoned through quem/ dis pater to make monsters like baron,omega or seals. If you get maxx C'd you can just play runick/bystial control and quem/cartesia are also good normals under the c. So essentially the entire deck is good under maxx c. There's a lot more the deck can do but it'd be too long to mention every interaction in the deck.</p>"

Annihilator is a Level 9 DARK Fiend monster that was strangely released in Ignition Assault in 2020. This card is absolutely awful. Like this card is in the Speed Duel card pool and it still does nothing. It's effect allows you to target a card you control and a card your opponent controls and destroy them. Then, if you destroyed a face-up Fiend monster(s) by this effect, Annihilator gains ATK equal to half the original ATK of those monsters. When I started experimenting with all the Level 9 monsters in the game in Prediction Princess, I have always looked past Annihilator Archfiend because I just thought of it as like ""a Level 9 you can Summon from Deck off of&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>"" and something that you really couldn't build around. And to be really fair, ""Archfiend"" support is literally godawful while generic Fiend support and cards that do something with Fiends are either lacking or favor being played in their respective archetype when concerning the latter. Then I read&nbsp;<strong>Lucent, Netherlord of Dark World</strong>. ""If this card is discarded to the GY by card effect: Special Summon this card, then, if this card was discarded from your hand or GY by an opponent's effect, you can Special Summon a Fiend monster from Deck to either field."" Like I am not a Dark World player, nor do I really know much of what the Deck can accomplish with their Structure Deck support. But like this effect is crazy, and it even sets up our potential play involving&nbsp;<strong>Archfiend Palabyrinth</strong>. Palabyrinth can target an Archfiend you control and banish another field monster you control to Special Summon an Archfiend from hand, Deck, or GY with the same Level as the targeted monster. Get&nbsp;<strong>Ceruli, Guru of Dark World</strong> to your opponent's field, discard Lucent, Lucent Special Summons itself back from GY and Special Summon Annihilator Archfiend from Deck, Palabyrinth target Annihilator and banish Lucent to Special Summon another Annihilator from anywhere. That's literally 2 level 9's on field to go into&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>. So what do we need for our combo?&nbsp;Full combo is one of the Dark World names that you are playing,&nbsp;<strong>Dark Corridor</strong>, and either&nbsp;access to&nbsp;<strong>Archfiend Palabyrinth</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>. Even though we can get 2 Level 9's onto the field without Monstrosity, Palabyrinth is not too accessible as you may think, so we are playing Monstrosity for access to more Level 9's and Bibliomuse. Is there any real benefit to playing this Deck? Not really. You aren't actually ending on any ""Dark World plays"". Nothing like the Grapha Fusion or some assortment of Rank 8's or&nbsp;<strong>Dark World Punishment</strong> and definitely no handlooping. I'd rather play variants like <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/runick-prediction-princess-ft-back-mutation-385236"">Runick Prediction Princess</a>, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/predaplant-prediction-princess-393025"">Predaplant Prediction Princess</a>, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/gate-guardian-prediction-princess-395960"">Gate Guardian Prediction Princess</a>, or <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/evol-prediction-princess-402031"">Evol Prediction Princess</a> (yes, I think that Evol and GG are up there).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Main Deck monsters: 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on field face-up or face-down and during the End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down. Tarotreith must either be Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned from GY via Tarotrei's End Phase effect. Her Flip Effect allows you to Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from GY if she was Tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand, and while she is face-up on the field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent's effects. 3&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it. 2 copies of&nbsp;<strong>Annihilator Archfiend</strong>. It's effect does not matter that much. We are playing 2 to have one be Summonable from Deck with Lucent while the second copy can also be Summoned from Deck via Palabyrinth. For our Dark World monsters: 3&nbsp;<strong>Reign-Beaux, Overking of Dark World</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Lucent, Netherlord of Dark World</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Ceruli, Guru of Dark World</strong>. We only need at least one copy of any of the Dark World names we are playing alongside <strong>Dark Corridor</strong> for full combo. Reign-Beaux adds a Level 5 or higher Dark World monster from Deck other than itself if its discarded to GY by card effect and if it is discarded there by your opponent's effect, you can Special Summon a Level 4 Dark World monster from Deck or GY to either field. So, if you get Ceruli to your opponent's field and use it to discard Reign-Beaux, you can search for Lucent and Summon another Ceruli to your opponent's field to discard Lucent for Annihilator Archfiend access. Lucent Special Summons itself from GY if it is discareded by card effect and sent there and if it was discarded by your opponent's effect, you can Special Summon a Fiend from Deck. Discard this off of Ceruli and you get itself back and Annihilator Archfiend from Deck. And with Lucent being also on field, you can banish it with Palabyrinth to get another Annihilator Archfiend from Deck. Ceruli Special Summons itself from GY to your opponent's field if it is discarded to GY by card effect. And if it was Special Summoned by a Dark World effect, your opponent discards a card, ""your opponent"" being you if it's Summoned to your opponent's field. This triggers all of your Dark World monsters' effects that require them to be discarded to GY by your opponent's effect. And finally, 1&nbsp;<strong>Archfiend Heiress</strong> which adds an Archfiend card from Deck to hand except itself it is sent to GY by card effect or destroyed by battle. This searches you Palabyrinth.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion&nbsp;</strong>for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Foolish Burial&nbsp;</strong>to either dump a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from Deck or Archfiend Heiress for a search. 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can also banish it from GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess monster from Deck face-down. 1&nbsp;<strong>Called By the Grave</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Dark Corridor</strong> which searches for a Dark World monster and then has you discard a card. This is our way to search for a Dark World and also discard for effect to procc a Dark World monster's effects, preferably Ceruli. If you want another way to discard for effect, you could play&nbsp;<strong>Dark World Archives</strong>, but I like Dark Corridor more. 3&nbsp;<strong>Archfiend Palabyrinth</strong> which gives all of your Fiends 500 ATK and also allows you to target an Archfiend monster you control to banish another Fiend monster you control and Special Summon an Archfiend monster from hand, Deck, or GY with the same Level as the targeted monster. 1&nbsp;<strong>Terraforming</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which either Special Summons a Level 9 from hand or targets a Level 9 you control and Special Summons 2 Level 9's from Deck with a different Type and Attribute than that monster but with different names.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong> which Special Summons a Flip Monster from Deck face-down on Fusion Summon. 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> which searches for a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell from Deck if sent to GY. 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Super Starslayer TY-PHON - Sky Crisis</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Nine-Lives Cat</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>S:P Little Knight</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Gravity Controller</strong>. We aren't really doing any Extra Deck stuff related to Dark World, so we have a pretty generic Extra Deck for our Aggregator line and Rank 9 plays.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 3&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Thrust</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong>, and 3<strong> Infinite Impermanence</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>"

Play with FIVE copies of your most powerful Sky Striker card! <br /><br />Right now, blind second strategies are in a good position to tackle the meta because of the nerfs to Tearlaments - the only deck that does relatively well vs. boardbreakers. The dominant decks right now are Mathmech, Kashtira and Purrely, both decks that fold to boardwipes, Nibiru, and freely trigger Triple Tactics Thrust. Thrust searches the out for each of these decks, and you're free to go off with Sky Striker's unparalelled grindgame and boardbreaking potential!&nbsp; The only difficult matchup right now is Vanquish Soul, where you'll likely be stuck in a good old fashioned game of resources to come out on top. <br /><br />After the gamestate has been simplified, this is where Sky Strikers come in! in addition to having enough main deck space to fit in the mandatory ""Maxx C"" package (9 cards), the strategy can also comfortably fit powerspells like Harpie's Feather Duster, Evenly Matched, Raigeki and Triple Tactics Talent! The Sky Striker engine also has cards that excel at cracking boards like Widow Anchor and Afterburners.&nbsp;<br class=""ContentPasted0"" /><br class=""ContentPasted0"" />The time-tested strategy with blind second Sky Strikers is to destroy most if not all of your opponent's resources that they slap down on the board going first, and then close out the match with Sky Striker's grind game. This is done by setting up multi-role and if you cannot, you prioritize getting Engage! from deck and using it as much as possible especially with it's extra +1 draw.<br /><br />The current meta allows for Evenly Matched and Raigeki to obliterate most duelist's boards this format since they generally spend all their resources building their ""unbreakable"" board only to fall to 1-2 cards. For example, you can bait out your opponent's singular S/T negate (Like Spright Carrot/Baronne) with Afterburners then obliterate everything afterwards with Raigeki!

I want this Deck to have its own identity rather than relying on also using the Evol monsters to get to a Level 9. I want to be making use of&nbsp;<strong>Souleating Oviraptor</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Miscellaneousaurus</strong>, <strong>Animadorned Archosaur</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Double Evolution Pill</strong> in order to make myself a path to get to a Level 9 monster on field. If I just rely on Lios and Megachirella, I'd just be playing Evol Prediction Princess at that point. Even though my Ham Prediction Princess, Predaplant Prediction Princess, and Gold Pride Prediction Princess lists all use&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Ophyrs Scorpio</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</strong>, they are using them to facilitate their own respective plays. Ham Prediction Princess uses them to search&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> and go into Link plays or go into a copy of <strong>Trishula, the Dragon of Icy Imprisonment</strong>. Predaplant Prediction Princess uses them to search for&nbsp;<strong>Ultra Polymerization</strong> and go into&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Ambulomelides&nbsp;</strong>to work your way to&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Triphyoverutum</strong>. Gold Pride Prediction Princess uses them to search for&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion </strong>and to go into <strong>Gold Pride - Chariot Carrie</strong> and work your way to&nbsp;<strong>Gold Pride - Pin Baller</strong>. You could just play Lios and Megachirella in Dino Prediction Princess to have a way to dump Misc, but I'd rather be playing Evol Prediction Princess at that point because those two cards basically make up the core of Evol Prediction Princess if you get what I am trying to say. The Level 9 monster we are looking at today is&nbsp;<strong>Jurrac Titano&nbsp;</strong>who is a Level 9 FIRE Dinosaur monster. We could technically have played&nbsp;<strong>Mighty Dino King Rex</strong> and built the Deck around it, but it being a Level 9 EARTH Dinosaur monster, means that we can't access&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Bibliomuse</strong> off of it via&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which isn't ""technically"" a problem since we've had to deal with that issue before with&nbsp;<strong>Amazoness Pet Liger King</strong> in Amazoness Prediction Princess. But it's different this time because we have a better target that does the job better for us. I'm just saying you could play Mighty Dino King Rex, but I am not recommending it. All we need for full combo is&nbsp;<strong>Souleating Oviraptor</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>, and any non-Dinosaur monster in our hand or a way to put one in GY to banish for the activation of&nbsp;<strong>Double Evolution Pill</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Main Deck monsters: 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on field face-up or face-down and during the End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down. Tarotreith must be either Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei's End Phase effect. Her Flip Effect allows you to Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. If it was worthwhile to play Evoltile Pholis who can Special Summon an Evoltile from hand or GY face-down on Summon in Evoltile Westlo, I would be running 3 Tarotreith instead, but needing to get Pholis on field and have Westlo in hand or GY is just too much of a burden for me to consider it. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from GY if she was tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand, and while she is face-up on field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent's cards and effects. 2 <strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can add a Level 9 monster with a differnet Type and Attribute than it from Deck. 1&nbsp;<strong>Jurrac Titano</strong>. This card cannot be Special Summoned but <strong>Double Evolution Pill</strong> ignores Summoning Conditions which gives you the ability to actually Special Summon it from Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Kashtira Fenrir</strong>. I find this card as a good free Summon who can search a copy of itself for a non-Dino monster in hand for Double Evolution Pill and it also provides some form of interruption in addition to all of that. 3&nbsp;<strong>Souleating Oviraptor</strong> which we are only using for its first effect which allows you to either add a Dinosaur monster from your Deck to your hand or send it from Deck to GY. We are using this to add our 1 copy of&nbsp;<strong>Miscellaneousaurus</strong>. You can Quick Effect send it from hand or GY to make it so that Dinosaur monsters you control are unaffected by y our opponent's activated effects during this Main Phase. It doesn't really come up,&nbsp; but I guess you can argue that it protects your Animadorned Archosaur search. Also, you can banish it and any number of Dinos from GY to Special Summon a Dinosaur from Deck with a Level equal to the number of Dinos you banished, destroying it during the End Phase. You are always just banishing Misc itself to Special Summon Archosaur from Deck. Speaking of, we are playing 2&nbsp;<strong>Animadorned Archosaur</strong> which destroys a Dinosaur monster in your hand or on field other than itself on Normal or Special Summon and adds a Reptile, Sea Serpent, or Winged Beast monster with the same orignal Level as that monster or an Evolution Pill Spell from Deck. We are using it to search for&nbsp;<strong>Double Evolution Pill</strong> to get Jurrac Titano from Deck onto field. We are playing 2 because we aren't actually playing a Dinosaur Deck. We are using Dino cards to get ourselves to a Level 9, so we don't have many ways to actually get Archosaur onto the field and have another Dino on field or in hand to pop with its effect. And because we are getting it off of Misc who can only get it from Deck, we are playing 2 in case we do draw one of them. And finally, 3 <strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong> as both a handtrap and a non-Dino.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Spell/Traps: 1&nbsp;<strong>Foolish Burial</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can banish it from GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. 3&nbsp;<strong>Fossil Dig</strong> which searches for a Level 6 or lower Dinosaur monster from Deck. 2&nbsp;<strong>Double Evolution Pill</strong> which banishes a Dinosaur and a non-Dinosaur monster from hand and/or GY to Special Summon a Level 7 or higher Dinosaur monster from Deck ignoring its Summoning Conditions. We are playing 2 just because we can technically just activate it if we draw it while having the right cards in hand to banish for its activation. It also helps to have a copy already in hand in case your opponent stops Oviraptor or Archosaur. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which either Special Summons a Level 9 from hand or target a Level 9 monster you control and Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from Deck with a different Type and Attribute than it but with different names. 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>, and 2&nbsp;<strong>Ready Fusion</strong> to get you&nbsp;<strong>Pragtical</strong> which can give you another Dinosaur to pop with Archosaur if you hard draw Archosaur without Ovi or you can use it for additional Link Material.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong> which Special Summons a Flip Monster from Deck face-down on Fusion Summon. 1&nbsp;<strong>Pragtical</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> which search for a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell if sent to GY. 1 <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>, 1 <strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong>, 2 <strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>. 1 <strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1 <strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. 1 <strong>S:P Little Knight</strong> and 1 <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>. 1 <strong>Knightmare Phoenix </strong>and 1 <strong>Linkuriboh</strong>. In case you don't have a non-Dino in hand or GY to banish for Double Evolution Pill, you can Link off Archosaur into Linkuriboh and Link Linkuriboh and Oviraptor into Phoenix to put a non-Dino in GY to banish. After that, if you need to get Aggregator off the field, you can just Link Aggregator and Phoenix into Little Knight which does serve as interruption. It isn't as good as Link Summoning it on your opponent's turn with Masquerena, but it is still better than nothing and a pretty good option at that. And finally, 1 <strong>Gravity Controller</strong>. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 2&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>, 3 <strong>Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju</strong>, 3 <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>, 1 <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>, 3 <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>, and 3 <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>. &nbsp;</span></p>"

I enjoyed playing it at full power in the TCG with the Ishizu millers and shufflers and the Bystials and I also really liked the Ishizu Tearlament mirror match in Master Duel when it first came there. I even own a Zombie Tearlament Deck irl to scratch my itch to play both Zombie and Tearlament. When I first went over the entire list of Level 9 monsters in the game, I never really considered playing Tearlament with Prediction Princess even if Kaleido-Heart was a Level 9. I figured that the Deck would never work due to the fact that you couldn't really mill cards from the top of your Deck as you would risk milling cards like&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> along with other cards that we would much rather have in our hand or in the Deck. And I thought that Kaleido-Heart was just a meh target for&nbsp;<strong>Summoner of Illusions</strong> in Prediction Princess. Now I know that I was completely wrong. Tearlaments Prediction Princess really does work. It may not be the greatest variant of Prediction Princess, but it apparently does work to a degree, meaning that I can now cross off Kaleido-Heart on the list of Level 9 monsters in the game I need to experiment with.&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart</strong> is a Level 9 DARK Fiend Fusion Monster that requires&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Reinoheart</strong> and 2 Aqua monsters as Fusion Material. This is why I didn't think that Tear Prediction Princess would be able to work. You need a specific monster as Fusion Material along with 2 Aqua monsters where the only 3 Aqua Main Deck Monsters in the archetype are limited to 1 each. But as I looked more into what cards could actually help to facilitate Kaleido-Heart, I remembered&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Perlegia</strong>. If an Aqua Tearlaments monster is sent to your GY via a card effect, you can send a Level 4 or lower Aqua monster from your Deck to your GY, but if you sent a non-Tearlaments monster, you cannot activate cards or effects with the same name as that card for the rest of the turn. So, if you Normal Summon Reinoheart and use its effect to send an Aqua Tear name from Deck to GY while Perlegia is on field, you can send another Aqua monster from Deck to GY, you can Fusion Summon Kaleido-Heart right on the spot using the effect of the sent Tear name. So that all cumulates in your full combo being&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> + <strong>Tearlaments Reinoheart</strong> +&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Perlegia</strong> (or another Aqua monster in hand, field, or GY). Going back to Kaleido-Heart, he actually has a lot more uses than just being a Level 9 on field for Monstrosity. If he is Special Summoned or if an Aqua monster is sent to your GY by card effect while he's on field, you can target and shuffle a card your opponent controls into the Deck, and if he is sent to the GY by card effect, you can Special Summon him back and send a Tear card from Deck to GY. Since we are going to be using him to Xyz Summon&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>, it's important to note that Aggregator detaches for effect. So when you are reattaching the&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> you sent to GY when you Xyz Summoned it, you detach and send Kaleido-Heart to GY by card effect which then triggers his effect to bring himself back and dump a Tear card. From here, you have a couple of options. You can dump&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Sulliek</strong> for a search of a Tearlaments monster or you can send&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Scream</strong> to add a copy of&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Cryme</strong> from your Deck to your hand to have access to a Spell/Trap card or monster effect activation negate for your opponent's turn or you can add a copy of Sulliek to have a targeted monster effect negate which also sends a monster you control to GY which can trigger Kaleido-Heart to bring himself back and spin a card your opponent controls. Now, if you want another option in what you could do, you can send whatever to get whatever, but then, you can use Kaleido-Heart and the copy of Bibliomuse that you brought back from GY via its own effect and flipped up with Tarotrei in order to Xyz into <strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> for interruption.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Main Deck monsters: 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on field face-up or face-down and during the End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down. Tarotreith must be either Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei's End Phase effect. Her Flip Effect allows you to Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. If it was worthwhile to play Evoltile Pholis who can Special Summon an Evoltile from hand or GY face-down on Summon in Evoltile Westlo, I would be running 3 Tarotreith instead, but needing to get Pholis on field and have Westlo in hand or GY is just too much of a burden for me to consider it. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from GY if she was tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand, and while she is face-up on field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent's cards and effects. 2 <strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can add a Level 9 monster with a differnet Type and Attribute than it from Deck. 1&nbsp;<strong>Summoner of Illusions&nbsp;</strong>which is a Flip Monster you can get from Deck with Tarotreith. It has a mandatory Flip Effect to tribute 1 other monster you control to Special Summon a Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, destroying it during the End Phase. Our options in this Deck are&nbsp;<strong>Naturia Exterio</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Rulkallos</strong> (to be on-theme),&nbsp;<strong>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Dragostapelia</strong>. Note that it Tributing 1 other monster is not done for cost. It is done as a part of the effect which means that you could technically trigger Kaleido-Heart by tributing it and sending it to GY as he will be Tributed and sent there by a card effect. For the Tearlament monsters: 3&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Reinoheart&nbsp;</strong>and 1 each of the limited&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Scheiren</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Havnis</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments</strong><strong> Merrli</strong>. Reinoheart sends a Tearlaments monster other than himself from Deck to GY on Normal or Special Summon, and if he is sent to GY by card effect, you can Special Summon him back and send a Tearlaments card from hand or GY, banishing him when he leaves the field. For the other Tear names, we are not using their own respective effects because it really does not apply in this Deck. We just need their effect which allows you to Fusion Summon a Fusion Monster by placing the materials, including itself, from hand, field, and/or GY on the bottom of your Deck if they are sent to the GY by card effect.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can also banish it from GY during the Standby Phase in order to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess monster from Deck face-down. 1&nbsp;<strong>Terraforming</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Perlegia</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Primeval Planet Perlereino</strong>. Both give your Tearlament monsters and Fusion Monsters 500 ATK. Perlegia, if an Aqua Tear monster is sent to your GY by card effect except during the Damage Step, you can send a Level 4 or lower Aqua monster from Deck to GY, but you cannot activate cards or effects with the same name for the rest of the turn if you sent a non-Tearlaments monster. Perlereino adds a Tearlaments monster or&nbsp;<strong>Visas Starfrost&nbsp;</strong>on activation and if a Tear monster(s) is returned from field or GY to the Deck or Extra Deck, ou can target and pop a card on field. We need Perlegia for our combo while Perlereino is just a search, and because of that, we don't need to really max out on Perlereino. 2&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Scream</strong> which we are only using for its GY effect which adds a Tearlaments Trap from your Deck to your hand if it is sent to GY by a card effect. 2&nbsp;<strong>Foolish Burial Goods&nbsp;</strong>and 1&nbsp;<strong>Foolish Burial</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which can either Special Summon a Level 9 from hand or target a Level 9 you control and Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from your Deck with a different Type and Attribute but with different names. 1&nbsp;<strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Sulliek</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Cryme</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Naturia Exterio</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Rulkallos</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Dragostapelia</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> for a Ritual Search. 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>S:P Little Knight</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Gravity Controller</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 3&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Kurikara Divincarnate</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Lightning Storm</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong>, 3 <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>, and 3 <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>. &nbsp;</span></p>"

I understand that Kozmo has a gameplan where you are focusing on using your pilots to bring out your ships to gain advantage and reduce your opponent's available resources through your various interactions and interruptions. But that doesn't mix well with Prediction Princess, especially after their support. Prediction Princess focuses on getting to <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong> in order to set up and build a board of Prediction Princess Ritual Monsters and Flip Monsters over the course of your turn and the start of your opponent's turn with your Flip Monsters either interrupting/stopping your opponent's plays while also netting you card advantage through searches with&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. With the completely opposite-facing ways to faciliate the set-up for both halves of the Deck it's a miracle that I even came up with a way to play Kozmo Prediction Princess. The Level 9 monster we are looking at today is <strong>Kozmo Dark Eclipser</strong> which is a Level 9 DARK Machine monster. Don't get your hopes up because we are literally incapable of ending on any Kozmo-related plays in our endboard because we just cannot fit the necessary cards to accomplish that in our Deck. We are just using Dark Eclipser and the Kozmo cards we are playing to put a Level 9 on board for&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>. I mean, the Deck is fine. It's not great, but it is really funny because we are actually using <strong>Crossout Designator</strong> as a combo piece in situations where we have access to it. You see,&nbsp;<strong>Kozmo Strawman</strong> can pay 500 Life Points to target a banished Kozmo monster and Special Summon it with its effect negated, destroying it during the End Phase. So, if we draw a way to get to Strawman, Crossout Designator, and&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>, we can Crossout calling Dark Eclipser and banish a copy of it from the Deck, Normal Summon Strawman and pay 500 to bring back the banished Dark Eclipser, and activate Monstrosity targeting Dark Eclipser to get Bibliomuse and&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> from Deck, giving you Rank 9 access for&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> and Bibliomuse to faciliate your Prediction Princess plays. Again, the Deck is alright. It at least functions and you have a decent chance of opening full combo, whether it is purely just Prediction Princess plays or the Kozmo line to Dark Eclipser and then to your Prediction Princess.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the monsters: 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on the field face-up or face-down, and during the End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down. Tarotreith must be either Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei's End Phase effect. Her Flip Effect allows you to Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from your GY if she was tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect can add a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand, and while she is face-up on the field, she gives your Ritual Monsters targeting and destruction protection from your opponent's effects. 2&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it. 1&nbsp;<strong>Trias Hierarchia</strong> to be sent off of the Diviners we are playing and it can Special Summon itself from hand or GY by tributing a Fairy monster. This basically can give you Rank 9 access, given you draw Diviner and Monstrosity as you can get Deus-X and Dark Eclipser off of Monstrosity targeting it on field. Speaking of, 2&nbsp;<strong>Kozmo Dark Eclipser</strong>. This card cannot be targeted by your opponent's card effects and non-opt, during either player's turn, when a Trap Card is activated, you can banish a Kozmo from GY to negate the activation and destroy that card. And if it is destroyed by battle or card effect and sent to GY, you can banish it to add a Level 8 or lower Kozmo monster from Deck. This card is neat in Kozmo Decks, but we are just playing it as a Level 9. We are playing 2 because&nbsp;<strong>Crossout Designator</strong> only banishes from Deck and since it doesn't hurt if we draw 1 of them because Strawman, like all the Kozmo pilots, can banish themselves to Special Summon a ship from hand. 1&nbsp;<strong>Kozmo Farmgirl</strong> which can banish itself during either player's turn to Special Summon a Level 4 or higher Kozmo monster from hand and if it inflicts battle damage to your opponent, you can pay 500 to search for a Kozmo card. I mean we are just playing Farmgirl as another pilot. I just felt like the Deck needed another pilot to potentially draw into, so Farmgirl is keeping Strawman company. And we are never using that second effect because it's gonna be pretty hard to inflict battle damage with 1500 ATK, and it's not like you can enter battle during turn 1 either way. 3&nbsp;<strong>Kozmo Strawman</strong> who has the same first effect as Farmgirl, just Special Summoning Level 3 or higher Kozmo monsters from hand instead. And you can pay 500 Life Points once per turn to target and Special Summon a banished Kozmo monster with its effects negated, destroying it during the End Phase. 3&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald</strong> which sends a Fairy monster from Deck or Extra Deck to GY on Normal or Special Summon to increase its Level by the Level of the sent monster which you are using to send either&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> from Extra Deck or&nbsp;<strong>Trias Hierarchia</strong> from Deck. And finally, 2&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong> as potential handtraps, but mainly to add more use to our Crossouts.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Spell/Traps: 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Emergency Teleport</strong> which gets us any of our Kozmo pilots from Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Crossout Designator&nbsp;</strong>which allows you to declare a card name and banish that declared card from your Main Deck to negate its effects and the activated effect and effects on field of cards with the same original name. Usually, you are using this against handtraps, but we are using it to banish Dark Eclipser, and not being able to activate its effects doesn't matter at all as we are never using them either way. 3 <strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can banish it from GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which can either Special Summon a Level 9 from hand or target a Level 9 you control to Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from Deck with a different Type and Attribute than that monster, but with different names. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>. We are not playing&nbsp;<strong>Gold Sarcophagus </strong>because it's only at 1, meaning that we have a large chance of not drawing it, and while it does also banish a monster from Deck, leaving a potential Crossout in hand to deal with a potential handtrap, I just find it not very good as Crossout. Crossout can banish a card from Deck and can protect you, both being in different applications and situations of course, but drawing Gold Sarc when you have full Prediction Princess combo without the use of your Kozmo cards, leaves it sitting there all stupid. Crossout just feels better to play and has more usage overall, especially when you don't have access to the Kozmo part of your Deck.

Finally, 1 ROTA gets any warrior monster.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Age of Overlord also brings the SINFUL SPOILS engine to Infernoble, allowing for another layer of consistency. The Sinful Spoils package is primarily used for WANTED: Seeker to search for Diabellstar, so she can set Original Sinful Spoils - Snake-Eye from deck. Snake-Eye summons from deck a level 1 Fire monster, that being either Infernoble Knight Renaud or Fire Flint Lady. All of this does not use up your valuable normal summon allowing for an easier way to get to Isolde! Finally, WANTED: Seeker recycles Original Sinful Spoils for a 1 card draw.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">There are 6 EQUIP spells in this deck, and they are mostly garnets to be sent to the GY via Isolde. During the End Phase, these equips (usually Angelic Ring) is equipped to Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles. You may not want to draw into these garnets, but Infernoble Arms - Durendal is fine to draw into (hence it's a 2-of) since it searches for a level 5 or lower Fire Warrior from deck.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Finally, there are 12 STAPLE slots in this deck.

It generally ends on 2-3 spell/trap negates, 1 quick effect pop, and 1 monster negate/destroy. If there are extenders, the board can also have Baronne, S:P Little Knight and Apollousa.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are multiple pathways to respectable Infernoble boards that all vary in power depending on how many times you've been interrupted and whatever cards you have in your hand. However, they all centre around resolving both of Isolde's effects. If Isolde is interrupted, the backup plan is to summon S:P Little Knight.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif;

font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Being a combo deck, Infernoble functions like Mannadium, Dragonlink and Cyberse Mathmech. They can all create scary boards, but kind of suck going 2nd. The 12 handtraps coupled with the amount of gas Infernoble has theoretically should enable this deck to simplify the gamestate, play through interruption and full combo, but if you know for sure you can't make it through what your opponent has, just go to next game. It's better that you take the loss and not give your opponent any information so they don't side the right cards against this strategy.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">The backup for this strategy if you can't resolve Isolde is S:P Little Knight! You can even link away S:P Little Knight to make Isolde the following turn when it's safer to do so. That's why there are two S:Ps in the Extra Deck (ouch that's expensive for IRL decks lol).&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">You can make Baronne before Isolde with Diabellestarr + Ash Blossom. Baronne can also be made with Infernoble Knight Charles + a level 1 tuner like Ricardetto or Renaud.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Noble Arms Musuem is a soft once per turn. Multiple Museums means you can summon up to two Emperor Charles the Great! Be sure to not link off Isolde for S:P until you have both Charles on field, since you need Isolde's link zones to summon two of them.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">If you have a garnet you wanted to search in your opening hand, try to get the card in the GY somehow (either by using it, discarding it for Neo Aqua Dolphin or Different Dimension Reincarnation's effect). Then you get Infernoble Knight Maugis in the GY to shuffle it back so you can properly search the garnet later in your combo.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">In games 2 and 3, side in Called By the Grave with Crossout Designator since your opponent is also siding in handtraps (like the fearsome Droll) to hardcounter your strategy.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

And he really does live up to his ""The Great"" title, since this boss monster (coupled with his bestie S:P Little Knight) is enough to boost this strategy to meta relevance once again! </span><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400;"">The consistency that the Diabellestarr engine and the new Infernoble cards of Museum and Angelica really push the deck to the next level of power since it allows so much staple cards to be used with the deck like the 12 handtraps.

Look, I know that we are focusing on trying to Summon Overdragon in this Deck, so a Cyber Dragon Prediction Princess Deck is a possibility. However, it would never come into fruition. There are 2 reasons for this. First of all, all of the good Cyber Dragon cards and Cyber Spell/Traps Machine-lock you. This is a bit of a stretch but cards like&nbsp;<strong>Cybernetic Horizon</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Cyber Dragon Nachster</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Cyber Dragon Herz</strong> all have good effects for either Cyber Dragon plays or are able to really turbo your way to Overdragon, but they Machine-lock you. I'm not saying that they are particularly good (in the case of Cybernetic Horizon in the bricks you need to play) or what you would theoretically play in a Cyber Dragon Prediction Princess Deck, but I would've liked to experiment with it as a Deck at the very least, either having like a&nbsp;<strong>Cyber Dragon Infinity</strong> (or idk&nbsp;<strong>Cybernetic Overflow</strong>?) as a part of my endboard or having the ability to go into a&nbsp;<strong>Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</strong> on my following turn for a Quick OTK. Second, have you read what Overdragon does? It sends your entire board other than itself to the GY on Fusion Summon. Even if you were able to make some assemblance of a Cyber Dragon board before going into your Prediction Princess plays, Overdragon just throws it all into the GY when its Summoned as a mandatory effect. And so I have ended up with this Deck that intends on turboing out Overdragon for a Level 9 on field for&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>, and to be fair, it's probably better than what Cyber Dragon Prediction Princess would've been. We are utilizing&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Darlingtonia</strong><strong> Cobra</strong> to search for the current OCG-exclusive <strong>Over Future Fusion</strong>. I mean if this card doesn't scream ""Make Chimeratech Overdragon"", I don't know what does (probably Cybernetic Horizon actually). It reads that you can activate each of its effects once per turn. You can reveal a Fusion Monster in your Extra Deck and send a named Fusion Material monster from your Deck to GY, but you cannot Special Summon monsters with that name nor activate their monster effects this turn. And you can also Fusion Summon a DARK Machine Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck by banishing materials from your GY. This means that we can make Overdragon and go through our whole Prediction Princess line through a 2.5 card combo of <strong>Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>, and a monster to discard for Scorpio. Normal Summon Scorpio and discard a monster to Special Summon Cobra from Deck. Cobra searches for Over Future Fusion. Activate Over Future Fusion and use its first effect to dump Cyber Dragon from Deck. Link off Cobra and Scorpio into&nbsp;<strong>Sky Striker Ace - Camellia</strong> which is a generic Link-2 Machine monster. Then we Link off Camellia for any Sky Striker Link-1, I am playing&nbsp;<strong>Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</strong>. This gets Camellia into GY, giving you Cydra and a Machine in GY, so now you can activate Over Future Fusion's second effect to banish Cydra and Camellia to Fusion Summon Overdragon. Overdragon sends the rest of your field to the GY, and now you activate Monstrosity targeting Overdragon for&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> and you should know the rest. I mean, the Deck is cool, but I'd much rather be playing a more interesting Prediction Princess variant that actually has the ability to produce more of a unique endboard.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">For the monsters: 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on the field face-up or face-down, and during the End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down. Tarotreith must be either Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei's End Phase effect. Her Flip Effect allows you to Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from your GY if she was tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect can add a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand, and while she is face-up on the field, she gives your Ritual Monsters targeting and destruction protection from your opponent's effects. 2 <strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it. 1&nbsp;<strong>Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light</strong> which can be Summoned off of the Lonefire Blossoms we are playing for a Level 9 and on Normal or Special Summon, it can search a Generaider card or a Plant monster. She also works as a nice&nbsp;<strong>Small World&nbsp;</strong>bridge from Diviner to her to a Predaplant or Lonefire. 2&nbsp;<strong>Cyber Dragon</strong>. You realistically only need 1, but Over Future Fusion only does send from Deck. Even if you draw 1 copy, you can still use it as a Small World bridge from it to Mardel to Diviner or a Predaplant or Lonefire. 3&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</strong> which sends a monster from hand or GY on Normal or Special Summon to Special Summon a Predaplant from Deck. 1&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</strong> which adds a Fusion of Polymerization Spell card from your Deck to your hand once per Duel if it is Special Summoned by the effect of a Predaplant monster. 2&nbsp;<strong>Lonefire Blossom</strong> which can Tribute a Plant to Special Summon a Plant from Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald</strong> which sends a Fairy from Deck or Extra Deck to GY to increase its Level by the Level of the sent monster. It's good for Small World bridging and you can just Normal Summon it to send&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> from Extra Deck for a Ritual search to go through your Ritual plays from there. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">For Spell/Traps: 1 <strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Over Future Fusion</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong>&nbsp;which&nbsp;Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down, and you can also banish it from GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess monster from Deck face-down. 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which Special Summons a Level 9 from hand or targets a Level 9 you control and Special Summons 2 Level 9's from Deck with a different Type and Attribute than that monster, but with different names. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Small World</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Chimeratech Overdragon</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong> which Special Summons a Flip Monster from Deck face-down on Fusion Summon, and 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> which searches a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell from Deck if sent to GY. 2&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>. 1 <strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1 <strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. 1 <strong>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</strong> and 1 <strong>Cross-Sheep</strong> to get more use out of Scorpio and Cobra through searching for&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>S:P Little Knight</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Sky Striker Ace - Camellia</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</strong>. Camellia is just a generic Link-2 Machine that we can easily Link off since all of the Sky Striker Link-1's just need a Sky Striker monster that isn't their Attribute as material. This gets you a Machine into GY for Over Future Fusion to get you Overdragon. I am choosing to play Kagari, and while you can send a Sky Striker Spell from Deck to GY with Camellia and add it back to hand upon Link Summoning Kagari, there is never going to be a moment where we don't have a monster in our Main Monster Zones, meaning that we can't make use of any of the Sky Striker Spells, even if we wanted to. But you could play any Sky Striker Link-1 that you fancy. Finally, 1&nbsp;<strong>Gravity Controller</strong>.</span></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Side Deck: 2&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Thrust</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>"

Discarding cards with Longyuan helps to add fuel for a Branded in White fusion and Swordsoul synchros can be used to bring out Icejade if needed. Branded in High spirit synergizes well with the Swordsoul, as putting one and Icejade can let Taia do its thing. Lastly, Ecclesia is an all-around all star in this strategy, fueling both paths and easily coming back in one's hand</p>"
