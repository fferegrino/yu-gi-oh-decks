When you have a good hand, this deck is capable of bringing out cosmic blazar dragon, in the only condition that you know synchro monsters very well and do know how to use a synchro deck. If cosmic blazar is not possible, always try to bring out crystal wing, clear wing, or shooting star. A few tips: 1. cosmic blazar is impossible to summon if there are no level eaters in the graveyard. 2: Stardust dragon is very weak by itself, so always use it to bring out shooting star. 3: Synchro is history. So don't be surprised if a meta deck beat you easily."

It uses the Draco engine and metalfoes for support to pendulum summon the draco's or fuse them to provide support or small draw power. Metalfoes Mythriel is your ace fusion as it helps you recycle your metalfoes in the deck and uses you the opportunity to return a troublesome monster card back to the hand or extra deck. Other fusions are there for support and different options. A variety of different Xyz to help balance the extra deck and to use in sticky situations.  Ash Blossom can be used to stop the drawing of cards which could bring a problem going into other meta decks that use a lot of draw power. Metalfoes fusion stays at 2 just in case it gets banished and it can recycle itself for a draw so its never a bad choice. This deck has been used against all aspects of non-link meta and has done very well against them all. (Link will be added later on to update deck use)

Sadly, <strong>El Shaddoll Construct</strong> is banned, so this is the best build in order to go around it, <em>in my opinion</em>. With this deck, there are multiple extra tech's that can help you out when things aren't going your way and your monsters are being destroyed quickly.</div></blockquote> The purpose of this deck is primarily to beat down your opponent so you can win with the powerful <em>Shaddoll's</em> and the multitude of <em>Synchro</em>/<em>XYZ</em> Monsters in the extra deck. All these can give you an out to many decks you may face.  The <em>Lightsworn </em>Monsters exist from the old deck in which I ran <strong>El Shaddoll Construct</strong>, but since its ban, I decided to add in<strong> Sephylon, The Ultimate Timelord </strong>to the mix. I know, replacing an Extra Deck Monster with a Main Deck Monster seems dumb, but listen on.  <strong>Sephylon</strong> needs to be special summoned from your hand by having 10 or more monsters in the Graveyard. Now luckily, <em>Shaddoll's</em> have a useful effect when sent to the Graveyard by card effects, so that helps us with him. In addition to that, the <em>Lightsworn's</em> <strong>Raiden</strong> &amp; <strong>Lyla</strong> &amp; the Spell Card <strong>Charge of the Light Brigade</strong> add some more spiciness to this deck because <strong>Raiden</strong> can help to get monsters in the Graveyard AND activate effects of the <em>Shaddoll's</em> if they get discarded this way, and <strong>Lyla</strong> can destroy Spells/Traps that the opponent has either face-down or activated (such as continuous spells/traps or field spells), then she sends more Monsters from the deck to the grave once the turn has ended, hopefully spitting out more <em>Shaddoll's</em>.  When the Lightsworn's send Monsters to the Graveyard, a mix of Light &amp; Dark Monsters may lay there, so, the BLS - EotB and the Chaos Sorcerer are there in order to benefit from these. They both have effects to just straight up destroy other Monsters, and they're tough to get by.  I've added <strong>Rainbow Kuriboh</strong> to stop your Opponent's Monsters from attacking, along with <strong>Vanity's Fiend</strong>, since <strong>Vanity's Emptiness</strong> is banned. These aren't only extra Monsters for<strong> Sephylon</strong>, but also extra Light &amp; Dark's for <strong>BLS</strong> &amp; <strong>Chaos Sorcerer</strong>."

Monsters: <a data-name=""Night Express Knight"">Express Knight</a> &amp; Derricrane are your main combo pieces with Ruffian Railcar helping to support that combo. (also the field spell helps you get to one or the other) We also run a Kaiju engine with Jizukiru being a level 10 Machine that synergizes with the deck nicely. Exodius is cool for recycling &amp; Cyber End Dragon for another level 10(can't forget Maxx C).  Spells: Switchyard is the field spell we need, you can special summon Ruffian off its 1st effect &amp; it changes to a level 10, but you can't deal battle damage to your opponent when you do so. The 2nd effect is what we want, you can pitch a card to the grave &amp; add one of your level 10 trains to your hand. Running 3 Terraforming is essential &amp; scapegoats for links. Now for the on-of list, most are self-explanatory. Raigeki, Kaiju Slumber, Upstart, soul charge, Limiter Removal for otk &amp; Foolish Burial for pitching Ruffian. Also running Skill Drain.  For the extra deck, you mostly go into Super Dora &amp; sometimes Gustav Max for burn. Skypalace is pretty situational. Galaxy Destroyer is hilarious if you get his effect off &amp; for wiping the back row &amp; popping pendulum scales. Number 35 &amp; 84 work great together&amp; we finish off with our Link monsters."

If the facedown is a Change spell, you can also change Absolute Zero into Acid and wipe out your opponents board (It feels good)  Thats just one of many strategies.

The Atlantean's are there for their graveyard effects which can be taken advantaged of by Abyssmegalo and Abyssteus. Simply put them in the graveyard as needed. I wouldn't simply summon Atlantean's unless through an effect. Your main monsters are the Mermail. Deep Sea Dive is for the easy Synchro into Tatsunoko (I would special summon neptabyss for her effect) and then into larger  synchro summons. Ash Blossom and Ghost Ogre is for support to stop opponent. Fishborg Launcher is also good for synchro summon if needed, but synchro isn't the main goal. The main monster is Abyssmegalo. Use Mastar Boy for ATK boost. Solemn Warning never hurts to have and stops big summons when you may have a weak-hand. Take advantage of Salvage and use Abyss spell on Abyssmegalo or Abyssteus(mainly Megalo)."

""<a title=""Shiranui Spectralsword"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Shiranui_Spectralsword"">Shiranui Spectralsword</a>"" is currently the only Tuner of the archetype and allows the player to Special Summon a Zombie-Type Synchro Monster from the Extra Deck, by banishing itself alongside with a non-Tuner Zombie-Type monster, both from the Graveyard. Although this Special Summon is not treated as a Synchro Summon, this effect allows the player to unleash monsters that would normally require specific Synchro Materials, notably ""<a title=""Archfiend Zombie-Skull"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Archfiend_Zombie-Skull"">Archfiend Zombie-Skull</a>"".  There are currently three boss monsters in the Archetype, all of them being Synchro Monsters: ""<a title=""Shiranui Samuraisaga"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Shiranui_Samuraisaga"">Shiranui Samuraisaga</a>"", ""<a title=""Shiranui Shogunsaga"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Shiranui_Shogunsaga"">Shiranui Shogunsaga</a>"" and ""<a title=""Shiranui Sunsaga"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Shiranui_Sunsaga"">Shiranui Sunsaga</a>"". ""Shiranui Samuraisaga"" can recycle one of your banished ""Shiranui"" monsters and then restrain the opponent's aggression; if it ends up being banished, it can weaken one opposing monster's ATK by 500 points. ""Shiranui Shogunsaga"" has higher stats and a more straightforward set of effects: when it is Special Summoned by any means, it can banish one Zombie-Type monster from the Graveyard in order to raise its 3000 base ATK by an amount equal to the banished monster's ATK; this effect is obviously more powerful when its target is a ""Shiranui"" monster, that will have its second effect triggered. When it is destroyed, its owner can return one of their banished Zombies with 0 DEF to the Graveyard. ""Shiranui Sunsaga"" has the highest ATK of the group, at 3500. It's summon effect allows it to recycle any number of Zombie-Type Synchro monsters, banished or in the Graveyard, back into the Extra deck, then destroying cards the opponent controls up to the number of cards recycled by this effect. Its main power comes from its destruction negation, as it can prevent the destruction of any Zombie-type monster (by battle or card effect) by banishing a ""Shiranui"" monster from the graveyard, saving your monsters and activating the banished monstered effect. Each boss monster is two levels higher than the previous boss, allowing the effect of ""Shiranui Spectralsword"" to special summon the next boss monster should the previous one be destroyed.  LETS GO OVER THE 3 GANDORA'S  their main effects banish and destroy cards while offering a atk boost but at a price. it halves your lp. but clears the field. giga is easy to summon (2 tributes from hand or field) while the others need tributes. to prevent bricking from high lvl cards i use montage dragon. heres how i go about this deck.  i use the grass looks greener to throw cards into the gy. youll notice that most of the cards have effects that activate when sent to the gy. this is the decks main defense and summon engine. while i wait for that... ill summon two level 4 monsters with mezuki, fairytail or a shiranuis effect. (fairy-tail and pot of desire will also help power giga-rays when the time comes) and special summon bagooska to give me time. and help set the field while offering effect negates. this is when i set cards like peropero or electroturtle if they are in hand.  after a couple turns of throwing cards into the grave and banish pile. i use spectralsword or anothers effect to special summon the higher lvl shiranui and keep that going to test and clear the field. just gage it from there. once you hit that point its extremly easy to spam the field. phantom chaos is in the deck to futher trigger gigas effect. other than that have fun. hope you guys like the deck!  &nbsp;  this is for the pc (og) version so i follow the banlist. but for mobile players (ygopro) add 2 more copies of the grass looks greener and take out a unizombie and book of life and youre set.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "

That's about it.,"<p><strong>Intro to the cards</strong></p> <p>The usual main attackers are Deskbot 001, Deskbot 004, Deskbot 007, Deskbot 008, and Deskbot 009. The support cards are Deskbot 002, Deskbot 003, Deskbot 005, Deskbot 006, and Deskbot Jet. All of the Deskbots, if they have the proper setup, can deal heavy damage. The four Pendulum Monsters are Deskbot 005, 006, 007, and 008. 007 and 008 are more attack based because their effects are aimed at them getting damage in. 005 and 006 are better for Pendulum Summoning and their effects are aimed at getting more Deskbots onto the field. Deskbot Jet is the Synchro Monster. It has two effects that can be activated, but only once per turn, and once that turn. It also has it's normal effect which boosts its power. The Field Spell, Deskbot Base, is sometimes annoying, sometimes helpful. It can boost all Deskbot monsters on the fields Attack and Defense by 500. This can ruin part of the strategy. It's more useful effects are as follows: Once per turn: You can reveal any number of ""Deskbot"" cards in your hand and shuffle them into the Deck, then draw the same number of cards. You can banish 9 ""Deskbot"" cards with different names from your field and/or Graveyard, except ""Deskbot Base""; shuffle all cards from your opponent's hand, field and Graveyard into the Deck. The more useful out of the useful effects is shuffling and drawing cards. It can help refresh a bad hand. The other effect is situational.</p> <p><strong>How to play them</strong></p> &nbsp;  I'm going to show you a combo I love to use with this deck. The ideal hand is as follows (If you are going first); Machine Duplication, Deskbot 003, Deskbot 005/006, Bottomless Trap Hole/Raigeki/Twin Twisters, and Deskbot 009. Place Deskbot 003, and activate his effect to Special Summon a Monster, but don't use his second effect. Special Summon Deskbot 002, and activate its effect. Add either Deskbot 005/006 to the hand (Depends on which one you got in the starting hand. If you got 005, add 006 and vice versa). Use Machine Duplication on Deskbot 002, Special Summon the two others in your deck, activate their effects. When it asks you what to add to the hand, add Deskbot Base and Deskbot 007/008 to your hand. Put 005 and 006 into the Spell/Trap Card Zones, Special Summon Deskbot 009. Place down the Bottomless Trap Hole/Twin Twisters. Activate Desktop Base, and if you want, exchange some cards. If you have yet to do so, activate Deskbot 003's effect. Use it on Deskbot 009, and once you do, activate 009's effect (Be amazed!). End your turn, and try to keep Deskbot 003 alive. This is just an example of a combo that you can use, but find more yourself.  &nbsp; <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p> &nbsp;  A few major weaknesses this deck has are: Mirror Force (Any kind), Effect Negating Cards, Solemn Cards, getting a bad hand, and misclicks.  &nbsp; <p><strong></strong>Thank you to anyone that looks at this. Enjoy the deck!</p>"

Link Format,"This deck uses Trickstar, but also takes advantage of the Star-Seraph engine. You have two options you can usually do. You can either use the Star Seraph or the Trickstars. For the Trickstars the usually combos <strong>ALWAYS </strong>Candina or Lightstage. Depending on your hand of course, I would get lightstage on the board then search Candina or Lycorissia (depending on your hand) and use Candina to search Lycorissica or Trickstar Reincarnation. From there search out Candina for Lycorissica and activate Reincarnation to get big damage. There's multiple ways to pull this off, but the main goal is to bring out holly angel or decode talker to take out your opponent. Don't force the link summon though you have XYZ and synchro for a reason.  Star Seraph engine explains itself, summon all 3 to get sentry on the field to take out 1 pesky card. The synchros are meant for Lycorissica and Gofu. I would always resort to Beelze as it is easy to summon and hard to get off the field for some unprepared decks. Double summon is meant to help combos, dark hole, and raigeki for protection. The Solemn cards and Ash Blossom will help stop your oppoenent from advancing their board. Overall, more Trickstars is needed for the TCG and until then combining types is the best method."

IT DOES NOT relay on that card. World Chalice takes practice and a great intro into the link-format.  In the general sense you want to summon Link Spider and Imduk for additional summons. Eve the Shrine Maiden is a link card not meant for the extra monster zone. She can protect everything she points to from card effects and she can't be destroy by battle or card effect so she is very handy. I would focus on getting on Borreload or Aurum immediately. Use each spell card wisely and experiment to find out their purpose they can be used multiple ways. The World Legacy and Guarddragon are meant for the graveyard to recycle cards back on the field or to the field. So use them for link summoning. Use Imduk ability in the grave to get World Legacy on the field.  Only 3 traps which help recycle or special summon. Solemn Strike because you can't go wrong with that card. This deck is a good intro into Link summoning in general and if the cards are played right this can take out meta decks."

Since Repairman isn't a hard once per turn, you can keep reviving him or bring out more of them from the deck to abuse his effect to revive an Iron Chain monster from the graveyard.  This deck is extremely consistent as all you need is two level three monsters and a way to send Coil to the graveyard.

The Summoner Monk 'engine' provides a consistency boost in discarding dead spells (including Metalfoes Fusion, a spell that let's you draw 1 by shuffling it from the grave into the deck) to summon Armageddon Knight, which can dump a Farfa for some light removal or an Inzektor piece, or maybe a hopper to facilitate hornet, then make a rank 4 play.

Well, the answer is a simple Trap Card Called ""Corrupted Keys"" Which Allow you To target An XYZ monster you control and summon Three Umbral Tokens (ATK:??,DEF:00) its attack is the attack of your XYZ Monster. They can't attack your opponent directly.  &nbsp;  You can use them to clean your opponent field of Monsters then attack directly with you XYZ Monster. Or you can easily tribute them to summon a high level Monster (Like An Egyptian God monster for example).  &nbsp;  This deck also has A variety of spell cards especially for this archetype.  &nbsp;  So, I was very, very surprised (and Angry) to notice that no one seems to use this amazing Archetype.

The most interesting thing i implemented in the deck is that kaiju and jurrac dino give access to star eater, and tyranno and aeolo does the same thing. kaiju and aeolo could also gain access to Chaofeng, Legend of the Yang Zing which could replace dragon of the ice barrier. Although we have to agree that dragon of the ice barrier is strong but the fact that it needs 3 or more monsters to summon makes it hard bring out on to the field. true kings and aeolo give access to Leo the gate keeper.  For more resistance, drop a few PSY or ash blossoms and ghost orge into the deck, replace the kaijus with them. Yazi yang zing and mare mare could be added into the deck.  The down side of this combo is that mare mare is a water wyrm monster and could not be summoned by Bahrastos (but it helps with the summoning of Bahratos).  true draco phoenix Marriamne and black ptera could also be added into the deck, but i suggest not because it is hard to summon. Although tornado dragon and Castel was added help with it, but again, it works better with Yangzing dino because there is Pulao, wind of the Yang Zing.Although deng long was a body blow to yang zing dino, it is still playable. If you want look at a true king yang zing dino deck, go check out snavar98's deck. Elemental Lord Pyrorex could also be dropped in, but i suggest against it since it could not be summoned by the pill and has a very limited summoning condition. Tyranno infinity could dropped in to cover some attack weaknesses.  the effect of lost world and its uses go find in the article, they do a better job of explaining it.  The above are my suggestions for true king dino arch type, hope you find it helpful.  Changes to the deck: <ol>  	<li>Chaofeng, Legend of the Yang Zing has been added of its easy summon condition and that the fact it grants easier passway to sychro. There is also the fact it could possibly summon mare mare or the other true kings.</li>  	<li>Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing and mare mare has been added. I have realised, after reminders of others, that Yazi itself fits in a more aggro play style, whereas the ancient fairy dragon that have been replaced fits with a combo play style. Whereas ancient fairy dragon could be useful, i believe that Yazi itself is a much more useful monster in terms of its effect and the fact that it could bring mare mare to the board, opening more room for synchro.</li>  	<li>The seven sins has been added as i realised one of the weaknesses of the deck. Sometimes when we have the ultimate conductor and the True King of All Calamities on the board there is simply not enough resistance. Also the two monster have a very similar effect in terms of controlling the opponent's monsters. There are specific situations where Number 77 would prove as much better choice.</li>  	<li>I have come to realise that there is no possible way to summon overtex coatls because the pill does not work on him and the fact that there could be no possible 5 banished dinosaurs. however, Overtex Coatls could be considered being put into the deck along with Soul Release and Tyranno Infinity.</li>  	<li>Soul Charge was added into the deck. Although true king dino has an incredible ability of building up a strong board, its power to build up a new board after the old one was destroyed proved weak. So therefore soul could very much help you in mid or late game.</li>  	<li>One of the two  Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju has been taken away because of adding of mare mare.</li> </ol> Update for V0.3 link format update (as i have recently just studied link format) <ol>  	<li>Crystron Needlefiber is added for new path to synchro, Celestial Double Star Shaman is added for Crystron's effect, as there are probably a few Babycerasauras and Petiteranodon in your hand or graveyard. Number 77 is removed to make room for the link monsters.

You can also use brilliant fusion to allow you to link summon Pahntom Core allowing you to special summon more monsters augmenting Lapis Lazuli's effect. There are many other combos that you can do but I find that it is easier to learn them yourself and maybe even make modifications.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

Their FLIP effects disrupt your opponent, gather or recover cards, and help swarm, and if your opponent decides to negate one, they'll probably do so with a card that also destroys, triggering their powerful effects to swarm further directly from the deck. As you build up resources, you can spend them on their Link Monsters, which turn these innocent insects into powerful attackers with stacking buff effects, and if your opponent does deal with them, you get the resources you spent to make them back.  Some specific techs of note in detail: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Block Spider"">Block Spider</a> can be Special Summoned by the effect of <a data-name=""World Legacy in Shadow"">World Legacy in Shadow</a>, triggering its effect for a cheap Link or an attack lock.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>, besides just being general Link assistance, is usfeul for a specific combo: use one <a data-name=""Sheep Token"">Sheep Token</a> to create <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> in the Extra Monster Zone, then two more tokens for <a data-name=""X-Krawler Synaphysis"">X-Krawler Synaphysis</a> beneath it, then the Spider and your last token for a second Synaphysis next to it. Their effects affect each other, and the Extra Monster Zone is free to put something else with down-facing arrows in there.</li>  	<li>It's worth noting that besides other Krawlers, <a data-name=""Verdant Sanctuary"">Verdant Sanctuary</a> can also search <a data-name=""Maxx"">Maxx ""C""</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Lose 1 Turn"">Lose 1 Turn</a> may seem out of place, but with how slow-paced the deck is, Link Monsters remaining in ATK position, and a lot of action happening on your opponent's turn, it hinders you little enough to be worth using it against a Special Summon heavy opponent.</li> </ul> As Side Decks are largely dependent on what you expect to face, I've opted to use it to illustrate other options instead. Besides extra Krawlers for tweaking ratios to taste, and Book of Eclipse - which can blow out certain match-ups but is near-worthless against Link-heavy decks - it contains some spicy techs. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Karakuri Strategist mdl 248"">Karakuri Strategist mdl 248 ""Nishipachi""</a> is a Level 3 Tuner that can get you to <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> with only 1 Krawler non-Tuner, as well as flipping a face-down Krawler to apply its effect. However, the deck can't afford any more Normal Summons.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Junk Synchron"">Junk Synchron</a> can revive a Krawler to make <a data-name=""Junk Warrior"">Junk Warrior</a>, which can gain ATK from any Krawlers you control. This is nothing more than a meme.</li>  	<li>Speaking of memes, <a data-name=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a> can theoretically be summoned with 3-4 Krawlers and any of the deck's odd-leveled Tuners.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Inzektor Picofarena"">Inzektor Picofarena</a> can help recover resources, as well as an interesting interaction with the Krawlers' floating - it works from the Spell/Trap zone. In addition, you can play actual Inzektors for their effects, and they can be summoned from the deck by tributing a Krawler with <a data-name=""Insect Imitation"">Insect Imitation</a>.</li> </ul>"

If you can play metalfoes this deck will work greatly in your favor. I won't be covering the metalfoes basics since there is enough information on the internet out there. I might make a video in the future on how to make plays with this deck. It will be posted here.  You can learn to play metalfoes by practicing. A good beginner idea is to destroy all your metalfoe cards and end up with a pendulum scale 1 - 8 so you can summon your monsters back. <h4>Why do we run 46 cards as opposed to 40 cards?</h4> This deck has good drawing power. If you are going to utilize your side deck, you can still utilize your main cards without needing to sacrifice good cards you need.  Wind bitches = 6.  Assuming that you get your wind witch combo right ur left with 43 cards in your deck. If you remove wind witches you have 41 cards. Whats wrong with 41 cards :)  &nbsp; <h2>strengths</h2> <ul>  	<li>High piercing damage on defence monsters</li>  	<li>great summoning power</li>  	<li>great recovery</li>  	<li>Great Defence ability.</li>  	<li>ability to steal opponents monsters</li>  	<li>nice field of monsters and facedown cards</li>  	<li>draw power</li>  	<li>awesome side deck</li>  	<li>glorious extra deck if used well</li> </ul> <h2>weaknesses</h2> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""solemn strike"">solemn strike</a> <em>(don't over summon if you think your opponent has it don't summon all your monsters have some just in case)</em></li>  	<li><a data-name=""evenly matched"">evenly matched</a> <em>(wtf is this card)</em></li>  	<li>relies on special summoning</li>  	<li>with endless nightmare you are fucked unless you can do something about it</li>  	<li>you will have issues with untargetable monsters or monsters such as <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> <em>(the solution for this is <a data-name=""number s39"">number s39</a> or you use <a data-name=""metalfoes orichalc"">metalfoes orichalc</a> and <a data-name=""metalfoes mithrilium"">metalfoes mithrilium</a>)</em></li>  	<li>weak if your card are getting banished</li>  	<li>not the best backrow destroyer such as spells and traps<em> (you might place some <a data-name=""twin twisters"">twin twisters</a> in this deck if that is a problem)</em></li> </ul> <h1>Monsters</h1> <h4><a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a></h4> If this card is used right it is one of the best cards. You can shuffle your opponent cards to their hand but also your own cards. kaijus can be brought back to your hand. The best idea with mithrilium is sending one of your own metalfoes monster on the field to your hand so that you have the missing pendulum scale in for summoning pendulums. Shuffle nopes to your opponents hand. Shuffle cards you need back to your own hand.  Also if this card is destroyed you can recover 1 metalfoe normal monster from your graveyard or pendulum zone. Overal great defence. <h4><a data-name=""Metalfoes orichalc"">Metalfoes orichalc</a></h4> If you need to quickly destroy a card on the field, you can destroy with your pendulum zone this card to destroy one card on the field. Also this baby is your main piercing damage amplifier. Also with metalfoes combination you can fusion summon mithrilium with a pendulum monster for orichalc and they will all come back on the field. <h4><a data-name=""Metalfoes alkahest"">Metalfoes alkahest</a></h4> Steal his monster if needed. <h4>Kaijus (tributing their monsters optional)</h4> You have a choice between: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a></li>  	<li class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a></li>  	<li class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Kumongous, the Sticky String Kaiju"">Kumongous, the Sticky String Kaiju</a></li> </ul> Those three are your main to go kaijus for this deck. The reason kaijus work with this deck is that you can bring them back to your hand with <a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a>. Sphere also works but it requires 3 tributes although sphere can be a game changing moment, lava golem will almost certainly guarantee that you remove 2 monsters on the field. Use whatever of those 3 monsters you like. Two kaijus in your deck is more than enough. The usefull thing about <a data-name=""Kumongous, the Sticky String Kaiju"">Kumongous, the Sticky String Kaiju</a> is that you can pendulum summon it, and tributing your opponents monster requires no normal summon. <h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a></h4> you get to summon 2 metalfoes. This card is a must have in this deck. <h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Astrograph Sorcerer"">Astrograph Sorcerer</a></h4> Some people prefer using  <a data-name=""Majespecter Raccoon - Bunbuku"">Majespecter Raccoon - Bunbuku </a>But astrograph gives you more utility. If a card is destroyed you can summon it and you can bring one metalfoe monster from your deck to your hand. It also helps you with summoning number <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye </a>  This card also has a pendulum scale 1 so it balances it out with <a data-name=""Raremetalfoes Bismugear"">Raremetalfoes Bismugear</a> <h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Archfiend Eccentrick"">Archfiend Eccentrick</a></h4> This card is great because it can destroy a spell card or a monster card. Some people prefer having 3 of them in your deck. However, having 3 of those cards in your extra deck is meaningless since you will be summoning metalfoes most of the times. 2 of them is more than enough. Also you can use archfiend eccentrick on <a data-name=""Metalfoes Combination"">Metalfoes Combination  </a><a data-name=""Metalfoes Combination"">to get another metalfoe in your hand.</a> <h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer"">Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer </a></h4> <p class=""engine-dark-box"">This card is next level with metalfoes. with 1 metalfoe monster and luster pendulum you can get another metalfoe to your hand.</p>  <h4><strong>Wind bitches</strong></h4> Free <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a><a data-name=""clear wing crystal dragon"">? </a>And with pendulum summon you can get a <a data-name=""clear wing fast dragon"">clear wing fast dragon</a> as bonus? Get your hands on it.  If you, however don't like them, you can remove them from the deck.  If your opponent gives you a hard time doing the wind witch combo, then u can always replace them with your side deck cards. The wind witches are inside to give you more options. The only downside is that you can only summon wind monsters the turn you activate it. Play wisely.  On a side note: with <a data-name=""Windwitch - Glass Bell"">Windwitch - Glass Bell</a> and a metalfoe monster you can summon clear wing fast dragon. If you also have <a data-name=""Windwitch - Snow Bell"">Windwitch - Snow Bell</a> then u can get <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon </a>regardless. <h1>Spells</h1> <h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Swords of Concealing Light"">Swords of Concealing Light (optional as opposed to quacking mirror force) </a></h4> <p class=""engine-dark-box"">The reason for this card as opposed to a mirror force is that you can get this card back in your hand with <a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a><a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium""> </a></p> Also they are on defence position on your turn so with metalfoes orichalc you can get dem piercing damage on their faces :) <h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a></h4> since metalfoes are basically destroying their own monsters with card effects, supply squad works for having great draw power. 2 is enough because you don't want 3 of those in your hands or on the field. <h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Painful Decision"">Painful Decision</a></h4> This is your card for getting a metalfoe from your deck. Since you can only use 1 per turn I won't recommend 2 of those in your deck.  &nbsp;  Plays  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The engine is not used in this deck to establish card advantage, though it can be useful for this purpose, but to bring out Metaltron.  Metaltron can be brought out in 2 ways. <ul>  	<li>1.) Tribute Summon - requires 3 (3 spells, 0 monsters | 2 spells, 1 monster | 1 spell, 2 monsters | 0 spells, 3 monsters) <ul>  	<li>This is ideal as it allows you to trigger Metaltron's eff - which can be used to delve into the synchro portion of the extra deck as needed</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>2.) Dreiath III, the True Dracocavalry General: this card's eff is upon being sent to the graveyard (you can tribute this card for another True Draco or for metaltron itself - and bring out another metaltron, etc.) it allows you to summon any True Draco monster - which includes Metaltron (though this negates the eff of Metaltron and should only be used if you need a defensive card or a beater).</li> </ul> Aside from bringing out Metaltron, details above, the deck focuses on gradual spell advantage through the True Draco spell system - which can not be searched due to the limitation of Ignis and ban of Dinomight Knight. The spell system works in that traps are used to destroy opponent's monsters - and bring out True Draco monsters - and spells are used in one of two ways. True Draco Heritage allows you to draw and is the most basic card when it comes to spell advantage, it should always be set before a spell/trap tribute summon of a true draco spell/trap --&gt; gives you a +1 card advantage. The second spell is Disciples of the True Dracopheonix which can serve as fodder in the beginning of a duel but must be kept around for later in a duel so that the True Draco engine can be kept alive; as this card allows you to recycle cards such as Dreiath and Metaltron - which are key to bringing out Metaltron and the Sycnhros associated with his eff.  Other Important Cards: <ul>  	<li>Masterpeace: Same use as in previous True Draco decks, though this is not necessarily the boss ""monster"" of the deck anymore. Masterpeace serves as a card that can shut down and/or prevent chains - as well as give you ridiculous card advantage. I keep 2 but if you prefer Master Peace to Metaltron, use  3.</li>  	<li>Ash Blossom...: Standard hand trap, multi-purpose and won't trigger graveyard effs (though you can replace Ash with Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit if you'd prefer sending to graveyard)</li>  	<li>Dragonic Diagram: Allows you to search for true draco spells/traps/monsters --&gt; Key to speeding up the engine and securing Metaltron through 3 tributes. Not the most important card in the deck but it acts as the primary searcher, allowing you to trigger spell/trap effects and bring more into your hand. <ul>  	<li>Ideal combos: Dragonic Diagram (activation) --&gt; tribute of fodder card (useless card) or Dreiath --&gt; Summon Metaltron or Ignis from Dreiath eff --&gt; obtain something like True Draco Heritage or Dracopheonix from sacrifice (whatever is more appropriate for the situation) --&gt; Use to gain card advantage --&gt; beatdown + spell/trap destruction --&gt; repeat</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Extra Deck Synchros: Many are situational but some can be used in any battle as a boss monster that can guarantee victory. Personally I'd bring out Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon for it's effect but Barbaroid has one of the most brutal effects available to you and can help beef up a deck that is otherwise lacking in immediate offensive firepower.</li> </ul> Not really sure what else to say here, so I'll leave it at that. If you have any tips, I guess you can contact me on here?"

Most of the fodder does come from the regular deck, but there is generally not enough fodder in any given hand for you to summon Trishula; the boss of this deck and the hardest card to summon. Whilst this deck does not perform the special summons of a true Nekroz deck and can not survive off of the extra deck in a link format, it does have its strengths: being able to turn weak, but sustainable, card advantage into plus summons and being able to protect monsters that are on the field for extended periods of time."

As it's namesake might suggest, the boss monster - and goal - is to bring about CXyz Barian Hope. The best way to bring about Barian Hope would be to use C101: Silent Honor Dark - which has an effect that allows you to pile on more Overlay material for Barian Hope, which boosts Hope's ATK/DEF. This can lead to an OTK, as it's not difficult to reach a 5000/5000 or 6000/6000 beater with CXyz Barian Hope. Aside from the boss monster, the deck revolves around the Utopia Chaos series - enabling you to deal damage or prevent damage, depending on the situation; and given other situations, there are various Xyzs - Castel (clearing), Honor Ark (card destruction + clearing), etc.  Basics: Most of the spells exist, in the counts that they are in, to speed up the summoning of a Chaos Xyz - but there are some reinforcement cards in spells like Xyz Territory and Xyz Tribal Rivals (the latter of which can make a nearly indestructible board). The Monsters exist, too, in their current number for the purpose of summoning an Xyz in a turn or two."

Foolish Burial Goods is there to send Overload to the Graveyard, turning it into an easy search on the next turn. Artifact Lancea was my tech choice as it protects your Gears and Drivers if you do not control Circuit or have a free monster zone for your Synchro Summons. Beatrice and Big Eye were chose over other Xyz because of their great synergy with PSY-Frames, Beatrice for enabling Multi-Threader and Overload plays and Big Eye for stealing the opposing monsters as a last resort. Overall, this is a good rogue deck, capable of facing most strategies and unleashing very powerful options, such as PSY-Framelord Omega and Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon to opress the opponent."

Can be played differently depending on if user goes first or second. ,"<h2>Legacy of the Thousand Eyed One</h2> <blockquote><div>As you can probably already see, this deck is filled with the new legacy support for Relinquished and Eyes Restrict monsters. Why? Because they're amazing!  Millenium-Eyes Restrict is capable of countering some of the most annoying Effect Monsters. It's effect reads: ""Once per turn, when an opponent's monster activates its effect (Quick Effect): You can target 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls or in their GY; equip that target to this card. Gains ATK/DEF equal to the combined ATK/DEF of the monsters equipped to it by this effect. Monsters with the same name as a monster equipped to this card by this card's effect cannot attack, also negate their effects."" Millenium-Eyes Restrict is capable of equipping more than one monster at a time, a feat that used to be impossible. Plus, it if the opponent activates an effect, just equip it to yourself. Problem solved!  Millenium-Eyes Illusionist is another great example of amazing support. It's effect reads:  ""(Quick Effect): You can discard this card, then target 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls; equip that target to 1 ""Eyes Restrict"" Fusion Monster or ""Relinquished"" you control, and if you do, it is treated as being equipped by the equipped monster's effect. If an ""Eyes Restrict"" Fusion Monster or ""Relinquished"" is Special Summoned: Add this card from your GY to your hand. You can only use each effect of ""Millennium-Eyes Illusionist"" once per turn."" This card can be used for Ritual Summoning Relinquished with ease because when Relinquished is Special Summoned, M-E Illusionist is returned from the GY to your hand. It also can be used similarly to a handtrap as it's first effect can counter cards. <p class=""engine-dark-box"">Magical Illusionist Faceless Mage is perfect candidate for post-Instant Fusion. ""If a face-up ""Eyes Restrict"" Fusion Monster or ""Relinquished"" you control is destroyed by battle or card effect while this card is in your hand or GY: You can Special Summon this card. If this card is sent from the field to the GY: You can target 1 ""Eyes Restrict"" Fusion Monster or ""Relinquished"" in your GY; Special Summon it. You can only use each effect of ""Magical Illusionist Faceless Mage"" once per turn."" Basically, Instant Fusion an Eyes Restrict while MIFM is in hand, end turn once satisfied, kill the IF target, Special Summon MIFM. You got a body right there! You can also send it from the field to the GY to Special Summon that IF target back to the field. Rinse, repeat, victory!</p> Relinquished Fusion the Quick-Play Fusion Card for the ""archetype."" Fusion Summon 1 ""Eyes Restrict"" Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by banishing Fusion Materials from your hand, field, and/or GY. During your Main Phase: You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls; equip that target to 1 ""Eyes Restrict"" Fusion Monster or ""Relinquished"" you control, and if you do, it is treated as being equipped by the equipped monster's effect. You can only use each effect of ""Relinquished Fusion"" once per turn. Yet another way to use Equip shenanigans.  Those are the major cards to worry about.

It plays pretty straightforward, with your main goal being to summon Clear Wing","This deck is a pretty simple take on the Windwitch Speedroid strategy. It plays pretty straightforward, with your main goal being Clear Wing Fast Dragon and the indestructible Crystal Wing, and there are plenty of combos you can pull off. One thing you may notice is that I decided to run three of every Windwitch. Although most strategies only run 3 Ice Bell, 2 Glass Bell, and 1 Snow Bell, I decided to run 3 of all 3. This is because you will always have two Wind-type monsters on the field when synchro summoning, so filling Snow Bell's condition is easy and makes for even easier indestructible Crystal Wing summons. I kept Ice Bell at 3 for obvious reasons, due to it being the catalyst for the instant indestructible Crystal Wing. One thing I was debating was whether or not to leave Glass Bell at two, but I eventually decided to put it at three due to it also being able to create the indestructible Crystal Wing when paired with Taketomborg due to it being Normal Summoned, searching out Snow Bell, then Special Summoning Taketomborg from hand, then using Snow Bell's effect to Special Summon it, and then go into the indestructible Crystal Wing. Plus, it is a searcher for any Windwitch, which can help improve consistency."

I custom built this deck so that it brings out big boss monsters constantly that will create a big problem for your opponent! Use double evolution pill and the invoked engine to bring out huge boss monsters that cause tons of problems for your opponent like mechaba and ultimate conductor tyranno.  The True King engine allows for big combos for the dinosaurs.  Use the spellbook engine to get more draw power and pull off the combos you need to win! This deck has been tested by me and works really well and is lots of fun to play!

First of all, it's highly recommended to send as many skull servants as possibile to the graveyard, in order to increase King's attack. Your first strategy consists into sending wightprice from your hand/deck to the graveyard: use Gozuki's effect or card trooper's effect. In this way, you'll be able to activate wightprince's effect, and send a skull servant and a lady in wight from the deck/hand to the graveyard. The cheerful coffin is another useful card because allows you to send monster from you hand to the graveyard.  Once wightprince, skull servant and the lady in wight have been sent to the graveyard, you can activate wightprince's effect: banish all these 3 monsters and special summon the king from your deck. Now you can activate burial from another dimension to bring back your 3 monsters and boost the king's attack.  Wall of light and gravity bind are useful cards to control the field and to give you the time to set your board with 1/2 kings with 3k/4k atk points each. Extra deck is not necessary, but this deck can easily spam monsters even thanks to zombie master, and borreload dragon is quite strong."

No problem, sobrecarga de fusión y un chimeratech para reventarlos a todos.  En caso de que te quedes sin campo, y el otro tenga una fusión, xyz o link, se la puedes quitar con el megaflota y un monstruo de nombre Cyber dragon en campo, así le quitas algunas oportunidades de ganar, y puedes devolver los que estén banned al campo, con los efectos negados, pero si tienes un cyber dragon de 3 cabezas banned, ya tienes en el campo un bicho de 4000, es tan fácil como usar cyber network y luego destruirla con magical space tuphoon."

I made this deck purely to go second, if you go first you won't have a very strong board.  When you do go second using the fire true king to destroy 2 infernoid monsters in your hand and then banishing a monster your opponent controls is very effective! There is also void imagination that allows you to fusion summon Infernoid Tierra and send the 3 Elder Entity N'tss.  Then you can pop 3 cards your opponent controls.  I put cards in the side deck that allow you to go first and be more successful like the solemns but it isn't enough normally so going second is your best option!"

This deck is good for supporting all warrior cards which i have woven it to be. Solidarity is a good card with its 800 Atk buff and this effect can stack. To get real good early game is when i summon <strong>Zubaba General </strong>and attaching either <strong>Lv. 6 Mystic Swordsman </strong>or <strong>Freed the Matchless General</strong> buffing him by roughly 2000 atk.  *Edit Credit - shinrazantetsu* I agree with him, Sogen is a very poor card and was added as filler so i removed it and added Magnum Shield. As well i added Rose, Warrior of Revenge since its a better tuner and its suitability is higher.  -This is the third deck i've put alot of thought into any tips or adjustments are welcome!  -Blason"

Millenium-Eyes - ""Relinquished Fusion"" can Fuse Relinquished win ANY monster in your Hand/Field. He can stop a lot of annoying monsters effects.  Dystopia - Probably the Most Awkward to summon but Not Difficult. ""Oh Tokenbaum"" can tribute one token and summon the 4 Kuriboh monsters from your Graveyard to Summon. Best in Mid to Late game. plus he sends the Kuribohs back to grave so it wont affect your ability to summon Envoy  While Linkuriboh is a must i am not too familiar with Link monsters so you may find better options than the ones i picked.

This deck is pretty consistent for the FTK and you can expect to FTK your opponent maybe once every match and even if you can't, then just use regular Pendulum Magician combos and set up Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon! The FTK is not too hard, I will explain the easiest way to do it, right now. First, you need to link summon one Heavymetalfoes Electrum by using Astrograph Sorcerer and/or Cronograph Sorcerer and/or Supreme King Darkwurm to special summon and/or you can normal summon too to get the Electrum. After that you need to get five dark pendulum monsters on the field (six monsters total including the Electrum in the extra monster zone) by pendulum summoning. Then make a second Heavymetalfoes Electrum. Also, you MUST have Instant Fusion in your hand to bring out the FTK fusion target (Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale).  You can place Supreme King Gate Zero and Supreme King Gate Infinity in your scales and use Gate Zero's effect to search an Instant Fusion if you don't have it in hand already. But don't use the Instant Fusion until the end! Make sure to use both Electrum's effects in the process of summoning them to special summon Astrograph and/or Cronograph and get a free draw.  Next, link those Electrums away to get Zefra Metaltron. Then, contact fuse the four left over dark pendulum monsters to get out two Supreme King Dragon Starving Venoms and use Instant Fusion to get out Lyrilusc.  Finally, copy Lyrilusc's effect using the Supreme King Dragon Starving Venoms and use both Starving Venom's effects to deal burn damage to them worth eight-thousand life points! This is the easiest way to FTK your opponent using this deck, but there are other plays in this deck to get the Instant Fusion to bring out Lyrilusc and use the Supreme King Starving Venoms to burn them for game.

Silent swordsman unique ability to negate Spells at lv.5 and all Spells and Traps at Lv.7 is extremely powerful combining it with the warrior synergy you're going to be cooking up some decently sized plays with this deck. I suggest trying to either get<strong> Silent Swordsman</strong> or <strong>Silent Swordsman Lv.3</strong> on the board on turn 1 it is extremly powerfu.l if you can keep <strong>Silent Swordsman</strong> you can use his ability to not only negate spells but also Buff him every standby phase  -If there is any tips or suggestions let me know  -Blason

On their own, they can give you a steady start to a game, providing a solid defensive line. With the assistance of Dragon Horn Hunter, these monsters become just that little bit stronger and also protect you from battle damage entirely.  Use cards like Heat Wave or Tyrant's Throes to gain a huge advantage over your opponents (Provided they aren't playing a similar deck) by cutting off their most powerful monsters and allowing you to build up field presence in the meantime, picking off their tributes and other weaker monsters. If Sea Dragoons of Draconia is in the Pendulum zone, attacking your opponent will also enable you to get an extra monster out each turn during the Battle Phase. Depending on the opponent, Tyrant's Throes can almost become a win condition for this deck, stifling your opponent's summoning capacity completely while leaving yours untouched and allowing you to attack directly every turn.  Sky Dragoons of Draconia has a powerful Pendulum effect that allows you to double up on monster destruction each time you attack with one of your Normal monsters, useful for disposing of high-ATK targets, or to eliminate threats in your opponent's Spell &amp; Trap card zones. Alternatively, you can use it to clear out a Pendulum zone you no longer need to replace it for a new one.  Summoner's Art can be used to search out Dragon Horn Hunter or Sky Dragoons of Draconia to start off your Pendulum setup, or in tandem with Ancient Rules to bring out a Blue Eyes White Dragon or Dragon Core Hexer. <h3>Extra Deck</h3> One of the easiest possible strategies to pull off with this deck is to use Dragon's Mirror and Link Spider to summon First of the Dragons. Summon any Normal monster while you have another Level 4 or lower in hand, then Link summon Link Spider. Use its effect to bring out the second monster, and then use Dragon's Mirror to banish the one in the Graveyard and the one on the field as Fusion materials.  Princess Cologne can be used as an easy barricade if you come under pressure from attacks. Combined with Dragon Horn Hunter's Pendulum effect, she can usually buy you at least one turn to recover. <h3>Alterations</h3> <ul>  	<li>Dragon Core Hexer is mostly in this deck as a thematic compliment to Dragon Horn Hunter. Mechanically, she isn't much better than Blue Eyes unless you want to use her as a defensive wall. She could easily be traded out for a third Blue Eyes or similar monster.</li>  	<li>Alternate Pendulum choices may include Lancephorhynchus to give all your Normal monsters piercing damage, or Master Pendulum, The Dracoslayer to help manage your Pendulum zones.</li> </ul>"

After some testing, this build has been decently effective and has more Mekk-Knight monsters to summon and have in your hand. The goal of the deck is to make invoked mechaba and set spell cards in your hand that are within the same column that your opponent controls a card(s). Then summon the Mekk-Knights and wreck havoc! Mind control and scapegoat are really great for summoning link monsters and getting out Borreload Dragon or SkullDread. This deck also runs a lot of handtraps to stop your opponents plays which is extremely helpful."

","This is a fairly straightforward deck that I'm trying out for the sake of one of my favorite monsters; Chaos MAX. Kaijus are a fun and incredibly annoying but still entirely viable mechanic that lends itself well to the lvl 8 draw cards, so they were one of the best ways to fit the engine in. The main objective is to take out problematic monsters then beat over the rest of the board, either with your Kaijus or with the main dragon himself, MAX-y boy. Also, I should mention that the extra deck is really random, I just kinda picked usable cards without a whole lot of forethought, but you could fit a couple generic links, a couple lvl 4 overlays and just generally put a bit more effort into it than I initially did. My only regret is that this deck is actually the 4th version of the concept. The first version employed recurring monsters like Grapha to do the deed instead, but my boys in the Dark World just can't keep up anymore. :(  UPDATED FOR IMPCANTATIONS! I, FOR ONE, WELCOME OUR NEW RITUAL OVERLORDS. These little guys help add consistency and a muuuuuuch easier OTK to the deck;  - Summon an Impy-boi in defense position - Creature Swap the Impy-boi away - Summon Chaos MAX - Attack for game  It's freaking hilarious when it goes off."

You want to go second every duel though if you can, otherwise it is hard to win. To win you need to special summon the Mekk-Knights to OTK your opponent out of nowhere. If you're opponent has one card in a column and you have a spell or trap and a Mekk-Knight in your hand then you should set the spell or trap in the same column as their card(s).  Then you can special summon the Mekk-Knight(s) in the column(s) that have two or more cards! Use Mind Control to take their monsters and link them away with your Mekk-Knights/Scapegoat Tokens.  Final Countdown puts pressure on them as they have to hurry if they want to win while Final Countdown is active. It's a tech choice I came up with that is funny to use. Use Psychokinesis to destroy your opponent's cards and use Psi-Blocker to block their card(s) that you know they are going to try to use. There are other great cards in the deck that have good synergy with the deck like PSY-Framelord Omega. I came up with these great techs that have good synergy with the deck. Hope you all enjoy them and the deck!"

After testing I've found it has a low brick rate and is extremely competitive for those meta players who are Trickstar fans! The goal of this deck is to burn your opponent every time they draw/search and every time they use a spell/trap. Also, using the Trickstar Reincarnation and Droll &amp; Lock Bird combo to make your opponent lose their entire hand and basically instant lose is amazingly broken and helpful. It's simple, just get two Trickstar Reincarnations using Trickstar Light Stage and Trickstar Candina, then set them. Make sure you have a Droll &amp; Lock Bird in your hand, then once your opponent plays any card on their following turn right after yours, use one of the set Trickstar Reincarnations and right after it resolves and your opponent draws their new hand, start a new chain by activating the other Trickstar Reincarnation, then immediately chain your Droll &amp; Lock Bird in your hand to that Trickstar Reincarnation. Droll &amp; Lock Bird's effect comes first in the chain, therefore it will stop them from searching/drawing anymore this turn, and the Trickstar Reincarnation will set off next, making them banish their entire hand without being able to draw after since Droll &amp; Lock Bird's effect is active. Scapegoat and Eater of Millions are also very powerful tools in this Trickstar build. Use Scapegoat during your opponents end phase allowing you to link summon big boss monsters like Borreload Dragon and Saryuja Skull Dread during your following turn to OTK and overwhelm your opponent."

The goal of the deck should be to get your Assembly Nightingale out and then use Recite Starling to boost it/search for other lyrical luscinia monsters  Please feel free to give me criticism and commentary on the deck. It works pretty well(its 23 - 3 in play testing as of right now) but there is definitely room for improvement  strategy here...

For additional counter plays the deck uses Artifacts to prevent the opponent (or yourself) from banishing cards, prevent extra deck summons or simply destroy cards from your opponent.  Depending on your opponents deck, there are an additional Moralltach and Lancea in the side deck. The Paleozoics are the main traps in this deck and you can use them for your XYZ plays with the frogs.  Additional stuff: Eater of Millions and Sky Cavalry  are used for some protection in case the artifacts brick or when you need to remove a threatening monster. The Handtraps in this deck are Effect Veiler and Artifact Lancea. Ash blossom was to expensive in my opinion so i use effect Veiler as alternative. There are Solemn Warning and Solemn Jufgement in this deck. I didn't include strike to keep the Call of the haunted in the deck But there will be no problems with swapping CotH for some strikes.  Side deck note: Some side deck cards can be swapped out. I have kept Paleozoic Dinomischus because i'm not sure if i should use only 1 copy of that card or 2. I rarely use him but when i use him, he can be helpful. Another card that isn't that important is the Call of the Haunted. I just didn't knew what to include at this point."

The goal of the Electrumite abuse is to stock the Extra Deck with Pendulum Monsters to bring out a variety of cards (whatever is suitable). With Clear Wing being a board wipe, Starving Venom being an extender (whether that be more negates with Odd-Eyes Vortex, or another card like Electrumite --&gt; which you might want to preserve the effect of for even more looping). The Mythical Beast engine is simply there to speed up the deck (and you include cards, like Rescue Hamster --&gt; which is a tech option in my opinion because it requires cards in the Extra Deck to be of use). If you'd like to see a board with 4+ Negates: Run 2 Starving Venoms, Firewall, Underclock, Norito, and an Odd-Eyes Absolute to pop into a Odd-Eyes Vortex (I don't run this setup but I've seen it, and it works). Other tech options include Psy-Frame, Gameciels (which slow down the deck), Ash or Ghosts (both slow down the deck), and standard side deck cards (for T1 meta like True Draco). This deck is a little more casual than your average Pendulum Mag. build, but it does have an incredible sense of speed --&gt; speed that, if played correctly, can match (if not surpass) many tournament standard decks."

It is also difficult to sweep a field while also maintaining your resources. Of course, <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> is one easy step to clear your opponent's field, but it doesn't necessarily destroyed its spell/traps, which means you'll be opened to any traps/spells your opponent control. In this case, this deck fulfill its its requirements to sweep the field while also maintaining its safety. This deck contains all Strikeblade Archetypes and Spellbook Engine (<a data-name=""Spellbook Magician of Prophecy"">Spellbook Magician of Prophecy</a>, <a data-name=""Spellbook of Secrets"">Spellbook of Secrets</a>, and <a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledges"">Spellbook of Knowledges</a>) and Bamboo Sword Engine (<a data-name=""Broken Bamboo Sword"">Broken Bamboo Sword</a>, <a data-name=""Golden Bamboo Sword"">Golden Bamboo Sword</a>, and <a data-name=""Cursed Bamboo Sword"">Cursed Bamboo Sword</a>). In fact, it is easy to came across a monster, hopefully any Rei.  <a data-name=""Strikeblade Maneuver Afterburner"">Strikeblade Maneuver Afterburner</a>, <a data-name=""Strikeblade Maneuver Jamming Waves"">Strikeblade Maneuver Jamming Waves</a> are the card that takes care of both your opponent's monster, traps/Spells. Jamming Waves can take care of any monsters that ""cannot be targeted by card effects"" since Jamming Waves doesn't specifically say ""target"". You can use Afterburner to take care of any powerful monsters like <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> (you have to lure it, or to negate it to destroy it).  <a data-name=""Strikeblade Ignition Engage"">Strikeblade Ignition Engage</a> is the very key to this strategy. If you use it, it is an endless loop of drawing one ~ eight from the deck, while also grabbing three cards from the deck itself, which is extremely consistent. IF you don't have any monster in your hand, or any to draw, go for <a data-name=""Strikeblade Battlegear Hornet Bit"">Strikeblade Battlegear Hornet Bit</a>, then one of the two: <a data-name=""Strikeblade Battlegear Widow Anchor"">Strikeblade Battlegear Widow Anchor</a> or <a data-name=""Strikeblade Battlegear Eagle Booster"">Strikeblade Battlegear Eagle Booster</a>. Also, if you want to refresh <a data-name=""Strikeblade Valkyrie Kagari"">Strikeblade Valkyrie Kagari</a><a data-name=""Strikeblade Valkyrie Kagari""> and </a><a data-name=""Strikeblade Valkyrie Shizuku"">Strikeblade Valkyrie Shizuku</a><a data-name=""Strikeblade Valkyrie Kagari"">, use </a><a data-name=""Strikeblade Battleship Hercules Base"">Strikeblade Battleship Hercules Base</a><a data-name=""Strikeblade Valkyrie Kagari""> to destroy itself via </a><a data-name=""Strikeblade Battle System Multirole"">Strikeblade Battle System Multirole</a><a data-name=""Strikeblade Valkyrie Kagari"">,</a> <a data-name=""Strikeblade Airspace Area Zero"">Strikeblade Airspace Area Zero</a><a data-name=""&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-name="">, or Jamming Waves. You can add Call from the Grave to cancel your opponent's Ash Blossom for easy access. It also is a spell, so it is a great addition to your deck. The only unluckiness in this is when you can't afford to draw a card AND cannot summon a monster. This deck requires a lot of practices, strategies, etc. Anyway, this is all I can give for this week. </a>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "" href=""""&gt;  <a data-name=""Strikeblade Valkyrie Kagari"">Strikeblade Airspace Area Zero</a>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Great combos with <a data-name=""Magical Dimension"">Magical Dimension</a>/<a data-name=""Dark Renewal"">Dark Renewal</a> and Spellcasters, <a data-name=""Vengeful Bog Spirit"">Vengeful Bog Spirit</a>/<a data-name=""Soul Exchange"">Soul Exchange</a> and Toon Monsters.  <a data-name=""Vengeful Bog Spirit"">Vengeful Bog Spirit</a> shares the Toon Monster handicap to the opponent. <a data-name=""Soul Exchange"">Soul Exchange</a> is usable too, because tribute summoned monster (except for <a data-name=""Toon Magician Girl"">Toon Magician Girl</a>) couldn't attack immediately.  <a data-name=""Comic Hand"">Comic Hand</a> steal an opponent monster for free, and it could even attack in your very next turn.  <a data-name=""Magical Dimension"">Magical Dimension</a> is a great opponent's End Phase combo.  It has an enormous (ridiculous) staying power thanks to <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a>, also has great defenses like Mirror Forces, <a data-name=""Toon Briefcase"">Toon Briefcase</a>, Bottomless, <a data-name=""Black Illusion"">Black Illusion</a>, Compulsory, the Solemn. Even more defenses in the Side Deck, eventually.  Some cards like <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> and <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> are needed because of activation cost and maintenance of Toon Kingdom, as you can see I use 44 cards because of this.  You can use another Palladium or Red-Eyes instead of <a data-name=""Sorcerer of Dark Magic"">Sorcerer of Dark Magic</a>, it's here only for a ""Yugi Deck"" factor.  In side deck there are some combos too: <a data-name=""Toon Defense"">Toon Defense</a> with <a data-name=""Drowning Mirror Force"">Drowning Mirror Force</a> (you should use at least 2 of them for each one and remove all Toon above level 4).  <a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a> is a pain in the ass for the Pendulum/Link Decks and <a data-name=""Quaking Mirror Force"">Quaking Mirror Force</a> + Toon direct attacks are the death sentence for old decks."

Use it at your leisure. I'm not a fan of the cloud castle/calamities combo but I feel it might be better than twin burst which is why it's there.  Main combos, terraforming into mausoleum if you have 2 tuners in hand, bonus if one of them is Maiden, who summons a blue eyes from deck when targeted by mausoleums effect ,allowing you to go straight into needlefiber.  If you have destrudo, arkbrave or goliath in hand terraform ravine instead. Crystron needlefiber effect to summon o-lion from deck then link into summon sorc, either summon a dragon from hand if none are on field, not recommended but can be useful in certain situations like a matchup vs brandish.  You can easily get dark matter on field into arkbrave goliath combo. From there it's up to you, I don't like bringing out Saryuja unless I need the special summon, the deck for effect is just a bonus.  Enjoy."

This deck actually did really well in testing and has a pretty low brick rate considering they got hit hard on the last banlist. After days of testing and making this deck from scratch, this is what I came up with for Spyrals for the current 2018 meta format. The goal is to get out Spyral Double Helix using two Spyral monsters, Trigate Wizard, more link monsters, and Spyral Sleeper. Spyral Sleeper is the boss monster of the deck. Summon him by removing from play 3 Spyral cards in your grave. Then equip him with Spyral Gear - Last Resort and use Sleepers effect to target himself and two of your opponents cards for a nasty combo. This deck takes tons of practice so be sure to play it often if you wish to master all the combos and are new to the deck. Or, if you are already a Spyral pro from the previous format then you know the drill. Enjoy!"

It's best if this goes second, and you do whatever Strikeblade Spells you need, and get out Kagari. Then you use Trickstars. There, you can get Candina, then get Trickstar Light Stage if you have Bouquet. Get Bouquet if you don't have one yet. Then you can deal huge battle damages using the combo of Bouquet AND Lycoris to boost your Kagari's huge attack. Last time I used this deck is that I deal 9000 LP damages at best. This deck doesn't really involves burns, but if you can burn it with Reincarnation and Lycoris Combo, that'll be great."

Summon out <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a> to use its effect t0 destroy your opponent's spell &amp; trap cards up to the number of fusion materials used. My strategy is to summon out Rampage Dragon using Power Bond, thus doubling its attack points. Then I use its effect where you send up to two light machine monsters from your deck to the graveyard, and Rampage Dragon gains an additional attack for each monster sent to the graveyard. If you get the right hand you can easily OTK your opponent.  One other strategy is to have both Cyber Dragon and <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a> in your hand. You then special summon Cyber Dragon from your hand while your opponent only controls a monster. Then you normal summon Cyber Dragon Drei which its effect will change all Cyber Dragon monsters on your field to lvl 5 including itself. Then proceed to use those two monsters to XYZ Summon <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>, then special summon <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> over Nova. Infinity's effect allows you to turn your opponent's attack position monster into an overlay unit once per turn, which also increases Infinity's attack points by 200 for each overlay unit. You can also use Infinity's effect to turn one of your monsters into an overlay unit for Infinity which will boost its attack points.

This is actually really consistent due to the Deviritual cards, allowing you to easily get both a ritual monster and Advanced Ritual Art/Chaos form. You can also search the ritual monsters with melody of awakening dragon. If you get both rituals out and they have atleast 2 monsters (with 1 of them not being a link monster) you pretty much win since you can switch attack position monsters to defense and reduce their defense to 0, then attack with Chaos MAX and kill them with double piercing damage. Also, you can add any extra deck monsters you want."
