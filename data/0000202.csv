More than often your opponent doesn't have an out for Crooked Cook and ends up overcommitting thus making the Fisherman LV7's banish effect all the sweeter. If you're not satisfied with that, you can just straight up boardwipe with a Zeus summoned on top of a Cook that can't be destroyed by battle. This is assuming Crook has Right-Hand Shark as material.

The sharks are meant to summon the XYZ's. The Icejades are surprisingly very useful here.  Tremolat lets you special summon ANY water monster from your hand. Fisherman LV5, Buzzsaw Shark, Citadel Whale, Beautunaful Princess are all good options. Tinola lets you special summon ANY water monster from the graveyard, which is pretty good considering the cards we're running. It's, also, possible to summon a WATER monster sent from your hand by it's effect if there's a water monster in the grave already.

Side-deck is interchangeable depending if you go first or second.

Missing card is Ice Barrier, a tremendous searcher for the Fisherman boys, Tremolat, and Citadel Whale if you want it. Can also recover ANY water monster from the grave, not just the one that was sent.

The deck is focused in summoning Destiny Hero - Plasma while D - Force is on the field, but, to get that D - Force out the deck it's not simple so i've made a more consistent version of the previous deck.

This new version have less cards consequently having less Danger! cards with means less monsters for plasma to absorb, but until you summon plasma probably is the 4-6 turn so the enemy should have did a plenty of things and got a lot of monsters in his graveyard so don't worry.

Hmmm there's no WomboCombo, just stall until you have all cards you need to summon Plasma.

&nbsp;

Notes:
<ul>
 	<li>Destiny Hero - Plasma IS a special summon which needs tributes so it's NOT tribute summon what means that you can tribute 3 Scapegoat tokens for his summon.</li>
 	<li>You can trade Dark World Dealings for Hand Destruction but remember that Hand Destruction don't trigger Danger! or any discard effects.</li>
 	<li>Is easily disrupted by Lock Bird and Ash Blossom so you can add mind drain or prohibition to the side deck.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Sorry for any grammar mistakes.

Any suggestions are welcome.

But Doom Sentence and the graveyard-effect of Dark Spirits Mastery can lead to big card advantage.

Dark Spirits Mastery can search Destiny Board/Norleras/Necrofears.

The BAs should be used first turn because your s/t-zone will be blocked afterwards.

Therefore, only the BAs with good effects are included.

The Dark Spirits are searchable via Rhino, Tour Guide and Scarm and can revive the necrofears and the unchained monster.

Beatrice/Herold are light fairys for Norleras.

If Norleras' effect resolves, you will most likely win the game with a massive graveyard setup.

Dark Necrofear+Curse Necrofear= Draglubion+Number 100 (9000 ATK)."

Beacon/Aboundance/Blessing/promise only at 1 each because they are situational and searchable with Rainbow Bridge/Crystal Master

Lost Wind/Crackdown/Solemns can block your zones, so i go with TT (Can be used on your own Summon) ,Compulse (Can Reset Pegasus), Veiler (HT).

Dark&gt;Raigeki in this Deck, because it triggers conclave.

Don't like Rainbow Dragon (And Rainbow Overdragon) because you have to play more of the bad Crystal Beast and this deck is to Normal Summon heavy anyway.

Bless Madame Verre.","Based on the deck shown by u/KharAznable on his post about cheap decks under 30$. The deck revolves mostly around using the Witchcrafter engine to get out Madame Verre and protecting it using the various spell cards in the archetype as discard fodder for your Witchcrafters or using their effects to assist your plays. The main differences in my deck from the original are the addition of the field spell Secret Village of the Spellcasters, which locks out your opponent from using Spell Cards as long as you maintain a Spellcaster on the field, and Effect Veilers as generic budget hand traps.

General game plan: You want to go turn one and set up a board with as many Witchcrafters in the grave (or banished after using their effects) as possible, at least a few spells in the hand with Golem Aruru, and Madame Verre and Witchcrafter Bystreet on the field. If you have Haine and Unveiling you could set Unveiling and immediately summon Haine during Standby to protect Madame Verre and your Spellcasters for turn two as well. Dogmatika Punishment or Golem Aruru any big beat sticks your opponent may pull out, and utilize Madame Verre's opponent field-wide monster negate (non-targeting BTW) and Aruru and Haine to weather your opponent's turn. Your turn, if you still have an Aruru you can generally utilize a Collaboration and Scroll for advantage alongside Madame Verre's ATK boost effect during Damage Step to swing over bigger monsters for huge damage.

I honestly love this deck so far, and you can still spill in other Extra Deck monsters as you see fit. Very fun casual control deck, in my opinion, spell lolis for the win!

With that said, the age in some of this cards is very noted since this Starter Deck featured a lot of Normal monsters.

Their old strategy was about battle position and ranking-up their Xyz Monsters.
Nowadays, they're more of a monster spam with no reason, or linking and doing nothing, which is why they're not used.
<ul>
 	<li>Main Strategy:
Going first or second probably won't change your moves. This deck is all about Special Summoning their Rank 7 and hoping to live a turn.</li>
 	<li>Monsters:
<ul>
 	<li>Level 3:
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Digital Bug Registrider"">Digital Bug Registrider</a>: Probably the best card in DigiBug deck. It's the card that make your Rank 7 more accessible and faster. His 1st effect can be triggered by most of the deck and his second eff is also good if you get lucky.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Digital Bug Websolder"">Digital Bug Websolder</a>: Main monster for a Normal Summon. Websolder is good in basically any hand opening(except if you're like me and draws 20 traps in a deck with only 3). His effect makes you summon 1 from your hand, which with Beetroopers, that could mean more Extra Deck monsters.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Beetrooper Scout Buggy"">Beetrooper Scout Buggy</a>: Best Beetrooper monster, no doubt. Splashable monster that's a free Xyz/Link Summon. If used right, it can make big combos.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Beetrooper Scale Bomber"">Beetrooper Scale Bomber</a>: Registrider, but not Registrider. Scale Bomber is pratically another Registrider, having the same impact - Special Summon a second monster by Normal Summoning a card.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Battlewasp - Twinbow the Attacker"">Battlewasp - Twinbow the Attacker</a>: Do I need to say something about it...? It's a free special summon, no matter your hand. If any of your monsters got negated, you still have a free summon.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a>: While being heavily used in other insect decks, in DigiBug we have a big problem. We're out of Lv4 monsters. You can Resonance Insect, but it's too bricky in a deck where you always want a Lv3 monster, not a Lv4 one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Non-Level 3:
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Danger! Mothman!"">Danger! Mothman!</a>: Basically the best draw maker for the deck. Your luck doesn't matter that much, since in any case, you'll get a draw. You can use him for links or some Bagooska action.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Beetrooper Sting Lancer"">Beetrooper Sting Lancer</a>: Not as good as Mothman, but it still adds the Beetrooper Field Spell, which can give you a Lv3 monster or it can add the Beetrooper trap, which is also good negation.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Battlewasp - Sting the Poison"">Battlewasp - Sting the Poison</a>: Well, some people may ask why I added this card into the deck, since it's not really a combo starter(because I didn't put any synchros) and the add(Twinbow the Attacker) will not make much difference. Well, I added it for the negation effect. You can easily summon this card with Cicada King and it's just another interruption for your opponent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Spells:
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>: Since you brick a lot, desires is just a last hope.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Bug Signal"">Bug Signal</a>: This card is basically a Rank-Up-Magic. It can speed-up the summon of the Digital Bug Rhinosebus(The rank 7 monster).</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>/<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>/<a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a>: They're there to fill the deck. Foolish Burial can be used as a combo starter sometimes(using Gokipole), but it's too situational and most of the times it'll just be a bait for your opponent. The other cards are just a try to have more monsters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Traps:
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Bug Emergency"">Bug Emergency</a>: Use this to protect yourself/have some monsters. It is a brick sometimes, so if you want to change it, go for it.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Beetrooper Fly &amp; Sting"">Beetrooper Fly &amp; Sting</a>: Counter trap that sets itself. Depending on the field, this can be a life saver.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Extra Deck:
<ul>
 	<li>Go mostly for the Xyz Monsters, but the Beetrooper links are also very good and Inzektor Picofalena can add good cards, if used well.</li>
 	<li>Most of the cards can be changed in the Extra Deck, but 2 of the DigiBugs Xyzs is good to mantain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
DigiBugs are a really fun deck to play, but they can brick a lot and handtraps are always a problem.
Anything you want to say, comment it, since it's good for me to learn about the deck too."

This deck is cheap! I swear people complain about engines being expensive! If you’re looking for a budget deck I’d say your best getting krawlers, they’re so cheap with an actually decent payoff and you can still spare money to buy handtraps!

In the lore Krawlers are beings that live all over the world (I originally thought they were aliens but I was wrong, they’re just bugs) and pose a threat to the people who live there, there’s thousands upon thousands of them and they live all over the place, they appeared in a fight against the world chalice and debuted a couple more times, I’m doing these builds in the order they appeared in the lore, I’ll also be giving out the backstory of the archetypes (basically just a bio, not the stories)

Again, any questions will be happily answered

Also if I’m correct Mekk-Knights are next..."

Maybe even with protection!,"Good for going first or second, slightly better going second though IMO.  Nearly every starting hand you should be able to get both <a data-name=""Wightprince"">Wightprince </a>into the graveyard by using either of <a data-name=""Uni-Zombie"">Uni-Zombie</a>'s efffects: discarding if you drew Prince with first effect or sending with second effect; summoning Dark Grepher and activating his effect; or summoning Armageddon Knight.  Foolish Burial and One for One are also options.

If you don't start with any of those somehow you've also got the three Lightning Storms and Super Poly's, Prince and <a data-name=""Wightbaking"">Wightbaking</a> can activate off both of their discards as they are worded with ""if"" and not ""when"".  More ways to turbo Prince or Baking into the grave are to just link them off with Linkuriboh or Almiraj.

My strat is to send a Baking to grave first with any of the methods I mentioned, searching Prince and <a data-name=""Wightmare"">Wightmare</a>, then discarding Prince.  Activate Prince in grave sending the vanilla and Lady, activate again banishing the three to summon King from deck, then activate Mare to summon Lady for effect protection.  King should be at 3k after this and possibly more depending on what you hand was, like if you drew into Princess.

In the chance you don't open into any Skull Servants another play is to just Zombie World and Super Poly into <a data-name=""Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon"">Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</a> or Starving Venom.

Extra Deck is the Dragonecro and two Starving Venoms for the shenanigans I just mentioned, two <a data-name=""Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn</a> and a <a data-name=""Sylvan Princessprite"">Sylvan Princessprite</a> for milling.  Doesn't come up very often but the tech is viable.  <a data-name=""Avendread Savior"">Avendread Savior</a> to for more graveyard sending and maybe beat over something.  I don't use it a whole lot but, again, there if needed.  <a data-name=""Vampire Sucker"">Vampire Sucker</a> for draw power, <a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a> for potential OTK set ups if you King is the size of a, really big scary skeleton.  And finally Linkuriboh and Almiraj for linking away Prince or Baking if you had bad opening draw.

Side deck has two Ghost Belles to counter things like Called by the Grave because we want those skellies in the grave.  Two Book of Life for revival and graveyard removal.  Lightning Storm for if you want more backrow removal.  Now that I think about it Twin Twisters would be an equally good option, good idea for budget play.  Shiranui Style Solemnity...I'll be honest I've never understood how to properly use this with the deck, I've only seen it being run in other Skull Servant decks so I figured I might as well put it in the side.  Veil of Darkness because nearly all of the Skull Servants are darks and if you believe in the heart of the cards you'll put all of them in the graveyard during your draw phase.  Torrential Tribute for interruption.  The Extra Deck monsters in the side you could replace with other cards if you like, I've haven't really been able to find good plays with them.  Up to you if you want.

Have fun with the biggest walking beat stick known to skeleton kind!"

Today in another version of the <strong>Triple Structure Deck Challenge</strong>, we’ll talk about one of the new Structure Decks in OCG: <strong>Overlay Universe</strong>. As the recent entries of the challenge, the deck list of this version will be available at the end of the wall of text here in case some cards appear missing. With that said, rules are the same: A 40-card Main Deck build using, at least, 30+ cards that are enlisted in the Structure Deck’s card list; where the Extra Deck can be edited by choice. With that said, let’s begin the deck’s breakdown.

<strong>Deck Analysis</strong>

Although it was originally marketed as a Structure Deck that would feature support cards for 3 of the mayor characters of the Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL anime, this Structure Deck brings support mostly to <strong>Yuma Ysukumo’s</strong> “<strong>Utopia</strong>” Deck: A deck consisting of consistently summon R4NK Xyz monsters to then use “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>” Spell Cards to bring even bigger Xyz monsters.

Also, it needs to be noted that this “Deck” actually relies of many sub-archetypes that were used by Yuma &amp; Astral during the anime: those being “<strong>ZW -</strong>”, “<strong>ZS -</strong>”, “<strong>Onomat</strong>”, “<strong>Zexal</strong>”, “<strong>Xyz</strong>”, “<strong>Number</strong>”, “<strong>Utopic</strong>” “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>” and what some call the Alliteration Squad (<strong>Gagaga, Gogogo, Zubaba &amp; Dododo</strong>). And just because I hate myself, I will explain each archetype, but only the cards used in the build.

<strong>ZW – &amp; ZS –</strong>

“<strong>ZW -</strong>”, which translates to “<strong>Zexal Weapon</strong>”, consists of monsters of various Levels, Types &amp; Attributes which share one peculiarity: they can equip themselves from the hand or field (depending the monster) to either a face-up “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster, a “<strong>Number C39</strong>” monster, or more specifically to a <strong>Number C39: Utopia Ray</strong>, if stated by the card. However, the “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monsters used here are from the variant that can equip to any “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster. As a note, I will only note how it can be equipped and what effects has while equipped to a monster:

<strong>*ZW – Tornado Bringer</strong>: Can be equipped from the hand or field. While equipped to a monster, that monster gains 1300 ATK and it cannot be targeted by your opponent’s card effects. Also, if the monster equipped with him would be <u>destroyed by battle</u>, <strong>Tornado Bringer</strong> destroys itself instead. While its protection is partial, it is intended to be paired with <strong>Lightning Blade</strong> for the full setup, which will be explained right now.

<strong>*ZW – Lightning Blade</strong>: Can be equipped from the hand or field. While equipped to a monster, that monster gains 12oo ATK and, while equipped to a monster, all face-up “<strong>ZW -</strong>” cards you control cannot be destroyed by your opponent’s card effects. Also, if the monster equipped with Lightning Blade would be destroyed by a card effect, <strong>Lightning Blade</strong> destroys itself instead. When paired with <strong>Tornado Bringer</strong>, the equipped monster gains 2500 ATK, your opponent can’t target it with effects, all your “<strong>ZW -</strong>” cards cannot be destroyed by your opponent’s effects and that monster is protected once for battle destruction and once for effect destruction. This simple combo is the main reason both of them are always run when playing “<strong>ZW -</strong>”’s.

<strong>*ZW – Pegasus Twin Saber</strong>: This one is a bit more recent with its day view being in LIOV, and also having one of the weirdest gimmicks of “<strong>Utopia</strong>” decks: having less LP than your opponent. It can only be equipped from the field, but you can Special Summon it from the hand if your opponent LP is at least 2000 higher than yours. The equipped monster gains 1000 ATK and while equipped to a monster, you can negate 1 monster effect activated in your opponent’s field. Alongside some of the new Xyz monsters, this is one of many options this deck has for effect negation, even if limited to monster effects. Also, some of the new support can make it be equipped from the Deck.

<strong>*ZW – Asura Strike</strong>: Can be equipped from the hand or field. The equipped monster gains 1000 ATK and while equipped to a monster, that monster can attack all monsters your opponent controls once each. Since this deck can actually get some high attack monsters, it can help to wipe out a board if your opponent doesn’t have an answer to it.

<strong>*ZW – Eagle Claw</strong>: In comparison to Pegasus, its effects are quite similar. It can only be equipped on the field to a “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster, but it can Special Summon from the hand if your opponent’s LP is at least 2000 or higher than yours. The equipped monster by this effect gains 2000 ATK and, while equipped to a monster, can negate the activation of a Trap Card or effect. Is mostly run to add more negates to the end board.

<strong>*ZW – Dragonic Halberd</strong>: While not running his Utopia Ray counterpart, Halberd is a rather good extender to run, although you might need <strong>RUM Zexal Force</strong> to summon it. Is a Rank 5 DARK Dragon that requires 2 Level 5 materials and it cannot attack directly. You can detach 1 material from this card to search 1 “<strong>Zexal</strong>” Spell/Trap from the Deck to your hand. Also, you can target 1 “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster on your field and equip this monster to it. That monster gains 3000 ATK, and if it destroys 1 monster by battle while equipped with this monster, you can Special Summon any “<strong>ZW -</strong>” Monster cards equipped to it. You mostly summon it to get rid of garnets by searching <strong>Zexal Construct</strong> and using said garnet with it, or searching another <strong>RUM Zexal Force</strong> or <strong>Zexal Field</strong>. And the last effect, while a bit weird to pull off, it can be combo-ed with <strong>Shining Draw</strong>’s first effect, since <strong>Shining Draw</strong> does not count as if the equipped “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monsters were equipped by their effects, making Halberd Special Summon all of them, attack when them if you like to, and them re-equipping them properly with their effects.

On the other hand, “<strong>ZS -</strong>” monsters (which I’m going to guess it translates to <strong>Zexal Sage</strong>) consists of Warrior-Type monsters that grant positive effects when paired with “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monsters. Most of this support comes from LIOV, but is heavily recommended to try out if attempting this deck for the challenge:

<strong>**ZS – Ascended Sage</strong>: A Level 4 LIGHT Warrior monster that can Special Summon itself from the hand if you control no cards. If it is used for the Xyz Summon of a “<strong>Utopia</strong>” Xyz monster, you can add 1 “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>” Normal Spell from the Deck to the hand (if you wondered, there are some “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>” Quickplay Spell cards, and some of them are kind of busted). “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>” cards are probably your main access to this deck’s new boss monster, so it’s recommended to run at 2-3 to secure one. Just remember its summoning condition.

<strong>**ZS – Armed Sage</strong>: Another Level 4 LIGHT Warrior monster that can Special Summon itself from the hand if the other monster you control is a Level 4 monster except another copy of itself. If used for the Xyz Summon of a “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster, you can add 1 “ZW -” monster from the Deck to your hand. One of your most reliable plays is open with both Sages for a double search, most of the time using them to summon <strong>Number 39: Utopia Double</strong> so it can also summon any “<strong>Utopia</strong>” Xyz monster with its effect.

<strong>**ZS – Utopic Sage</strong>: Also, being new support from the Structure Deck, is a generic Rank 4 LIGHT Warrior Xyz Monster that requires 2 Level 4 monsters. You can detach 2 materials to Special Summon 1 “<strong>ZW -</strong>” or “<strong>ZS -</strong>” monster from the Deck but you’re locked to only Special Summoning Xyz monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn, and you can only attack with “<strong>Number</strong>” monsters that turn. If a “<strong>Utopia</strong>” or “<strong>Utopic</strong>” Xyz Monster which is original attribute is LIGHT would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can banish this monster from the field or GY to prevent it. In case you didn’t open with <strong>Ascended Sage</strong> or <strong>Armed Sage</strong>; or you wanted to bring a “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monster to equip to a monster, <strong>Utopic Sage</strong> can help with both. Keep in mind that he’s a “<strong>Utopic</strong>” monster and not an “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster, meaning if you use both Sages to bring him out, you cannot search with their effects.

<strong>Alliteration Squad, Onomat &amp; Utopic</strong>

These 3 archetypes consist of mostly Level 4 monsters and some Spell Cards that will help you to bring Rank 4 monsters fast. Really fast. Starting with the Alliteration Squad, it consists of 4 smaller archetypes: <strong>Gagaga, Gogogo, Dododo</strong> and <strong>Zubaba</strong>. All these archetypes have their own strengths, but besides being played by Yuma in the anime, the main reason they are connected are due to their simple but effective swarming effects to bring Rank 4 Xyz monsters later.

<strong>***Zubababancho Gagagacoat</strong>: Alongside 2 more monsters that were featured in the<strong> Legendary Duelist: Magical Hero</strong> set, is the first one treated as more than 1 archetype. Is a Level 4 EARTH Warrior that can Special Summon itself from the hand if you control another “<strong>Zubaba</strong>” or “<strong>Gagaga</strong>” monster, except another copy of itself. It can also target 1 “<strong>Gogogo</strong>” or “<strong>Dododo</strong>” monster in your GY and Special Summon it, but you can only Special Summon Xyz monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn. It’s always run at 3 with said 2 monsters since they act as an engine that can summon 2 or even 3 Rank 4 Xyz monsters with the right hand.

<strong>***Dodododwarf Gogogoglove</strong>: This is the second monster of said engine, being a Level 4 EARTH Rock monster that can Special Summon 1 “<strong>Zubaba</strong>” or “<strong>Gagaga</strong>” monster from your hand. If this card is in the GY, but you control a “<strong>Dododo</strong>” or “<strong>Gogogo</strong>” monster except another copy of itself, you can Special Summon it from the GY but is banished if it leaves the field. The self-banishing setback is avoided if it is used in a Xyz Summon, since Xyz materials are sent to the GY regarding if it were meant to be banished by its own effect.

Next, we have <strong>Onomat </strong>and <strong>Utopic</strong>, which is mostly support cards that works with every archetype member of the <strong>Alliteration Squad </strong>and some of the other archetypes used in the deck.

<strong>***Utopic Onomatopoeia</strong>: Is a Level 4 LIGHT Warrior that is treated as a card of all 4 archetypes of the Alliteration Squad (meaning he’s also a “Gagaga”, “Gogogo”, “Zubaba” and “Dododo” card). During the Main Phase, you can Special Summon up to 1 of each “Zubaba”, “Gagaga”, “Gogogo” and/or “Dododo” monster except another copy of itself in Defense Position, but you’re locked to Xyz monsters for the rest of the turn. This is your main playmaker and your main interaction with the effects of Coat and Glove, being the third member of the engine mentioned earlier.

<strong>*Utopic Astral Hope</strong>: Being new support from the Structure Deck, is a Level 4 LIGHT Warrior that can Special Summon itself from the hand if there is an Xyz monster on the field. You can send 1 other card from the hand or field to the GY to add 1 “<strong>Xyz</strong>”, “<strong>Onomat</strong>”, “<strong>Zexal</strong>” or “<strong>Number</strong>” Spell/Trap card from the Deck to your hand. This one, while being another free monster and a backrow searcher, the setup needed and the fact this decklist is already tight with the ratios, it is recommended to run in smaller ratios, usually at 1 or 2.

<strong>**Onomatopaira</strong>: Now starting with the backrow support, this is a Spell card that can send 1 card from the hand to the GY to add 2 monsters that are either a “<strong>Zubaba</strong>”, “<strong>Gagaga</strong>”, “<strong>Gogogo</strong>” or “<strong>Dododo</strong>” monster; but they cannot be from the same group. Is a simple yet effective double ROTA for your Deck. If you run a deck more dedicated to the <strong>Alliteration Squad</strong>, max out on this one alongside…

<strong>**Onomatopickup</strong>: A Continuous Spell card that when activated can add 1 “<strong>Onomat</strong>” card from the Deck to the hand. It also has another effect to modify the level of all monsters you control, but that one is more reliable for more dedicated <strong>Alliteration Squad</strong> Decks. Its main purpose here is to search <strong>Utopic Onomatopoeia</strong> or <strong>Onomatopaira</strong>, whatever is needed at the moment.

<strong>Zexal, Rank-Up-Magic, Xyz &amp; Number</strong>

This section is pretty much about most of the backrow this deck runs that supports the deck’s playstyle.

<strong>**Zexal Construction</strong>: Coming from LIOV, is a Spell card that requires to reveal 1 card in your hand to activate. If you do, you can add 1 “ZW -” monster, 1 “ZS -” monster, 1 “Zexal” Spell/Trap card, 1 “Rank-Up-Magic” Spell card OR 1 “Rank-Down-Spell” card; but if you do, the revealed card is shuffled into the Deck. This is also one of your backrow searchers, while also getting rid of any garnet or unnecessary card at the moment. Just because this deck list is tight, I run 2; but if possible, max out of it.

<strong>*Zexal Field</strong>: Is their new Field Spell, that prevent your opponent to activate cards or effects in response to the effects that would target an Xyz monster you control. If you Special Summon an Xyz monster(s), you can target 1 of those monsters and you can attach another Xyz monster from the Extra Deck or GY to that monster. Lastly, during the Draw Phase, before drawing, you can place 1 “<strong>Shining Draw</strong>” from the Deck on top of the deck. Is used only to prevent your opponent to negate any “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>”, equipping a “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monster or interacting with your Xyz monsters. The <strong>Shining Draw</strong> setup is a nice extra, since <strong>Shining Draw’s</strong> second effect makes it another “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>”, almost being an extra <strong>Hyper RUM</strong>. Also, you can use <strong>ZS – Utopic Sages</strong> from the Extra Deck to give them to fuel your Xyz monster on the field, to then use them as materials and setup the GY for their protection effect.

<strong>**Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</strong>: Is a Spell card that targets 1 Xyz monster you control and Special Summon from the Extra Deck 1 “<strong>Utopia</strong>” or “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monster that is 1 Rank higher that the targeted monster, using it as material and transferring its materials to the summoned monster. Then, you can take 1 “<strong>ZW -</strong>” or “<strong>ZS -</strong>” monster from your Deck and place it on top of the Deck. Lastly, if your opponent’s LP is 2000 or higher than yours, you can banish this card from the GY to draw 1 card. This is usually what you search with <strong>Ascended Sage</strong> if you opened with a <strong>Hyper RUM</strong>, if not, search the latter; and if you’re low on LP can net you a draw or even a search if you arrange the top card of the Deck.

<strong>**Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Hope Force</strong>: This card is new in this Structure Deck, which is a Spell card that can target a Rank 9 or lower “<strong>Utopia</strong>” Xyz monster you control and Special Summon a Rank 10 or higher “<strong>Utopia</strong>” or “<strong>Utopic</strong>” Xyz monster using that monster as material and transferring its Xyz materials to it. If an Xyz monster is Special Summoned by the effect of a Rank 10 or higher “<strong>Utopia</strong>” or “<strong>Utopic</strong>” Xyz monster, and this card is in your GY, you can target one of those monsters and attach it as a material. This card is your main access to your new boss monster, alongside <strong>Number 99: Utopic Dragon</strong>, that can also Special Summon Xyz monsters. (Spoilers: the new boss monster specializes in Special Summoning Xyz monsters).

<strong>***Xyz Change Tactics</strong>: Is a Continuous Spell card, but you can only control one due to its effect. When a “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster is Xyz Summoned to your field, you can pay 500 LP to draw 1 card. Since this deck can Special Summon “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monsters a lot, it can net you a good plus, while setting your LP to the effects of <strong>ZW – Pegasus Twin Saber</strong>, <strong>Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</strong> or even <strong>Hope for Escape</strong> to draw even more cards, if you happen to run it.

<strong>***Numbers Protect</strong>: Is a Counter Trap card that can negate the activation of a Spell/Trap card or monster effect and destroy it, while you control a “Number” Xyz monster. If a “Number” Xyz monster you control gets destroyed and this card is in your GY, you can Set it back to the field but it banishes when it leaves the field. It’s an archetype Solemn Judgement that is capable of recycling itself. The activation requirements are rather simple, but the recycle requirements are a bit slow.

<strong>Utopia</strong>

“<strong>Utopia</strong>” is the main archetype that mostly dominates your Extra Deck, consisting of Warrior Xyz monsters with mostly battle-related effects, with a side of summoning even stronger versions of themselves.

<strong>**Number 39: Utopia</strong>: This is Yuma’s ace monster, while also being one of your must-go to extend your Extra Deck plays. Is a Rank 4 LIGHT Warrior Xyz monster that requires 2 Level 4 monsters. If a monster declares an attack, you can detach 1 material to negate that attack. If this card does not have materials, it gets destroyed when targeted for an attack. While its effect brings a bit of defense, you mainly summon the original Utopia to interact with some of your cards.

<strong>*Number 39: Utopia Double</strong>: Is a Rank 4 LIGHT Warrior that requires 2 Level 4 monsters. As a Quick Effect, you can detach 1 material to add 1 “<strong>Double or Nothing!</strong>” from the Deck to the hand, and then you can Xyz Summon 1 “<strong>Utopia</strong>” Xyz monster using this monster as material and transferring its materials to it. The summoned monster’s ATK becomes double its original ATK but it cannot attack directly. Its effect can Xyz Summon ANY “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster, giving you access to all of the listed monsters on this section and giving it a huge attack boost. If you ever draw <strong>Double or Nothing!</strong> you can reshuffle it with <strong>Zexal Construction</strong> to still use Double’s effect. I love starting with him when I opened with any of the Sages, since I found funny how you can search up to 3 cards with only an Xyz monster.

<strong>*Number C39: Utopia Ray</strong>: Is a Rank 4 LIGHT Warrior that requires 3 Level 4 LIGHT monsters or can also be Xyz Summoned using a “<strong>Number 39: Utopia</strong>” as material, transferring its material to it. If your LP are 1000 or lower, you can detach 1 material from this card to make it gain 500 ATK until the end of the turn; if you do, 1 monster your opponent controls lose 1000 ATK until the end of the turn. This effect is not once per turn, and it doesn’t target. If you get really low on LP or you’re deep into the grind game, it can net some heavy damage; but is mainly used for Xyz climbing using his Summoning Condition to prepare a bigger Xyz Summon.

<strong>*Number S39: Utopia Prime</strong>: I will not detail much about it, since is another “Utopia” monster that can be Xyz Summon using “Number 39: Utopia” as the full material; and is mostly used for Xyz Climbing.

<strong>*Leo Utopia Ray</strong>: This one comes from the <strong>Animation Chronicle Volume 1</strong> set, which will bring cards exclusive to the anime and adapt them to the physical game. Is a Rank 5 LIGHT Warrior that requires 3 Level 5 monsters and is always treated as “<strong>Number 39: Utopia Ray</strong>”. You can detach 1 material to equip 1 “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monster from the Deck or Extra Deck to this card as it was equipped by their effect (this is because some of the “ZW -” monsters only work when equipped by their own effects and not equipped by other means, like with <strong>Thousand-Eyes Restrict</strong> or <strong>Immortal Phoenix Gearfried’s</strong> effects since they were intended to work only with <strong>“Utopia”</strong> monsters). As a Quick Effect, and if this card is equipped with a “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monster, you can target 1 Effect monster your opponent controls; it negates its effects and halves its current ATK. If equipped with Pegasus, it can give you a double monster effect negation and the ATK reduction can help you out with an OTK, which Utopia decks can pull off a lot.

(IMPORTANT NOTE: This wording means you can’t run 3 copies of this monster and any copies of the original <strong>Utopia Ray</strong> or the other monster that is also treated as “<strong>Number C39: Utopia Ray</strong>”, that being <strong>Ultimate Dragonic Utopia Ray</strong>. So, pick wisely your ratios. I put 1 original and 1 Leo, but the choice to play them are yours.)

<strong>*Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</strong>: You might be familiar with this card because of how often is played in decks that uses a lot of Level 4 monsters in order to have a strong beater to run over problematic boss monsters, alongside <strong>Utopia Double</strong>. Is a Rank 5 LIGHT Warrior that requires 3 Level 5 LIGHT monsters or it can also be Xyz Summoned using a Rank 4 “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster, transferring its materials to it; but itself cannot be used for an Xyz Summon (so no <strong>AA-ZEUS</strong> cheese). If it battles, your opponent cannot activate cards or effects until the end of the Damage Step. During damage calculation, as a Quick Effect but only if it has a “<strong>Utopia</strong>” Xyz monster as material, you can detach 2 materials to make this card’s ATK 5000 during that damage calculation. Is a rather problematic beater, for your opponent that is, that it can be equipped with the “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monster to give it an ATK boost when he runs out of materials. Consider it a Plan B boss monster.

<strong>**Number 99: Utopia Dragner</strong>: But now is time to talk about this deck’s Big Kahuna. <strong>Number 99: Utopia Dragner</strong> is a massive Rank 12 LIGHT Warrior with 3000 ATK/DEF that requires 3 or more Level 12 monsters (only an absolute madman would try to summon him by the generic way, so this is your main target with <strong>Hyper RUM</strong>). As a Quick Effect: You can detach 2 materials to Special Summon 1 “<strong>Number</strong>” monster from your Extra Deck, that has a number between “1” and “100” in its card text, and <u>it is treated as an Xyz Summon</u>. But if you do, you can only Special Summon Xyz monsters from the Extra Deck, and other monsters other that <strong>Utopia Dragner</strong> cannot attack directly this turn. Also, if an opponent’s monster declares an attack, as a hard OPT, you can change its ATK to 0. Although his last effect is pretty strong, giving a defensive option in battle, the real busted thing about this new boss monster is his first effect. If summoned with the right combo (which I list a bit below), it is possible to summon him with 4 materials, granting you access during your turn and your opponents turn to the non-“<strong>Utopia</strong>” Number monsters in the Extra Deck; those being <strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong> (Summon it during your turn for Spell Negation, but if you have Hyper RUM in the GY, DO NOT give it to him and save it for later) and Number 92: <strong>Heart-eartH Dragon</strong> (Summon it during your opponent’s turn, especially during the End Phase, and when you do GIVE HIM the Hyper RUM from the GY so it can banish its entire field). Just as an extra, to showcase which could be good targets for <strong>Dragner</strong>’s effect, here’s a list of Number monsters that could benefit from it:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Number 3: Cicada King.</strong> Monster effect negation and large blocker.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 4: Stealth Kragen.</strong> Quick Effect monster destruction and burn.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 6: Chronomaly Atlantis.</strong> Can become a large beater and could halve your opponent’s LP at cost of a Battle Phase.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 7: Lucky Straight.</strong> While its effect relies only on luck, its effects can be devastating.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 9: Heraldic King Genom-Heritage.</strong> Useful against Xyz-centered Decks.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 11: Big Eye.</strong> Takes control of 1 of your opponent’s monsters.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 14: Greedy Sarameya.</strong> Bounces back any burn damage you would take, and could possibly destroy a lot of monsters with its second effect. Useful against Burn Decks.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 18: Heraldry Patriarch.</strong> Useful against decks that Summon multiple copies of a monster.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 21: Frozen Lady Justice.</strong> Destroys all Defense Position monsters your opponent controls.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 22: Zombiestein.</strong> Ridiculously large ATK value and RDA Abyss-like omni-negate.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 23: Lancelot, Dark Knight of the Underworld.</strong> Direct attacker, monster destroyer and provides mandatory backrow negation, including your own so be careful.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 24: Dragulas the Vampiric Dragon.</strong> Can be brought back if not destroyed properly and can send cards from the field to the GY without targeting.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 25: Force Focus.</strong> Monster effect negation against high-level monsters. Useful against Ritual, Fusion or Synchro-based strategies.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid.</strong> If its effect is successful, it can turn into a rather large monster, usually a <strong>Super Quantal Mech King Great Magnus</strong>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech</strong>. Useful against boosted monsters, like a <strong>Gren Maju Da Eiza</strong>-centered Deck.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 35: Ravenous Tarantula</strong>. Stat boost to your entire field if you have an LP advantage, as well as a possible monster board wipe. It can be used to summon <strong>Seven Sins</strong>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark</strong>. Stat reduction to your opponent’s field and monster reviver upon being destroyed.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong>. Spell negation and attack interceptor.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</strong>. Defensive and stalling option.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition</strong>. Entire lockdown of 1 card on the field while he stays on the field.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 54: Lion Heart.</strong> Battle damage reflector.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 60: Dugares the Timeless </strong>(requires <strong>Zexal Field</strong>). All of his effects are amazing.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 61: Volcasaurus</strong>. Monster destruction and burn.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon.</strong> Massive ATK values when the field is packed with Xyz monsters.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu.</strong> With a proper setup, he can Summon a really beefy token.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 68: Sanaphond the Sky Prison.</strong> Prevents players to Special Summon from the GY.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 70: Malevolent Sin. </strong>Banishes 1 monster for a turn. If kept alive and constantly attacking, it can become a large beater and could be used to Summon <strong>Seven Sins.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Number 71: Rebarian Shark</strong>. “<strong>Number</strong>” Xyz monster reviver and can setup a “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>” for the next turn.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 76: Harmonizer Gradielle</strong>. Steals monsters from the opponent’s GY while gaining kind of specific protection.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 77: The Seven Sins</strong> (requires <strong>Zexal Field</strong>). Banishes all Special Summoned monsters from the opponent’s field and attaches 1 of them, while also gaining protection.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora</strong>. Can make 1 card on the field unaffected to all card effects, and it can be used as material for a <strong>Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</strong>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 84: Pain Gainer</strong>. Massive DEF values when more Xyz monsters are on the field, burns your opponent each time they activate backrow, destroys all of his monsters with less DEF than him and it can be used to Summon Seven Sins.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker</strong>. Constant card banishing.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon</strong>. Banishes any card Normal Summmoned, Special Summoned or Set from your opponent’s field at their End Phase.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 97: Dragluon</strong>. It can Summon a <strong>Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon</strong> with a <strong>Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon</strong> as material OR a <strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon</strong>. By any route, this is an OTK enabler.</li>
 	<li><strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon</strong>. OTK enabler when packed with more Xyz monsters.</li>
</ul>
As for the said combo, it mostly relies that you have a <strong>ZS – Ascended Sage</strong> on your hand and another Level 4 monster. Use both to summon <strong>Number 39: Utopia Double</strong>, and use <strong>Ascended Sage</strong>’s effect to search <strong>Hyper RUM</strong>. Then use Double’s effect to add the <strong>Double or Nothing!</strong> from the Deck to then Special Summon a <strong>Number 39: Utopia</strong>. Use that Utopia to summon either <strong>Utopia Prime</strong> or <strong>Utopia Ray</strong>, and then use the <strong>Hyper RUM</strong> to summon <strong>Utopia Dragner</strong>. Use <strong>Dragner</strong>’s effect to summon <strong>Number 38</strong> during your turn and don’t activate the <strong>Hyper RUM</strong> from the GY yet. Keep doing your plays like normal. When your opponent turn starts, you can use <strong>Dragner</strong>’s effect again to bring <strong>Number 92</strong>; but it is recommended to save it until the End Phase or if <strong>Dragner</strong> is in risk to getting removed from the field by any means. If you do summon <strong>Number 92</strong>, activate the <strong>Hyper RUM</strong> from the GY and attach it to him. When the End Phase rolls up, activate its effect to banish most of your opponent’s field to have a rather secure OTK on your following turn.

<strong>Side Deck and Generic Cards</strong>

As for the more generic cards run in the Deck, <strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong> can search any monster from the Main Deck except the “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monsters, <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> for recycling monsters, <strong>Double or Nothing!</strong> for <strong>Utopia Double</strong>’s requirements and a <strong>Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</strong> as a Plan C boss monster and Xyz Monster reviver.

The Side Deck consists mostly of cards I think would synergize well with the Deck. More Main Deck monster options for more swarming (<strong>Dododo Buster</strong>, <strong>Gogogo Giant </strong>and <strong>Astral Kuriboh</strong>), Xyz Monsters (<strong>Number 99: Utopic Dragon, ZW – Leo Arms, Gagagaga Magician</strong> with both <strong>Number F0</strong>, <strong>Daigusto Emeral</strong> and a <strong>Number 97: Dragluon</strong> package) and some backrow (<strong>Dodododraw</strong> for more draws and <strong>Gagagarevenge</strong> for monster reviving).

&nbsp;

And that should be enough for this deck’s analysis. For the time I practiced this deck, the biggest board I could manage was 5 negates (<strong>Leo Utopia Ray</strong> with <strong>Eagle Claw</strong> equipped, <strong>Dragner </strong>with <strong>Pegasus Twin Saber</strong> equipped, <strong>Number 38</strong> on the field, and a set <strong>Numbers Protect</strong>) alongside a <strong>Utopia the Lightning</strong>, <strong>Heart-earth Dragon</strong> with <strong>Hyper RUM</strong> as material, <strong>ZW – Lightning Blade</strong> equipped to <strong>Dragner</strong> and one <strong>ZS – Utopic Sage</strong> in the GY for extra protection. And I required the best opening hand possible, which was opening with both <strong>Ascended Sage</strong> and <strong>Armed Sage</strong>, and a <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong>; doing the <strong>Utopia Double</strong> triple search combo.

If you could manage a bigger board of negates, let me now in the comments. Lastly, thanks for reading this wall of text, probably the biggest for now. The decklist for the <strong>Starter Deck: Kaiba</strong> deck will be uploaded tomorrow. Until then.

16 .banish tunneler from grave and return all your link monsters + your starter to the deck/extra deck then draw 2.

17. on end phase activate bullet to return dozer to hand

17 . 5. sometime during your opponents main phase 1 activate knuckle to discard box and SS bullet from grave, if bullet gets destroyed this turn on your opponents end phase you can bring box back to hand to search for an infinitrack anchor drill

&nbsp;

this is my take on Neo-Spacian.

It is meant to be a going second deck, since most Neos-fusions are better at breaking boards than setting up interruptions.

I decided to make this deck because I tried to build a Neo-Spacian deck in my childhood... but it got stolen. BIG Sadge :/

<span><strong>Card highlights</strong></span>

<span><strong>Monsters:</strong></span>

Most of the Neo-Spacians are outdated monsters released back in GX times.

The one exception is <a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin"">Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</a>. It is a card that sees plenty of play in Isolde turbo, dark warrior abomination decks. It helps to play around handtraps.

The other three-off out of the <a>Neo-Spacian pool is </a><a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Grand Mole"">Neo-Spacian Grand Mole</a><a>. It is probably best known out of bad childhood memories, bouncing your boss-monster again and again. ^^ </a>

The rest of the bunch is just there to deliver discard fodder and serve as possible fusion materials.

My favorite Neo-Spacian is <a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Flare Scarab"">Neo-Spacian Flare Scarab</a> for esthetic reasons.

Your best starter for the deck is <a data-name=""Neo Space Connector"">Neo Space Connector</a>. It brings out <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Neos"">Elemental HERO Neos</a> for free and can exchange itself for a Neo-Spacian from the GY.

<span><strong>Spells:</strong></span>

One of the strongest spells for Neo-Spacian is <a data-name=""Convert Contact"">Convert Contact</a>. It allows you to draw two for the cost of a discard and a mill.

<a data-name=""Contact Gate"">Contact Gate</a> helps you to get more Neo-Spacians on the field and to soften the downside of your Neos fusion monsters.

<a data-name=""Neos Fusion"">Neos Fusion</a> is the <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> for the deck. Not much else to say about that one.

<a data-name=""Miracle Contact"">Miracle Contact</a> recycles your Neo-Spacians and <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Neos"">Elemental HERO Neos</a>. It also is your only option to summon <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Cosmo Neos"">Elemental HERO Cosmo Neos</a> effectively.

&nbsp;

The deck shines more for nostalgic reasons than for playability, but I tried my best combining both.

The side deck presents some accountable options, but can be customized at will.

Suggestions to improve the deck are welcome. :)

Have a nice day, everyone!"

Option 1: deck out

Defensive deck which utilizes Necroface to deck out the opponent by removing cards from play.

Swap necroface between dimensions to win!

Since the deck itself is quite fast, ideally you activate ""return from the different dimension"" to summon and remove multiple necrofaces in your turn to deck out your opponent. Pass the turn to win.

Option 2: wait like a crocodile and strike at the right moment.

Giant trunade is meant to recycle cards which switch Necroface between dimensions.

However later in the game, you could normal summon a necroface, activate return from the different dimension, giant trunade and OTK your opponent."

The main focus is to create a position you can control the game from when going first, knocking down your opponent as they try and set up.
When going second the main goal is similar, but instead of preventing them from setting up you try and knock down what they've built. Eldlich and the Live☆Twin archetype synergize nicely together to grind the game out.

Sideboard's just cards I'm considering adding to the mainboard at current, not an actual suggestion."

Winda and Grysta can be Fusion summoned pretty Easy.
El Shaddoll Shekinagha and El Shaddoll Construct will be an good working Defense.
Avramax is kinda Easy to summon, with Cross Sheep and Construct and he is your main Attacker.

I am not sure about the Potential against Meta Decks but i guess it could be pretty good in Locals.

Curse of the Shadow Prison could be changed with an 3rd Ash or some other Fusionspell  like Nephe Shaddoll Fusion.

The Sidedeck is mainly optimized for some Kaiju and Extra Spell/Trap if you are strugeling against some Dragoons the Side Deck could be an Option."

To say that Plunder Patroll will never have a chance at META contention is an understatement. Given not only that the tides had slowly turned into this archetypes favor with the introduction of BlackEyes, the Plunder Patroll Seaguide; but the cardpool that is currently picking up a lot of decks has especially gave this one a boost. While the main Plunder Patroll engine hasn't changed much (aside from bringing Red and Blue Beard to 2 copies instead of 3), newer cards had opened up for the decks versatility to further optimize it's hidden potential. Like Prank-Kids, Plunder Patroll has to reep in Hand-Traps to it's most wisest use (such as Effect Veiler, Ghost Belle, and Ash Blossom), all while piecing together a OTK board that rewards over refuses. Hence why Triple Tactics Talent is in the Main Deck over the usual Pot of Desires; and where cards like Twin Twister and Solemn Strike can breach the current state of the game. Extra Deck monsters like Borreload Savage Dragon, Apollousa, Daigusto Emeral, and Hope Harbinger Dragon are great emergency pieces to go into in case SHTF. Familiar Side Deck staples like Droll &amp; Lock Bird and Evenly Matched also come into play for cases, such as Shaddolls and Drytron. I know this isn't the best of both worlds; but taking it that Plunder Patroll has to rely on what they can get their hands on for until they get new support, it seems that the störtebeker jungs have to work with what they have until better archetype support comes around"

I know you wouldnt be summoning rai-oh to often on your first turn, but you can easely abuse this combo on your next turns as it is searchable by the fusion."

Well luckily there's another unbanned boss monster: Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon

We might not be able to summo","We'll build this deck around the usage Twin Headed-Thunder Dragon for rank 7 fodder or a Forbidden Memories-esque beatdown. Our main combo will require Polymerization, an OG Thunder Dragon or a Thunder Dragon Fusion, or ways to acquire them (we have plenty).

Having Polymerization allows us to churn out three Twin-Headed Thunder Dragons in a single turn thanks to the recycling of Thunder Dragon Fusion and Verte Anaconda.

You'd play this for the most part like a traditional TD deck. Aloof is an excellent card in this deck for getting TD pieces and setting up the Verte Anaconda we want on the field. Once we get a poly, TD and a TDF in our hand, we go the following:

1- Ditch a TD, add 1 and ditch it again so we have 2 in GY and 1 in our hand.

2- Activate TDF, get 1 Twin-Headed and put your TD that you discarded back into your deck.

3- Since there is still a TD in your hand, use its effect to discard itself and add 2 to hand.

4- Activate your poly, get another a Twin-Headed.

5- Now that you have your grave set up, now is the time for any extra deck set up or any additional special summons that you want.

6- Activate your Verte Anaconda get your third and final Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon.

7- Beat down your opponent with unrelenting nostalgia

This deck probably won't win you a regional but it should good for a laugh when you tell your friends you're playing Thunder Dragons in 2021."

This is lightsworn, what can you expect?","Lightsworn and Chaos, a combination almost as old as yugioh itself. Personally, I don't play creator or valkyria, but both can be used as extenders so feel free to adjust the deck. Very simple deck, summon raiden or lumina then raiden, mill, extend (graveyard effects, minerva, special summons, etc), build board. Its quite easy to put up a few interrupts like harbinger, crystia, apollousa, and draco berserker. harbinger can be made with chaos ruler and levianeer. Levianeer can very easily summon apollousa, etc. It struggles against spell/trap heavy decks going first or second so the side deck has backrow removal. It also struggles going second so extra cards like hand traps etc are helpful there. The easiest out to a boss monster is dingirsu. Enjoy."

You can build up a good board with 5 cards nearly every duel with protection through <a data-name=""Fallen Paradise"">Fallen Paradise</a> and controll through <a data-name=""Sacred Beast Awakening"">Sacred Beast Awakening</a> or OTK your opponent with <a data-name=""Raviel, Lord of Phantasms - Shimmering Scraper"">Raviel, Lord of Phantasms - Shimmering Scraper</a> or <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</a>.

Most important cards to start your combo are: <a data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a> and <a data-name=""Opening of the Spirits Gates"">Opening of the Spirits Gates</a> (they can search for each other).

With Piri Reis Map (Release in December) this deck gets even more consistency and maybe can also compete with some Meta Decks."

Makes a lot of fun while playing it. If your Prank-Kids combo goes interrupted, just follow with Eldlich. If you don`t have an Prank-kid in hand, don`t give up, play Eldlich. If you play against an annoying backrow deck, and you can`t combo any more, follow with Eldlich.

Both Prank-kids and Eldlich doesn`t need much space, and can also start out of one card. Eldlich make`s your prank-kids-deck more consinstend, by making the strategy more interruptable. It sounds weird, but accept when your combo is broken and try to come back while you can survive with Eldlich. There´re so many problems you can fix with Eldlich in the Prank-kids deck, and you have the space for the engine.

Be careful while fusion summon in your opponents turn, because you lock yourself into Prank-kids and can´t use Eldlich-traps any more.

I think it´s clear that handtraps, side deck and extra deck are format dependet. Give the Deck a chance!"
