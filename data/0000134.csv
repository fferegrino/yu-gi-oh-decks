It comes with a safety warning that you will get RSI if you try to use it online. Over many moons it has morphed (mainly when I stole ideas from better deck builders) but with the banning of Linkross, I have been at a loss of how to proceed without a complete overhaul. If anyone has any thoughts, please let me know. To assist with this, I've written up a step-by-step guide here:
<ol>
 	<li>Go first against a deck which plays no disruption‚Ä¶..</li>
 	<li>Summon 2 Warriors. Options are Neo Space Pathfinder, Golden Castle/Iron Hans, Sublimation Knight, Golblidenburgh &amp; Phantom Knights</li>
 	<li>Summon Isolde</li>
 	<li>Add any warrior to hand that is not Zushin. Best target is Iron Knight.</li>
 	<li>Use effect to discard 4 equips. Keep all DDR in deck, discard Divine Sword.</li>
 	<li>Summon Armageddon Knight. Equip Divine Sword if in hand.</li>
 	<li>Discard Plaguespreader and SS it.</li>
 	<li>Summon Halbifrax from Isolde and PS Zombie.</li>
 	<li>Summon Red Rose Dragon with its effect</li>
 	<li>Synchro Summon Power Tool Dragon with AK and Red Rose</li>
 	<li>Summon White Rose Dragon</li>
 	<li>Get DDR with Power Tool Dragon</li>
 	<li>Remove Armageddon Knight + 1 from play to add Divine Sword from GY to hand.</li>
 	<li>Play DDR, discard divine sword, SS Armageddon Knight</li>
 	<li>Discard Zephyr</li>
 	<li>SS Blackwing by adding DDR back to hand. AK goes to GY</li>
 	<li>Add DDR back to hand by removing AK from GY</li>
 	<li>Play DDR on AK. Discard Summoner Monk.</li>
 	<li>Play Number 60 through AK and BW.</li>
 	<li>Use Number 60 effect to SS Summoner Monk</li>
 	<li>Discard 1 spell to SS another Summoner Monk (use Divine Sword if needed)</li>
 	<li>Summon El Shaddol Winda through Power Tool &amp; Number 60</li>
 	<li>Use 2nd summoner monk to summon Rescue Ferret</li>
 	<li>Leaving Rescue Ferret use remaining monsters to summon Primathmech</li>
 	<li>Use effect to add De-Synchro from deck to hand</li>
 	<li>Summon Taotie Dragon, with the Primamech and Halb (any link 3 facing down would do)</li>
 	<li>Use Rescue Furret to summon Tuningware, Vylon Cube, and Magic Cat.</li>
 	<li>Summon Armory Arm with Tuniningware and Vylon Cube</li>
 	<li>Add DDR from deck to hand. Living Fossil if already there.</li>
 	<li>Use De Synchro on Armory Arm, summoning the materials</li>
 	<li>Summon Linkross from Taotie Dragon</li>
 	<li>Summon 2 Tokens</li>
 	<li>Use Tokens &amp; Vylon Cube to summon TG Hyper Librarian</li>
 	<li>DDR Plaguespreader</li>
 	<li>Synchro Summon Altergiest Dragvirion with PZ, Magicat and Tuningware</li>
 	<li>Add back De Synchro with Magicat, it will be drawn by Tuningware along with another card thanks to Librarian.</li>
 	<li>Activate De-Synchro on Dragvirion</li>
 	<li>Repeat loop until all cards are drawn. This may be 25-38 times.</li>
 	<li>Utilise accumulated mega-hand to summon to set up the following:</li>
 	<li>Gravekeepers Shaman, Iris, Phantom of Chaos &amp; Skull Servant should be in the main monster zone, Skull Lair should be active. LADD and Plaguespreader should be in the grave. Pianissimo and Zushin the Sleeping Giant should be in hand.</li>
 	<li>Resource cards: Number 60, Saryuja, Living Fossil, DDR, Monster Reborn, Silent Doom, Temple of the Kings and Summoner Monk.</li>
 	<li>Use Phantom of Chaos on LADD.</li>
 	<li>Activate Pianissimo on Skull Servant</li>
 	<li>Activate Zushin on Skull Servant</li>
 	<li>Activate Plaguespreaders effect in GY by adding Zushin to the top of the deck. ‚ÄúLADD‚Äù/Phantom of Chaos will trigger. To its activation chain the effect of Skull Lair, target the Skull Servant and remove 1 monster from the GY.</li>
 	<li>Skull Servant will not be summoned due to GK Shaman. Phantom of Chaos has 0 ATK/DEF so cannot prevent anything as LADD. And by virtue of using a chain link 3, draw 1 from Iris. It‚Äôs the Zushin.</li>
 	<li>Activate the newly drawn Zushin on the Skull Servant</li>
 	<li>Repeat 9 times until Skull Servant has 10 tokens</li>
 	<li>SS Zushin the Sleeping Giant</li>
 	<li>For the extra flex, add all other cards in the hand back into the deck, by using the above loop but not chaining Skull Lair.</li>
</ol>

An amazing combo nobody knows about.,"Tenyi cards have incredible synergy with eldlich cards since your traps are technically non effect monsters. Ashuna and Adhara both make your grind game even more powerful than standard eldlich, allowing you to win in mirror and even keep up with drytron. The counter trap gives you 3 more answers to cards like duster, reboot, lightning storm and evenly. As well as being able to be used in conjunction with your board wipes in order to out boards with multiple spell speed 2 negates. The field spell is basically always live and lets you outgrind even harder, it's technically neg when you first use it and you don't have handtraps to draw into, but eldlich will not get OTK'd even going second thanks to busted cards like needle ceiling and your attack blocking capabilities."

<span>So the main point of this deck is to get <a data-name=""Benghalances of the Samsaric Cycle"">Benghalances of the Samsaric Cycle</a> by getting three monsters then going <a data-name=""Sunavalon Melias"">Sunavalon Melias </a>to bring back <a data-name=""Sunseed Genius Loci"">Sunseed Genius Loci </a>from your gy and going link 4 <a data-name=""Benghalances of the Samsaric Cycle"">Benghalances of the Samsaric Cycle</a>.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>For a deck whose main goal is to get a link 4 in one turn (which it does most of the time.) It is actually a slow deck.¬†</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Deck strategy.¬†</span>

<span>So the key to winning with this deck is <a data-name=""Sunvine Shrine"">Sunvine Shrine</a> which you can get with the link 1 <a data-name=""Sunavalon Dryas"">Sunavalon Dryas</a>. So how your going to win is by having <a data-name=""Benghalances of the Samsaric Cycle"">Benghalances of the Samsaric Cycle</a>, <a data-name=""Sunvine Shrine"">Sunvine Shrine</a>¬† lot‚Äôs of stun, and a Sunavalon link 1 2 or 3¬†</span>

<span>So what you're going to do when you have <a data-name=""Benghalances of the Samsaric Cycle"">Benghalances of the Samsaric Cycle</a> and a <a data-name=""Sunavalon Dryas"">Sunavalon Dryas</a> is when your opponent summons a monster you're going to return it to hand take its atk in damage and sp a <a data-name=""Sunvine Thrasher"">Sunvine Thrasher</a> and regain the damage you took by using <a data-name=""Sunavalon Dryas"">Sunavalon Dryas</a> effect. The link 2 and 3 do the same thing but can do it more times.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Overall this deck is fun to play and very powerful being able to control the damage you take and turn it into a benefit.¬†</span>

&nbsp;

<span>(Dueling Nexus does have some issues with the cards.)</span>

If your opponent hasn't already conceded from boredom, you'll have an end board of Calamaties, Borreload Savage (3), and a 6k beater in Assault Blackwing - Onimaru. The warrior package is for Aqua Dolphin to combat hand traps.

Soft garnets are Megaliths, Deskbot 001 and equips that return themselves to deck. The hard garnet is Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing, also you can't go off with both Nabla's or two Karakuri's in hand. You'll need Plaguespreader to send these back into the deck to go full combo. You can use Armageddon Knight (summon with Isolde) to toss Plaguespreader Zombie and stuff back any garnets you may have drawn.

98% of the time you are good to go. This is still in testing, feel free to switch it up as you feel necessary.

Per usual, always conduct Dogmatika plays after plans of summoning from the extra deck. AA-Zeus comes out quite frequently in this build, due to the ease of Rank 8s. Necroface recycles all the Eldlich traps, and Chaos Creator recycles Necroface. Fallen of Albaz is added for flavor points and for easily dealing with Dragoon. There are 2 required normal summons (Necroface and Fallen), with up to 5 normal summons if you choose to include Ecclesia. 8 hand traps are included, but you can easily take out the ""Chaos package"" of Fallen of Albaz, Necroface, Chaos Creator, and Chaos Emperor to bring that number up to 11, in addition to adding a Kaiju or another tech option. The goal with this deck is to slow your down and then OTK with Liebe or Dogmatika."

(Rough draft! Criticism needed!)","OK, I know I'm late as f**k, but I got DOOM Eternal this month, and I absolutely love the game! So for my final deck profile of 2020, I made this go-second Burning Abyss build named after the most famous song in the game's soundtrack! 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As I just said, this is a Burning Abyss deck meant to go second every single game. I'm not sure how to improve the deck, but I'm gonna give you the run down on its strategy.

&nbsp;

The goal is to summon Dante--ideally while you also control Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss. When you attack with Dante, then you summon Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder, who is basically the BFG-9000 of Yu-Gi-Oh! AA-ZEUS by itself is broken. Sending Burning Abyss monsters to the graveyard to activate its nuke effect is OP, especially since you can send Scarm to the Graveyard to search a Tour Guide, or Dante to add Cir to the hand.

&nbsp;

And to make matters worse, if this thing is in a zone that Cherubini points to, it can't be destroyed by card effects!

&nbsp;

Now, an indestructible AA-ZEUS isn't this card's only strategy. If you're able to OTK, you can make Borrelsword Dragon or Accesscode Talker. As an alternative, you can link summon Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax with I:P Masquerena to make a near-unkillable boss monster!"

Sprigguns lacks consistency and starters, but the Machina mini engine fits perfectly here.

It provides easy access to a rank 4 and a level 8 monster that can loop a lvl 4. Springguns also lacks a good normal summon, and you can use Machina Gearframe in this case (ally birdman can turn into lavalval salamander, or be used to loop the Machina Gearframe if you get ash'ed).

Credits for the machina engine:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxBEw9L2gMc

The ratios for the main monsters are calculated to achieve better opening hands, with at least:
<ul>
 	<li>A way to activate Vast Desert Gold Golgonda</li>
 	<li>Any other Springguns card, but monsters are prefered here</li>
</ul>
The handtraps are a cheap way to achieve a minimun protection, that the deck also lacks.

Your standart combo would be a rank 4(either Gear Giant X, Dugares or Sprigguns Merry Maker), and from there you can ramp things.

For the extra deck choices:
<ul>
 	<li>Lavalval Salamander and Dugares are your ways of unbricking if anything ever goes wrong(Basically, every single sprigguns monster is a Garnet in essence)</li>
 	<li>You can use Vespenate to remove Sprigguns Merry Maker from your field, in order to use the field spell effect again in a third turn scenario;</li>
 	<li>Barricadeborg can retrieve your field spell and protect it;</li>
 	<li>Knightmare Phoenix to remove backrow;</li>
 	<li>Gear Giant X can search for Springgus monsters, usually you want Brothers or Pede, and a Rocky in your Graveyard.</li>
 	<li>Number 38 and Borreload are your go to monsters if you need to protect yourself or remove a annoying monster;</li>
 	<li>Dingirsu is the best single xyz monster you can summon for this deck. This card is incredible.</li>
</ul>
The side deck is mostly cards you can possibly use...but arent good.

Bricks not good enough to use in the main deck:
<ul>
 	<li>Supreme Archserpent Golgonda;</li>
 	<li>Gearspring Spirit;</li>
 	<li>Trade-in;</li>
 	<li>Other Sprigguns cards(I'm considering removing Sprigguns Booty as well);</li>
</ul>
Not good enough Starters:
<ul>
 	<li>Planet Pathfinder - Not needed actually;</li>
 	<li>Scrap Recycler - It's Just incompatible, it's also a level 3 EARTH;</li>
 	<li>Foolish Burial - Not needed</li>
 	<li>Monster Express - Just...Bad and slow;</li>
</ul>
Not good enough generic cards and extenders:
<ul>
 	<li>Minerva, The exalted Lightsworn - Can actually work with card trooper and machine duplication in a mill variant I'm working on;</li>
 	<li>Card Trooper - Same as Minerva;</li>
 	<li>Xyz Gift - Situational;</li>
 	<li>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos - Bad summon conditions;</li>
 	<li>Dark Factory of More Production - Good card but too slow. Can make it happen in control variants I guess;</li>
 	<li>Rise to Full Height - Equivalent to using 'threatening roar' - Could be good if you use Psyframe Framelord Omega to loop this card.</li>
</ul>

And also a JoJo reference","This is an Infinitrack deck that's meant to turbo out Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder. And no, this is not a JoJo reference. This deck is a reference TO a JoJo reference! https://ygoprodeck.com/road-roller-da/

&nbsp;

Infinitrack is already an Xyz deck that focuses on going second and attacking with strong monsters. In addition to that, the ""Infinitrack"" Xyz Monsters attach the monsters they destroy by battle as material, and Infinitrack Goliath can attach itself to one of them (Which protects any Machine-type Xyz Monster it's attached to from being destroyed by card effects). So naturally, AA-ZEUS would be a welcome addition to the deck...

&nbsp;

That is, if not for the fact that Infinitrack Brutal Dozer locks you into EARTH Machines if you use its second effect, which makes it one of the most important cards in the archetype. Because of this restriction, I decided to put Brutal Dozer in the Side Deck.

&nbsp;

Anyways, if you manage to get an AA-ZEUS that has Infinitrack Goliath attached as material, you get a 3K beatstick that can nuke the field, and can't be destroyed by effects. And the fact that you can banish Infinitrack Tunneler or Trencher from your Graveyard to either revive an Infinitrack or draw 2 cards makes AA-ZEUS even better for the deck!

&nbsp;

Finally, if you put Brutal Dozer in the Main Deck, make sure to put the 3 copies of Electro-Magnetic Railgun there too. Since Brutal Dozer stops you from summoning AA-ZEUS, you can use Railgun to tribute one of your Machine monsters and destroy 1 card on the field for every 1000 ATK that monster had."

1. Needelfiber-Auroradon Combo, searching 3-4 Ritual Monsters/Spells and setting up a Nekroz of Unicore protected by Valkyrus and Trishula in Hand and preparing follow-up plays for turn 2. (Full Combo below)

2. Vanity's Ruler Combo, searching Cyber Angel Benten, Evigishki Gustkraken and Gishki Aquamirror with Preparation of Rites, the Impcantation engine and Extra-Foolish Burial, then ritual summoning Gustkraken, hand-looping for one, searching Vanity's Ruler by the effect of the Benten tributed to summon Gustkraken and then tribute summoning the Vanity's Ruler over Gustkraken and any available Impcantation monster, making the opponent unable to special summon without affecting you and therefore allowint follow up plays.

&nbsp;

I've opted to not play any Handtraps as this Deck seems to start bricking very fast when you start to play non-engine cards, but I suppose you could leave out the Gishki package and the Vanity's Ruler package to atleast allow for 4 Handtraps, either 2 Ash 2 Skull Meister or The Psy-Frame package (which here would probably be used more frequently to negate the activation of an Ash to respond to an Impcantation Monster, Preparation of Rites or Extra-Foolish Burial than as an actual Hand-Trap, but that also allows you to play Psy-Frame-Lord Omega to loop an additional card out of your opponents Hand, I would then exchange the Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon for Omega) However I recommend no Handtraps.

&nbsp;

The Needlefiber-Combo goes as follows:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† (I will explain the abbreviations below)

NS DB3, SS DB1, LS Needlefiber, SS DB1, LS Auroradon, SS 3 Tokens, SS both DB1 from grave with their own effect, synchro summon a HAL and Crystron Quandrax with a DB1 and a token each, XYZ Cowboy, detach HAL, burn for 800, search a Ritual Monster/Spell, use Auroradon to tribute the Cowboy and the remaining token, SS Coltwing from Deck, SS two Tokens by Coltwings effect, SS both DB1 from grave by their own effect, synchro summon two HAL, XYZ Dugares, Dugares effect, detach both HAL and SS the HAL that you detatched off Cowboy earlier, search two Ritual Monsters/Spells, set up your board as you like, you could use your remaining HAL either as a negate or as tribute for a Nekroz of Unicore to search your fourth Ritual Monster/Spell. Going Second you could use thr remaining HAL and the Coltwing that should still be on board to go into Number 27, if you manage to dismantle your opponents board and proceed to BP, you will only need to do 5200 damage if you can destroy an opponents monster with Number 27, as that will allow you to go into Gustav MAX afterwards to burn for 2000 and close out the game, as your opponent will have taken 800 by Cowboy's effect already.

NS = Normal Summon

SS = Special Summon

LS = Link Summon

XYZ = XYZ Summon

HAL = Herald of Arc Light

DB3 = Deskbot 003

DB1 = Deskbot 001

BP = Battle Phase

&nbsp;

The Side Deck focuses on improving the Going-Second capacities of the deck with Dark Ruler No More! as a blowout and Kaijus; Pankratops and Mind Control as spot removal.

3 Cosmic Cyclone and Red Reboot for Backrow-Hate.

3 Different Dimension Ground for Graveyard¬† Hate.

Hope your opponent doesn't ash you first/second turn (hint: he can't if you use Unveiling to Special Summon your minions) and then set up your board with the cards you drew.

The Bamboo Engine + Rella is there to help you draw and Cursed works really well with the Witchcrafters cause you discard it for cost and add one bamboo card from your deck.

Let me know what you think

Fixed the Extra Deck, added <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> in the Side, if you already have it it's a free +2, I chose not to play it for budget reasons."

The new Bujin gives recovery and follow-up play, while the new Tri-Brigade link 2 give","https://youtu.be/AFmuibvmVCA

New cards, new deck. Tri-Brigade is known for its spam ability but negas so hard that it can barely climb the top spot. With the new Bujin, it cover the negs while giving higher ceiling and recursion thanks to Torifune and Rescue Rabbit for easy Amaterasu that can summon/add from banished pile. The new Tri-Brigade link 2 Bearbloom further adds power to this deck, it searches Revolt that can summon Shuraig during opponent's turn for more interruption (Bujin makes the fodders possible, Revolt can summon Nervall as material for more recovery too). Combo is in the video, I will explain card by card.

Bujin: 3 Torifune, 2 Rescue Rabbit, 1 Unexpected Dai (3 Dai/Rabbit are too much as the Bujin only make Amaterasu pass, Torifune is better than other cus it searches Centipede/Quilin). 3 Hiruko (3 cus we run Rescue Rabbit/Dai). 1 Centipede (pops s/t from gy) and Quilin (bounce face-up card from gy) as Torifune target. 1 Amaterasu (ss during your turn, add during your opponent's turn) and Susanowo (searches Hiruko to make Amaterasu). <strong>We dont run other Bujin as they-re not impactful enough</strong>. Kagutsuchi is generic beast-warrior but our other lv4 is Fraktall, it is better to resolve Fraktall eff than make it rank 4 Bujin. Ahashima only gives s/t pops (Knightmare Phoenix is better) and ss from hand (Ferrijit is better), cant link climb too.

Tri-Brigade: 3 Fraktall, 3 Kerass, 1 One for One, 1 Foolish Burial (best cards, along with One for One cus they accomplish the same). 2 Nervall (Fraktall/One for One/Foolish Burial target). 2 Revolt as it is searchable but kinda bad if drawn multiple cus you want more monster in opening hand as Tri-Brigade fodder, applies to this deck in general that's why we run many monsters.

3 Tenki is a must as Bujin or Fraktall search. 1 Jackalope, Dogman, Thunderbird (draw, Tri-Brigade fodder, free body). The rest is just good staples with synergy, Upstart (digs for starter card, I havent found other draw card that is compatible with this deck), Monster Reborn (re-summon Tri-Brigade for spam/Shuraig trigger), 3 D.D. Crow (good winged-beast handtrap), 2 Alpha the Master of Beasts (great card but dead going first).

Pros: Super consistent, legit board with follow-up, unique combo/control play.

Cons: Interruption sometimes isnt enough for Drytron/Virtual World or other free summon deck."

molten conduction field, rekindling, and boost warrior. and this deck is harder to use now considering the limitation of TG hyper libirian,

many of better decks of this but recently most of those cards are banned so this best i can come up with.

for 1 quasar (easy)

Main goal of the deck is to get 3 cards once at beggning of turn, use molten conduction field to send hand maiden and laval magma cannoner, laval handmaidens effect will trigger then send another handmaiden that handmaidens eff will also trigger sending the last handmaiden, and using that handmaiden send another laval cannoner. then use rekindling able to summon all the monsters you just sent to graveyard. tune handmaiden and the cannoneer for libirain, use its effect to draw. tune another for laval dual slasher ore laval dragon (your choice) and then use libirain eff to draw another, then finnaly¬† use your last card in your hand boost warrior its effect will allow it to special summon when tuner on field. special summon it then tune handmaiden and it for formula synchron. then synchron let you draw and hyper libirain let you draw too also. if you also have a de synchro in hand you can go over and over synchro summoning formula getting alot of draws. then tune synchron, and the 2 level 5s and get your quasar!

for 2 quasar (difficult)

really some of this depends on luck, once you have formula out with the rest (use same straegy as last time) use de synchro as many times to summon formula allowing you to draw 2 each time formula is summoned. once that happens get your quasar, and hope to got you drew another copie of rekindiling out of those 6 draws. use rekindling to summon all same monsters, this time any level 5 laval monster will work. tune those for a easy 2nd quasar.

The strategy is summon your extra deck Monsters as fast as possible, If you fusion summon Sunrise with a light monster as a material, you can bring The Shinning to the field immediately, thanks to Sunrise's effect.

Traps are the most loose thing in this deck, so you can remove them entirely if you feel like it.

The goal of this deck is to go first, and lock your opponent out of the graveyard and special summoning anything with Necrovalley and Hidden Temples of Necrovalley. To achieve this, the aim on the first turn is to turbo out a Necrovalley and the main boss monster, Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist, and then use Supernaturalist's effect to add Hidden Temples to your hand during the end phase. The rest of this deck is built around helping this combo achieve consistency and increasing special summoning power. Supernaturalist, when summoned, will usually have about 3200 attack, protects your Necrovalley from destruction which eliminates the need for Gravekeeper's Shaman, can search any Gravekeeper's and Necrovalley spell and trap, and is immune to destruction, making it hard to beat over when your opponent is locked out of special summoning. This deck avoids using the outdated flip effect Gravekeeper's, as they are too slow to compete in the modern meta. The rest of the summary will discuss the purpose of each card and its uses.

<strong>Main Deck Monsters:</strong>

<em>Gravekeeper's Spiritualist:</em> The deck's fusion card, which saves you from needing fusion spells. The goal is to add her and Necrovalley to your hand first turn with the deck's large amount of search power, summon her and use her and another Gravekeeper's in your hand as fusion material. The downsides are she must be on the field to use her, and is vulnerable to Effect Veiler and Impermanence. Also, you need a Necrovalley on the field first in order to fusion with her, but you can use Gravekeeper's Priestess in place of Necrovalley as well.

<em>Gravekeeper's Priestess: </em>These two are mainly here to increase the consistency of using Spiritualist's effect first turn. In case you can't get a Necrovalley, use her in place of it and special summon Spiritualist to use her fusion effect. The attack boost is not important, but sometimes helps.

<em>Gravekeeper's Headman: </em>When normal or special summoned can revive any level 4 Gravekeeper's, not negated by Necrovalley. Can use with Descendant to pop an opponent's card, Spiritualist to perform another fusion, or Commandant just as fusion or XYZ fodder or a beatstick. Use to extend combos basically.

<em>Gravekeeper's Descendant: </em>The deck's main form of spell/trap or monster removal. Requires a tribute, but you can turn this into a free monster search if you tribute Recruiter, which does not miss timing. It's important to note that this is not once per turn. Then works well for fusion and XYZ fodder.

<em>Gravekeeper's Recruiter: </em>When sent from the field to the graveyard in any way, gives you a free search of any other Gravekeeper's, of which you'd usually want to add Spiritualist. It's important to note that this card does not miss timing on any of the cards in this deck you could combo with it and isn't once per turn, so feel free to exploit it to your heart's content.

<em>Gravekeeper's Commandant</em>: A free unlimited Terraforming that can also double as a monster for any fusion or XYZ plays.

<em>Gravekeeper's Chief: </em>Works well with Transmodify when tributing any of your level 4 monsters, but when used in this way doesn't gain its tribute summon effect. When tribute summoned revives any of your Gravekeeper's in the graveyard, including Supernaturalist. He also negates the effect of Necrovalley for your graveyard only, letting you use Dark Magic Veil on any of your monsters in the graveyard. He has good, but very situational uses, which is why I have him at only one copy.

<em>Summoner Monk:</em> Is both dark and spellcaster, the same as Gravekeeper's monsters, letting this card benefit from Dark Magic Veil, Magician's Circle, and Transmodify. It's important effect, the special summon, is only a soft once per turn, so you can use multiple copies on the field, it works whether it is normal or special summoned, and can even search another copy of itself out if desired. You can discard a spell you don't need to special summon any level 4 from your deck, of which the best target for is most often Spiritualist to fusion summon Supernaturalist. You can also use this one card for a free XYZ summon of any rank four, as overlaying does not count as tributing the card. However, it cannot be used as fusion material for Supernaturalist. Overall a very versatile card in Gravekeeper's.

<strong>Extra Deck Monsters:</strong>

<em>Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist: </em>The main boss monster of the deck. When fusion summoned and with Necrovalley, has a minimum of 3200 attack. With Necrovalley on the field both Necrovalley and Supernaturalist are immune to destruction effects, which is why Gravekeeper's Shaman isn't included in this deck, as Supernaturalist does what she does but better. Its search effect happens during the end phase, but remember to activate it during your main phase. With it, you can search any Gravekeeper's or Necrovalley spell or trap. The goal is to get this card out first turn, and then search Hidden Temples of Necrovalley if you didn't hard draw it.

<em>Number 101: Silent Honor ARK: </em>Functions as a situational option for removing a problem monster without destroying it. Can then use that monster as material to save itself from destruction.

<em>Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer: </em>Similar to Silent Honor ARK, this card can bounce any face up card, including spells and traps, back into the deck. Is also here for its situational uses.

<em>Quintet Magician: </em>It should not be a goal of this deck to summon this card, but it's here as a very powerful situational option that can win the game on its own, if you happen to be able to go into it.

<strong>Spell Cards:</strong>

<em>Necrovalley</em>: The main spell card of the deck, used to make almost all its plays. The attack increase is good, but its main purposes are to enable your card effects such as Spiritualist and Hidden Temples, and to lock your opponent out of moving any cards any their graveyard while you retain full access to yours. You want this card in your hand first turn.

<em>Hidden Temples of Necrovalley</em>: The second most important spell card, this card locks both players out of all special summoning, except Gravekeeper's. Keep in mind this restricts you from XYZ summoning or special summoning Summoner Monk. Is a very good card to hard draw first turn, but is mainly added to the hand with Supernaturalist.

<em>Throne of Necrovalley:</em> Is a very good searcher for any Gravekeeper's, of which you could use it to add a Commandant to your hand to then use its effect to get a Necrovalley, search Spiritualist for a fusion summon, or even Headman or Chief for a special summon from the graveyard. Instead, can also be used for an extra normal summon of a Gravekeeper's to extend combo plays, making this the most versatile option in the deck.

<em>Dark Magic Veil: </em>Is an amazing special summon of any monster in this deck from your hand or graveyard, for barely any cost, and is not once per turn. Keep in mind however, that if you have Necrovalley on the field and don't have Chief on the field, you can only use this to special summon from the hand, but even then this card is still very useful.

<em>Transmodify: </em>Is very versatile in this deck, mainly to turn any level 3 on the field into any level 4 from the deck, as all monsters in this deck are the same type and attribute. You'd mostly want to summon Spiritualist with this card. Also works very well with Recruiter for a free search to turn its cost into a benefit, and does not miss timing. You could also use it on a level 4 to bring out Chief from the deck to use Dark Magic Veil on monsters in the graveyard. However, it is reliant on having a level 3 on the field, so I have it at two copies, but I could see someone wanting to play it at three.

<em>Terraforming: </em>Free search for Necrovalley. Is limited to one copy on the ban list.

<strong>Trap Cards:</strong>

<em>Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley: </em>A powerful omni-negate and destroy of any card effect, if you have Necrovalley and a Gravekeeper's on the field. However, as a trap card and with the limitations it has, it can be a bit slow, so feel free to slot in hand traps like Nibiru, Ash Blossom, Effect Veiler, or Infinite Impermanence if you want to, but this card is a cheap and still pretty good alternative to those.

<em>Magician's Circle: </em>A free special summon of literally any monster in your deck if a spellcaster on the field declares an attack. While this effect is almost broken, it can backfire if your opponent runs any spellcasters, so you could also side deck this card and run something like the hand traps listed above or another Transmodify if you want.

<strong>Conclusion:</strong> Gravekeeper's are a good anti-meta deck that can go against even strong meta decks, but they are reliant on establishing their field before your opponent can, otherwise the swarm abilities and negates of meta decks will be too much to handle. However, this is a cheap and easy to play deck that is great for anyone looking to get into Yu-Gi-Oh and start winning games."

Originally, ""Gladiator Beasts"" were a battle-focussed archetype with a unique gimmick which is referred to as ""taging out"", in which a ""Gladiator Beast"" monster could shuffle itself into the deck after being part of a battle and summon another ""Gladiator Beast"" from the deck which would then activate some sort of effect. They still have this ability and work with it, but the more modern support also gave them ways to tag without even attempting a battle while providing the deck with various other cards and strategies to make use off.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Normal Monster in the archetype in form of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andal"">Gladiator Beast Andal</a>"" is absolutely crucial. Unlike various other archetypes that have Normal Monsters in their ranks, ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andal"">Gladiator Beast Andal</a>"" is a solid beater, can be used for various other summons in the deck and is a consistent Special Summon to use via ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>"".</p>
<p>The Effect ""Gladiator Beast"" Monsters I run are one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attorix"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a>"", both for the graveyard setup as well as her ability to change her level in order to be used for certain Fusion monsters, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Bestiari"">Gladiator Beast Bestiari</a>"" for his backrow removal effect and because he is of paramount importance to summon ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a>"" from the Extra Deck, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Equeste"">Gladiator Beast Equeste</a>"" for the very useful ability of recycling ""Gladiator Beast"" Spells, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Darius"">Gladiator Beast Darius</a>"" for an in-archetypal ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"", one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Noxious"">Gladiator Beast Noxious</a>"" for yet more graveyard setup, the effect of preventing one attack with the added bonus of being able to tag during the opposing turn, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Vespasius"">Gladiator Beast Vespasius</a>"" as more high-level Fusion material that can Special Summon itself and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Augustus"">Gladiator Beast Augustus</a>"" for yet more high-level monster for the Extra Deck summons with the added bonus of being able to swarming the field with ""Gladiator Beasts"" and also triggering their effects since they still get summoned correctly. The generic monster options aside from ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"" are three copies of ""<a data-name=""Test Tiger"">Test Tiger</a>"", which are more swarming and allow more hands you draw to go into ""<a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a>"" and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"" for interruption that you can and should absolutely afford to play.</p>
<p>The backrow has three ""<a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>"" for ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andal"">Gladiator Beast Andal</a>"", three ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast's Comeback"">Gladiator Beast's Comeback</a>"" for various reasons but mostly as a play extender, three copies of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Proving Ground"">Gladiator Proving Ground</a>"" as the ""<a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>"" for ""Gladiator Beasts"", one ""<a data-name=""Mind Control"">Mind Control</a>"" to clear monsters off the opposing field while also gaining material for ""<a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a>"" to make ""Gladiator Beast"" monster available again which allows you to activate cards like ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>"" again, one ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast United"">Gladiator Beast United</a>"" to surprise opponents during the Battle Phase by summoning monsters such as ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a>"", three copies of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Rejection"">Gladiator Rejection</a>"" as a useful summoning tool and a way to give your monsters targeting protection, one ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Charge"">Gladiator Beast Charge</a>"" as a board clear, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast War Chariot"">Gladiator Beast War Chariot</a>"" as a searchable anti-monster effect Counter Trap and lastly one ""<a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a>"" for the well-known ""Utopia Double"" engine.</p>
<p>In terms of the Extra Deck ""Gladiator Beasts"" actually use quite a lot of the options they have at their disposal. ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Essedarii"">Gladiator Beast Essedarii</a>"" is only in the Extra Deck to have access to another Level 5 ""Gladiator Beast"" monster if I have enough option in the Level 4 segment but cannot go any higher with the available cards. The aforementioned high-level ""Gladiator Beasts"" are absolutely necessary as you pretty much always want to summon ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a>"", who pretty much summons Extra Deck monsters for free and therefore really pays for himself. Options to summon via ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a>"" include ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"">Gladiator Beast Heraklinos</a>"" for as many Spell/Trap negates as you want as long as you can pay for it by discarding cards from your hand, or ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a>"" who comes with 3500 ATK, can negate a monster effect per turn and lets you choose what the opponent has to attack. Equally as important in the Extra Deck is the aforementioned ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a>"", who gets rid of two opposing cards when summoned. Constantly resummoning ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a>"" is something that is relatively easy in this deck and can clear the field while you are still setting up for an OTK scenario. The main play enabler is ""<a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a>"", who is summonable with two monsters of which thankfully only one needs to be a ""Gladiator Beast"" monster, and it fetches ""Gladiator Beast"" cards on summon while also allowing to ""tag out"" without the need of an attack. The rest is pretty straightforward: I run the two cards necessary for the ""Utopia Double"" engine, one ""<a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>"" since it supports the beatdown strategy really well, ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" against opposing backrow, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Dragases"">Gladiator Beast Dragases</a>"" for the rare scenarios in which he is a better choice than ""<a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>"" to make the best out of two copies of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andal"">Gladiator Beast Andal</a>"" in your starting hand.</p>
<p>I only started writing about ""Gladiator Beasts"" after a friend of mine asked me to help him build a deck with them, but after I was finished going through them all I had to admit that they are an interesting bunch of cards to work with. I feel like they run out of resources rather quickly but they do perform quite well with some explosive plays while also staying true to their archetype's identity.

<span>Hello and welcome to my Virtual World Build! This new deck that I made does not require the new trap gate to be nibiru proof, this new card is like the icing on the cake. It is very easy to achieve and here‚Äôs what you need to do it and what you get when you do it -¬†</span>

&nbsp;

<b>What you need -</b>

&nbsp;

<b>Lulu/Lili + Kawaloon + any 1 VW monster except Nyannyan</b>

&nbsp;

<b>What you end on -¬†</b>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>The entire thing is Nibiru proof (Gossip shadow)</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1"">VFD (Free win - no monster effects on the field for opponent)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1"">Number 75: Gossip Shadow (negate if you haven‚Äôt used it already on nibiru)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1"">Geomathmech Final Sigma (great against control decks, OTK card for next turn, unaffected by other cards, is a 3k beat stick that does double damage while on the extra monster zone)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1"">Virtual world gate: Chuche (shuffle 2 VW cards from banish zone into deck to pop 1 during opponent‚Äôs turn)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span>Virtual world is a Tier 1 competition of the current metagame and took - 1st LCS 8, 2nd LCS 8 and 1st LCS 9. The deck is very powerful being able to being able to turbo out True King of all Calamities very consistently, end on zeus with 4 materials at the worst case, be nibiru proof (number 75), Have multiple sources of removal (Utopia Beyond to counter Dragoon, Jaja, Break Sword, Constellar M7) and have a level 9 synchro monster on the field that if sent to the graveyard off of true king or simply just sent there - can recur itself back and is literally a Macros Cosmos (any card sent from the field to the graveyard is banished instead). This is all as of now and it gets better. There is new support of this deck that makes the deck more consistent and even better! The combos also end on a much higher note! The 2 new cards coming are Virtual world Rabbit - Tutu and Virtual World Gate - Zhuangwoo. Tutu is trash so this deck does not run it but Zhuangwoo is actually really good. You never really want to set it because it‚Äôs field effect is really bad. It is only good because of it‚Äôs monster reborn effect you can activate by banishing it from the graveyard. If you draw it you can simply discard it to resolve Qinglong so it is not a brick. It can extend the combo and also serve as an extender paired up with Foolish Burial goods!¬†</span>

&nbsp;

<span>If you want to learn how to do this combo, I highly recommend watching my Youtube video - in it I explain the entire deck in-depth and all of my card choices and also tell you how to do the combo. In this video I only do the Nibiru proof combo so if you want to learn how to do the ‚Äònormal‚Äô combos as well check out my other video! I also have a 1st Place LCS 8 Virtual world deck video if you are interested in that. Also consider answering the poll question down below! Today‚Äôs poll question is: What are your favorite decks of all time, and what is your favorite archetype/card?</span>

(Also, am I the only one who gets gundam vibes from AA-ZEUS's artwork?)","

...Alright so...here is my first Galaxy/Photon deck, revolving around Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Ex Dragon. I'm very much new to that archetype, in terms of playing it. Up until now, I've only played against it. Because of that, some advice on how to improve this deck would be GREATLY appreciated.

&nbsp;

Anyways, this deck's main goal is to go second because of Cipher Ex Dragon's first effect, which lets you detach two Xyz Materials from it to make your LIGHT monsters untargetable until the end of your opponent's turn. Basically, your strategy is to summon Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon (without using its effect), then summon Cipher Ex Dragon with it and use that effect. Then you attack with your Xyz monsters, and use Cipher Ex Dragon to summon AA-ZEUS during your Main Phase 2. And because AA-ZEUS is a LIGHT monster, your opponent can't target it with any card effects until their turn is over.

&nbsp;

The end result of this strategy is that your opponent will be left to deal with an untargetable, 3000 ATK beatstick that can nuke the field. And if Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon is detached to activate AA-ZEUS's effect, Afterglow Dragon can either use its second effect to attach a Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon from the hand or Deck to ZEUS so that it can activate its effect again. Alternatively, Afterglow Dragon's effect can summon it to your field so that you can deal at least 6000 battle damage on your next turn.

&nbsp;

So, the Ace Monsters of this deck are Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon, Photon Dragon, Cipher Ex Dragon, and AA-ZEUS.

Because of this deck's primary goal, and AA-ZEUS's appearance, this deck is named ""Galaxy Gundam."""

This is mostly self-explanatory but in case you aren't aware

-Get vennominon out, using some tributes

-Hope you get rise of the snake deity out in time

- Use a dark hole to destroy le vennominon

- Don't brick, good luck

Waking the dragons there because people who know you're playing this will mindlessly try to shred backrow, punish this.

-Always try to get a vennominon in the grave off first snake rain, just in case.

Don't lose lol."

You don't need to run tribute it makes it a lot more budget if you don't he allows for the 1 card combo but he's not necessary it's a good deck even without him. You can switch out the three real traps for hand traps and I prefer to keep the deck around 40-45 cards for constancy purposes so if you choose not to run tribute for budget reasons I suggest running handtraps like in my side or adding kaijus or even a feather duster if you have it for back row removal but that's what twin twist is there for or satellite falcon. I hope you have fun with it and let me know how you do by tagging @precisionxdualists or dm'ing us on instagram

This deck is more of a Pure Build of Neos but with a Single card being Neo Space Connector can lead to Setup Mystic Mine.

Neo Space Connector - NS Aqua Dolphin - Isolde(use effect to add either E HERO Neos or Neo Space Connector) - Infernoble Knight Renaud(SS from Isolde) - Favorite Hero(to hand) - Link to Predaplant Verte Anaconda(use effect to activate Neos Fusion to summon Brave Neos or Rainbow Neos it depends on which one you need)

If your opening hand with Neo Space Connector and Miracle Contact you can lead to an OTK using the steps above but add E HERO Neos to hand if you dont already to setup Elemental HERO Brave Neos equipped with Favorite Hero Rainbow Neos and Verte Anaconda tribute Verte with Rainbow Neos effect wipe your opponents monsters and activate Neo Space from deck using Favorite Hero both your remaining monsters will have at least 5000 ATK each with no monsters on your opponents field. This combo is pulled off by only using 2 cards and you still have 4 other cards"

Thunder Nyan-Nyan and Thunder King Rai-Oh are good LV 4 beatsticks; Denko Sekka has a great effect that will not affect you since there are only continuous spells here.

Solidarity + Luminous Spark gives a nice 1300 ATK boost.

Some Summer Summoner is more of a filler; Play Lightning Rod Lord/Royal Decree if you are against a spell/trap heavy deck."
