Pure Altergeist 2020","Yo guys, I'm back! I know I've been gone a long time but its been because of school, covid and just other things going on in my life. No I did not get covid, but we had to go to my other house temporarily because it was bad where I live. But anyways, to start things back off I want to introduce you guys to my newest Altergetist build with Altergeist <a data-name=""Multifaker"">Multifaker</a> at 3. The deck is back at full power and I think its insane especially with Meluseek being a water attribute because you can use him and another other monster to make Eria, The Water Charmer and using her effect to steal your opponent's Crystron Halqifibrax which can lead to other combos like Ningrisu or Accesscode Talker. You can also do Almiraj (can be summoned off Meluseek being normal summoned) plus any other monster to make Hiita. Evenly Matched in the main deck is actually really amazing as well. Going second it allows you to break your opponent's board and then setup yours so that they surrender during the following turn since they won't have anymore resources. I don't really have anything else to say about this deck. Its consistent and I have tested it just like I do all my other decks for you guys. Enjoy and stay tuned for more!"

As many 1 card starters as possible, with good back-up plans.","Hi, welcome to the deck! The main goal is to make True King of All Calamaties off of easy 1 card combos. The rest of the deck are basically bricks that facilitate these combos.

Jet Synchron is full combo, pitching a card. Tuning finds you jet synchron, might mill Token Collector, Citadel, or Jinzo. One For One is the full combo without using your normal summon, allowing you to use any extender to Scrap combo off first, before Auroradon. It can pitch Jinzo, Citadel, or Token Collector for profit. Scrap Recycler are more routes into Needlefibre through Jet, and are also great follow-up plays, for routes to OTK and/or break boards. Its a nonbo with the field spell, since it will miss timing. Deskbot 003 is the best of these starters, since you don't have to pitch a card and can stock the GY up with an extra Jet for later use, such as to pitch a Jinzo you drew late into the turn. Urgent Schedule is a ""starter"" going second. You can OTK, pop backrow, wipe monsters, and even set up Halqifibrax through this card. Thanks to the field spell you can even use this card going first (though generally you won't be able to link with it afterward). Machina Citadel are to special summon off of Urgent Schedule, and you can loop them by stacking a back-up in your GY. Jinzo is a one of - it has 2400 ATK points, so it's easy to res with the field spell, and shuts down Imperm and Evenly. That's it. Foolish Burial is an extra copy that works as an extender in bad hands. Black Garden is nuts in this deck, being able to turn on Urgent Schedule for free turn 1 enables truly broken stuff, if we so choose we can clog up people's zones and slow the game down, so it's nice on its own with some of our solid hand traps. 2 each of 001, O-Lion, and Scrap Golem makes sense to me - you could cut down to 1 Golem and be happy, but it's nice to know your combo will work even if you see 1 brick, and there are unusual circumstances where using one of these as a normal summon still combos off. Pot of Avarice is a spot of card advantage, coupled with the ability to recycle combo pieces. It's really that simple, if the deck gets interrupted I want to have a second chance with the game. Gizmek Uka makes a lot of sense in the deck. It's a free special summon that locks people out of their extra deck for playing Needlefibre in a meta where every deck is Needlefibre. Eria the Water Charmer Gentle makes this a very high impact hand trap. All of our hand traps help make our board, while being as impactful against the current meta as possible and playing through Called.

Gizmek Orochi is back. This lets you make Apollousa with 4 negates without using up your synchro cards, for those games where you get Black Garden + Urgent Schedule or One for One + Scrap Recycler. It is also a free(ish) extender and a Gizmek Uka target that you can use to make Uka into an insane extender once you get your Black Garden.

Herald and Borreload Savage are things you can make with Gizmek Uka and Scrap Recycler or 003. This also gives you an alternative line of play with Urgent Schedule going first, and gives us a second combo after the first for 3 read em 3 lines of play. (4 if you count Eria). This means only running Accesscode for our Scrap Wyvern, but honestly, this is fine. I'll miss Borrelsword, but Accesscode does a good impression and also plays out of the Eria line.

I hate going down Auroradon, but I can recycle one copy with Avarice, and I can make Herald in other ways, so I'm running Herald as well.

I cut the copies of tuning in order to run Phantazmay. This increases our chances of seeing high impact spell cards, and doubles as a target to special summon with Black Garden."

This is good, because I want to eat combo.","Latest version. Running the Uka package, because ironically in a Needlefibre world it is simultaneously generic and high impact. This leaves room for 12 total hand traps, and has a lot of bricks. On the other hand, the deck's grind game is pretty good for a synchro variant, it can slow a game right down, and capitalize by winning in an instant.

The extra deck is the Calamities + Pot of Greed combo, or the 2 negate combo as a back-up/follow up.

I like One For One. Very often you see it with Golden Lord (when you do see it) and so long as you have a hand trap its a 7th way into the combo. The deck doesn't really care that it doesn't use the normal summon, but it still seems worth it.

Nibiru is the other high impact hand trap that might still stop a turn, and basically lets me win the game, sometimes. Also, it combines with other hand traps very nicely against Adamancipator. Imperm is obligatory in Eldlich, it's a good generic trap that negates and activates from the hand, I think this deck will always run Imperm first.

I want to be back on 3 of each Golden Land trap. It gives the deck a better grind game, and increases the odds of seeing them just enough."

Formud Skipper ties them together making it the best starter for OTK with 1 other Mathmech monster in hand just like regular Mathmech play, but the difference here we can summon Sky Striker with Formud along the way. Not only that, just like Salamangreat, now Sky Striker is able to OTK with Accesscode/Updater Jammer with the same starter above!

The combo needs <strong>Formud + Mathmech</strong> monster, so we play 3 Cynet Mining and One for One. Other way is 3 cards, Parallel Exceed + Mathmech + Sky Striker (Raye/Roze/Hornet). The Formud OTK combo is we use Formud copy Zeke, ss Kaina, use Formud chain Kaina (chainblock Ash, vice versa depends on you), add Parallel Exceed, ss Hayate use Exceed, ss another Exceed from deck, make Primathmech Alembertian add 1 other different Mathmech monster, use Alembertian tribute Hayate ss Mathmech (other than Sigma cus it can ss itself), ss Sigma. From here you can either make Final Sigma or Accesscode route. If youre making Final Sigma, ss it on extra zone, use Multiplication doubles its attack and swing for game.

The Accesscode route, you make Splash Mage with Alembertian + non-Multiplication, use Splash Mage ss lv4 Mathmech from GY, make Accesscode with Splash Mage and 2 mats (including Multiplication), use Multiplication and chain Accesscode. Now we have 8.6K Accesscode with bunch of different attribute link monsters in GY (3 at minimum, Kaina, Hayate, and Splash Mage).

Mathmech lineup: 3 Sigma, 3 Nabla, 1 Multiplication (searchable by Nabla and Alembertian, not a tuner means ded if we play multiple), 1 Equation (extender).

Sky Striker lineup: 2 Raye (2 cus it's not our main normal summon and we dont run Area Zero), 1 Roze (extender), 2 Afterburners, 2 Widow Anchor, 1 Hornet Drones. We dont run Area Zero/Multirole as we only play minimal Sky Striker cards, it means we grind only with Raye, Hayate+Kagari, or Shizuku.

The rest of the main deck is just typical go second cards. It's hard on TCG cus no Crossout to prevent Nibiru.

Extra deck is self-explanatory. Trisbaena is there cus we can trigger it by using Splash Mage to reborn Formud then Linkuriboh on Trisbaena zone, super useful against Eldlich/Dragma or after we use Red Reboot but cant OTK.

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/VsFRdxd.png"" alt=""image"" />

Pros: Consistent OTK and we play Sky Striker if we failed to OTK anyway, and lots of staple space.

Cons: Going first is bad, we play bootlegged Sky Striker, and going second against meta is really dependent on the staples you draw.

Has countermeasures to most meta decks (comes with video).,"Video for some of the combos:



From what I've experienced, it's impossible to be consistent with Dark Magician Deck regardless of how many draw engines you add to it. The reason for this is because of the number of cards that can be potential bricks if other cards are still inside the deck, not the actual draw power of the deck itself per se.

Therefore, I did not add spellbook engine because it requires a normal summon, which conflicts with Rod (and having 3 in your deck), and since you can retrieve rod with Soul Servant, it shouldn't be too difficult with an average hand. Your normal summon is VERY important, using it for draws is the same thing as giving up this turn. You can quickly accumulate draw power using Dark Magician Fusions and Magicians' Souls, with a bit of luck you can EASY pull out 10+ cards from the deck. Draw power is not Dark Magician's real issue, reliance on a good starting hand is. It sounds counter intuitive but it's not as much as you think. Basically, for Dark Magicians, making sure that your starting hand can start in a way by having more card interactions is more important than drawing more cards. For example, using metafoes fusion results a deck shuffle, so you're getting a random deck. But using cchicken race or upstart goblin over metalfoes fusion,you can pair with magic circle or soul servant and choose what card you draw. As long as you can secure getting rod and souls, you can likely get something that matches situation, preferably a way to either get out Magicians' Souls or the Dark Magicians, which allows you to dump more Soul Servant compatible cards to the graveyard. Not having a once per turn restriction also helps tremendously compared to metafoes fusion.

Your main goal is to dump Mana/Dark Magician/Dark Magician Girl/Mahad to the graveyard, then gaining draws from it.

Rod and Magician's Souls are the main starting point of Dark Magician Deck, therefore it is necessary to max all of them.

Dark Magic Circle is one of the most important card in the deck, and since it can potentially draw a card if it is a Dark Magician spellcard(which is guaranteed used with soul servant), it is recommend to put all three.

Soul Servant is the main method of search your deck, it can search anything DM related in Deck/GY, its only downside is that it can be a brick starting with it turn one, but you can alleviate this by using in combination with Chicken Race or Magician's Souls.

On the other hand, Eternal Soul and Navigation are easily Searchable, so having all 3 is not necessary, especially when they can be bricks when you don't have Dark Magician in GY or in hand. Navigation in particular since you generally only really need to dump 2 monsters at once with Navigation in an entire match for fusion.

1 Mana, you only need one Mana, since you can dump her using magicians' souls (which should be your first priority most of the time when using Magicians' Souls) and you really want her to stay there or on the field, not in your hand or the deck. Mana is very good for deterring your opponent from targeting your monsters, since she is quite pesky in the sense that she can summon Dark Magician Girl from the deck when she is destroyed, in turn giving your +1 draw power from Soul Servant while leaving a monster on field. If Your Magicians' Souls get Effect Veilered, to the very least you can go for Red-Eyes Dragoon using Verte Anaconda using Magicians' Souls and Mana as materials.

&nbsp;

1 Mahad can counter many dark monsters, including Dragoon and Chaos Max Dragon.

2 Eternal Soul is nice to have on hand if you have another card that can get Dark Magician to the GY or hand, but having 3 is more than necessary, especially when it is easily searchable and even retrieve from GY with Soul Servant. Retrieving it using Soul Servant+The Dark Magicians also allows to summon Dark Magician on the same turn, which is very useful.

1 Secrets of Dark Magic is very important for summoning Dragon Knight and The Dark Magicians, but one is enough since it's searchable and generally you'll only use it twice at most, and you can use soul servant to retrieve it from GY as well. If you have Dark Magician Girl if your hand, you can also use her instead of Dark Magician for fusion to get her in the GY, which is very important for Soul Servant.

1 Illusion Magic is used for retrieving Dark Magician to your hand for Fusion/Navigation/Eternal Soul, as well as protecting your monsters from other more harmful effects than being sent to GY.

1 Eye of Timaeus, this card is not searchable but at same time can be bricky when running multiple. Since this Deck already uses Secrets of Dark Magic, you don't really need more than 1.

One Apprentice Illusion Magician, since there's only one Navigation in the Deck, the need to use her to get Dark Magician in hand doesn't come up that often. She can also be special summoned using Navigation, which can you an opportunity to fusion Dragun of Red-Eyes or Dragon Knight when it's your turn.

That sums up the Dark Magician cards.

I used Chicken Race over Upstart Goblin and Metafoes Fusion, mainly because: 1. You do not have a once per turn restriction; 2. You can use Chicken Race to draw a card, then use Magician's Souls to get rid of it to draw another, giving you two cards in the process.

1 Terraforming, since you're already running Chicken Race and Secret Village.

1 Super Polymerization, since it's searchable with Verte Anaconda you don't need that many. Moreover, you can also use this to remove most enemies since Verte can make another monster dark as well.

1 Red-Eyes Fusion and 1 Red-Eyes Black Dragon, because Dragun of Red-Eyes is OP.

Dark Magician Deck is very weak to enemy hand traps, so at least 2 called by the grave is pretty necessary, I feel. The Card <a data-name=""Three Tactical Talents"">Three Tactical Talents</a> will also help tremendously when you're faced with such a situation.

1 <a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spellcasters"">Secret Village of the Spellcasters</a>, though it may be side decked since it's a rather situational and can affect you as well (it will hurt you more than help you against decks like Poltergeist).

handtraps are handtraps. You can change with w/e you like, though some Effect Veiler is recommended because it's a magician monster, which allows you to summon Selene which can summon Spellcasters from graveyard, and can link summon into Accesscode Talk for a whooping 5300atk. You can also use it as The Dark Magicians fusion material, or Illusion magic.

As for Extras:

Dragon Knight: This + Eternal Soul is very powerful against many decks (though it's not infallible such as against Orcust), definitely bring one, though you only need 1 since it counts as Dark Magician and as such can be summoned with Eternal Soul even if it is sent to the GY.

Dragun of Red-Eyes and Verte Anaconda: I don't think I need to say anything how powerful this combo is. Even some Orcust run it nowadays.

Starving Venom Fusion Dragon: Very easy to summon using super poly, especially with superpoly and vertes (which can turn one of the monsters into dark). At minimum it works on any monster that can be targeted and effected, since you can turn it into dark and use verte for the other material.

The Dark magicians: Extremely easy to summon, offers great draw power and can potentially get Dark Magician Girl on field for more Soul Servant draw power. It can also draw a card and set it and use on the same turn, in including Eternal Soul, which goes VERY WELL with cards like soul servant. Use its draw ability wisely every turn, save it until using soul servant and/or dark magic circle

Needlefiber/Selene/Accesscode Talker: Use a card+handtrap to summon it lategame, and you can use it to summon Selene, which can summon Dragun from GY if you need it. Alternatively, you can also use her to summon another Spellcaster then use them to link Summon Accesscode Talker (5300atk+destroying multiple cards without triggering them) to finish the opponent.

Knightmare Phoenix: Link-2 Summon, if the opponent runs Imperial Order this is your way out.

Imduk: Dark Magician can Link summon Imduk, so if you have two Dark Magicians on field or 1 in hand, you can make a Dragon Knight or Dragun. Having two Dark Magician on field is not a difficult task most of the time.

Linkuriboh: Since Linkcross is getting banned in July, it's less useful, but you can still convert Magician Souls into this to minimize damage. It's also necessary for easy summoning of Ningirsu: Normal summon a handtrap → Summon Needlefiber → Search Effect Veiler from Deck → Make Veiler into Linkuriboh → Ningirsu

Galaxy Tomahawk:

This is a a bit long, but basically it's extremely useful for setting up a powerful board with Dark Magician, since it creates tokens to summon link monsters like <a data-name=""Ip"">Ip</a> <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Astram</a>.

I've learned it from a Dark Magician veteran, a powerful combo with only 2 cards:

Rod + Magicians' Souls

<strong>Rod</strong> → <strong>Soul Servant</strong> → <strong>Magicians' Souls</strong> to summon <strong>Dark Magician</strong> →<strong> Soul Servant</strong> to fetch <strong>Maha</strong>d → XYZ summon <strong>Tomahawk</strong> → make <strong>Verte Anaconda</strong> + <strong>Union Train</strong> + <strong>Ip</strong> →<strong> Red-Eyes Fusion</strong> summon<strong> Dragun of Red-Eyes</strong> → Use <strong>Union Train</strong> and Equip <strong>Dark Magician Girl</strong> on <strong>Ip</strong>.  If you have extra bricks in hand, you can also consider using Verte's first effect then have Dragun deny it to get 1000atk AND remove it to save you from Sky Striker Roze/superpoly. Next turn Make <strong>Astram</strong>, <strong>Dark Magician Girl</strong> gets sent to GY, now you have Dragun + Astram, AND 3 Soul Servant related card in GY, meaning you can draw 3 cards with it.

As for the side decks, I don't have great ones in mind atm. <strong>Phantazmay</strong> is not only good synergy with Dark Magician Deck due to it being a dragon, it also pairs with  <strong>Nibiru</strong>, allowing to get the draws AND clear the board together. With <strong>Forbidden Drop</strong> I feel like Kaiju monsters aren't as necessary now, and since it can discard cards on field, you can use it to discard Chicken Race with no real cost (and probably benefits you).

Consider wiping opponent backrow if they're heavy on spell/traps with <strong>Dark Magic Attack</strong>.

Union Train can be used when making Ip + Verte combo,  since you'd have 6 monsters/tokens on board, leaving two left. You can use this method to bring out Dark Magicians or Palladium oracles then either equip it on the link monsters so when they are sent to graveyard as material, it gets dumped to the graveyard as well. Alternatively, you can also use Magicians' Souls to send it to graveyard while gaining a draw from it.

<strong>Skill Drain</strong> is useful but like Village can also hurt you, especially against Poltergeist.

If the opponent is a big fan of disabling magic cards, stuff all Typhoon the from side deck so you can stand a chance by destroying their cards like Secret Village of Spellcasters or Imperial Order."

I tried to embody the same energy into this deck. With the hand trap monsters try to stall your opponent if your hand sucks. Its a pretty basic deck just try to get out your boos monsters and smash your opponent to pieces! Once that monster dies synchro summon Borreload Savage dragon and continue the assault. (This deck is not very good but might be fun to play against higher level decks and just cheese the match)

The deck I'm gonna present to you today is the one I currently use, it is a True Draco deck that I built when I came back to YGO in Master Rule 3, I updated it since then so it would always stay relevant and work around nerfs the archetype received. To this day, its purpose is still the same, being an excellent Anti-Meta deck that is able to have a great control of the field as well as limiting the opponent's options.
<h3><em><strong>Composition :</strong></em></h3>
<h4><em><strong>Monsters :</strong></em></h4>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Metaltron x1 :</strong> A very good boss monster, provided you summon it correctly it gets a full effect immunity (even to yours), it can also be discarded and called by through TK Return. We do not make use of his second effect in this deck, you are free to swap it for another monster if you wish to.</li>
 	<li><strong>Dinomight x1 : </strong>Probably the best TD monster (save for the ultra-op Master Peace), which explains why he is limited. You want to get him out on the field ASAP (provided it is safe) to help setting up your continous traps.</li>
 	<li><strong>Dreiath x1 :</strong> A very good monster that effectively shields your other True Draco monsters from getting rekt by most common Meta effects, it's always good to have on the field, its second effect is also very good as you. I advise running at least 1, but you can add a 2nd or even 3rd copy in your deck if you want to counter the Meta more efficiently.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ignis Heat x3 :</strong> The Spell counterpart to Dinomight, it is much less strong but it is still a decent monster to have, you can remove one copy.</li>
 	<li><strong>Majesty Maiden x2 :</strong> Another good monster to have, it's weaker than the other in the TD archetype but it can help you search for another TD that you need.</li>
 	<li><strong>Night Dragolich x3 :</strong> A surprisingly underused card, especially with TD, it is a Wyrm monster that switches all non-Wyrm Special Summoned Monsters to Defense position as well as reducing their current Defense Value by their original Value (which often means it will be set to 0). Given the fact that all TD monsters in this deck are Wyrm, there is absolutely no reason not to use such a simple but extremely efficient monster. Seriously, keep it at 3 and enjoy.</li>
</ul>
<span><em>You may be tempted to add <strong>Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder</strong> (or even <strong>Uria, Lord of Searing Flames</strong>) in a deck with so many Continous Spells (and Traps) and wonder why I don't use them. The short answer is that <strong>those are bait cards for TD decks</strong>. </em></span>

<span><em>The long answer is that even if there probably will be a duel in which you can summon Hamon and laugh in a 4000 ATK monster that deals 1000 effect damage each time it destroys another monster and that offers attack protection to other monsters when staying in DEF mode, it would also require you to also run at least <strong>1 or 2 copies of</strong> <strong>Cerulean Skyfire </strong>to efficiently protect and make the most out of <strong>Hamon,</strong> which would take up precious Deck Space for cards that you <strong>cannot search</strong> and that have <strong>very poor synergy</strong> (not ""innexistant"" because of the continous TD spells) with TD cards. </em></span>

<span><em>I'm sorry for the long parenthesis to talk about this but it is a common mistake begginer TD players make when they want to create a deck. So, please, for the love of the Egyptian Gods, don't do that, it's genuinely trolling and will cost you much more duels than it will win you.</em></span>
<h4><em><strong>Spells :</strong></em></h4>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Dragonic Diagram x1 :</strong> I would bet it is the strongest Field Spell in YGO, it is way too perfect and we are lucky (or not, depends on your side) it is not fully banned, each TD Monsters can't be destroyed in battle once EACH TURN. You can also discard any card on the field or in your hand to search for any TD card in your deck once per turn. And as a side benefit, TD monsters gain 300 ATK and DEF.</li>
 	<li><strong>TD Heritage x3 :</strong> Depending on the number of TD cards you discarded during this turn, you can draw the same ammount once per turn. Needless to say it can turn up into a +2 / +3 or more on each use.</li>
 	<li><strong>TD Disciples x3 :</strong> Your main (and only) recycling tool, able to save your sorry ass if Dinomight, TK Return or Dragonic Diagram are destroyed and sent to your GY, that card is much better than you might think, it can be a life saver, it also allows you to get a +1 once per activation, which is always nice in the long run.</li>
 	<li><strong>Terraforming x1 :</strong> Well, do I even need to tell you why ?</li>
 	<li><strong>Domain of the True Monarch x1</strong> <strong>:</strong> This card is actually insanely good with TD, you do not run an Extra Deck here and decks relying on Tribute Summoning are very rare, locking your opponent out of their own Extra Deck. Its second effect is also very good to make up for TD's generally low ATK values. You can run more than one copy of it, don't forget you can search it with Terraforming too.</li>
 	<li><strong>Card of Demise x1 :</strong> A very good instant +2 card. The prices you pay for it are no big deal, setting up a good field is better than inflicting damage and discarding unused monsters is okay since you can bring them back with TK Return or recycle them with DC Disciples.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pot of Duality x3 :</strong> This card is decent, you trade it for one of the next 3 cards in your deck, it is a +0 but you get to chose what you need the most out of the options you get, and you do not Special Summon anyways.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Monarch's Stormforth x1 :</strong> Give the Kaiju / Super Poly treatment to any big wall or annoying monster like Dragun or Zeus standing in your way. Sadly, that cheesy strat is dying as a lot of new boss monsters have effects preventing them to be tributed (f for Obelisk btw) or effects that allows them to negate any dangerous card once per turn, so you have to be creative to get those effects wasted first. Keep that card at one to avoid bricking !</li>
</ul>
<h4><em><strong>Traps :</strong> </em></h4>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>TK Return x2 :</strong> No but seriously, that card, it's just straight OP, get it on the field ASAP and make sure you can recycle it in case something bad happens to it, every turn without Return on your field is a turn you didn't play right. With its recent return to 3 copies, you can throw in a 3rd. <em>TK Return counts as a TD Trap !
</em></li>
 	<li><strong>TD Apocalypse x3 :</strong> This card is also really OP but it smh isn't Limited or even Semi Limited, you can fuck up your opponent really badly with its effect, but we'll talk about it later.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Monarchs Erupt x3 :</strong> It negates the effects of all monsters that were not Tribute Summoned, that's it, I don't need further explanation. Allthough you gotta make sure to always have a Tribute Summoned monster on your field, which shouldn't be too hard.</li>
 	<li><strong>Waterfall of Dragon Souls x2 :</strong> A good search card, especially if you abuse its second effect (we'll come to it later). You can add a 3rd copy if you want.</li>
 	<li><strong>Rivalry of Warlords OR Gozen Match x1 :</strong> Those cards can be usefull against decks featuring only one Monster Type or Archetype, you can add more of these but I do not think it is worth it as it can brick you if you get them when you do not need it. (I'm currently putting those in the Side Deck)</li>
 	<li><strong>Storming MF x2 :</strong> That MF is fire, literally. Yeet all ATK position monsters your opponent controls into his hand (or extra-deck). If you get it off, you will most likely see your opponent instantly surrender (and sometimes call bullshit or flame you).</li>
 	<li><strong>Infinite Impermanence x2 :</strong> You know the card, you know why it's good.</li>
 	<li><strong>Escalation of the Monarchs x1 :</strong> Because Tribute Summoning during your opponent's Battle Phase is always fun and giggles, you can already summon during his Main Phase with the TD traps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><em><strong>Playstyle :</strong></em></h3>
True Dracos have held a good spot as an anti-meta deck since their release, being really dominant in 2017 and early 2018 (and still being strong in 2020). Despite numerous limitations and bans, the Archetype is very good and almost always combined with other Archetypes to solidify its or the other Archetype's strengths while covering for weaknesses. This deck is making use of Monarch cards to make it hard for the opponent to Special Summon (as well as locking down the Extra Deck).

As I said earlier, I have been using this deck for a long time and I think my win-ratio throughout the years is roughly or above 75%, IRL and Online on YGO.PRO (and now EDO.PRO). However, living in a small town far away from the bigger cities, I have not taken part in any major tournament, which would be this deck's true test.

I have a <strong>harder time going against other TD or Monarch decks</strong>, the end result depending more on the RNG and luck than anything else and against <strong>Dark Magicians</strong> and <strong>Vanilla Blue-Eyes decks</strong> (by Vanilla I mean decks that want to summon the regular BE White Dragon without using Chaos Max / Neo Ultimate or any other non-normal monsters) as they are unaffected by some of my lockdown cards. I recently came accross some trouble against some <strong>Phantasms decks</strong> when having a mediocre starting hand as they are Power Decks that do not rely much on the Extra Deck and you need to make perfect use of your resources to dispatch them.

Not gonna lie, I'm expecting you to know how TD work and what their unique gimmick here if you came here and read this far but I'm going to sumarize it incase it is not your case.

<strong>TD Monsters are to be Tribute Summoned and they can use Continous Spells or Traps to be Summoned.</strong>

TD Spells have two effects in common : They allow you to Tribute Summon a TD Monster once during <strong>your Main Phase</strong> (in addition to your Normal Summon) and, if they are sent from your field to the Graveyard (through being use as Tribute or Destroyed / Discarded), they allow you to <strong>destroy any Spell or Trap card</strong> on the field.

TD Traps also have two shared effects : They allow you to Tribute Summon a TD Monster once during <strong>your OPPONENT'S Main Phase</strong> and, if they are sent from your field to the Graveyard (through being use as Tribute or Destroyed / Discarded), they allow you to <strong>destroy any Monster card</strong> on the field.

That means that you have to be mindfull of your cards and how you manage them. You nevertheless have the ability to cycle a lot through your deck and to draw or search a lot of cards through clever usage of your effects.

If you go first, you want to assert dominance over your opponent and to make sure you won't have your field shatered in an instant and to get OTK-ed, which is the point of the current Meta, relying on the ""Monarch"" aspect of the deck and Dreiath for cover. If you go second, you want to break your opponent's field wide open with your spells and traps and to make sure he does not have any chances of making a come back (with Dragolich to lock him out of special summoning from the GY for example).

Do not hesitate to tribute your TD spells or traps if you need to get rid of the opponent's backrow or monsters, even if that means tributing TK Return, the gods will forgive you in that leads you to a victory, especially now that it is not Limited anymore. Also, do not be the noob that activates the Spell and Traps GY effects when your opponent have nothing you can target, you will have to destroy one of your own card and you will look (and feel) dumb. Anyways, this deck has a lot of Combo Potential, here is a few examples to get you started, I'll let you discover the rest by yourself !
<h3><em><strong>Combos and Tricks</strong></em></h3>
<h4><strong>10 IQ combos : </strong></h4>
<ul>
 	<li><em>Card of Demise + TK Return</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Just send TD monsters to the GY during your endphase, and instantly after doing that, summon one with TK Return.</li>
 	<li>You can also ""cheese"" the damage immunity this card grants to your opponent if you use it during your Main Phase 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><em>Dragonic Diagram + Any TD Spell or Trap (+TD Heritage)</em>
<ul>
 	<li>You not only get to search a card you need, you also yeet a card your opponent controls in the process.</li>
 	<li>After that, you can use TD Heritage to draw a card (or more if you sent more TD cards from the field to your GY this turn)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><em>TD Apocalypse (+ Dreiath III) + TK Return</em>
<ul>
 	<li>When your opponent attacks, use TD Apo to target a monster you control and send it to the GY to halve the opponnent's monsters ATK points, then use TD Return to bring that same monster if Defense position.</li>
 	<li>This combo gains 90 bonus IQ if the monster you sent to the GY is Dreiath as you will be able to use its effect to summon any TD monster and then you can call back one of the highest DEF points TD monster.</li>
</ul>

 	<li>When your opponent attacks, use TD Apo and target another TD Apo (or Return if you REALLY MUST), not only will your opponent's monsters lose half their ATK points, you will also be able to destroy one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><em>TD Apocalypse + TD Apocalypse</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Just use TD Apocalypse effects twice, halving even further your opponent's monsters ATK. <em>Be mindfull however, the trick here is that you cannot use that combo in the same Chain, so you will have to find a way to create two different Chain blocks !</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><em>Waterfall of Dragon Souls (+ Dreiath III) + TK Return (+ TD Heritage) (+TD Disciples)</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Use WDS second effect to send a monster you control to the GY to draw two cards (or more if you sent more monsters to the GY with that effect)</li>
 	<li>Add 100 IQ if that monster was Dreiath (you know the reason if you read the TD Apo + TD Return Combo)</li>
 	<li>Add 300 additional IQ if you then use TD Heritage to draw even more cards (tho it has to be during your turn)</li>
 	<li>Make it over 9000 IQ if you can then get TD Disciples off and to draw one last card.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><em>Metaltron XII + Dreiath III (+TK Return) (+Any TD Spell)</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Use Dreiath to Tribute summon Metaltron, then use its effect to special summon another Metaltron (if you have multiple copies of it) or any other TD Monster.</li>
 	<li>Add 100 IQ if you then bring it back with TK Return</li>
 	<li>Add Cyber Dragon Nova IQ if you then use a TD Spell to Tribute Summon another Dreiath</li>
 	<li>Add Cyber Dragon Infinity IQ if you once again use a TD Spell to Tribute that other normal summoned Dreiath to Tribute Summon another monster (and Special Summon again with Dreiath)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>500 IQ Combo :</strong></h4>
<ul>
 	<li><em>Escalation of the Monarch + Metaltron XII + Dreiath III (+TK Return) (+Any TD Trap)</em>
<ul>
 	<li>That is actually the same combo than the one I just mentionned, but you will start it during your opponent's Main Phase or Battle Phase instead of during your turn, causing Chaos within is mind as you play YOUR TURN during theirs.</li>
 	<li>If you do that during the opponent's Battle Phase, you won't be able to use the (+Any TD Trap) part and you will have to wait for your opponent to get to his Main Phase 2, you can circumvent that issue with Escalation of the Monarch.</li>
 	<li>Seriously, it already happened to me several times that confused opponents mistakenly ended their Battle Phase or lost to the Timer because they weren't sure who had to play and what Phase we were in anymore.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Lockdown Combo :</strong></h3>
Night Dragolich + Any Tribute Summoned TD Monster (preferably Dreiath or Metaltron or both) + Monarch's Erupt + Domain of the True Monarchs + TD Apo + A card ready to be used for TD Apo + Infinite Impermanence ready. Your opponent can only break it piece by piece, and you should be able to deal with it.

&nbsp;
<h3><em><strong>In conclusion :</strong></em></h3>
I thank you A LOT for checking this deck and reading this far, do not hesitate to try the deck out or to ask me if you have any questions left. If you have constructive feedback to give about anything, do not hesitate either. I will surely keep updating this deck as BanLists come and the Meta evolves, I am often experimenting with new stuff revolving around TD (I'm currently trying an Invoked + True Draco deck, it's good stuff but it is sometimes weird). Once again, thank you for reading and see you in a duel !

&nbsp;

the strategy here is to summon Blue-Eyes White Dragon then summon Deep of Blue Eyes to trigger its effect to search for the ritual spell Chaos Form and Blue-Eyes Chaos Max Dragon in one turn.

also cards like Deep of Blue-Eyes and Melody of Awakening Dragonis going to make summoning Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon much much easier, this is why I choose to put 3 cards of this monster into my deck.

due to Deep of Blue-Eyes  not being released in TCG and YuGiOh LOTD link Evolution I couldn't test this deck against challenging campaigns but I've build a similar deck with only one Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon as a difference between this deck and that and although Deep Of Blue-Eyes with also excluded it had a very high success rate against YuGiOh LOTD Challenging campaign so I assume that this deck won't be any difference."

Essentially got most of the ideas for this variation of the deck from this guy: <a>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJvP-Wkqfz9TGgxtzQFX1zw/videos</a>

Then I made it more focused on the Infinite Negate variation instead of the Storm Barrier variation.

<span lang=""en"">The first effect of ""<span><strong>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</strong></span>"" serves as a seeker for both the Noble Knight and Destiny Hero monsters, In the case of the Noble Knights to have a second turn response putting in our hand the ""<strong><span>Noble Knight Medraut</span></strong>"" to continue with the basic combo of the Noble Knights (""<span><strong>Noble Knight Medraut</strong></span>"" + ""<span><strong>Noble Arms</strong></span>""), the use with Destiny Hero gives us a target for an eventual ""<span><strong>Destiny Draw</strong></span>"" that we have stuck in hand in the first turn.

The deck takes advantage of the normal summons provided by the ""<span><strong>Noble Knight Custennin</strong></span>"", as it can be specially summoned to the field having the only requirement to have a ""<strong><span>Noble Arms</span></strong>"" face up, so use the ""<span><strong>Destiny Hero - Decider</strong></span>"" to equip a noble weapon , and to be able to link summon ""<span><strong>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</strong></span>"".

""<span><strong>Morgan, the Enchantress of Avalon</strong></span>"", provides a decent cover in response to the effects that our rival can use, and if combined with the ""<span><strong>Noble Knight Dystran</strong></span>"", resulting in the negation of an effect and the destruction of a card face up in control of our opponent. So we will use the destiny hero engine to have ""<span><strong>Morgan, the Enchantress of Avalon</strong></span>"" in our hands as soon as possible.

So this is my personal favourite deck and all my decks I upload I make sure it can compete by playing rated in dueling book.

This deck can play a lot hand traps as well which also makes it a solid contender to the tier 1 decks right now.

Have Fun!"

I almost play only normal monsters in this deck. I have duels and so muc,"So if you have any questions please pm on dueling book. Pls comment fro any questions.

So i realised that this deck is slightly overdue. <a>https://www.duelingbook.com/deck?id=5880923</a> here is the updated version.

Contents:
1. Test Hands

2. Why I play the cards I play

3. Replays

&nbsp;

<span>Test Hands</span>

Here is one test hand, more is coming soon!

<a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=603931-19410018</a>

There are 1 test hand in this replay.

<span>Why I play the cards I play:</span>

So the first part of the decklist is that you can see that I play every 4 or under dragon normal monster tuner. This is to boost consistency of getting towards the Halq and then to combo off from there.

Then I play 2 baby dragon just to make sure that you can easily have access to a level or lower tuner monster from your deck.

I also play the 3 guardragon garmides because it is an extender.

I play 3 of the lv9 guardragon to go into with either elpy or its own effect.

I then play the black luster sword lock to stop your opponent from using the extra deck.

1 copy of red-eyes darkness metal dragon as another extender to bring out using elpy if u have drew one of the lv9 guardragons.

Unexpected dai + The load of monster reborn-type cards - to extend your combos.

Effect Veiler and the Ash Blossom: To stop some of our opponents plays.

Extra Deck: You can see why I play certain cards in the replay.

<span>3. Replays</span>

<span>I will be uploading replays daily of some rated games fo the deck to show the decks overall power.</span>

Instant Fusion gets out an Elder Entity to bring out ","With the use of Castel, the ""Flip"" Effects that the Geargias use can be triggered off easily. The Book of Taiyou is another great addition, and I would run 3. Book of Moon is better off on side deck. The Elder Entity helps get your Geargias out of your hand with the use of Instant Fusion. Xyz Summons are done Quickly and Easily with cards like Geargiaccelerator, Gadgets and Geargianos that I run here. I side deck the Rank 3 and I play the Wind Ups too! They can flip easily. As for the Dreadnoughts, I usually Xyz into them with the Geargias and the Geargianos. I usually use Ancient Gear Box with Geargiauger to search the Geargias faster, but the Disadvantage for this is that I can't get my Geargiaccelerator with this, so I usually recurr to reusing Geargiarmor's ""Flip"" effect to search it, or the Gear Gigant X. Usually the Geargias that go to the Grave I bring them back with either Monster Reborn, Geargiano, and Geargiano MK-II. Mk-III I just keep one of that guy there to get out any Geargias out fast. Basically Xyz Summons really quickly, and uses many Special Summons, so it does have the risk to be Nibirued. Many of the Xyz Summons can be negated, and it still needs a lot to go but this seems to be a pretty solid Deck on its own."

Here's the link to the POP/STARS music video, if you wanna watch it! <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8qRB4</a>

This actually isn't MY deck. I actually asked one of my followers on Twitter to make it a week ago, because I was dealing with burnout. I have her to thank for making this deck. Anyways, ""We POP/STARS"" is meant to go second 100% of the time. Your goal here is to OTK your opponent.

</span></span>

The best time to make link plays is when u gey two <span>Doomking Balerdroch<span> because u will most likely have <span>Zombie World <span>on the field so on yours opponents Standby phase one of the Balerdroch will come back to the fild and if u have made <span>Vampire Sucker <span>u will draw a card.</span></span></span></span></span></span>

After battling, GBs are able to shuffle themselves into the deck and bring out a different GB (unlocking it's dormant effect at the same time). With this ability, GBs are able to quickly swarm the field, setting them up for Fusion Summoning.

GB Fusion monsters don't have to use <strong><a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a></strong>, but instead are summoned by shuffling the fusion material into the deck. What's better is that after battling, the fusion monsters can also be shuffled into the deck to bring out 2 GBs !

One of the most important Main Deck Monsters in the deck is <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Augustus"">Gladiator Beast Augustus</a>,</strong> with it's cool ability to bring out another GB from your hand (plus it's effect) It is a Level 7 with <span id=""card-atk"">2600</span>/<span id=""card-def"">1000 stats.</span>

The key Extra Deck Monster is <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Edition"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Edition</a></strong>, who can bring out a new GB fusion monster each turn! It's stats are 2400/3000

Spell cards such as <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Rejection"">Gladiator Rejection</a></strong> allow you to special summon an edition monster in defence while preventing your monsters from being targeted by your opponents, and the Field Spell <strong><a data-name=""Colosseum - Cage of the Gladiator Beasts"">Colosseum - Cage of the Gladiator Beasts</a> </strong>gives your monsters an extra 100 ATK/DEF each time a monster is special summoned from either players deck, giving you a great advantage!"

Anyways, this deck's main purpose is to swarm the field with different Attributes of Monsters, then activate Six Shinobi to stall for another turn and attack for game. Great Shogun isn't really useful unless your opponent has Dimension Barrier or something, but that's just my opinion. So yeah.

Also, pls dont spam me with comments saying I copied someone else. This deck's style is kind of similar to someone else's, but I did not copy them. Thanks"

Eldich is useful to negate and summon another monster that fills your field with powerful cards and Doomking Balerdroch can be helpful in certain situations. Your Uni-Zombie should effectively bring out the right cards you need in order to wipe the opponent's effects and lifepoints before you can deck out.

A single Redeployment ends on Apollousa, Avramax, Block Dragon, and Howitzer. We will","The new rank 5 Vespenate the Spinbreaker enables the synergy between Ancient Gear and Machina. The end board with Apollousa, Avramax, Howitzer, and Block Dragon is easily achieved with <strong>a single Redeployment</strong> or any of <strong>Gearframe + Irradiator/Possesstorage</strong>, making the consistency is somewhat acceptable. Bricking wont be a big issue as you will play regular Citadel control or handtraps. We will have 4 Ancient Gears (Frame, Box, Ballista, and Howitzer) too along the way if you didnt banish them for Block Dragon, it means we can follow up for Chaos Ancient Gear Giant via Verte/Overload Fusion. We dont use Halq in the combo, it's just there for follow up play/free plus.

The combo is super long, I will upload the replay tutorial (it uses Codebreaker package it means <strong>you gotta free the link 3 zones for them</strong>). <a>https://bit.ly/3er2PVX</a>

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/kAr8chT.png"" alt=""image"" />

The Machina lineup consists of Irradiator, Gearframe, Possesstorage (great in grind game), and Redeployment as 3 ofs for our combo starter. 1 Citadel and 3 Overdrive is there as Citadel control and recycles your banished machines, esp since we use Overload Fusion and Block Dragon.

The Ancient Gear package is small as theyre just combo pieces being Ancient Gear Fusion, Box, Frame, and Overload Fusion (Chaos Giant follow up via Verte).

Rock lineup enables further spamming mid-combo despite being bricks (lol). Block Dragon (easily searched and summoned along the way, watch the replay), Adaman Researcher and Seeker, Weeping Idol, and 3 Gigantes.

The rest is just handtrap as well as Crossout target (not TCG legal yet) and generic backrow removal.

<img src=""https://www.yugioh-world.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/dr_vellian_crowler-561x372.png"" alt=""image"" />

Pros: Themed, end board is hard to penetrate without strong cards like DRNM, Sphere Mode, etc. Combo can adapt going first or otk.

Cons: Bricking hard.

Cards to think of: Machina Fortress is good in grind game but with negs. Ancient Gear Wyvern works via Ballista/Howitzer for free plus if we draw Frame/Box but it is another brick."
