Those two were Ryu-Kishin and Wattkid known as Oscilo Hero #2 in that time. So let's go card by card so you can see why something was played instead of something else.

1x Dark Magician-it still is 2500 ATK beatstick but it needs 2 tributes while everyone was playing 6 1000 ATK monsters and 9 1200 ATK monsters which means nearly everything was a Trap Hole target and that made it even harder to get Dark Magician out on the field, but that card was still pretty powerful and was worth playing.

1x Gaia the Fierce Knight-same reason as with Dark Magician, except this thing had 200 ATK less then Magician

3x Hitotsu-Me Giant-still a powerful 1200 ATK beatter that can go over most low level monsters

3x Mammoth Graveyard-same reason as with Hitotsu

3x Silver Fang-except it was as strong as Hitotsu and Mammoth it could be equiped with Beast Fangs making it even stronger and it was the only 1200 ATK monster that could be boosted up at this time

3x Ryu-Kishin-1000 ATK was a powercreep for 800 ATK monsters

3x Wattkid-same reason as with Ryu-Kishin

3x Dark Gray-there weren't so many 1000 ATK monsters so cards like this that could be equiped and boosted were still seing play

2x Nemuriko-same reason as with Dark Gray

2x Kagemusha of the Blue Flame-same reason as with Dark Gray

3x Dark Hole-overpowered clean up card

3x Fissure-still destroys a monster for no cost and can help you to get with weaker monster through stronger monster by just destroying it

3x Beast Fangs-we still play Dark Gray and Silver Fang so we want them to be even stronger

2x Legendary Sword-boosts Gaia and Kagemusha

2x Book of Secret Arts-boosts Dark Magician and Nemuriko

3x Trap Hole-right now it is auto destruction for 17 of 24 monsters that everyone plays, so it is in this format something like Solemn Judgment is today, it was like a summon negate

Why Sword and Book instead of more monsters? To boost up 800 ATK monsters to get over 1000 ATK monsters and they also are unafected by Trap Hole still, which means that they can be a really big problem for your opponent if he doesn't find a clean up card or a stronger monster, or a clean up card if you boosted something to a 1400 ATK for example.

Dark Magician Gaia beatdown stoped seing play 'cuz now there was much more removal for most monsters and there is no posibility that 800 monster would last more than a turn it is summoned, so those were mostly unable to be placed on the field."

Yeah, the card isn't banned in Master Duel for some god forsaken reason. literally just the fact that you can end on him means you can play through any Maxx ""C"" no problem. Like, sure. They have 15 cards, but what good are they if they cant even get a monster on board? Also, access to 3 Tsuchinoko makes the deck even more consistent!"

Jizukiru can be used to get over an opponents boss monster, jizukiru can then be tributed into fortress dragon from your opponents side of the field (easy boss monster elimination) or you can go the full on OTK route and bring in limiter removal and gold sarcophagus to OTK with cyber end dragon/cyber twin dragon etc

However, the PC version of Master Duel with one of its achievements ""Burn it All"" ticked my interest in using Warlock as a way to net burn damage. Are there faster ways to net bigger burn damage? Of course there are. But me being a sucker for Spellcaster-type monsters decided to take the long way around. 100k burn damage means 100 Normal Spells to activate, or 50 if I'm lucky and I manage to get both Warlock(s) out and keep them that way.

Strategy here is pretty simple. Your primary objective is to get Warlock to the field ASAP. Having ""<a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>"" in its card text means Warlock can be top-decked with <a data-name=""Soul Servant"">Soul Servant</a>, which can be searched out using <a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a><a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">.</a>

Once you get him out, burn away. While the Dark Magician archetype has tons of useful spells, almost half of them are Quick-Play while Warlock burns on Normal Spells only. Among them, I count nine Normal Spells, most of which are useless; which is where Spellbooks come into play. Pair that with the other general-purpose Normal Spells and you'll burn through 8000 LP in no time."

&nbsp;

The deck is very hand trap resilient and can end with Wandering Gryphon Rider + Dpe and/or Utopic Draco Future depending of your matchup and hand.

&nbsp;

The Ghostrick combo:

You start XYZ summoning Ghostrick Alucard with any level 3 mosnters ~XYZ summon Ghostrick Angel of Mischief using Alucard ~Activate Mischief effect, detach Alucard and add Ghostrick Shot to your hand ~Activate Shot and Summon Alucard from your GY ~Summon another Mischief ~XYZ summon Number F0: Utopic Future and then climb it into a Draco Future. The only problem in this combo is that if you draw Ghostrick Shot you can't make it because the Alucard you would need to summon isn't in your GY, you can resolve this poblem by just using another Alucard, but i will keep the engine efficient and small.

&nbsp;

While this is Dragonquest and not some convoluted JRPG from the 90's with horribly complicated mechanics that makes old-school DND look seizure inducing to the typical normie in comparison, it really isn't. In reality, the endgame is to either land on halq for Auroradon for B-Savage; Go for Gryphon Rider for Rose Dragon for Lv10 Synchro; or say screw it and nail it with whatever you have at your disposal. Also included is ""Archnemeses Eschatos"" as a psuedo backup for Protos *(because he got the banned hammer because of seethe and cope).* Also in the lineup is the usual tongue and cheek Crossout Designator staples and targets used for the lulz."

Learning to play with this deck will give you a solid foundation on how to play Xyz decks. As an Anime protagonist archetype that introduced the Xyz mechanic to the game, <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a> is one of the most iconic cards in all of Yu-Gi-Oh! and Utopia has received and will continue to receive support over the years and last year the OCG released a Structure Deck that made the deck viable and competent at what it does.
Master Duel has a Utopia Structure Deck available from the beginning of the game and it's about it and its improved version that we're going to talk about next.

//////////////////////////////////////////
Budget version of the deck (3 Structure Decks):
Only with the Structure Deck cards the deck's gameplay is limited and is based on making the <a data-name=""Ultimate LEO Utopia Ray"">Ultimate LEO Utopia Ray</a> equipped with several ""ZW -"" monsters that give attack to the equipped monster in addition to an extra protection effect against destruction or target of cards or even interaction with the opponent with the ""<a data-name=""ZW - Pegasus"">ZW - Pegasus</a>"" which is the main ""ZW -"" monster available and that you always want to equip in <strong>LEO Utopia</strong>. That way you equip LEO Utopia with several ""ZW -"" monsters so that it becomes a respectable Boss Monster with high attack, protection effects and negation of opponent's monsters becoming the deck's win condition.
These are the possible combos to do with just the Structure Deck:

///////////////////////////////////////////////
Competitive version of the Utopia deck:
In this version we focused on comboing through the <strong>""Onomat"" engine</strong> which consists of adding high rarity cards such as <a data-name=""Onomatopickup"">Onomatopickup</a>, <a data-name=""Onomatopaira"">Onomatopaira</a> and <a data-name=""Utopic Onomatopoeia"">Utopic Onomatopoeia</a> to the deck. This engine spams the level 4 monsters needed to access the Xyz RANK-4 Utopia from the Extra Deck and start making Utopia moves.
A benefit of this version is the decrease in ""ZW -"" monsters used in the deck by opting for more consistency cards. We also reduced the number of copies of cards that are not as necessary for the deck to work as <a data-name=""ZS - Armed Sage"">ZS - Armed Sage</a>. But the main difference between this Competitive version and the Budget version is in the use of <a data-name=""Number 99: Utopia Dragonar"">Number 99: Utopia Dragonar</a> that we make with <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce"">Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce</a> and it by itself already gives us access to <a data-name=""Ultimate LEO Utopia Ray"">Ultimate LEO Utopia Ray</a> without having to use Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force. That way you can make a very oppressive <strong>end board with several interactions</strong> with the opponent via the engine, which is a quality of this deck. For this you usually end up with the Extra Deck very quickly, being this a deck that goes to All or Nothing where if the field is broken you won't have good follow ups to play on the back but if the opponent can't break that field you win very fast.

These are the possible combos in the competitive version of the deck:

(Remember that these cards have a huge synergy with each other so you get this same combo if instead of the <a data-name=""Onomatopoeia"">Onomatopoeia</a> it was a <a data-name=""Dodododo"">Dodododo</a> for example which is a good discard too, just the <a data-name=""Zubababa"">Zubababa</a> you don't want to discard to the GY)

///////////////////////////////////////////////

In this last topic I talk about the details of the main deck and extra deck engine cards as well as card options that can be used to have a competitive version but still with budget options in Master Duel.
//////////////////////////////////
Technoplay Main Deck:

<a data-name=""ZS - Armed Sage"">ZS - Armed Sage</a> became an expendable card in the deck after the support of <a data-name=""ZS - Utopic Sage"">ZS - Utopic Sage</a> that accesses <a data-name=""ZS - Ascended Sage"">ZS - Ascended Sage</a> directly from the deck but we still used a copy in the deck.

<a data-name=""Astraltopia"">Astraltopia</a> is the <strong>best extender</strong> because it can simply <strong>add any spell/trap of the archetype</strong> including the COUNTER Trap <a data-name=""Numbers Protection"">Numbers Protection</a> which is an insane card and in addition it costs any card from your hand or field to gy which means it benefits greatly from using cards like <a data-name=""Onomatopickup"">Onomatopickup</a> and <a data-name=""Xyz Change Tactics"">Xyz Change Tactics</a> to activate their effect. (It doesn't specify that you have to have an Xyz Monster to Special Summon it onto the field, so if only your opponent controls an Xyz Monster you can still Summon it.)
If you searched it with the <a data-name=""Primathmech Alembertian"">Primathmech Alembertian</a> and it doesn't have Follow Up you can use it to add the <a data-name=""Onomatopickup"">Onomatopickup</a>/<a data-name=""Onomatopaira"">Onomatopaira</a> from the deck to the hand to have Follow Up.

If you don't know what deck you're up against, the best thing to do is leave <a data-name=""Gigantes"">Gigantes</a> in your hand because if you take several Floodgates like <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, Gigantes is an potential out of those cards.

""ZW -"" monsters can be equipped to Utopia monsters to give extra effects like not being destroyed by effects or being targeted by cards and some have interaction effect like Pegasus that negates monster effect not to mention the equipped monster gains attack equal to the attack of the equipment itself like Pegasus that has 1000atk. The 3 main ones are: <a data-name=""ZW - Pegasus"">ZW - Pegasus</a>, <a data-name=""ZW - Lightning Blade"">ZW - Lightning Blade</a> and <a data-name=""ZW - Tornado Bringer"">ZW - Tornado Bringer</a>. As I'm getting ready to play the Xyz event I prefer to just use Pegasus and Tornado because it's no use using the Blade that protects from destruction and you take <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> that doesn't care about these protections. Playing Ranked Master Duel I would consider using one of them and the chosen one would be ZW - Tornado because the deck already has a way to protect against destruction by effects that is <a data-name=""ZS - Utopic Sage"">ZS - Utopic Sage</a> that no one remembers but it can banish itself so much from field and gy to <strong>protect all Utopia monsters</strong> from cards like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> and <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>.

Onomatopoeia Engine:
***<a data-name=""Onomatopoeia"">Onomatopoeia</a> can be Searchable by <a data-name=""Onomatopickup"">Onomatopickup</a>/<a data-name=""Onomatopaira"">Onomatopaira</a> and basically he is the Normal Summon of Gagaga's engine and brings the other monsters Special Summon from Hand at the same time you can Reborn him in the GY with <a data-name=""Zubababa"">Zubababa</a> or just his fact <strong>being in the field</strong> allows you to activate the <a data-name=""Dodododo"">Dodododo</a> eff in GY to return to the field. A card that interacts excellently with Dodododo and Zubababa. (Remember that <a data-name=""Onomatopoeia"">Onomatopoeia</a> brings monsters by Special from the hand in <strong>DEFENSE Position</strong> and you are LOCK on doing <strong>XYZ</strong>).
<a data-name=""Dodododo"">Dodododo</a> basically you want to Special Summon it from the Hand or the GY to the field. To bring him from the hand we only have the option of the <a data-name=""Onomatopoeia"">Onomatopoeia</a> but he can be your Normal Summon also to Special Summon <a data-name=""Zubababa"">Zubababa</a> from the hand if you don't open with the <a data-name=""Onomatopoeia"">Onomatopoeia</a> and he comes back from the GY by its own effect if you control the <strong>correct name</strong> which is quite simple to do (but Banish it when leaves the field).
<a data-name=""Zubababa"">Zubababa</a> is excellent, it's a <strong>double extender</strong> because it Special Summons from the hand by its own effect and reborn another monster from the gy to the field. (Another card that locks you in only making <strong>XYZ</strong> Monsters from the Extra Deck)
The combination of these 3 cards is enough to have the <strong>level 4 spam needed to access Xyz moves</strong> from the Extra Deck with you being able to make two to three Xyz RANK-4 just with them and with other Extenders this number easily reaches 4 or 5 Xyz in a single turn.
Both <a data-name=""Onomatopoeia"">Onomatopoeia</a> and a <a data-name=""Dodododo"">Dodododo</a> are excellent discards to resolve <a data-name=""Onomatopaira"">Onomatopaira</a>, only <a data-name=""Zubababa"">Zubababa</a> you don't want to discard to GY.

The advantage of <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</a> to <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce"">Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce</a> is that it can target any RANK-4 Xyz to bring <a data-name=""LEO Utopia"">LEO Utopia</a> from Extra Deck not needing to be a Utopia monster so you can use <a data-name=""ZS - Utopic Sage"">ZS - Utopic Sage</a> as a material from LEO Utopia for example which brings a lot of versatility.
Also don't forget that Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force puts a ""ZW -"" or ""ZS -"" monster on top of the deck and that it can banish itself from the GY to give 1 Draw if your opponent has <strong>2k or more LP than you</strong>.
Using both Rank-Up-Magic also brings a good versatility in deck moves, going according to how to make <strong>Utopia Double + LEO Utopia OTK</strong> but of course the priority is to make <a data-name=""99: Utopia Dragonar"">99: Utopia Dragonar</a> and for that the <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce"">Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce</a> is the only mandatory Rank-Up-Magic in the deck.

<a data-name=""Xyz Change Tactics"">Xyz Change Tactics</a> does something that I value a lot in any deck and that bothers me in decks that don't have that ability: draw cards and is searchable by <a data-name=""Astraltopia"">Astraltopia</a>. It also <strong>Chain Blocks the effects</strong> you activate when Summoning Xyz Monsters like <a data-name=""ZS - Ascended Sage"">ZS - Ascended Sage</a>.
Even knowing that the deck engine is very big and you will hardly draw defenses in the form of hand traps, just the fact of seeing new cards greatly increases the chance of you winning. Not to mention that <strong>paying 500LP is useful</strong> in this deck because several Utopia cards gain additional effects when your opponent has at least <strong>2000LP more than you</strong> like the <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</a> of giving you one more Draw for free in the turn or the <a data-name=""ZW - Pegasus"">ZW - Pegasus</a> that is summoned from the hand and then equipped with <a data-name=""LEO Utopia"">LEO Utopia</a> (this is the only way to equip Pegasus on your monster if it comes in your starting hand because unlike <a data-name=""ZW - Tornado"">ZW - Tornado</a> for example it <strong>only equips by activating the effect on the field</strong>, it is a brick in the hand that can only be equipped if it Specials first when its LP is 2k less than the opponent).
Speaking of synergy with the <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</a> you <strong>stack the top</strong> of the deck with a ""ZW -"" like Blade/Tornado is an <strong>indirect way to add them to the hand</strong> with the purchase of Xyz Change Tactics.
Not to mention that the Xyz Change Tactics draws can make it better for you to hold the <a data-name=""Onomatopoeia"">Onomatopoeia</a>/<a data-name=""Dodododo"">Dodododo</a> effect if you would summon <a data-name=""Zubababa"">Zubababa</a> to the field which is unnecessary since he can enter by his own effect and after several draws you use to be able to bring a lot of free extenders for powerful plays.

<a data-name=""Zexal Construct"">Zexal Construct</a> is for sure a cuttable card in the deck because you already have the <a data-name=""ZS - Utopic Sage"">ZS - Utopic Sage</a> to play its role much better. So consider exchanging it for any other card since it is a minus 1 for you when resolving what you always want to avoid having in your deck.
A card that I'm not using in the deck but that is a great budget option is the <a data-name=""Zexal Entrust"">Zexal Entrust</a> which is basically a Monster Reborn that also has the gy effect of banishing itself and adding a <strong>""Zexal"" Spell/Trap</strong> to the hand (Follow Up ).

As you use a lot of Continuous Spell and Equip Spell <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> it becomes excellent in the deck because the <strong>activation cost is very simple to pay</strong>.
Another synergy of Forbidden Droplet is with <a data-name=""F0: Utopic Draco Future"">F0: Utopic Draco Future</a> negating and <strong>taking control of an opponent's monster</strong> because you use it as a Droplet activation cost avoiding using your cards.

<a data-name=""Gameciel"">Gameciel</a> I thought about using it to face Shark Xyz Deck that can lock your field with <a data-name=""Number 4: Stealth Kragen"">Number 4: Stealth Kragen</a> + <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> or someone who plays with a troll deck of making <a data-name=""59: Crooked Cook"">59: Crooked Cook</a> Turbo made with <a data-name=""Astral Kuriboh"">Astral Kuriboh</a> or <a data-name=""Right-Hand Shark"">Right-Hand Shark</a>.

//////////////////////////////////
Technoplay Extra Deck Cards:

<a data-name=""Utopia Double"">Utopia Double</a> despite having to use a brick which is the ""<a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a>"" he Summons any ""Number 39: Utopia"" XYZ from the extra deck bringing it with DOUBLE ATK, that means that even if you take <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> when activating the effect of <a data-name=""99: Utopia Dragonar"">99: Utopia Dragonar</a>, you just have to put two level 4 Monsters on the field to be able to do Utopia Double and right after bring the <a data-name=""Ultimate LEO Utopia Ray"">Ultimate LEO Utopia Ray</a> from the Extra Deck without having to use the <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</a> which would be the only option to bring it to the field without using 99: Utopia Dragonar.
So even if 99: Dragonar is negated or takes Nibiru you can still summon LEO Utopia and pass with <strong>two monster negates</strong>.
The funny thing about Utopia Double is that if the opponent uses <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> and cut the LP to 4000, just use its effect and bring any Utopia with double attack that will usually come with 5k atk and hit straight to end the game without even having to use Double or Nothing!
A cool interaction of <a data-name=""Utopia Double"">Utopia Double</a> is with <a data-name=""LEO Utopia"">LEO Utopia</a> because you negate the effect of an opponent's monster and <strong>halv the monster's atk</strong> so most likely it will have 2k atk or less which means Utopia Double's OTK will happen.

The XYZ RANK-5 <a data-name=""Ultimate Utopia"">Ultimate Utopia</a> and <a data-name=""Ultimate LEO Utopia"">Ultimate LEO Utopia</a> are always treated as ""<a data-name=""Number C39: Utopia Ray"">Number C39: Utopia Ray</a>"" which means you cannot have the Original <a data-name=""C39: Utopia Ray"">C39: Utopia Ray</a> and these two Xyz in the same Utopia deck unless you choose to use 1 copy of Ultimate LEO and 1 copy of Ultimate Utopia and that way you already have 3 slots in use. In this case as it is not a budget version of Master Duel decklist you can simply use 1 <a data-name=""Ultimate LEO Utopia"">Ultimate LEO Utopia</a> and 1 <a data-name=""C39: Utopia Ray"">C39: Utopia Ray</a> Original.
***The <a data-name=""Ultimate LEO Utopia"">Ultimate LEO Utopia</a> says: <strong>This Effect's Activation and Effect Cannot be Negated</strong> so this makes it a more spectacular card than it already is.

<a data-name=""S39: Utopia the Lightning"">S39: Utopia the Lightning</a> is Utopia's boss monster capable of taking out any monster with <strong>5k atk or less</strong> from the field in the battle phase and very useful to have to take any Boss Monster from the opponent especially if your Utopia monster received interaction and is doing nothing in the field.

Remember that both <a data-name=""99: Utopia Dragonar"">99: Utopia Dragonar</a> and <a data-name=""38: Harbinger"">38: Harbinger</a> have battle phase effects, and Harbinger's effect is not even Hard Once per Turn so if he has 2 Spells attached to him he can use it twice for example.

<a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> being able to add <a data-name=""Gigantes"">Gigantes</a> to the hand is great for having an out to backrow in the search engine against Floodgate Turbo decks like Eldlich, True Draco and Monarch which are very popular in Master Duel. No wonder I also use <a data-name=""Exciton Knight"">Exciton Knight</a> and <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> to make sure my matchup against these decks is satisfactory.

<a data-name=""Bagooska"">Bagooska</a> is one of my favorite Rank-4 Xyz and it works in Master Duel as a contingency plan against <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> because by giving 2 draws to the opponent you can pass with an excellent floodgate that stops the turn of most decks and he <strong>stays on the field for up to 3 Standby Phase</strong> so you can draw the cards you need to play again. Not to mention that he's the best way to threaten <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> because he in attack position can't be targeted by cards or destroyed by card effects so it's almost guaranteed to make AA-Zeus.

***A card that I consider one of the best Xyz in the game is <a data-name=""Primathmech Alembertian"">Primathmech Alembertian</a> and this deck can use it to search for the best extender of the deck that is <a data-name=""Astraltopia"">Astraltopia</a>.

***Extra Deck monster restrictions you should be aware of: The monster <a data-name=""Utopia Double"">Utopia Double</a> brings on top of it has doubled ATK but cannot Direct Attack. Another card that is restricted to the player in the Battle Phase is <a data-name=""99: Utopia Dragonar"">99: Utopia Dragonar</a> that doesn't let you <strong>attack directly</strong> with other monsters (except itself) in the turn that used the effect and <a data-name=""ZS - Utopic Sage"">ZS - Utopic Sage</a> only allows you to attack with <strong>""Number"" monsters</strong>. Both 99: Utopia Dragonar and ZS - Utopic Sage lock you into making <strong>Xyz</strong> from an Extra Deck for the rest of the turn.

//////////////////////////////////
Disregard the Side Deck, these are just ideas of cards possible to use in the deck that I will discuss their use next:

<a data-name=""Gagagaga Magician"">Gagagaga Magician</a> is an option to make <a data-name=""F0: Utopic Draco Future"">F0: Utopic Draco Future</a> by reviving an XYZ from the GY for this. Because it has Gagagaga in the name, it also synergizes with some of the monsters in the Onomat engine but is not very relevant to the point of using it in the deck.

<a data-name=""97: Draglubrion"">97: Draglubrion</a> and <a data-name=""92: Heart-Earth"">92: Heart-Earth</a> are Free to Play options in the RANK-8 and RANK-9 Xyz Master Duel that you can bring with <a data-name=""99: Utopia Dragonar"">99: Utopia Dragonar</a> but of course the best option is <a data-name=""38: Harbinger"">38: Harbinger</a>.

<a data-name=""Xyz Universe"">Xyz Universe</a> is an Anti-Xyz trap searchable by <a data-name=""Astraltopia"">Astraltopia</a> that basically gets rid of two Xyz monsters from the opponent and brings in case you send two RANK-4 to the GY you bring <a data-name=""38: Harbinger"">38: Harbinger</a> to the field with this trap and he will have the negate of Spell Cards because you don't need to detach material to use it. <a data-name=""Xyz Encore"">Xyz Encore</a> and <a data-name=""Xyz Import"">Xyz Import</a> are also searchable cards in the deck but I consider Xyz Universe to be the best option to use in the <strong>Xyz Event</strong> (if you want to use it of course).

<a data-name=""S39: Utopia Prime"">S39: Utopia Prime</a> as well as <a data-name=""C39: Utopia Ray"">C39: Utopia Ray</a> are only used in the deck for you to put on top of <a data-name=""39: Utopia"">39: Utopia</a> or <a data-name=""39: Utopia Double"">39: Utopia Double</a> and activate <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce"">Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce</a> to make <a data-name=""99: Utopia Dragonar"">99: Utopia Dragonar</a> and that way it comes with 4 materials and can use the effect twice. You can also use them like Zoodiac does to make an <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> with various materials. You only use one of the two in the deck so in Master Duel if you have one of them you just need to know that it already works for the deck to work and you <strong>don't need to craft the other</strong>.

By using <a data-name=""F0: Utopic Future Slash"">F0: Utopic Future Slash</a> you can make <a data-name=""F0: Utopic Draco Future"">F0: Utopic Draco Future</a> much easier than just having two Xyz other than Number. Because you just do Utopic Future Slash on top of ""Utopia"" XYZ and Draco Future on top of Future Slash. But I prefer to keep using <a data-name=""F0: Utopic Future"">F0: Utopic Future</a> Original which has better battle phase effect, protection from destruction by effects and can be used in any xyz deck other than Slash which is only useful in that deck.

<a data-name=""ZW - Dragonic Halberd"">ZW - Dragonic Halberd</a> is another equipment option to use in the deck but it is only used in more budget versions of the deck in Master Duel and not in this one that is more geared towards the competitive.

<a data-name=""Downerd"">Downerd</a> can be used in the deck because all Utopic Future monsters are <strong>always considered RANK-1</strong> so you can do it on top and then <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> but the deck already has Xyz monsters that come on top of Utopia like <a data-name=""C39: Utopia Ray"">C39: Utopia Ray</a> or <a data-name=""S39: Utopia Prime"">S39: Utopia Prime</a> that are only used for this purpose.

<a data-name=""Exciton Knight"">Exciton Knight</a> is a card that almost no one expects to take and is surprised by a card that clears the entire field. If the opponent negates its effect he will have to destroy it too because if not you go to the battle phase and threaten <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> in Main Phase 2.

<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> is the most used XYZ RANK-4 in the history of the game, it was certainly ahead of its time for having a Quick Effect of being a <strong>GY Floodgate</strong> and this is very good against several Master Duel decks like Eldlich and Drytron and these decks should be quite popular in the <strong>Xyz Event</strong> so if you want to use the Abyss Dweller as a Generic RANK-4 Xyz option, here's the tip. This card is so good that I have no doubt if one day it will be banned (about 10 years from now).

<a data-name=""Anti-Magic Arrows"">Anti-Magic Arrows</a> is a way to make <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> pass because if the opponent doesn't interact in the Xyz Summon in the Main Phase and you go to the Battle Phase when you activate this card, you prevent it from activating Spells/Traps for the rest of the turn ensuring AA-Zeus on M2.

Play the card for last resort if you cannot find your way into the combo. It will save you occasionally but you need to keep in mind that you're going to need chuche to pop it if you need to have shenshen banish or just mill it for qinglong,etc. Either way fun deck to bust down your opponents card effects"

Let's go through the deck card by card explaining why those cards are in this deck.

1x Dark Magician-2500 beatstick which is hard to get off the field if not Trap Holed 'cuz no matter you have 6 removal cards, still if it hits the field you could easily just start summoning monsters and go for more and more damage every single turn killing your opponent if he does not have some kind of luck to get Dark Hole, since Fissure if you have Dark Magician and Silver Fang on the field for example cannot destroy Dark Magician and can only destroy Silver Fang.

1x Gaia the Fierce Knight-same reason as with Dark Magician

3x Silver Fang-this card is best 1200 ATK monster 'cuz it is the only low level monster with the higher stats that can be boosted by an equip spell which would be Beast Fangs

3x Hitotsu-Me Giant-has highest stats for a low level monster and cannot be taken down by a level 4 or below monster if there was no equip spell on that monster if it had 1200 ATK, or if there weren't 2 equip spells if it had 800 ATK.

3x Mammoth Graveyard-same reasons as Hitotsu-Me Giant

3x Kagemusha of the Blue Flame-second higher stats for a low level monster being 800 ATK and it can also be boosted with Legendary Sword. Also since Gaia is also a warrior it makes us to use less space on equip spells so we can play our 9 staple pack

3x Nemuriko-same reasons like with Kagemusha of the Blue Flame, but instead of Legendary Sword here is for her Book of Secret Arts

3x Dark Gray-same reasons like with Kagemusha of the Blue Flame, but instead of Legendary Sword here is Beast Fangs

2x Kurama-I think this is last 800 ATK monster in the Vol. 1 set which was only avaible set back then so it mades it the last best monster in the set. It has no equip spell supports but if your opponent uses a monster with lower ATK and doesn't have equip spell in hand he cannot get over it unless he gets Silver Fang, Hitotsu or Mammoth or 800 ATK monster+equip spell that supports that monsters type.

Until tomorow and a Booster 1.

3x Legendary Sword-this boosts Gaia and Kagemusha, and it can boost Gaia to be even stronger then Dark Magician

3x Book of Secret Arts-boosts Dark Magician and Nemuriko, also it makes Dark Magician being an unstopable force if your opponent doesn't have Dark Hole or Fissure if you just summoned Magician

3x Beast Fangs-boosts Silver Fang making it strongest low level monster and also boosts Dark Gray

3x Dark Hole-perfect board wipe to get rid of your opponent's monsters and can also take down both Gaia and Dark Magician

3x Fissure-destroying a monster is pretty good if it has high stats like Dark Magician, only downside is that it destroys monster with lowest ATK which can be and doesn't have to be a problem.

3x Trap Hole-if our opponent summons Gaia, Dark Magician, Fang, Hitotsu or Mammoth we can just automaticaly get rid of it and that is awesome 'cuz it leaves our opponent open and it can help in push making sometimes."

This was 1 of the 2 beatdown decks during this era and this format was here until March. Just for yall' to remember there was not a banlist nor limited list during this time. Silver Fang beatdown was much better 'cuz this was also the 1st deck that could brick like Monarchs today. So going a card by card expleining why those are in here:

3x Dark Magician-2500 beatstick which is hard to get off the field if not Trap Holed 'cuz no matter you have 6 removal cards, still if it hits the field you could easily just start summoning monsters and go for more and more damage every single turn killing your opponent if he does not have some kind of luck to get Dark Hole, since Fissure if you have Dark Magician and Silver Fang on the field for example cannot destroy Dark Magician and can only destroy Silver Fang.

3x Mammoth Graveyard-same reasons as Hitotsu-Me Giant

3x Kagemusha of the Blue Flame-second higher stats for a low level monster being 800 ATK and it can also be boosted with Legendary Sword. Also since Gaia is also a warrior it makes us to use less space on equip spells so we can play our 9 staple pack

3x Nemuriko-same reasons like with Kagemusha of the Blue Flame, but instead of Legendary Sword here is for her Book of Secret Arts

1x Dark Gray-same reasons like with Kagemusha of the Blue Flame, but instead of Legendary Sword here is Beast Fangs

3x Legendary Sword-this boosts Gaia and Kagemusha, and it can boost Gaia to be even stronger then Dark Magician

3x Book of Secret Arts-boosts Dark Magician and Nemuriko, also it makes Dark Magician being an unstopable force if your opponent doesn't have Dark Hole or Fissure if you just summoned Magician

3x Beast Fangs-boosts Silver Fang making it strongest low level monster and also boosts Dark Gray

3x Dark Hole-perfect board wipe to get rid of your opponent's monsters and can also take down both Gaia and Dark Magician

3x Fissure-destroying a monster is pretty good if it has high stats like Dark Magician, only downside is that it destroys monster with lowest ATK which can be and doesn't have to be a problem.

3x Trap Hole-if our opponent summons Gaia, Dark Magician, Fang, Hitotsu or Mammoth we can just automaticaly get rid of it and that is awesome 'cuz it leaves our opponent open and it can help in push making sometimes.

Just to ask, did you know that Blue-Eyes White Dragon was supposed to be in this set, but was removed after and was added to the game later?"

First we get the Dinomorphia fusion, then the terrible Icejade support, and now this piece of garbage deck.

Before reading further, I will strongly warn everyone intent on reading this miserable guide that <em>Mysterune as of right now is terrible.</em> I'm not innovative enough to actually come up with anything interesting with this deck; Sky Striker Mysterune has anti-synergy, but Musket Rune seems decently playable at the very least. I'm sure somebody else has made a list on that though. <strong>If you're looking for a fun, interactive deck, you're looking in the wrong place. If you want to make your opponents mald, then you've come to the right place.</strong>

&nbsp;

<span><strong>How to play Mysterune</strong></span>

I don't even know what to say. This miserable deck actively encourages you to deck your Opponent out, especially with that battle-phase skip. Without even reading any of the cards, <strong><a data-name=""Lord of the Heavenly Prison"">Lord of the Heavenly Prison</a></strong> and <strong><a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a></strong> being in the same deck should be plenty giveaway to the gameplan. You flip Skill Drain, and stall your opponent to death. What are they going to do? <em>Summon a beatstick with more than 3k ATK while Skill Drain is up?</em>

If you fancy decking your opponent out a little faster, <strong>Munnin, Wings of the Mysterune</strong> can search <strong>Deceit of the Mysterune</strong>, which is why we play it at 1 copy. The dog can recycle the continuous and the field spell too ig.

tldr: flip skill drain, then you deck them out.

I really don't know what to say about the gameplan, and I have no clue who would find this sort of gameplay fun, so I guess I'll go over some interactions and potential (and highly questionable) tech options.

<strong>Lord of the Heavenly Prison</strong>: I'm pretty sure anyone who's run into Eldlich in competitive knows what this thing does already. I'll just mention that this thing also searches spells. <strong>You have access to your whole ass deck with this card</strong><strong>.</strong> If you want to search either <strong>Spring of the Mysterune</strong> or the other field spell in here whose name I will not utter, set <strong>Metaverse</strong> or <strong>Terraforming</strong>. I have accidentally set the actual field spell and paid dearly for it on multiple occasion.

<strong><a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a></strong>: This deck is already a war crime, may as well go the full mile. Mysterune plays pretty much fine under Mine, and I'd argue you can deck them out even better since Skill Drain shuts down <strong><a data-name=""Mysterune of the Freezing Curse"">Mysterune of the Freezing Curse</a></strong>.

<strong><a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a></strong>: Flex spots, I just slapped Solemn in here because I couldn't think of anything else.

<strong>Handtrap Pile</strong>: This deck can't play going-second for shit. Handtrap brigade is here to alleviate this deck's terrible performance when playing second to a degree. Technically flex spots, you can also play whatever the hell you want in here. I prefer handtraps over going-second options for game 1 as handtraps do still add more interruptions for you if you win the dieroll.

<strong>Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell</strong>: <strong>Infinite Impermanence </strong>and <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> both go offline when Skill Drain is up. If you know for a fact you're going first, feel free to replace some handtraps with more potent going-first options during siding.

Other than that, the side deck is entirely up to personal preference. I'd say to play what works for you instead of netdecking this horrid thing and assuming its playable.

<span><strong>Terrible Tech</strong></span>:

<strong>Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries</strong>: The Extra Deck hardly matters. Only the six Mysterune fusions come up mostly. If you're expecting to fight various decks, or just have certain cards/archetypes you just hate with all your soul, feel free to play this in either the main or the side.

<strong><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong>: Ditto.

<strong><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a></strong>: This could totally go into Effect Veiler or Imperm's slot, but this deck has a grand total of like 1 way to deal with a giant-ass Nibiru Token. I wouldn't count on your chances of having that immediately available. Also, Nib is a level 10 so there is potential Xyz play potential with Sky Prison.

<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Liebe&lt;/strong&gt;: ""><strong></strong></a><a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Liebe"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Liebe</a>: This also includes Gustav Max. I don't know when this will ever come in handy since you can't even enter Battle Phase, but idk I'm not your dad play whatever the hell you want.

<strong><a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a></strong>: All I'm saying is that this thing is searchable from Sky Prison which you can use to make a Rank 10. Also another body you can hide behind with Skill Drain up since it's a fat body.

<strong><a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a></strong>: If you're playing the above, you may as well for the fun of it. There is close to zero actual practicality since Skill Drain is just going to turn it into a fat body anyway, but whatever.

<strong>More Mysterune Cards</strong>: I mean, if you adamantly refuse to play Mine and Skill Drain, you can just play the other Mysterune cards. They're pretty bad but hey, do what you like.

<strong>More War Crimes</strong>: If you want to go the <strong>extra </strong>mile, you can totally play a larger Mystic Mine engine in here, and literally ONLY use the Mysterune cards as a way to deck your opponent out a bit faster (or make it so they deck out first). I haven't tried this, but it's out there.

&nbsp;

Yeah this deck is terrible to play, and to play against. I have yet to not be called a slur whilst playing this deck on EDOPro. The games last upwards of 40-50 turns, with minimal gameplay. You kind of just sit there and watch your opponent cope under Skill Drain... Give this deck a try if you have a shit ton of time and nothing to spend it on, I guess."

Anyways, this is Timelord Burn with Kaijus! Timelords are an archetype of Level 10 Fairy monsters that most of them share the effects of being able to be normal summoned without tribute if you control no monsters, have 0 ATK and DEF, can't be special summoned from the Main Deck without the help of a certain card, they can't be destroyed by battle or card effect, they shuffle themselves back into the main deck on your Standby Phase, and they all have activated effects if they do battle. With these abilities, Timelords are built innately as a Control or Stall deck, waiting for certain cards to finish the game. Let's talk about how we're doin' this.

We're running only 3 of the Timelords and a Timelord support in Time Maiden. Our 3 Timelords are Metaion, Michion, and Raphion. Metaion bounces every monster on the field back to the hand (or Extra Deck) except itself and deals 300 burn damage for each monster bounced. While the burn on this is mediocre at best, it excels in removing Extra Deck monsters with certain protections. Michion, our second Timelord, straight up HALVES the opponent's LP after combat. This makes Michion the single best Timelord to open as it basically reads ""Deal 4000 Damage to your opponent's LP on your first turn if this card makes it past the Battle Phase."" While he's weaker later, this strong start can be enough for our burn traps and our last Timelord to finish the job. A neat little interaction with this is that Michion's effect IS NOT effect damage, so it gets around cards that negate effect damage, like Destiny Hero Decider. That's likely because it doesn't say something like ""Your opponent takes effect damage equal to half their LP."" Now, our last Timelord, Raphion, burns the opponent for an amount of LP equal to the ATK of a monster it battled, so what you wanna do with Raphion is attack your opponent's biggest monster for huge damage. And we'll finish off with our Timelord support, and probably the single best card in this deck, Time Maiden. She's a Level 1 Fairy with 0 ATK and DEF who can special summon herself if you control no monsters. She's treated as 2 materials for a tribute summon of a Timelord, can tribute herself to search for a Timelord from your deck, and can banish herself from the GY to special summon a Timelord from your deck and ignoring its summon condition of not being able to do so. She does the most important thing this deck needs to do that doesn't rhyme with ""ramage"" (not a real word but I digress) and that is cycling your Timelords and being sure you always have one on the ready! Basically she's a 2-for-1 and that's why she's the most vital card in this deck. You can probably get away with running 1 or 2, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you do so. ""Why not run the trap cards for the archetype?"" Don't get me wrong, Infinite Light is a GOOD card for the archetype, but the thing is: the archetype is what we call BAD, and we kinda wanna run more damage style traps to close games than play a control game.

Kaijus, why? Well, this deck has legs when it goes First, but with Kaijus, its Going Second game is on another level. Its just generically good to use 'em to get rid of certain pesky boss monsters your opponent might spew out turn 1, so we're running 9. 3 Gadarla, 3 Thunder King, and 3 Jizukiru. These are all Rare Quality and that's why we're running them. I'm not crafting 3 Gameciel when we have 4 unique Kaijus that do the same god damn thing. Plus, sometimes bigger is better if we wanna use Raphion to attack into one. A pleasant thing I figured out is that Gadarla is Wind attribute, so you can tribute off a pesky Wind Barrier Statue if your opponent is playing Simorgh. Its not like you special summon that much, but GOD DAMN Time Maiden is so good.

Now our Spell/Trap lineup, and we'll start with the Spells. The only other SR in this deck that isn't Time Maiden is Pot of Extravagance, which is a generically good card that you can use in a lot of different decks. It allows you to banish 3 or 6 cards from the Extra Deck for you to draw 1 card for each. Honestly, this is basically Pot of Greed because this deck does not give a single shit about the Extra Deck. 2 and a half copies of Pot of Greed seems pretty good to me. Our only other Spell is Book of Moon, which we run at 2. Its a Quick-Play that flip's a monster face-down. It can be used to get rid of nasty effects on your opponent's field, or with good timing, it can even be used to keep a Timelord from shuffling itself back into the Main Deck, allowing you to use its effect again. Its versatility is almost unmatched.

Our Traps, which allow us to close games out or to stall them for a better chance to win. Waboku prevents battle damage from being taken and prevents your monsters from being destroyed by battle. This honestly came up a lot more than you'd think. It can really bail you out if your opponent negates a Timelord's effects. Dimension Wall is one of the most underrated cards in this deck. Its ability to to possibly negate lethal damage and reflecting it to your opponent is unmatched and I learned that very soon after I reached Gold with the deck. Bad Luck Blast is basically baby Ring of Destruction. It deals half the ATK of a monster and doesn't destroy it, but at least it deals 1000 burn damage if its destroyed by an opponent's card. ""Why not run Ring of Destruction then?"" Because by the time Ring of Destruction comes into play, you can't use it. Ring of Destruction forces you to target an opponent's minion that has equal to or less ATK than their LP, so it can't close game out without having exact lethal. Plus it can only be used during your opponent's turn. Bad Luck Blast can be used during your turn too and can choose ANY of your opponent's monsters, making it a more flexible tool to close the game. Secret Barrel is here to do a bit of burn damage too. I wanted to run Just Desserts, but there's 2 things with that: 1: Its an SR, so its not really worth crafting. And 2: if your opponent bothers to read your cards, they're probably gonna play VERY passive so they won't summon monsters. I've gone against Sky Strikers who use Afterburner on their own link monsters so Raphion couldn't hit it for game. Now for spot removal: 2 Compulsory Evacuation Device and a Dogmatika Punishment. Honestly, you can replace Punishment for a 3rd CED, it might not do what you want and its possible you turn off your final Fake Pot of Greed. I had 3 in a previous build with Extra Deck monsters with way too many ATK so it'll break nearly anything, but its not worth it.

Now the extra deck, and this is the magic of it. In short, sweet, and simple words: The Extra Deck doesn't matter. You can put quite LITERALLY ANYTHING IN. Hell, this could be good for that Xyz Festival Event, just throw in 15 Xyz monsters and you'll banish 'em anyway. The only Extra Deck monsters you can care for are the Cannons, Rank 10 Xyz monsters and that's only because every Timelord is Level 10 and Zeus, which is a Quick Effect board wipe on a giant body, but don't be sad if you banish 'em all in 1 go.

And that's really it for the deck! It's a very consistent deck that can catch a lot of players off guard. It plays exceptionally well against Maxx ""C"" because you don't really care to special summon, but Ash Blossom will freakin' hurt your turn, especially if it hits your Time Maiden's effect. As a note to anyone reading that wants to know how to go against Timelords: don't attack them without a reason. They get their effects whenever they do battle, and if you couldn't read the card, it applies to both turns. You don't wanna give Raphion 2 activations of burn in 1 life cycle of him. Also, while they do have formidable protections, they are still INCREDIBLY fragile. Negating their effects (I.E. with Dark Ruler No More) allows them to be destroyed and they will take battle damage, they can be easily be bounced back (I.E. with Compulsory Evacuation Device or Knightmare Unicorn), and you can flip them face down (I.E. Book of Moon) so they can be destroyed by card effects then. I hope this explains a lot about what the deck is capable of and how you can avoid screwing yourself with effect damage, and thank you for taking the time to read this!"

Do everything you can to mill all your archetype-specific cards, along with Mezuki to build a powerful graveyard that buffs your King of the Skull Servants to ridiculous levels. Prioritize milling Wightbaking when you can, but remember its sent-to-grave effect is once per turn. Wightmare makes King of the Skull Servants a perfect target for Allure of Darkness. And Wightprincess makes a surprisingly effective hand trap when not being used as a combo piece. Further, almost every card in the deck is live from turn one, because even if you don't draw your mill cards, even the lowly Skull Servant itself can be used to link into a Linkuriboh or Relinquished Anima, which can get you started or buy you time.

The Rokket engine and Orcust engine synergize well for you to end on hot red, borrel savage, and galatea with a crescendo and plenty of card advantage. Alternatively, you can go down the Rusty &amp; Dingirsu line and set up a pop 2 + VFD on your opponents turn. To close out games, Orcust makes Accesscode seamlessly or you can use rank 4's to go into Arc Rebellion.

The overall strategy is to swarm the field with warriors in order to link or overlay into more powerful monsters until you draw into Polymerization and can summon Amazoness Empress. It's easy enough to get the materials needed, so summoning multiple Empresses creates a difficult-to-break lock. The deck also plays Dimension Guardian to grant a single Empress the same protection, or to serve as a possible alternative win condition by equiping Amazoness Swords Woman, who can then crash multiple times into your opponent's monsters with impunity."

Konami seems to love Dinomorphia/Dinorphia, because they gave this deck a really weird tech option: The Supreme King's Soul. A Normal Trap that requires you to pay half your LP...in a control deck all about paying half your LP to activate Normal Traps.

&nbsp;

And if your opponent activates a Spell, you can banish Supreme King's Soul from your GY and ZAR-C from your field to summon Crystal Wing or Crystal Clear Wing from your Extra Deck! Crystal Wing and Crystal Clear Wing are both negates that can work during either player's turn, so they are by far the best targets for Supreme King's Soul that you can put in this Deck!

&nbsp;

And since Jurassic World: Dominion was trending on Twitter days ago...Well, you know why I named this deck ""Dinomorphia Dominion."""

I got to Platinum 1 in 2 nights with a roughly 80% win rate.,"The recipe I used to get Plat 1. It's built more for best average results against the widest array of master duel decks, rather than peak power output from comboing. I've seen some builds that can end with more negates on board but get interrupted harder or sacrifice versatility against certain decks. Why yes, I have indeed cut a Maxx ""C"". I don't really believe in the card, as the opponent is likely to have 5-8 cards (3 ash, 2 called by, 3 crossout) that out Maxx""C"" than you are to have Maxx ""C"", and so the real use for Maxx ""C"" is to bait out the opposing ash blossom when going second. Other than that it's more of a ""win more"" card for decks that get to combo off but then also have Maxx ""C"" in hand to punish the opponent for trying to break their board.

The Cherubini &gt; Bardiche &gt;Rhongo + Gossip shadow line is really only here for going first against 0 hand traps. The instant you get interrupted it's best to simply bail out into Requiem + Fog blade or Requiem + Wing to protect it from raigeki/lightning storms.

This recipe is also somewhat old, and the reason for 2 Droplet is that I simply didn't have a third at the time. Looking at this list now I'd likely cut the Nibiru for the 3rd copy of Droplet.

I can't really say anything other than it's a competent archetype with decent tools. The most important thing for climbing ranks in master duel is and always will be to simply be patient and actually read cards; both yours and your opponent's. Oh and to recognize the skill level of your opponent. If they try to ash a danger you can probably rely on them to also not read fog blade, or to sequence their moves wrong to create advantage for you."

It's basically Zoodiac, except you have to summon 2 monsters instead; and instead of using a 1500 damage direct attack, you will use a 4000 ATK beatstick

2 Level 4 D/D monsters can overlay into <a data-name=""D/D/D Wave King Caesar"">D/D/D Wave King Caesar</a>. This is much easier to achieve now that we have the new Lvl 4 D/D monster: <a data-name=""D/D Gryphon"">D/D Gryphon</a>, being the Bora of this Deck. The new Xyz, <a data-name=""D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex"">D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex</a> can overlay on top of <strong>ANY</strong> D/D/D monster. <a data-name=""Number 84: Pain Gainer"">Number 84: Pain Gainer</a> can overlay on top of a Rank 8-10 DARK Xyz. Guess what's a Rank 10 DARK Xyz? Exactly, <a data-name=""D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex"">Machinex</a> is. <a data-name=""Number 77: The Seven Sins"">Number 77: The Seven Sins</a> can overlay on top of <a data-name=""Pain Gainer"">Pain Gainer</a>.

Combo your opponents to death with the classic dragunity loop combo and make 3+ interruptions...

jokes!

Remus + 1 discard gets you into Areadbhair, Crystal Wing, Savage and Heavenly Spheres via the Gae Durg Combo. Heavenly Spheres SS target will be Parlor and Parlor can pitch whatever you need that hasn't been in the gy yet. The small Dragonmaid package is for the Damage push as well as the grind game. Sometimes can also get into Sheou for additional negate if your Synchro Dragons get mopped.

A neat control deck revolving around the new vampire support from Battle of Chaos,"Vampires gives eldlich more options and can be used to OTK and steal your opponents cards.

Theres a few neat tricks like using vampire ghost + sucker to tribute summon a vampire on your opponent's turn but its very difficult to have that scenario setup without adding more bricky high level vampires."

Great summons and searching. Generally what you want in a good deck.,"Hello people, this is my first deck and personally my fav, but you don't care about that and no one reads these anyway.

The strategy for this deck is to either overwhelm your opponent with Eldlich, or just OTK the living Christ out of them with Numeron. You generally want to go second with this deck for the OTK and you have plenty of hand traps to deal with pretty much anything. If you get <a data-name=""Cursed Eldland"">Cursed Eldland</a> along with a spell/ trap in your hand, you can get an Eldlich on the board, pop one of your opponents cards or destroy Eldland and set Scarlet Sanguine to try and set up for next turn.

The Numeron part of this deck is pretty braindead, so I'm sure even someone who relies on Dragoon for the entire match (You know the people I'm talking about) could figure it out.

Anyway, I'm always happy to take <span>CONSTRUCTIVE</span> criticism, and have a good day."

Master Duel.
","Hi all,

Thank you for checking out my deck profile for Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. This ABC list has taken me to Platinum 1 for the first 2 seasons of Master Duel.

I'll list out your main play below, all you need is <em>Union Hangar</em> OR an <em>ABC</em> piece and <em>Unauthorized Reactivation.</em>

Activate Union Hangar -&gt; Search B

Summon <em>B</em> -&gt; Attach <em>Union Driver</em> from Deck

Activate <em>Union Driver</em> to banish -&gt; Attach <em>A</em> from Deck

Special Summon <em>A</em> -&gt; Link Summon Using <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> for <em>Union Carrier</em>

<em>B</em> Chain Link 1 to add <em>C</em> -&gt; <em>A</em> Chain Link 2 to add back <em>B</em> from GY

<em>Union Carrier</em> effect to attach <em>Photon Orbital</em> to <em>Union Carrier</em> -&gt; <em>Photon Orbital</em> effect to search for <em>Galaxy Soldier</em>

<em>Galaxy Soldier</em> effect to send <em>A</em> to GY to special summon -&gt; <em>Galaxy Solider</em> effect to search for <em>Galaxy Soldier</em>

<em>Galaxy Soldier</em> effect to send <em>B</em> to GY to special summon -&gt; Overlay both <em>Galaxy Soldier's</em> to XYZ summon <em>Cyber Dragon Nova</em>

XYZ summon <em>Cyber Dragon Infinity</em> using <em>Cyber Dragon Nova</em> as material -&gt; Special Summon <em>ABC-Dragon Buster</em> by banishing A, <em>B</em>, &amp; <em>C</em> from GY

This is your bread and butter combo. ABC thrives in simplified game states as a top-deck Union Hangar late into the duel is full combo. The only change I would make to the list is swapping out the final Infinite Impermanence for the third Forbidden Droplet."
