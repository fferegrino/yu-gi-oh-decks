It was somewhat inspired by an earlier tournament version of the deck. The goal is to use the resilience of Albaz to get out some of the Dark Magician's win conditions such as the Dragon Knight combo or the Dragoon. Because of the how the Albaz deck works, I found that Albaz's cards can kinda deal with most threats on win duels on its own. I would want to be able to get out a Dragon Knight combo a bit faster, but you will likely last long enough to bring it out for duels. That, or you won't need it.</p>"

Jet bounces a card and will summon itself back from the GY for free basically, Dragon Spirit banishes S/T every time it's specialed so you're usually atleast sniping one thing with it per time, Alternative Blue-Eyes actually has good use since you can destroy the Ken you give them then use it as material for a rank 8, Giantrainer is just... more draws.

C101,"<p>Hello and welcome to another guide, where I'll be explaining how to FTK with C9. Here, C101 will play an important role in that regard. Let's jump into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mIXRzhVXLw"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" cards.</p><p>2) Make sure you have 2 x Level 4 monsters at your side to XYZ Summon Gunkan. Utilize either Saryuja or ""Monster Reborn"" and while at it, activate ""Black Garden"".</p><p>3) Overlay into C101 with ""Barian's Force"" by using Gunkan as material. If you have planted flowers to opposing side and Special Summoned with ""Monster Reborn"", you can gift them to opponent by playing ""Mystic Box"". Destroy a rose to give it and then, attach said monster as material for C101. You can also reset C101 with Book spells, for your information.</p><p>4) Your aim should be to have at least 10 materials with C101 but the more, the merrier. When you think it's enough, overlay into ""Barian Hope"" via C101. Then, activate ""Clockwork Night"" to change the type of all monsters on the battlefield to&nbsp;<strong>Machine.</strong></p><p>5) With required type/attribute/rank present, activate ""Astral Force"" to jump into ""Number 9"" and lead the way with ""Barian's Force"" to C9.</p><p>6) Activate both abilities of C9 for the FTK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 9: Dyson Sphere"" can be found within ""Colossal Mech"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force"" + ""Number C101"" + ""CXyz Barian Hope"" can be found within ""Sword of the Seventh One"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Centurion's a fairly small engine, and you can play it in a variety of decks that don't block Synchro Summons, although playing it pure or with a couple of small resource engines splashed in feels like the most optimal move, since you can fit plenty of non-engine staples to supplement and insure plays.</p><p>The basic Centurion strategy is this: simple combos that spit out Level 8 and Level 12 Synchros left and right, during your turn and during your opponent's turn with the help of your Field Spell. Your main-deck Centurions will be constantly shifting between being monsters and being Continuous Traps - the fact that they're Traps allow you to use their effect to Special Summon themselves during the opponent's turn, and the cards all work together to protect each other when they're not tagging in and out - Primera protects your high-level cards from effect destruction, Legatia provides your low-strength cards with battle immunity, and Stand-Up Centurion! protects itself when a Centurion monster exists. It's an incredibly easy strategy to pick up, but where the average player separates from the advanced is how you follow-up - you might be able to King Calamity your opponent once in a while, but if that gets blocked, utilizing your surviving pieces is crucial for you to build back, which this deck can do if it really needs to.</p><hr /><p>Basic Centurion Combo - 1.5 card combo (requires <strong>Stand-Up Centurion! + 1 other card)</strong>, survives Droll, cannot be Nibiru'd:</p><ol><li>Activate&nbsp;<strong>Stand-Up Centurion!</strong></li><li>Use&nbsp;<strong>Stand-Up Centurion!</strong>, discard 1 card for cost<ul><li><em>Resolve:&nbsp;</em>Place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> from Deck into S/T Zone as Continuous Trap</li></ul></li><li>Use&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve: </em>Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> from S/T Zone</li><li><em>On Resolution:</em> Trigger&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong><br /><ul><li><em>Resolve</em>: Add&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Normal Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong></li><li>Activate&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:&nbsp;</em>Place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong> from Field into S/T Zone and place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong> from Deck into S/T Zone</li></ul></li><li>Use&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:</em> Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong> from S/T Zone</li></ul></li><li>Synchro Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Legatia</strong> using&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong><ul><li><em>On Summon:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>Trigger&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Legatia</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Draw 1 card</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><em>During End Phase</em>: Activate&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Legatia</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:</em> Place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> from GY into S/T Zone.</li></ul></li><li><em>During Opponent's Turn, when it's safe:</em> Use&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> CL1, Use <strong>Centurion Trudea</strong> CL2<ul><li><em>Resolve</em>: Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong> from S/T Zone and increase its Level to 8; Special Summon <strong>Centurion Primera</strong> from S/T Zone</li><li><em>On Resolution:&nbsp;</em>Trigger&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera&nbsp;</strong>CL1, Trigger <strong>Stand-Up Centurion!</strong> CL2, Activate <strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong> from GY CL3 targeting&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:</em> Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI&nbsp;</strong>from GY and place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong> into S/T Zone; Synchro Summon&nbsp;<strong>whatever Synchro is best for the situation</strong>;&nbsp;add&nbsp;<strong>whatever Centurion card is best follow-up for next turn</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><p>The best play (until it inevitably gets banned) is to summon&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Dragon</strong>, then using its Quick Effect immediately to summon&nbsp;<strong>Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity</strong>, which will lock your opponent out of all on-field effects for the rest of their turn, allowing you to run with that momentum for the remainder of that Duel.</p><p>If you start with&nbsp;<strong>Emblema of Oath</strong>, you can use that to Set&nbsp;Stand-Up Centurion! from your Deck and make plays like normal.</p><p>If you start with&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong>, you can Normal Summon Primera to add Stand-Up Centurion! to your hand. From there, you activate Stand-Up, use its effect to discard to place Trudea into the S/T Zone, Special Summon it, then continue plays from step 5.</p><p>If you start with&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong>, you can Normal Summon Trudea, use its effect to place Primera into the S/T Zone, Special Summon Primera, add and activate Stand-Up, then use Stand-Up to place Emet VI into the S/T Zone. From there, continue plays from step 6.</p><p>If you have all the combo pieces you need while you're building during your first turn, add <strong>Truth Centurion</strong> instead of a second Stand-Up or another Centurion monster - this gets you an omni-negate for next turn in case the opponent has a strong hand or GY effect to try to break you. During your opponents turn, for the Primera search, I like adding&nbsp;<strong>Faith of Centurion</strong> on the off-chance your Legatia is outed during the turn - you can use it to recoup the Primera that Legatia would have re-placed, giving you material for another Synchro on your turn.</p><hr /><p>Now for the side engines and unorthodox staples.</p><p>A minimal <strong>Bystial package with 1 Magnamhut and 3 Druiswurm</strong> acts as powerful GY disruption, can provide bodies on the board for defense, and provide strong effects. Druiswurm's non-destruction removal is always solid when it gets triggered, and Magnamhut can either fetch a Druiswurm or recoup a lost Signer Dragon. In addition, them all being Level 6 opens up the Level 10 Synchro package of <strong>Chaos Angel and Baronne de Fleur</strong>, in case your initial plays get interrupted and you only have Primera on-board.</p><p>Two <strong>Kashtira Fenrir</strong> give you a good option going first or second - you can summon the first, search the second, then use the second as your discard fodder for Stand-Up. And of course, there's its second effect that banishes one of your opponent's cards face-down if they use a monster effect. Finally, it being Level 7 opens up the Level 11 Synchro package without wasting your Normal Summon on Ash Blossom - specifically, <strong>Psychic End Punisher.</strong></p><p>Because of the large amount of space for hand traps, I've elected to run a <strong>Crossout Designator</strong> package, split between the Main and Side Decks. As good as this deck is against Droll and Nib, a well-timed Ash or Imperm can stop your plays if you didn't draw a second piece of follow-up. Splitting the negation between <strong>Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermenance</strong> gives you counterplay against both if you draw Crossout in your opening hand, and of course, running <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> at 3 is almost never a bad thing. There is also one copy of <strong>Nibiru</strong> in your Main Deck, in case you get the chance to go crazy - while a basic Centurion combo only performs four Summons, placing Fenrir or a Bystial on the board before that during the same turn will land you with a Primal Being Token as soon as Legatia is summoned. As for your Side Deck handtraps, you have two more copies of Nibiru for actual use, 1&nbsp;<strong>Droll and Lock Bird</strong>, just in case you're forced to use Terraforming or Prosperity, 1&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Ogre and Snow Rabbit</strong>, which would kill your Stand-Up if not countered, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Dimension Shifter</strong>, which is a Garnet for you but also shuts down a floodgate that would kill your ability to recoup resources.</p><p><strong>There Can Be Only One</strong> is just your average side-board floodgate. The only Centurions that match types are Legatia and Emet VI, meaning you can play under this card most of the time.</p><hr /><p>This is absolutely not the final version of the deck. Like all archetypes that originate from Deck Build Sets, there's likely going to be new support in future releases, and I didn't even elect to add&nbsp;<strong>Bonfire</strong> to this list, which is just another 1-3 copies of Trudea - I wanted to keep this list restrained to Valiant Smashers and earlier, to make it as accessible as possible to the earliest adopters of this archetype. Centurion has had incredible results in the OCG, and I'm looking forward to being one of the first to run it here in the TCG.</p>"

Destroy EVERY card the opponent has on summon is great especially since it can be summon on their turn and the fact that it burns for the combined original attack of every destroyed monster means an opponent could loss just by trying to push for lethal. The restriction on the burn damage might seem a little annoying but is in reality really easily to meet. The fact that monster is UNAFFECTED by other card's means that the opponent can't even negate it and if they somehow survive the burn damage they're gonna have a hell of a time getting off the field.

Play with FIVE copies of your most powerful Sky Striker card! <br /><br />Right now, blind second strategies are in a good position to tackle the meta because of the nerfs to Tearlaments - the only deck that does relatively well vs. boardbreakers. The dominant decks right now are Kashtira and Purrely, both decks that fold to boardwipes, Nibiru, and freely trigger Triple Tactics Thrust. Thrust searches the out for each of these decks, and you're free to go off with Sky Striker's unparalelled grindgame and boardbreaking potential! <br /><br />After the gamestate has been simplified, this is where Sky Strikers come in! in addition to having enough main deck space to fit in the mandatory ""Maxx C"" package (9 cards), the strategy can also comfortably fit powerspells like Lightning Storm, Dark Ruler No More, Raigeki and Triple Tactics Talent! The Sky Striker engine also has cards that excel at cracking boards like Widow Anchor and Afterburners.&nbsp;<br class=""ContentPasted0"" /><br class=""ContentPasted0"" />The time-tested strategy with blind second Sky Strikers is to destroy most if not all of your opponent's resources that they slap down on the board going first, and then close out the match with Sky Striker's grind game. This is done by setting up multi-role and if you cannot, you prioritize getting Engage! from deck and using it as much as possible especially with it's extra +1 draw.<br /><br />The current meta allows for Lightning Storm and Raigeki to obliterate most duelist's boards this format since they generally spend all their resources building their ""unbreakable"" board only to fall to 1-2 cards. For example, you can bait out your opponent's singular S/T negate (Like Spright Carrot/Baronne) with Afterburners then obliterate everything afterwards with Raigeki! If that's not enough, Raye and friends can clear the board very well during the battle phase and with Zeke's banish.&nbsp;</p><p><br class=""ContentPasted0"" />If your weakened opponent hasn't surrendered yet due to the sheer resource advantage and offensive pressure this deck generates, you can clear the board with a plethora of cards including Linkage, allowing Raye to OTK all by herself!<br /><br />This Sky Striker list is an updated version of my earlier Sky Striker decks, specifically for the October 2023 Masterduel metagame. <br /><br />Remember, RAYE IS BAE!!!</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Repeat until there is nothing to fetch with ""Primal Seed"".</p><p>5) After the activation of ""Soul Absorption"", activate Sage to discard everything in your hand.

Saturn+Trident,"<p>(<strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong>Keep an eye on how many Extra Deck cards your opponent have and plan accordingly.)</p><p>Greetings! Did you know there is another card similar to <a href=""/card/earthbound-greater-linewalker-10340"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Earthbound Greater Linewalker</strong></a>, seen in ""Side Deck""? Just like how Linewalker sets your opponent's LP to 3000, Pendransaction does the same but there is a catch: You need to have at least 15 more Extra Deck cards than your opponent. Thanks to Trident, you can setup in your favor. Let's get into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/AlsguTMnP_A"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Throughout the game, perform these actions below in preparation of Pendransaction:</p><ul><li>Use Pendulum ability of Garuda to destroy a spell/trap and deliver Garuda to Extra Deck as face-up.</li><li>Discard Alector + Saturn with Ravenous, even just one will do.</li><li>XYZ Summon ""Abyss Dweller"" by using 2 x Cthugua as materials and activate Abyss to not be disturbed by effects coming from your opponent's GY, which will be filled with Extra Deck monsters thanks to Trident later on.</li></ul><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" cards. For sake of convenience, banish Extra Deck monsters for Chaos Emperor, which are Librarian as DARK and Integrator as LIGHT.</p><p>3) If you have either Alector or Saturn in your hand but not both, Special Summon one of them via Saryuja. Then, make sure Alector + Flamvell is present on the battlefield, where you can also use ""Monster Reborn""...</p><ul><li>If board space is your concern, you can also add ""Offerings to the Doomed"", found in ""Side Deck"". However, it's vital to add Offerings if your opponent has only one Extra Deck card. Reason is that even though you can send only Saryuja to GY, how can you also send Trident to GY afterwards?</li></ul><p>4) Synchro Summon Trident with Alector + Flamvell. Then, activate Trident to send up to three of your monsters to GY, where you can also include Trident to send up to three Extra Deck cards to GY. If there are Extra Deck monsters present, focus on them first and repeat until your opponent has no Extra Deck cards. By reviving Trident and 1-2 more monsters with ""Monster Reborn"", you can repeat this step as many times as you can. As explained in #3, if your opponent has only one Extra Deck card, you have to add Offerings to clear Trident manually...</p><ul><li>Since Trident clears up to three board spaces, you can XYZ Summon Pendransaction by using Monk+Panda as materials. Never ever do with 2 x Cthugua, be warned.</li></ul><p>5) If you have depleted your opponent's Extra Deck via Trident, you can revive Saturn with ""Monster Reborn"" and activate ""The Sanctuary in the Sky""...</p><ul><li>If interested, know that you don't have to use Saturn + Sanctuary duo to FTK with Pendransaction. You can remove these two and add any FTK cards to your liking. You can check this <strong><a href=""/deck-search/?&amp;cardcode=Earthbound%20Greater%20Linewalker%7C&amp;author=154160&amp;offset=0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">link</a></strong> to see Linewalker decks, where you can add said FTK shenanigans but there is catch: For each new Extra Deck monsters, you have to add more of Pendulum monsters as Extra Deck face-up. Feel free to have a look at ""Side Deck"" for other Pendulum monsters you might add in the future.</li></ul><p>6) It's time to return Extra Deck cards to where they belong...</p><ul><li>If they are in BZ, ""Primal Seed"" is your best friend.</li><li>If they are in GY, ""Pot of Avarice"" + ""Pot of Generosity"" are your best friends.</li></ul><p>7) If you have done everything correctly, you should have 15 Extra Deck cards while your opponent has none. Finally, activate Pendransaction to set your opponent's LP to 3000 and tribute Saturn for the FTK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Abyss Dweller"" can be found within ""Forgotten City Dwellers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pendransaction"" can be found within ""Emerging Monstrosity Recon!"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Choose the outcome as&nbsp;<strong>heads&nbsp;</strong>to always skip your opponent's turn, at the cost of sending two of your monsters to GY.</p><p>3) Special Summon 2 x Level 1 dudes with Panda. Next, XYZ Summon Dullahan with these little dudes and overlay into Mischief.</p><p>4) Before jumping into End Phase, here is your checklist:</p><ul><li>Have you changed the button on the lower right corner of the screen to either ""ON"" or ""Auto to not miss anything?&nbsp;It can be changed within settings under ""Duel"", where you can change ""Activation Confirmation"" to ""Switch + Hold"" for manual setup.</li><li>Do you have monsters other than Mischief + Time Thief + Arcana trio? Don't forget to have at least two monsters for Arcana, so that you can skip your opponent's turn by sending them to GY.</li><li>Have you sent Balerdroch + Sabres to GY? You can either send both with Ravenous or hold them in-hand to send them into GY with ""Into the Void"".</li><li>Have you set Bird Sanctuary + DNA Surgery? These will come in handy later on.</li></ul><p>5) After your opponent's turn has been skipped, during your Standby Phase, Special Summon Balerdroch and activate the ability of Redoer to attach top of your opponent's Main Deck. Then, shuffle a card from your hand on top of your Main Deck to bring forth Sabres. When you end your turn, send Balerdroch + Sabres to GY for Arcana.</p><p>6) Repeat what was explained in #5 until Redoer has 6 materials attached and nothing more. Then, activate ""Bird Sanctuary"" and ""DNA Surgery"". By changing the type of every monster on the battlefield to&nbsp;<strong>Winged Beast,&nbsp;</strong>you can attach Redoer into Mischief via ""Bird Sanctuary"" for the victory!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Arcana Force XXI - The World"" + ""Light Barrier"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

C101+Barian Hope,"<p>Good day to you! Some time ago, I made a FTK based on <a href=""/deck/silent-chaotic-sphere-380092"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>C9</strong></a> with C101. Today, I decided to do the same thing but based on Number 43. Let me see...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5HWRrTDQpt0"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" cards.</p><p>2) Special Summon Yajiro via Saryuja. You have to place Yajiro at the center of the battlefield or Yajiro will detonate itself. Then, place Saryuja opposite to Yajiro with ""Shien's Spy"" and gift Yajiro with same card to rightmost side afterwards.</p><p>3) Set ""Waking the Dragon"" to where Yajiro can bounce. The reason is that when we revive a monster with ""Monster Reborn"" and place the monster at where said trap is, Yajiro will destroy Waking. This allows to Special Summon a monster from your Extra Deck. Repeat this process until you brought forth Number 43 + Number C101 + Reprodocus. Note that Reprodocus and C101 should point towards each other.</p><p>4) It's time to attach monsters with C101. Start with sucking Yajiro and then, reset its ability with Book spells to repeat as many times as possible. Then, revive a monster and gift to opposing side because C101 can only attach Special Summoned monsters from opponent's side of battlefield.</p><p>5) Meanwhile, enlarge your hand with ""Primal Seed"" cards by targeting each other and adding banished card as extra to your hand.</p><p>6) Repeat these steps explained in #4 + #5 until you think you had it enough. Then, replace C101 with Barian Hope, pointing towards Reprodocus.</p><p>7) If you have attached enough materials by repeating #4, Barian Hope should have good amount of ATK. You can boost even further by activating ""Stoic Challenge"".</p><p>8) If you have expanded your hand by repeating #5, ""Torpedo Takedown"" will work well in your favor. After changing the attribute of Barian Hope to WATER with Reprodocus, you can activate Torpedo by detaching a material from Barian Hope. While Torpedo deals damage in multiples of 400 for each card in your hand, same amount will be also granted to Barian Hope.</p><p>9) Thanks to last five steps, if executed well enough, the ATK of Barian Hope should be larger than your opponent's LP. If you recall, Number 43 was Special Summoned with ""Waking the Dragon"", explained in #3. Play ""Mystik Wok"" for the final blow by tributing Barian Hope and choosing its ATK. What is going to happen is that you will gain LP equal to ATK Barian Hope had and Number 43 will convert healing into damage against your opponent for lethal damage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Stoic Challenge"" can be found within ""Blazing Warriors"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Number C101"" + ""CXyz Barian Hope"" can be found within ""Sword of the Seventh One"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Level 9 Spotted ⚠️,"<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Dragonmaid really is not the best engine to be running if you want to get a Level 9 monster on board easily. I guess that this realistically is more of a&nbsp;<strong>Summoner of Illusions</strong> showcase for Prediction Princess than it is a ""Dragonmaid Prediction Princess"" Deck, but I'm still combing through all the Level 9 monsters in the game and putting them into a Prediction Princess Deck. Are there any actual benefits to playing Dragonmaid in Prediction Princess? Literally no. The Main Deck Dragonmaids in&nbsp;<strong>Chamber Dragonmaid</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Parlor Dragonmaid</strong> are very Normal Summon reliant and there is also no real good way to search a Dragonmaid monster through in-archetype cards except for <strong>Kitchen Dragonmaid</strong> which is yet another Normal Summon who is one of the worst searchers I've seen for an archetypal card. This Deck is using them in order to search&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Changeover</strong> which Fusion Summons&nbsp;<strong>House Dragonmaid</strong> out of the Extra Deck, getting you a Level 9 monster on the field whose Type and Attribute are perfect for&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> in this Deck. Yes, the days are over for us where we </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">""need"" to use Monstrosity because of&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong> access off of&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong>, but we are playing the best of both worlds in both a Monstrosity line and Instant Fusion for Master of Ham in this Deck. I do really like <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/ham-prediction-princess-378532/"">Ham Prediction Princess</a> and going all in to search for Instant Fusion for Ham access and I do think that is much better than bidding on Monstrosity, but I am currently experimenting with Prediction Princess making use of the various Level 9's in the game and seeing if they can actually make a functioning Deck.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For our Main Deck monsters: 3 <strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>. 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>. Again, I think that playing a combination of 5 Prediction Princess Ritual monsters consisting of some number of Tarotrei and some number of Tarotreith is a good Ritual Monster concentration for the Deck. However, I've had some time to dwell on Tarotreith and I figured that since it is the more ""important"" of the two Rituals for plays on your opponent's turn, I'd rather be playing a higher concentration of it. Tarotreith can be Ritual Summoned or Summoned from hand or GY via Tarotrei's End Phase effect. On Flip, it can Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down and as a Quick Effect, it can Flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. Tarotrei can Quick Effect Flip a monster face-up or face-down and can Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY in face-down Defense Position during the End Phase. 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> which on flip adds a Prediction Princess monster other than itself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand. If it's Tributed and sent to GY, it can Summon itself back face-down, and while on field, it gives your Ritual Monsters targeting and destruction protection. 2 <strong>Deus X-Krawler</strong> which negates all of your opponent's monsters' activated effects on field after it has been flipped face-up, and when it's destroyed on field, it can add a Level 9 with a different Type and Attribute than it from Deck to hand. I would play 1, but having another copy in Deck is good in case you drew one in your opening hand to still have Monstrosity live. You could play 1 <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> in place of the second Deus X, but that's up to you. 3 <strong>Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</strong> which adds a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell from Deck to hand on Normal or Flip Summon. When you don't have access to the Dragonmaid portion of your Deck or access to <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>, Manju helps you get to more of your Ritual pieces for your Prediction Princess plays. 1&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Ernus</strong> which is pretty much only here as a way to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Dragonmaid from hand by discarding it. Also, I guess it also acts as a Dragon monster for Fusion Material for House Dragonmaid. You could cut this card if&nbsp; you want, but having a way to get a Dragonmaid onto the field without using your Normal Summon and having an extra Dragon for Fusion Material just in case is pretty alright. 3&nbsp;<strong>Chamber Dragonmaid</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Parlor Dragonmaid</strong>. Chamber adds a Dragonmaid Spell/Trap from Deck on Summon and Parlor sends a Dragonmaid card from Deck to GY on Summon. Chamber will usually be searching&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Changeover </strong>for a Fusion Summon whereas Parlor will be sending either Changeover or&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Tidying</strong>. If you draw Parlor and another Dragon, you can send Changeover, Changeover bounces Parlor to hand to add back itself, and you can Fuse into House Dragonmaid from there. If you draw say Parlor and&nbsp;<strong>Foolish Burial</strong>, you can Normal Parlor to send Tidying, use Foolish to send Chamber, Tidying banish from GY to Summon Chamber from GY, and Chamber search Changeover for a Fusion Summon. 1&nbsp;<strong>Summoner of Illusions</strong> which on flip Tributes another monster to Special Summon a Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck which is destroyed during the End Phase. Mind you that this is a MANDATORY effect, but it works wonders in a Deck like this. So what are your options? Well, your best options are monsters who don't have an important effect that activates specifically on Fusion Summon, a way to negate cards and/or effects, or a generally good effect, but most importantly, they cannot say ""Must be Fusion Summoned"" or ""Must first be Fusion Summoned"". Let's go through them:</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>~ Naturia Exterio -</strong> This card is basically infinite Spell/Trap negates by banishing a card from GY and sending the top card of your Deck to the GY.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>~ Invoked Mechaba - </strong>&nbsp;This card can negate a Spell/Trap Card or monster effect by discarding a card of the same type. It's a very solid piece of interruption and negation.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>~ Dragonmaid Sheou </strong>-&nbsp; An omni-negate that bounces itself back to the Extra Deck afterwards to Summon a <strong>House Dragonmaid</strong> from Extra Deck. Excellent for this specific Deck.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">~ <strong>Eldlich the Mad Golden Lord </strong>- He cannot be destroyed by any card effect, including its own destruction via&nbsp;<strong>Summoner of Illusions</strong>'s effect during the End Phase. And if he sticks around, you can Tribute a Zombie, most likely being himself, on your turn to take control of a face-up monster your opponent controls, period.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>~ Despian Proskenion</strong> - During the Main Phase, it can Quick Effect banish a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link from your opponent's GY or Special Summon it to your field.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>~ Gaia Prominence, the Fierce Force</strong> - It's a bit of a stretch, but by discarding a card, you can negate an opponent's activated monster effect in the hand or GY.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">~ <strong>Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World -</strong> This substitutes an activated monster effect or an activated Normal Spell/Trap Card of your opponent with ""Your opponent discards 1 card."" This is a bit more situational as you can't activate this effect if you, yourself, have no cards in hand because that would make it an illegal activation. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>~ Mamonaka the Vaylantz United</strong> - During the Main Phase, it can Quick Effect target an Effect Monster in your opponent's Main Monster Zone and place it face-up in the Spell/Trap Zone in the same column as a Continuous Spell, but if that Zone is occupied, it's instead destroyed and your opponent is burned equal to its ATK.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">~ <strong>Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart</strong> - This card targets and shuffles a card your opponent controls into the Deck on Special Summon. It isn't as good as some of the other monsters here, but it is definitely a consideration somewhat, and it also is a Level 9 so it can technically act as a Monstrosity target on your opponent's turn.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">~ </span><strong style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Red-Eyes Dark </strong><strong>Dragoon </strong>- It cannot be destroyed or targeted by card effects, period. Yes, this includes <strong>Summoner of Illusion</strong><strong>s</strong>'s End Phase effect. You cannot pop cards with its first effect because it was not Fusion Summoned, meaning no Normal Monsters used for it Fusion Summon, but it is still an untargetable, indestructible omni-negate once per turn.</p><p>~ <strong>Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</strong> - If you are willing to play another Albaz Fusion in the Extra Deck, this card is a Quick Effect banish 1 monster on the field. And no, it cannot use its other effect to destroy all monsters your opponent controls during the End Phase if your opponent gets rid of it because it wasn't Fusion Summoned.</p><p>~ <strong>Rindbrumm the Striking Dragon</strong> - This card negates your opponent's activated Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link Monster's effect and returns a monster on field to the hand. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>~ Tearlaments Rulkallos</strong> -&nbsp; Rulkallos negates the activation of a card or effect that would Special Summon a monster(s) and sends a Tear from hand or field to GY, including itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>~ Dark Cavalry </strong>- As a non-once per turn, it can discard a card to negate an activated card or effect that targets a card on field. This includes your opponent targeting their own cards as well which gives it a lot more utility, but just like Gaia Prominence, it is only a consideration.</p><p>~ <strong>Millennium-Eyes Restrict&nbsp;</strong>- When your opponent activates a monster effect, it can target an Effect Monster on your opponent's field or in their GY and equip itself with that monster, gaining ATK/DEF equal to that monster's ATK/DEF and it negates the activated effects of all monsters with the same original name, and prevents them from attacking. Because we are also playing&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> in this Deck, it wouldn't hurt much to play this card because you can either use it as interruption or protect yourself against handtraps on your turn.</p><p>For Spell/Traps: 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong>. 3 <strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which can Ritual Summon a Prediction Princess from hand or GY face-up or face-down and it can banish itself during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. 1&nbsp;<strong>Foolish Burial</strong> to send a Dragonmaid for reasons I stated earlier or it can send Tarotrei or Tarotreith because Underworld Ritual can Ritual Summon from GY. 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which can Special a Level 9 from hand or target a Level 9 on field and Special Summon 2 Level 9's from Deck with a different name, different Type, and different Attribute. 1&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Changeover</strong> which can Fusion Summon a Dragon Fusion Monster using monsters from hand or field. If it's in GY, you can bounce a Dragonmaid you control to your hand and add this to your hand. 2&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Tidying</strong> which can target a Dragon monster you control and a card your opponent controls or in their Gy and return them to the hand. You can use this card for interruption if you draw it, but as for its GY effect, you can banish it to Special Summon a Dragonmaid from hand or GY which may come up in your combo. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>.</p><p>Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Naturia Exterio</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Sheou</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>House Dragonmaid</strong> which is our Level 9 target of choice for Monstrosity in this Deck. It can be made with a Dragonmaid and a Dragon monster. 1&nbsp;<strong>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham&nbsp;</strong>which can be Summoned via Instant Fusion and on Fusion Summon, it can Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down which gives you access to&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Alligator's Sword</strong> <strong>Dragon</strong> which can also be Summoned via Instant Fusion. If you draw Monstrosity and the Dragonmaid line, you don't need to go into Master of Ham for Bibliomuse, in that case, you can Summon Alligator's Sword Dragon for a Dragon for Fusion Material for House Dragonmaid. Your other options are <strong>Curse of Dragon, the Magical Knight Dragon</strong> and <strong>Darkfire Dragon</strong>. 1 <strong>Herald of the Arc Light </strong>to send off of <strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> for a Ritual Search. 1 <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>. 1 <strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong> which can detach any number of cards to pop the same number of cards and it can attach a monster it destroys by battle to itself as Xyz Material which makes it good for board clearing and making Zeus. 2 <strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> which sends a monster from Extra Deck to GY on Xyz Summon and it can detach materials to reattach monsters from GY which means you can recycle Herald for more searches. 1 <strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1 <strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong> for a Rank 9 option. 1 <strong>Gravity Controller</strong> to Link off Aggregator.</p><p>Side Deck: 2&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>, 3 <strong>Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju</strong>, 1 <strong>Kurikara Divincarnate</strong>, 3 <strong>Triple Tactics Thrust</strong>, 2 <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>, 1 <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>, and 3 <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>.&nbsp;</p>"

Consistency boosted with Lilith at the expense of a few hand traps. Only 1 reminder: Welcome Labrynth fiend locks, and stops Soul of the Supreme King from activating until the end of the next turn. Subsequently, if you reactivate it on your opponent's turn which extends the fiend lock. Usually you'll be searching for Big Welcome anyhow, but it's worth mentioning that you should activate Soul of the Supreme King before Welcome Labrynth. I'll mention some neat tech tips about this deck below.</p><p>1. Lilith allows you to set Labrynth engine or Soul of the Supreme King. It's completely random but at least you'll have plays either way. lol</p><p>2. Normal Summoned Lilith + Crush Card Virus = Board wipe/hand wipe for 1500+ Attack monsters.</p><p>3. Lilith can be summoned from the GY with Labrynth Labyrinth. Lilith can then tribute herself to set more traps to assist in the grind game.</p><p>4. For a 66.6% chance of pulling Soul of the Supreme King with Lilith, you can add 1 Trap Trick to the deck, and increase the number of Soul of the Supreme King copies to 2.</p><p>5.

There is a lot of room for optimization, particularly with the choice of Synchros, but it's a good start at the very least. Generally, your endboards should result in 2 Flare Metals + a Hieratic Seal/Synchro, 1 Flare Metal + a Hieratic Seal/2 Synchros, or a Hieratic Seal and 2 Synchros.</p><p>The Diabellstar engine in conjunction with the Resonator engine allows the deck to play through at least one or two hand traps or set up a board before using the normal summon with the right hand, and also gives the deck some additional draw power and consistency. That being said, if your opening hand only contains Resonators or Carboneddon and you do not have Foolish Burial or a Dragon Ravine, you can have a rough time.</p><p>Despite not being a synchro based archetype and not even having an archetypal tuner, I've found that Red-Eyes decks tend to be much more effective when they cut the fusions and focus more on Synchros.

Making the previously casual pend magicians in the tcg to a new level.</p><p>Supreme King Gate Magician (SKGM becomes one of the core cards the deck revolves around. Wings of light is a ROTA for supreme king gate cards.And the potential ability to double pend in 1 turn with pendulum evolution is incredible (though not really necessary)</p><p>The deck is very flexibile and has many multi-card combos depending on the hand with very low brick chances, but is relatively fragile as it almost plays into any handtrap and droll completely shuts it down.</p><p>The deck is also not very negate heavy with only baronne and vortex (and maybe unprotected apolussa) as their endboard negate + various other interactions from i:p and the time pendulumgraph, providing many interactions in the opponents turn and a stream of resources through Exceed the pendulum and star pendulumgraph, eventually either negating the opponent or dragging them into a grind game. The deck is a jack-of-all-trades kind of deck and can adapt different playstyles which is why I like it a lot</p><p><strong>Endboard:</strong></p><p>The deck aims for a 6 + 5 endboard filling all your available zones. usually including: Exceed the Pendulum (+1 or 2 magicians she can revive in your and your opponents turn), i:p, Baronne and Vortex in the monster zones;&nbsp; Double scales (including a magician), the 2 Pendulumgraphs and Pendulum Evolution (or a set wings of light) in the st zones.</p><p>A total of 2 omni negate and destroy, 1 targeted destroy from time pendulum graph, 2 targeted banishes from i:p into s:p (or 2-3 monster negates if going into apollusa). Ontop of that, star pendulumgraph for a +1 search, exceed the pendulum reviving sSKGM to +1 search</p><p><strong>Strats:</strong></p><p>The primary goal is to get SKGM to hand or scale and theres many ways to do it. with that and a high scale it is possible to combo off and it gets only better if there are additional things in hand to pend out.&nbsp;</p><p>Harmonizing is another high priority target, if you dont have it in hand then BTP will usually search her to make baronne post pend (which is also sadly the best nib window qwq) . Double Iris has the highest priority for the high scale (with the low scale usually being gate 0)</p><p>The priority between front and back row are a bit hard to judge but usually front is easier because how the pendulumgraphs are harder to search (by destroying double Iris), but usually if you can make a decent front row its possible to get the pendulumgraphs or at least 1 of them then the option is up to you</p><p>2x Darkwurm are played because you dont really want it in your hand but want to foolish it for that free ss but its a very good normal summon as well. It has a tricky scale effect too allowing you to search gate 0 or SKGM but locking you into pend summon darks only while its in scale and because its a 5 scale it will brick your magician pend summons, not recommended unless you have a way to remove it after pend</p><p>2x Gate 0 are played incase one of them gets removed, because they are hard to retrieve. If its on field, its a lv7 and a pop + ed special to trigger double iris and/or pend evolutions double pend effect by ss odd-eyes wing dragon (or any other valid fusion/synchro pend monster). Gate 0 poping Gate 0 is also a interesting tech. Gate 0 can place itself back to the scale if poped as a monster so you can almost trigger evolution for free</p><p>The double pend from pend evolution and searching for Astrograph have the lowest priority unless theres no other way to extend or you have enough resources to do so. After some playtesting pend evolution is not even mandatory for this build, but an occasional extender.</p><p>The one off lightwurm is usually used in the grind game and as a emergency high scale that can be searched off wings of light. Usually you will have SKGM in your faceup ed and a harmless gate 0 on your field. Normal lightwurm to add SKGM to your hand, special it out and go into psychic end punisher to pressure your opponent or into the 2nd set of BTP, ETP to extend once more</p><p>The single purple poison is not necessary but can come in handy at certain situations and is very searchable if needed</p><p>Destrudo is a 2nd target for foolish/dragon shrine, though it needs half your lp to special itself, it returns to the deck and is a tuner. The lp pay will eventually be able to boost your psychic end punisher to crazy stats.</p><p>Bystials can be extenders and interuption, given that many meta decks run dark/light monsters. Magnamut can search duiswurm or dark/lightwurm to either interupt further or extend next turn. In your own turn, they can also banish BTP in the gy to ss themselves to extend, also combos well with dd crow.</p><p>Handtraps/non engine: The classic stuff against meta with DD crow for extra gy hate a total of 11 free to exchange for something else but can be expended to 13 for a 45 card deck. 1x wings of light, 1x purple poison, 1x harmonizing, 1x gate 0 can be removed for other engine or handtraps too, the consistency loss is not very bad.</p><p><strong>Extra deck:</strong></p><p>The usual ed good stuff!<br />odd eyes wing dragon, xyz dragon, hope magician are targets to trigger pend evolution. The xyz dragon is also fooder for SKGM. Magician of Hope has the magician keyword and can be used for time pendulumgraph fooder.</p><p>Magician of hope is very rarely used though :c</p><p>Access code and End punisher are for grind game and game closing. The only downside is Access can only pop twice usually</p><p><strong>Side deck/ Other options</strong></p><p>Besides dweller, Lightining storm and 3x Evenly, everything else is exchangeable for handtraps. But I was thinking of the idea of an all out going 1st/ alternative route so this IS my side deck (for now at least)</p><p>The dracoslayer + kashtira package can replace some handtraps, the lone purple poison, 1 of the gate 0 and the vortex package in the ed</p><p>Given this deck can go into absolute dragon &gt; vortex relatively easy to just 2 SKGM, it has a very good synergy with Kashtira and r7 xyz( only 1 fenrir because theyre still a bit expensive :x) pair it up with a small dracoslayer package and you'll get a completely different endboard with equal or more oppressive capabilities.</p><p>[This build is specifically made for game 2 or 3 if going first only]</p><p>Kashtira can provide a consistency boost and ash bait. Instead of making absolute dragon in the magician combo, make Shagri-la instead and in your opponents standby phase ss a fenrir or unicorn to interupt your opponents furture plays pair it up with the below for better effects</p><p>Ignister prominence can be easily made with harmonizing. He can ss pegasus from deck (or she can be searched by BTP) to then search Necrovalley or Village which both work with pend and magicians, she can also search pressured planet to prepare for kashtira plays/followup, not to mention Ignister prominence's other effect is one of the best removals in the game (to a point where i almost want to include 1x Ignis phoenix).&nbsp;</p><p>This endboard usually includes 1x Exceed the pendulum to ss something from the hand, full scales, shagri-la to ss a kash in the next standby phase, Necrovalley or Village of spellcasters (active through exceed the pend). sadly hard dies to evenly :C</p><p><strong>End phase:</strong></p><p>Thanks for reading through my rambling again.

With the current meta it has a good match up against most decks as fields aren't ftk's at the moment and don't just set up as many hard negates and removal as previous formats with this it makes it much easier for Vaylantz to function. The deck does still brick sometimes but most hands should be able to get you to dyna lock with the new exceed the pendulum giving the deck far better end boards and ability to free up the necessary field zones as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The deck does die to nibiru, droll and DRNM but if these aren't hard drawn its very hard to break any Vaylantz board with just engine or not as impactful hand traps. Koa'ki Meiru Guardian is side decked for this exact reason as the deck doesn't need its normal summon and provides a negate for problem cards. If you get DRNM'd the oponnent was just better I guess can't play around that.</p><p>The hand trap and board breakers chosen to main deck have to do with Vaylantz's ability to break boards as going second with only engine can break most boards and if you have Fenrir you should be able to break anything. I have YGO Omega replays of this if anyone wants them can play through 4, 5 negates with the right hand easily and OTK. The selection of Fenrir is just because its the best card for this deck its a free special summon if you have drawn poorly and need extra material for Beyond the Pendulum and can clear some boards going second by itself. Droll was selected based off the fact that this deck can't break combo deck boards, Infernoble, Mannadium can't be broken with engine and droplet and DRNM main deck clash with the superheavy package. Ash and Imperm are must haves in the main deck this format just good versatile cards. Imperm may clash with the superheavy samurai package but it's good enough to justify due to just how versatile it is.</p><p>Board breakers in the side deck are the best avaliable in sphere mode and lava golem, no deck can negate these 2 and they normally remove all the problem cards just by drawing one of them and with the deck not needing its normal summon these are perfect. Feather Duster and Lightning Storm are both must haves in the side as well with Labrynth and anti-spell existing. d.d crow is there due to its versatility against a wide range of decks and can end turns with it hitting the right card. Cosmic cyclone could replace d.d crow if anti spell becomes meta again and starts being seen in every side deck just because its an FTK to pend.</p>"

It's pretty hard for most decks to out unless they either have banishing or some sort of bouncing to use against the thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Basically this deck follows similar concepts about trying to get it as soon as humanly possible; this is made insanely easy by the general Edison HERO engine being really, really good for getting through everything. Even with a singular Stratos we're still using lots of stuff to search through and find the materials needed for Dragoon bar that to get the deck moving as much as needed from draw power to just adding everything with Emergency. Prisma is also handy if you don't have material available and helps to cut through the deck and reduce dead draws.&nbsp;</p><p>It does help that Plasma is a perfectly acceptable side-boss that can also be crippling to many monster-focused decks being played to boot. King of the Swamp does seem a bit jank given it can't actually help us play Dragoon due to the technicalities requiring his exact materials and no proxies, however it's actually one of the big power cards of the deck given it searches out the poly and can then be used to get Absolute Zero out with a Miracle Fusion, making good use of your Grave.</p><p>This build uses very little traps in the main deck; we don't really need them for a whole lot given the main package is more than enough, but there are some staples thrown in just in case. Deck Dev crushes many other monster-focused decks and can be easily played out via Dragoon or the mainline Destiny cards, making it a incredibly crippling combo.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like the side deck could probably be improved, but rather than try for specific counters I focused more on a mini Gemini Hero engine given we're basically playing everything that makes that as impressive as it is already.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

The Mannadium strategy of summoning a lot of negate-oriented boss monsters turn 1 and boardbreaking juggernauts turn2/3+ has been thoroughly streamlined and made much easier.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"">Although not directly part of the archetype, Mannadium's relentless spam of material on the field enables it to summon I:P Masquerena for the incredible Extra Deck staple from AGOV S:P Little Knight - giving you two banish interruptions in one turn!</span></p><p style=""background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"">With all these cards from AGOV combined with support from previous recent sets, it seems that Mannadium is ready to break through to tier 1 status as this format's premier Synchro strategy!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;""><a><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"">The decklist in this guide is heavily inspired by Trif's top 4 Indianapolis YCS finish with Mannadium - his version having a heavy emphasis on consistency (22 starters, with many of them being 1 to 2 card starters) and defensive play (12 defensive staples used).

In the maindeck, only 3 copies of Visas Samsara are added (Extender, starter, combo piece and additional ""Visas Starfrost"" name in field/GY). In the Extra Deck, 1 copy of Mannadium Trisukda has been included.</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">There are 9 NORMAL SUMMONS in this deck (8 monsters with the ""heart"" statline of 1500ATK/2100DEF along with 1 Reinforcement of the Army). There are 9 ""PLANETS"" in this deck (3 Calarium, 2 Reichphobia, 1 Perlereino, 1 Wraithsoth, 1 Terraforming). 3 Kashtira Fenrir fetch Scareclaw Kashtira from deck. Totalling 22 starters, these cards obtain missing combo pieces from deck, with many of them being 1 card starters. 22 starters out of 40 cards make this deck RIDICULOUSLY CONSISTENT! Any 1-2 card combinations of these cards are full combo + extenders, ending on the standard board and possibly more!&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">12 DEFENSIVE CARDS are played - x3 Fenrir, x2 Triple Tactics Talent, x3 Triple Tactics Thrust, x3 Forbidden Droplet and 1 Infinite Impermanence. The ratio of these cards to the 40 card deck means that you'll typically draw 1-2+ of these and 3+ starters in the average opening hand - meaning that most hands are ""playable."" Coupled with Mannadium's inherent consistency + resilience to interruption, you'll win most of your games if piloted correctly (Unless you get Droll'd or Shifter'd)!</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">A small KASHTIRA package is included consisting of 3 Fenrir (Simultanously a starter + boardbreaker!) and Kashtira Scareclaw. Kashtira Scareclaw can be summoned from hand without normal summon to go into your Link-1 Light Heart so that you can fetch a combo piece - Reichheart or Visas Starfrost!&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">The final layer of consistency is Trisukda. This extremely easy to summon card makes Visas Amritara, which in turn searches for your missing combo pieces.</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">S:P Little Knight with her bestie I:P Masquerena is included in the Extra deck to enable more interruption since they are very accessible in this deck with proper extenders.

All these negates generally stop your opponents dead on their tracks, leaving you to OTK next turn with your overwhelming board presence and follow-up.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">The strategy for Mannadium is straightforward (summon level 10 synchros + 3 mat Apollousa) and combos are linear, despite hands being different. In some cases where a combo step is interrupted, a skilled Mannadium pilot can pivot to another route and still end on a strong board! Any combination of cards generally leads to the same end board. Here is the main combo for Mannadium:</span></div><div style=""background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Riumheart + Mannadium Meek = <em>Dis Pater</em>&nbsp;(Negate monster OR Destroy monster) + <em>Baronne De Fleur</em>&nbsp;(omni-negate/destroy) + <em>3 Material</em>&nbsp;<em>Apollousa</em>&nbsp;(3 monster negates) + if there are extenders you can summon <em>S:P Little Knight</em>&nbsp;+ draw 1.

Left unchecked, this Mannadium's bread and butter combo ends on 1 omni-negate, 4 monster negates, 1-2 banishes, and draw 1. You also have materials in GY next turn to create a Astraloud and if Dis Pater survives until next turn, he can summon Riumheart from banished pile to as follow-up to get more resources from deck. In games 2-3 if you go first, Mannadium Reframing can get sided in so that the board will be protected against Dark Ruler No More or Droplet.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The optimal deck's endboard is an extremely potent powerhouse that all decks would be hard-pressed to deal with. Depending on the cards in-hand and whatever interruptions your opponent has, your resulting endboard from this combo vary in power, depending on how much extenders you have and how many times you've been interrupted.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">This deck can also sustain being hit by several handtraps and keep on comboing, since it offers many extenders and different lines of play. Oftentimes this Mannadium can pivot into another route of play to keep on comboing. For example, has your normal summon been impermed? You can destroy it with Visas Starfrost then link him away for Light-Heart to go down the Scareclaw portion of the combo.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Going second, this deck naturally breaks boards with Primitive Planet Reichphobia, Astraloud, Baronne and Accesscode Talker removing cards. 11 defensive cards are played in the maindeck, which can turn into 19 when siding during games 2-3. 19 boardbreaking cards along with Mannadium's 22 starters means that boards will be broken and full combo can be achieved most of the time - bar cards like Droll or Shifter. The math in this deck's card ratios checks out (again, shoutout to Trif and Pak for figuring these out)!</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Mannadium can easily churn out over 9000ATK on board with at least 4 removals requiring minimal investment. When you've baited out all their interruptions going for the regular combo, you can pivot your strategy for the Astraloud + Accesscode OTK. First Link two monsters for Cross-Sheep on board. Contact fuse Visas Starfrost + Visas Clone in GY for Astraloud (1 pop) to a zone Cross-Sheep is pointing to so you can summon another monster from the GY. Then you can link the rest of the monsters on the field for Accesscode Talker.</span></div></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></div><ul><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">As you combo, be aware of the zones you're summoning in, or else you may stop your combo in it's tracks! For Light-Heart, keep the monster zone below it empty, so you can summon Reichheart below it. For Cross-Sheep, make sure to leave space for both a synchro and fusion monster to summon underneath it so you can get an ATK boost and a monster reborn.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">High impact handtraps like Dimension Shifter, Droll &amp; Lockbird, Nibiru and Artifact Lancea all stop this deck in it's tracks and/or severely limit it's play. While it is possible to play through these cards if your starting hand is strong, your board will be weaker. An option to use for this is 3 Crossout Designator + 1 of each handtrap to stop them (perhaps in sidedeck).&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">if you've been handtrapped to oblivion, or your opponent flipped D-Barrier calling ""synchros,"" then the general play is to end on S:P Little Knight with the resources you have left. It's better than nothing, and in a simplified gamestate she can win games!&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Is your combo stopped by a pesky floodgate on the field? No problem! One of your combo pieces, Primal Planet Reichphobia, destroys 1 card on the field! All it needs are at least 3 monsters on the field in defense position, which is an easy feat for this deck. Also Astraloud can destroy your opponent's floodgate monster on the field given it's materials are in the GY.</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">There are many other going-first combos with specific cards. Also, there are other playstyles of Mannadium that are playable, like the dreaded Calamity Lock! Be sure to check those out! <a>A good place to start is Yacine's combo tutorial videos.&nbsp;</a></span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Going second, you won't synchro much, despite Mannadium popularly known as a Synchro deck. You'll mostly summon Vicious Astraloud and Accesscode Talker to blow up your opponents board and attack for game! Making a Baronne will be ideal since it helps insulate your plays from interruption while destroying a card on the field.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Astraloud's effects aren't once per turn. If your GY is packed with the proper materials, you can keep blowing your opponent's monsters up!&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you happen to face a Expurrely Noir on the field, you can threaten the battle phase vs. it if you have a Kashtira Scareclaw on the field. The card's effect isn't activated, allowing you to negate the card if you declare an attack! If they shuffle away Kashtira Scareclaw, the card is now vulnerable to removal if it goes below 5 XYZ materials.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

What differentiates Mannadium from similar Synchro combo strategies like Adamancipator, Virtual World and the (now defunct RIP) Superheavy Samurai is it's ridiculous consistency (thanks to Trisukda and latest support), ability to break boards as it combos (Vicious Astraloud) and it's capability to quickly pivot from Synchro -&gt; Link.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400;"">Again, shoutout, thanks and congrats to Trif my Locals hero for this YCS decklist!

The deck isn't terrible.,"<p><strong>Card Choices:</strong></p><p>Main Deck:</p><p>The deck uses mostly standard VW ratios, I cut a copy each of the level sixes to keep the deck consistent. Two copies of Nyannyan as it's an important resource in the VW engine.</p><p>Two copies of Mo Ye and Longyuan as they're better to draw than Taia. Taia at one because the best use for it is to search off Emergence as the deck's only one card combo. Additionally, two copies of Ecclesia because I like it. It's good for consistency and saves the deck a normal summon going second. I usually side it out round two if I'm going first for more disruption (Dimensional Barrier, Denko Sekka, etc.).</p><p>Ash is the only hand trap in the deck because both engines are very space-heavy. Ash is generically good against most matchups. I also opted to play Dark Ruler No More as a board breaker instead of more hand traps as they have a greater impact for the number you run, making them a more space-efficient choice. Halfway through locals I was considering taking it out for something else, then I went against Dragon Link, resolved it three times, and won 2-0. It won't be coming out for the time being.</p><p>Pot of Desires is too powerful to remove even though it never draws the cards I want.</p><p>I took out Havnis and Shaddol Beast into Winda from my previous lists because the cards were too bricky and it wasn't worth investing all your resources into.</p><p>Extra Deck:</p><p>Both Swordsoul Sovereigns are included, though now Baronne is affordable, I might see if i can swap out Qixing Longyuan for one. Chenying is great for getting over big monsters. They can be made with the Swordsoul token / Ecclesia + Lili or another Lvl 6, but in Qixing Longyuan's case, it has to be a wyrm.</p><p>An OTK is easily accessible with most competent VW hands (Chuche on field, name in hand), as well as your opponent having a monster on field, by making 24 stars of material to make Utopia Beyond and Final Sigma. Utopia reduces the attack of the opponents monsters to 0, and Final Sigma deals double battle damage to monsters totalling to 9000 damage. If you can't quite make Final Sigma, you can use 18 stars to make Beyond plus Charge Warrior to hit all of your opponents special summoned monsters for 2000 each, and 3000 directly, but it requires your opponent to have 3 attack pos. monsters on board to OTK as opposed to one.</p><p>Yazi can summon Jiji or Lili from deck, and Baxia can summon Jiji from the GY, which opens up VW combos.</p><p>Stardust Charge Warrior is rad.</p><p>Zeus is only ever a backup plan for when you don't quite OTK I included it over a consistency card like Coral Dragon or Crocodragon because it is a really good backup plan.</p><p>Side Deck:</p><p>Dimensional Barrier is pretty good against something like Branded, but I feel isn't the best card to side in now. Same goes for Book of Eclipse.</p><p>Cosmic Cyclones and Harpie's Feather Duster are included to hit backrow decks, and decks with important continuous spell / traps.

Back Mutation Tributes a Fusion or Synchro monster you control in order to Special Summon a monster with the same original Level from your Deck, returning it to the hand during the End Phase. Metamorphosis would Tribute a monster to Special Summon a Fusion Monster with the same Level as the Tributed monster. With cards like&nbsp;<strong>Ready Fusion</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong>, and all of the Runick Quick-Play Spells, it is extremely easy to get a Fusion Monster out onto the field of a wide number of Levels to choose from. Ready Fusion Summons a Level 6 or lower non-effect Fusion Monster, Instant Fusion Summon a Level 5 or lower Fusion Monster, and the Runick cards give you access to&nbsp;<strong>Sleipnir the Runic Mane</strong> as a Level 9,&nbsp;<strong>Freki the Runick Fangs</strong> as a Level 5,&nbsp;<strong>Geri the Runick Fangs</strong> as a Level 4,&nbsp;<strong>Munin the Runick Wings</strong> as a Level 3, and&nbsp;<strong>Hugin the Runick Wings</strong> as a Level 2. Sure, there are a variety of different monsters of different Levels to Summon off of Back Mutation, knowing what Fusion Monsters you can readily get out of the Extra Deck, but I am looking at Prediction Princess because Back Mutation is basically another way to get&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> out of the Deck and into rotation. I've already made a <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/runick-prediction-princess-324318/"">Runick Prediction Princess</a> list, but that was about half a year ago from the posting of this Deck. Now, I know more of what ratio of cards I should be playing, what Extra Deck cards I should focus on, and this new list utilizes the best of all of the new cards Prediction Princess can make use of.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Main Deck monsters: 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>. Tarotreith can be Ritual Summoned or Summoned from hand or GY via Tarotrei's End Phase effect. On Flip, it can Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down and as a Quick Effect, it can Flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. Tarotrei can Quick Effect Flip a monster face-up or face-down and can Summon a Flip Monster from hand or Gy in face-down Defense Position duringthe End Phase. 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> which on Flip adds a Prediction Princess monster other than itself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand. If it's Tributed and sent to GY, it can Summon itself back face-down, and while on field, it gives your Ritual Monsters targeting and destruction protection. 2&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates all of your opponent's monsters' activated effects on field after it has been flipped face-up, and when it's destroyed on field, it can add a Level 9 with a different Type and Attribute than it from Deck to hand. 1&nbsp;<strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>. We are playing this because there are situations where you will have&nbsp;<strong>Trias Hierarchia</strong> on field and a&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> in hand. If you are in a situation where you have access to no Runick cards for Sleipnir, you need a target in Deck to Summon in addition to Deus-X Krawler when targeting Hierarchia with Monstrosity. The best target in a Deck like this would be Pot of the Forbidden, a fellow Level 9 Flip Monster. On Flip, you can choose to Draw 2 cards, bounce all Spell/Traps on field to hand, Destroy all monsters your opponent controls, or look at your opponent's hand and shuffle a card from it back into the Deck. Usually I wouldn't play Pot of the Forbidden unless it is a situation like this where you need an extra target in Deck for Monstrosity, but while each of its effects belong to a banned card (aside from&nbsp;<strong>Raigeki</strong>), they aren't really that good after the DABL Prediction Princess Support. Draw 2 card? You are already searching a Prediction Princess monster (other than Bibliomuse) and a Ritual Spell from flipping up Bibliomuse. You have the cards you want to see in hand already. Why would you need extra draws for 2 random cards that may or may not help you as much compared to what Bibliomuse already searched you for your following turn? Bouncing all Spell/Traps on the field to the hand? Unless you know that you are up against a backrow Deck and are going first, you are usually going to be Summoning Deus-X off of Tarotreith and not Pot of the Forbidden. If you do know, then you would get Pot from Deck with Tarotreith and bounce your opponent's backrow during the End Phase, yes. But sometimes you don't know your specific match-up, so there is no real reason to shotgun Pot of the Forbidden. Destroy all monsters your opponent controls? Man, your opponent is barely going to be getting anything worthwhile onto the field when you have Deus-X flipped up. And if your opponent's Deck gets many monsters onto the field without needing on-field monster effect activations, then, how would you know the match-up in the first place? Forceful Sentrying your opponent? I'm not too sold on this either. There are some situations where yes, it would be good and useful, but at the same time, you aren't shotgunning Pot of the Forbidden off of Tarotreith. Deus-X has a much more powerful effect, and if you are aiming to get rid of your opponent's board breakers, sure, but half of them are already covered by Bibliomuse who gives your Ritual Monsters targeting and destruction protection. The only real threats are Dark Ruler, Evenly Matched, Kaijus, and Imperming a flipped up Deus-X, but you don't really need to worry about those things unless it's game 3 and you went first game 1. And to be fair, many people don't know the Prediction Princess match-up. And in this Deck specifically, we still have the Runick cards to fall back on. So that is a little lecture on why Pot of the Forbidden isn't as ""good"" or as needed in a post DABL Prediction Princess list. Moving on, 1&nbsp;<strong>Trias Hierarchia</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald</strong>. Trias is another very easy-to-access Level 9 who can be sent off of Diviner, and can tribute a Fairy to Summon itself from hand or GY. This includes Hugin to clear up your Extra Monster Zone. Diviner sends a Fairy from Deck or Extra Deck to GY, increasing its Level by that of the sent monster's. You can send Hierarchia to put it in rotation, or you can send <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> from Extra for a Ritual Search. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Back Mutation</strong>. Again, this Tributes a Fusion or Synchro to Summon a monster from Deck with the same original Level, returning it to the hand during the End Phase. We are playing 2 of the Runick Fusions in this Deck.&nbsp;<strong>Sleipnir the Runick Mane</strong> is a Level 9 that can be Tributed to get Prediction Princess Bibliomuse or even put Hierarchia into rotation.&nbsp;<strong>Hugin the Runick Wings</strong> is a Level 2 that can be Tributed to get Diviner of the Herald from Deck. Yes, you heard that right. It can readily get Diviner out of the Deck for either a Ritual Search or to send Hierarchia to put it into rotation. Very nice card. 2&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>. It can Summon a Level 9 from hand or target a Level 9 on field and Summon 2 Level 9's with different names from Deck with a different Type and Attribute than the target. We are still playing this because it is still a very good card in Prediction Princess. Not only can it readily access the Aggregator line, it is basically a free Rank 9 in some situations. 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> to get&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong> from the Extra Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which can Ritual a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down. And you can banish it during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. 2&nbsp;<strong>Runick Fountain</strong> which allows you to activate Runick Quick-Play Spells from hand during yoru opponent's turn. And if you activate a Runick Quick-Play Spell Card, you can target up to 3 Runick Quick-Play Spells in your GY, return them to the bottom of the Deck and draw the same number of cards. This is great for digging deeper into your Deck for Ritual pieces and Bibliomuse. Next up, 3&nbsp;<strong>Runick Freezing Curses</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Runick Tip</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Runick Slumber</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Runick Flashing Fire</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Runick Destruction</strong>. All of them can Special Summon a Runick Monster from the Extra Deck to your EMZ. Freezing Curses negates the effects of an effect monster your opponent controls until the End Phase, banishing 3 cards from the top of their Deck. Tip adds a Runick card from Deck to hand except itself, banishing the top card of your opponent's Deck. Slumber prevents the next destruction of a targeted face-up monster on the field this turn, banishing the top 3 cards of your opponent's Deck. Flashing Fire targets and destroys a Special Summoned monster your opponent controls, banishing the top 2 cards of their Deck. And Destruction targets and destroys a Spell/Trap your opponent controls, banishing the top 4 cards of their Deck.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 2&nbsp;<strong>Sleipnir the Runick Mane</strong> and 2&nbsp;<strong>Hugin the Runick Wings</strong>. I know that Sleipnir has an effect, but I don't care because we are never going to be using it in this Deck. It's just a Level 9 for Monstrosity and Back Mutation. Hugin can discard a card to add a Runick Field Spell from Deck to hand and she can banish herself from field to protect another card(s) you control from destruction, and she's also a Level 2 for Back Mutation. 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. It Summons a Flip Monster from Deck face-down when its Fusion Summoned, which is going to be via Instant Fusion in this Deck. 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> which adds a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell from Deck to hand when it's sent to GY. 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong> which can detach any number of materials to pop the same number of cards on field, and if it destroys a monster by battle, it can attach it to itself which makes it good for boardclearing and making Zeus. 1&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> which can send a monster from Extra Deck to GY on Xyz Summon, and it can target monsters in your GY and detach an equal number of Xyz Materials to attach those monsters to itself which can be used to loop a Herald of the Arc Light you sent off of Xyz Summoning said Aggregator. 1&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong> for Rank 9 and interruption options. 1&nbsp;<strong>S:P Little Knight</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Gravity Controller</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 3&nbsp;<strong>Lava Golem</strong> we don't necessarily need our Normal Summon in this Deck, so having a way to clear multiple threats on your opponent's field without activating a card effect is pretty good. 3&nbsp;<strong>Kashtira Fenrir</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Thrust</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Abyss</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Dimensional Barrier</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Solemn Judgment</strong>.</span></p>"

the FTK (technically it's not an FTK since it ends at the start of your opponent's turn, but there's not much your opponent can react with to win this situation)</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">only warning i'd give is, if you know your opponent is playing purrely skip the FTK as pretty memory will save their ass, also this FTK is very weak to interruption but as per usual with FTKs it's immune to blowouts, if you suspect your opponent could handtrap you i'd recommend simply skipping the FTK and going for a safer salamangreat board</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">the deck, in general, is also fine as a regular salamangreat deck since the FTK is very low-commitment in main deck and extra deck space (without counting cards that you'd regularly run in salamangreat, it's 2 main deck cards and 1 extra deck monster)</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">i recommend trying out test hands before giving it serious plays, so you can get a feel of various play lines needed to reach the FTK</p><p

post my decks anywhere, but in this case this is a theorycraft that i've never seen anyone come up with (as far as i know, i could very easily be wrong and look like a tool), so i'm making this as an archive of ""i made this first"" proof, also i went 4-0 in a pre-realese test tournament with this and the FTK worked out quite a few times and the regular salamangreat pivot also worked so i feel confident enough in the fact that it's not 100% a meme</p>"

There's also the surrender button.</p><p><strong>Best Combo :</strong></p><p>- Place Triamid Cruiser</p><p>-Normal Summon Triamid Hunter</p><p>-Special Summon Adamancipator Researcher</p><p>-Excavate - Special Summon Dyna</p><p>-Normal Summon Dyna</p><p>-Thats it.</p><p>It kinda sucks that we have to rely on floodgates at the end of the day, but we play with the card in our hand, and Triamids are some bad cards.

His mission is to create harmonious connections and promote relationships between people, as well as balancing differences and adjusting contrasts. However, this angel has an exaggerated dose of vanity.Justice is an essential characteristic of this angel, who demonstrates remarkable tolerance, capacity for conciliation and collaboration. For Gabriel, love is the essence of life, making it colorful and tasty. He wants to explore the feeling to the fullest and is in no rush, preferring to carefully observe every movement of the loved one and imitate it.</p><p>His approach to his friends is unique, as he knows the expectations and weaknesses of each of them, always ready to offer words of encouragement in difficult times. Gabriel loves parties and doesn't refuse an invitation, he loves shopping and bargaining with people. When he was younger, he was always close to his siblings, enjoying fun times and sharing activities.</p><p>Gabriel values his appearance a lot and knows how to balance his commitments to avoid work overloads. When confronted emotionally, his tendency is to stall for time or ask for help, thus relieving the weight of responsibility. Living with people is very important to Gabriel, who feels despair at the thought of being alone for a short period of time. He needs company to feel comfortable.</p><p>In the family environment, Gabriel demonstrates his virtues in his judgments. He enjoys contact with other people and finds pleasure in his work, although he may occasionally be attacked by laziness or hesitation. His favorite color is pink and he prefers soft fragrances, with the delicate aroma of bouquets of roses or orchids. His biggest dream is to be surrounded by interesting and beautiful people, living in a luxurious environment and enjoying exquisite places. Gabriel simply loves chic!</p><p>Gabriel's main qualities include kindness, elegance, wisdom, pacifism and diplomacy. On the other hand, its disadvantages include hesitation, inconstancy, omission, laziness, vanity and the habit of taking or consuming unnecessarily. His biggest fear is going through scandals or embarrassment in front of people, which only increase his feeling of shame. Although he loves interacting with people, any confrontation or fight leaves him in a panic. The constant worry about making the right choice fuels your fears about the future and any threat to your stability is a cause for concern.</p>"

They support each other's weakpoints and enable each of their effects. Level 6 Bystials/Thunder Dragon + Assault Synchron also allow for the easy summon of Chaos Ruler in this deck, another valuable playstarter for this strategy, packing the GY, banishing lights/darks and providing a total of 3 level 8 bodies on board for Synchro or Link summons! Going first, this deck typically makes a 3-4 negate Apollousa, a search-floodgate with Colossus, multiple pops with Titan and the Bystial engine is set-up! Going second, this deck can plow through negates/interruption while having enough gas to clear the opposing board and OTK.<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</p>"

Also Cyberse Accelerator is in there as the cheapest Extra Deck monster that I can find, It's so you have more of your Extra after activating Prosperity. When buying this deck you should either exclude it if you have any Extra Deck bulk, or you should buy a cheap Extra Deck card that is available from 1 of the shops you are already buying from. Anyways, this deck is just Turbulance turbo without Hydrant or Diabellestar or the wide Extra Deck options that you can play with a full power Rescue-ACE deck.

The Baldrakes are for the mirror, book of eclipse for Purrely, and Heartbeat is for Labrynth or maybe Rescue-ACE. Anyways this deck actually has the potential to be about as strong as it's full power version. You're just missing some consistency, and Extra and Side Deck ultility. For potential upgrades I'd consider investing in more Tearlaments Kashtira first. It's a bit expensive but it really is a great card for this deck. It's great to open, it's great to mill, and it allows you to play through more. Past that I'd probably recommend focusing on the Extra or Side Deck after that. Guardian Chimera and Baronne (with Diviner) are great cards, but too pricy for a budget list like this. Tearlament is actually a very customizable deck so feel free to cut or add whatever you like to the Deck.</span></p>"

With the help of Urarctic Radiation, which can be abused to allow them to draw 14 at most, and the new level 1 synchro that easily creates a boss monster that just stops your opponents EX deck monster effects. Crossout Designator is the main card that will help you avoid those troublesome handtraps that could put a end to your plays like Nibiru and Droll. Main goal of the deck is to keep special summoning Ursarctic monsters so you can continue to get a draw off of Radiation, so you can fill your hand back with cards you can use to summon. if you run out of tokens on Radiation, use Baronne's pop effect and activate a new one and then continue with combo's.&nbsp;</p>"

That combo generally gets your plays started.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400;"">Black Metal is the main normal summon of the deck, representing a Hieratic Seals (Normal Black Metal -&gt; link away for Striker Dragon -&gt; Search Red-Eyes Darkness -&gt; Red-Eyes Darkness summons itself by banishing Striker Dragon -&gt; Red-Eyes Darkness summons Black Metal from GY -&gt; Link away both Dragons for Hieratic Seals).&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400;"">Going second, if you have Crimson Gaia in the backrow, it's ideal to go for the Crimson Dragon line to clear the board and OTK. Level 6 Bystial + Vision Resonator for Scarred Dragon Archfiend -&gt; Bystial Dis Pater ensures that you destroy all your opponent's ATK position monsters during main phase, leaving their DEF position monsters to get destroyed by Red Dragon Archfiend's battle phase effect!</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400;"">On the attack, Horus monsters are incredibly powerful beatsticks and King's Sarcophagus' non-targeting, non-destroying ""send"" outs most monsters. If your opponent removes any cards from your field when Horus monsters are fielded, you can punish them since all Horus monster's trigger effects occur with effects ranging from GY/banished recovery to sending a card on the field!</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></div><ul style=""text-align: left; list-style-type: disc; flex-direction: column; display: flex;"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}""><li style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Chaos Angel made with Bystial Lubellion (Light) and Vision Resonator (Dark) is very hard to out for most opponents since it inherits both of its attribute dependant effects! With both light and dark, Chaos Angel is a nigh unstoppable juggernaut on the field.</span></li><li style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">If you get Droll'd, you can still make plays with the Horus engine since they don't search by adding to hand. It sends to GY, then summons from GY! This immediately makes this deck better dealing with Droll than its dragonic sibling Dragon Link, since this deck can keep playing despite the lingering floodgate.</span></li><li style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">If you get Shifter'd, try to end on defense position Chaos Angel. Sometimes, your opponent simply can't deal with an unaffected unkillable monster, giving you time to outlast Shifter's two turn lingering banish effect.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">If you're trading one interruption with 1 of your opponent's cards, you're usually ahead in resources.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">The effect you mostly want to resolve is Zombie Vampire's mill 4 and summon 1 from GY.

Bystials were a good meta call in a format dominated by meta decks that load the GY with lights/darks such as Unchained, Purrely and Tearlaments. Combining 3 advantage engines together (Horus, Bystial and Dragonlink) while handtrapping/controlling strategies to a standstill means that most games would lead to the duelist out-resourcing the opponent!&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400;"">This mid-range, staple oriented playstyle is certainly fun to play!

You will never catch me playing the floodgate brickfest that is Ursarctic and while Ogdoadic is really cool, Reptiles just do not have any good generic enablers or realistically anything much to end on other than Odgoabyss. And to be really fair, Solfachord really doesn't do much on its own because about half of their monsters are bad and most of their Spell/Traps functionally are too specific. <strong>TiSolfachord Beautia</strong> makes a card banished instead of going to the GY when it leaves the field and is also a battle trick.<strong> FaSolfachord</strong><strong> Fancia</strong> gives battle protection for a Solfachord by destroying itself and adds a Solfachord from Deck to Extra Deck face-up.&nbsp;<strong>MiSolfachord Eliteia</strong> prevents battle damage and bounces a Spell/Trap on Summon.&nbsp;<strong>Solfachord Scale</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Solfachord Symphony</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Solfachord Harmonia</strong>, <strong>Solfachord Musica</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Solfachord Formal</strong> are all either very specific or they just don't do much at all. And while you could make an argument for&nbsp;<strong>Solfachord Musica</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Exceed the Pendulum</strong> now exists which makes it a lot worse. But that leads to you needing to play a lot of the more generic Pendulum support and enablers which results in Solfachord becoming almost your average Pendulum combo Deck you would usually see or think of when you think of a Pendulum Deck. This Deck plays the Supreme King engine in order to facilitate Extra Deck plays and a low scale in addition to all of your Solfachord cards.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Starting with the Solfachord monsters, the scale effects of your Solfacord monsters do not really matter all that much. There have 2 distinct effects. The Level 5 and higher Solfachords prevent your opponent from activating Spell/Trap Cards or monster effects when you Pendulum Summon a Solfachord monster while the Level 4 and lower Solfachords prevent the negation of the Pendulum Summons of your Solfachord monsters. Not the greatest scale effects, and they aren't exactly the most useful either considering that playing pure Solfachord as a Deck is pretty bad. We are playing 2 <strong>DoSolfachord Coolia</strong>, 1 <strong>LaSolfachord Angelia</strong>, 3 <strong>ReSolfachord Dreamia</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>DoSolfachord Cutia</strong>. Coolia can be Special Summoned from hand by Tributing 2 Pendulum Monsters which is almost never going to be the case due to Angelia. She can also target a face-up card your opponent controls and negate its effects until the end of your opponent's turn, but you can target 2 cards instead if you have an odd Pendulum Scale in your Pendulum Zone. I mean, yes, this is a good effect, but it is not a Quick Effect, so you can't use it on your opponent's turn and only are able to interact with your opponent on their turn with Coolia's next effect. When the effect of a monster on field is activated with an equal or lower ATK than the highest Pend Scale in your Pendulum Zone x300, you can Quick Effect destroy that monster. There are so many restrictions to this effect and all it does is destroy a monster. ""Activated monster effect ON FIELD, with an EQUAL OR LOWER ATK then the HIGHEST PEND SCALE in your Pend Zone TIMES 300."" The highest Pend Scale in this Deck is 8 which means that you can only pop a monster with 2400 or less ATK. If <strong>Supreme King Gate Infinity</strong> wasn't literally a walking detriment to you, then, this wouldn't be too much of a problem. The effect is still okay, but you are still pretty limited by what you are allowed to do. Angelia gives all of your Solfachord Pendulum Monsters an Armades effect for Spell/Traps while there is an odd Pend Scale in your Pend Zone which really is not anything worthwhile since we are only using her for her second effect. She can Tribute a Solfachord Pendulum Monster you control to Special Summon a Solfachord Pendulum Monster from your Deck whose Pend scale is 2 higher or 2 lower than the Tributed monster's. Angelia can tribute herself in order to get Coolia from the Deck which is the best and only worthwhile option. Dreamia can destroy itself to replace the destruction of your 1 Solfachord Pendulum Monster Cards by your opponent's card effect whiel you have an odd scale in your Pend Zone. I know that we are never gonna be using this effect for the most part, but I just want to comment on how bad this effect is. It does not replace the destruction of all of those cards. It ONLY replaces the destruction of ONE of those cards which is mindboggling. Either way, you can Special Summon her from hand if you control a Solfachord card in your Pend Zone. This gives good extension options to Link into something like <strong>Beyond the Pendulum</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Exceed the Pendulum</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>. Cutea gives all of your Solfachord Pend Monsters ATK equal to their respective Pend Scales x100 if you have an even scale in your Pend Zone. We aren't playing enough Solfachords to really make the best out of this effect. However, Cutea can search a Solfachord Pend Monster from Deck on Normal or Special Summon, and considering that she is a Level 1 Fairy monster, she can be Summoned off of&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald&nbsp;</strong>which is really nice for greater access. Moving onto the Supreme King Package. 1 <strong>Supreme King Gate Zero</strong> as a low scale and as a Supreme King Gate monster that can be accessed off of Gate Magician. Speaking of, 3&nbsp;<strong>Supreme King Gate Magician</strong>. Its Pend Effect allows you to destroy it to place a Supreme King Gate Pend Monster from hand or Deck into your Pend Zone except for itself. This puts Gate Magician into your face-up Extra to Pend Summon it out later while also giving you a low scale. It's monster effect allows you to send a Pendulum Dragon, Xyz Dragon, Synchro Dragon, or Fusion Dragon monster from hand or Extra Deck to GY while you have a Supreme King Gate monster in your Pend Zone to Special Summon it from hand. And if its Normal or Special Summoned, it can search a card that mentions Z-ARC from Deck except for a Spellcaster monster. This makes it a great extender and play-enabler. 2&nbsp;<strong>Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Supreme King Dragon Lightwurm</strong>. I'm playing 2 Darkwurm because I really don't want to be drawing it, especially when Cutea or Diviner is a much better Normal Summon. If it's in GY while you control no monsters, you can Special Summon it, and if its Normal or Special Summoned, you can add a Supreme King Gate Pend Monster from Deck to hand. Lightwurm is both a high scale in a scale 8 and a Level 4 Tuner. This is important for making&nbsp;<strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong> or for situations where you need a high scale. If it's Normal or Special Summoned you can add a Supreme King Dragon or Suprem King Gate Pend Monster from Extra Deck to hand which may come up in cases where you need to put resources back into your hand. 3&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald&nbsp;</strong>and 1&nbsp;<strong>Trias Hierarchia</strong>. Diviner sends Hierarchia from Deck to GY on Normal or Special Summon, and while Hierarchia is in GY, it can Tribute Diviner to Summon itself back, and when Diviner is Tributed, you can Special Summon a Level 2 or lower Fairy monster from Deck except itself. This gets you Cutea for a search for a Solfachord monster and since you have both Cutea and Hierachia on field, that is automatically access to&nbsp;<strong>Beyond the Pendulum</strong> which is really good. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</strong> for handtraps.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. This isn't necessary at all, but it is very nice to see Diviner for easy access to Beyond the Pendulum through 1 card. You can definitely replace them with Tactics and Thrust if you want. 1&nbsp;<strong>Foolish Burial&nbsp;</strong>and 3&nbsp;<strong>Dragon Shrine</strong> for ways to send Darkwurm from Deck to GY. 2&nbsp;<strong>Wings of Light</strong> which allows you to add a Supreme King Dragon or Supreme King Gate Pend Monster from Deck to hand.&nbsp;3<strong> Solfachord Elegance</strong> which allows you to choose 1 of 3 effects. You can Place a Solfachord Pendulum Monster from Deck into your Pendulum Zone, Add a Solfachord Pendulum Monster from hand to Extra Deck to scale 2 Solfachord Pendulum Monsters with 1 odd scale and 1 even scale from Deck, or you can add 1 odd and 1 even Pendulum Scale Monster from your Pend Zones to the Extra Deck to draw 2. You are usually going to be choosing from 1 of the first two effects, the first effect more often than not. And finally, 1&nbsp;<strong>Called by the Grave</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Crossout Designator</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon</strong> which is just a Pendulum Dragon name to send off of Gate Magician. It is possible to actually Summon our other name,&nbsp;<strong>Odd-Eyes Rebellion Xyz Dragon</strong>, so having an extra name to send helps, especially, since the Extra Deck is not very tight. 1&nbsp;<strong>Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</strong> which bounces a face-up Attack Position monster your opponent controls on Special Summon and it can negate a Spell/Trap Card or monster effect by shuffling a face-up Pend Monster in your Extra Deck into the Deck, destroying that card. 1&nbsp;<strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong>. I really did not know what else could be put into the Extra Deck, so I just put N'tss in since it can be sent off of Herald for a pop. 1&nbsp;<strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong> which can equip a Link from GY on Synchro Summon, giving it Borrel Counters equal to that monster's Link Rating, and you can remove 1 of them to negate a card or effect once per turn. 1&nbsp;<strong>Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</strong> which is a Rank 7 that can easily be made by using 2 Gate Magicians and if its Xyz Summoned and sent to GY, you can Special Summon an Odd-Eyes monster from Extra Deck, usually being Vortex Dragon. 1&nbsp;<strong>Odd-Eyes Rebellion Xyz Dragon</strong> which can detach a material to target up to 2 monsters your opponent controls with 3000 or less ATK and destroy them. If it is destroyed, you can put it in your Pend Zone and while it's in your Pend Zone, you can Special Summon it and then you can attach a DARK monster from GY to it as material. 1&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</strong> which can use a monster your opponent controls as Link Material, and when its Link Summoned, you can negate the effects of all face-up monsters your opponent controls and it is unaffected by activated effects that don't target it. Once per turn, if your opponent activates a card or effect that would Special Summoning a monster(s) from the Gy, you can negate the activation. 1&nbsp;<strong>Accesscode Talker</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</strong> who places Spell Counters on herself equal to the number of Spells on field and in GY on Link Summon and you can Quick Effect remove 3 Spell Counters to Special Summon a Spellcaster monster from hand or GY in Defense to a zone it points to. This is good for a quick Apollousa in your combo or easy access to Accesscode. 1 <strong>Beyond the Pendulum</strong> which adds a face-up Pend Monster from Extra Deck to hand on Link Summon and during the Main Phase, she can Quick Effect Special Summon a Pend Mosnter from hand or GY whose Level is between your scales in Defense. 1&nbsp;<strong>S:P Little Knight&nbsp;</strong>and 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Beyond the Pendulum</strong> which adds a Pend from Deck to hand on Link Summon by paying 1200 Life Points, but restricts you from activating monster effects and Pend Effects until your Pend Summon, and when you do Pend Summon two monsters with different original names to the zones it points to, you can target and destroy 2 cards on field.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 3&nbsp;<strong>Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Crossout Designator</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Thrust</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>"

This would also be a fun way of taking control over the game, since Duelist Kingdom has a rule that duelists cannot attack directly and The Legendary Fisherman with A Legendary Ocean would be one more obstacle that Yugi would have to overcome during his duel with Mako.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Credit for the inspiration for this deck goes to, once again, The Retro Expert.

I remember testing out Gizmek Ancient Gear when the extended Gizmek support came out in Dawn of Majesty before I realized that Ancient Gear is still really bad. Either way, our Level 9 that we are taking a look at today for Prediction Princess is&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</strong>, but this Deck focuses on both it and&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Makami, the Ferocious Fanged Fortress</strong>. Kaku can actually be placed into many different versions of Prediction Princess, with it even being capable of being utilized as a going second removal option, but it is still a very easy-to-summon Level 9 monster whose Type and Attribute are good as a target on field for&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>. Makami, on the other hand, can search any monster whose ATK equals its own DEF. This includes&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> who has 2500 ATK and 2500 DEF. This Deck aims on utilizing Kaku, Makami, and our 3rd Gizmek that I have yet to mention,&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Inaba, the Hopping Hare of Hakuto</strong>, alongside several&nbsp;<strong>Small World</strong> bridges to get to our Prediction Princess plays. Is this a good version of Prediction Princess? Not really. It is one of those acceptable versions of Prediction Princess that work, but it still doesn't compare to Runick Prediction Princess and pure Ham Prediction Princess which I believe are the best versions of Prediction Princess.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the monsters: 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>. I decided to play this ratio of the Rituals because we are playing&nbsp;<strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong> alongside&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> to make up for the 1 fatal flaw of Gizmek Makami which is that Makami is a Level 6. Yes, Makami can be Normal Summoned without Tributing which I will get to later, but without a Pre-Prep package, this Deck would be a lot more inconsistent. Pre-Prep allows you to search for Tarotrei and Prediction Ritual while Makami gets you Bibliomuse without the usage of&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>. While we have a couple of Monstrosity lines, it is still safer to have multiple ways of accessing Bibliomuse in this Deck which is through Makami, Monstrosity, and Small World (and Pot of Prosp if that counts). Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster face-up or face-down and she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down during the End Phase. Tarotreith can be Special Summoned by Tarotrei's End Phase effect and she can Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down and on Flip, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down. 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> which can Summon herself back face-down if she was Tributed and sent to GY, and on Flip, she can add a Prediction Princess monster except herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand. Also, while she is face-up on field, she gives all of your Ritual Monsters targeting and destruction protection from your opponent's card effects. 2&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates the activated effects of your opponent's monsters on field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed while on field, it can add a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it from Deck to hand. For the Gizmeks: 3&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Makami, the Ferocious Fanged Fortress</strong>, and 2&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Inaba, the Hopping Hare of Hakuto</strong>. Kaku can be Special Summoned from hand if there is a monster in the Extra Monster Zone. While on field, it can target a face-up monster in the Extra Monster Zone and equip it to itself. And when it destroys a monster by battle, you can Special Summon the equipped monster. Kaku is a very easy-to-summon Level 9, especially when we can just Link off Inaba or Diviner for&nbsp;<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong> or use&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> to Summon&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong> into your EMZ. And it is also a pretty unique form of removal for going second. Makami can be Normal Summoned without Tribute if you have 6 or more banished cards which means that&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong> is functionally a combo piece funnily enough because you banish 6 cards from your Extra Deck to search. On Normal or Special Summon, Makami can discard a monster to add a monster whose ATK equals its own DEF from Deck to hand and when its destroyed in the Monster Zone, you can shuffle 6 of your banished cards into the Deck. As I said before, Makami can search Bibliomuse, but it can also search for Kaku if you already have Bibliomuse which is nice for Link plays, Rank 9 plays, or extending with a Monstrosity. And yes, Bibliomuse will trigger if it is tributed for a Tribute Summon, but it is a bit of a waste if you do so because you really want Bibliomuse to be used for Ritual fodder for herself to be brought back, flipped to search, and potentially be used as Ritual fodder again. Inaba Special Summons a Machine monster whose ATK equals its own DEF from hand in DEF on Normal Summon. Its other effect is basically irrelevant in this Deck because we aren't playing enough Machines whose ATK and DEF are equal. Inaba basically plays around you having to Normal Summon Makami. We are only playing 2 of it because we aren't playing that many Machine monsters whose ATK equals their DEF, so drawing multiple copies most likely will result in a dead hand. But since it is a good Small World bridge, it is still worth playing. 3&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald&nbsp;</strong>who sends a Fairy from Deck or Extra Deck to GY on Normal or Special Summon, increasing its own Level by the Level of the sent monster. If you take a look at the Extra Deck, you can see that we are playing&nbsp;<strong>Trickstar Band Sweet Guitar</strong> which is a Level 7 Fairy Monster. Because we are playing Kaku who is a Level 9 FIRE Machine monster, you can send Sweet Guitar or any Level 7 Fairy, I recommend from the Extra Deck, with Diviner in order to make her a Level 9 as a Monstrosity target on field. This is good if you already have Bibliomuse access but don't have any Ritual access as you can Summon Kaku and Deus-X from Deck with Monstrosity and go through the Aggregator line to get what you need. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Spell/Traps: 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Small World</strong> which actually is incredible in this Deck or any Gizmek-focused Deck. Because if you didn't know, all of the Gizmek monsters have different Levels, different stats, and different Attributes with the only thing that they share in common being their Machine-typing. If you manage to bridge from a monster in hand to any Gizmek monster in Deck, you can search any Gizmek monster from your Deck or any monster with an associated Attribute as the rest of their stats, Types, and Attributes work. And while I would really like to have a Gizmek that would allow me to bridge from any Gizmek to any other Gizmek to Diviner,&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Naganaki, the Sunrise Signaler</strong> is a Level 2 which means that it can't bridge to Herald, so your only option would be to bridge from Kaku to Bibliomuse to Diviner. 2&nbsp;<strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Ritual</strong>. It is important to remember that this card can ONLY Ritual Summon Tarotrei and not Tarotreith. You can also banish it from GY except the turn it was sent there to search a Prediction Princess monster. 3 <strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or Gy face-up or face-down and you can banish it from GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which can either Special Summon a Level 9 monster from hand or target a Level 9 monster on field and Special Summon 2 Level 9 Monsters with different Types and Attributes thatn the targeted monster from Deck, but they are destroyed during the End Phase.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Trickstar Band Sweet Guitar</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong> who Special Summons a Flip Monster from Deck face-down on Fusion Summon. 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light&nbsp;</strong>for a Ritual search when sent to GY. 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong> which can detach any number of materials to destroy an equal number of cards on field, and it can attach a monster it destroys by battle to it as material, making it a great Zeus enabler in addition to board clearing. 2&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> which sends a monster from Extra Deck to Gy on Xyz Summon, which is usually Herald for a Ritual search, and it can detach any number of materials and attach the same number of monsters from GY which recycles Herald for another search when Aggregator leaves the field. 1 <strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Nine-Lives Cat</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>S:P Little Knight</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Gravity Controller</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 2&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Thrust</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Change of Heart</strong>.

The less disruption to face down, the better.</p><p>Play <strong>'<em>Allure of Darkness</em>'</strong> to strengthen your current hand, but, be careful not to suicide your whole hand. Play <em><strong>'Piercing the Darkness'</strong> </em>as soon as you get it.</p><p>There are two strategies to pursue, depending on the cards you have. The first strategic aim is to access <strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</em>'</strong> though <strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Fusion</em>'</strong>. All other times, the strategic priority is to Summon/Special Summon as many monsters to the field as possible, in order to access XYZ and Link monsters in the Extra Deck.</p><p>Use <strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Insight</em>'</strong> to search <strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Fusion</em>'</strong>. Another way of searching <strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Fusion</em>'</strong> is to activate the Graveyard Effect of <strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Black Meteor Dragon</em>'</strong>, however, you cannot activate this effect on the same turn it was sent to the Graveyard, so this play requires some setup. For a secondary target for <strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Insight</em>'</strong> search <strong>'<em>Return of the Red-Eyes</em>'</strong> which helps flood the field with monsters. <strong>'<em>Return of the Red-Eyes</em>'</strong> synergises extremely well with <em><strong>'Piercing the Darkness'</strong> </em>enabling the player to draw a card when they Summon a Normal Monster once per turn. For example: On your turn <strong>'<em>Return of the Red-Eyes</em>' </strong>activates and Summons a Normal Monster from the Graveyard to the field, which triggers <em><strong>'Piercing the Darkness' </strong></em>allowing you to draw a card. At the start of the opponent's turn, the process repeats.</p><p>If going for the Fusion Summon, a major weakness to beware is that <strong>'<em>Ash Blossom</em>'</strong> can negate<strong> '<em>Red-Eyes Fusion</em>' </strong>with a deadly lingering-effect. Since the <em>effect</em> of <strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Fusion</em>'</strong> would be negated, and not the <em>activation, </em>the summoning restriction effect of <strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Fusion</em>' </strong>still resolves, thus the player cannot summon anything else that turn. You can counter <strong>'<em>Ash Blossom</em>' </strong>with <strong>'<em>Called by the Grave</em>' </strong>should you be fortunate enough to have it in hand.</p><p>A second method of Fusion Summoning <strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</em>' </strong>can be accessed through <strong>'<em>Magicalised Fusion</em>'</strong> and is very easy to satisfy if <em><strong>'Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon'</strong></em> has already been brought out once already using <strong><em>'Red-Eyes Fusion'</em></strong>.</p><p><strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Soul</em>' </strong>is an excellent hand trap that allows you to Special Summon <strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Darkness Metal</em>' </strong>from the deck to the field. Its condition is easy to satisfy, only requiring your opponent Special Summon a monster. Summoning <strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Darkness Metal</em>'</strong> using this method is a priority.<strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Darkness Metal</em>' </strong>helps to flood the field during your main phase by Special Summoning one Dragon monster from the hand or Graveyard. <strong>'<em>Noctovision Dragon' </em></strong>chains nicely to the resolution of <strong>'<em>Red-Eyes Soul</em>'</strong>.<em><br /></em></p><p>For going second, <strong>'<em>Evenly Matched</em>'</strong> is very useful.<strong><em> 'Bystial Magnahamut'</em></strong> is excellent going second, use it on the opponent's turn to add <strong>'<em>The Black Stone of Legend</em>' </strong> to hand at the end of their turn.</p><p>For some back row destruction <strong>'<em>Dark </em><em>Armed, The Dragon of Annihilation</em>' </strong>can<strong> </strong>target and destroy front or back row, for the cost of banishing a card in your Graveyard. The effect can be used twice in one turn. <strong>'<em>Harpies Feather Duster</em>' </strong>also helps. Consider cards in the Side Deck when facing spell and trap heavy decks.</p><p>Red-Eyes Black Dragon is a metaphor about the power of potential. This deck is enjoyable to play and has a competitive edge. I would gauge its power at around Tier 2 or 3.</p><p>Since debuting at locals on [2023-10-17], this deck has bested:</p><p>[Kashtira]<br />[Eldlich] <br />[Swordsoul] <br />[Blue-Eyes]</p>"

This is because Shaddolls were the only Flip Archetype at the time which meant that the Flip Monsters you were playing had synergy with each other and they were not just random Flip Monsters that you tossed into the Deck just because they were good. Even so,&nbsp;<strong>Pre-Preparation</strong><strong> of Rites</strong> still wouldn't be released until 2016 which meant that you were basically playing Shaddoll until you could find Tarotrei and Ritual Summon her, and from there, you would have to do your best on trying to keep Tarotrei on the field or find more ways to access more copies if she were to be removed from the field. Yes, it was a really cool Deck, but it gave a feeling of playing Shaddoll with Tarotrei on the side. Even after we got cards like&nbsp;<strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> and all of the Shaddoll support from Structure Deck Shaddoll Showdown, there was really no truly good way to play Shaddoll with Prediction Princess. They synergized with each other but their individual pieces in the Deck didn't meld well together because Shaddoll was fully capable of functioning by itself while Prediction Princess and Tarotrei were clunky pieces that were hard to access.&nbsp;<strong>Shaddoll Schism</strong> fixed some of those issues as it made it so that you didn't need to play as many names to go into the real powerhouses of Shaddoll, being their Fusions, but at that time, there was already a much better Deck that facilitated it much better in Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika. I wanted to play Shaddoll and Prediction Princess together in the same Deck, and in the same combo. And this Deck achieves that to a fairly decent degree and that is due to it inheriting both the flaws of Shaddoll and Prediction Princess in that you have no easy way to search Shaddoll Spell/Traps without much investment through getting <strong>El Shaddoll Apkallone</strong> into the GY or through Flipping&nbsp;<strong>Shaddoll Hedgehog</strong> and that there is no inherent way to search for&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. The Level 9 Monsters we are taking a look at here in this version of Prediction Princess is&nbsp;<strong>Helshaddoll Hollow</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</strong>, but mainly Anoyatyllis. You see, Anoyatyllis requires a Shaddoll monster and a WATER monster for its Fusion Materials. For one, I am not going to play&nbsp;<strong>Naelshaddoll Ariel</strong> for a WATER monster and you can bet me that I am not playing&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Crystaldine</strong> for the same reason.&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>King of the Swamp</strong> don't count either because they literally do nothing in this Deck. So, we are playing <strong>Nephe Shaddoll Fusion</strong> to create ourselves a WATER monster to Fuse. Yes, this is basically a 4 card combo, but this is the only way that I can conceivably play Shaddolls and Prediction Princess in the same Deck, go through their cards in my main combo, and end on a board that includes monsters from both sides.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Main Deck monsters, we are starting off with the same song and dance:&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotreith</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> and 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotrei</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">.

For the Shaddoll monsters: 1 <strong>Helshaddoll Hollow</strong>, 3 <strong>Shaddoll Squamata</strong>, 3 <strong>Shaddoll Hedgehog</strong>, and 3 <strong>Reeshaddoll Wendi</strong>. For their Flip Effects: Hollow targets a face-up monster your opponent controls and sends a Shaddoll monster with the same Attribute from your Extra Deck to the GY to banish that monster. Squamata targets and destroys a monster on field. Hedgehog adds a Shaddoll Spell/Trap from Deck to hand. It is VERY important to remember not to activate Hedgehog's effect when it is sent to GY by an effect. Shaddoll monsters can only use 1 effect per turn and only once that turn which means you either get their GY effect or their Flip Effect. You see, if Wendi is sent to GY by an effect, she can Special Summon a Shaddoll from Deck face-down which you are going to be using to get Hedgehog. Later in your combo when you are using Tarotreith to flip your monsters face-up, you can flip multiple monsters which means that you can flip Hedgehog face-up in addition to Bibliomuse, giving you the ability to search for <strong>Shaddoll Schism</strong> to use as a part of your endboard. 99% of the time, you get nothing out of searching a Shaddoll off of Hedgehog's GY effect, so it is important to keep this in mind. Moving onto Wendi, her Flip Effect alllows you to Special Summon a Shaddoll monster from Deck in face-up or face-down Defense Position. For their GY effects: Hollow sends cards from the top of your Deck to the GY equal to the number of different Attributes of monsters on the field. Squamata sends a Shaddoll card from Deck to GY. As an alternate to the Hedgehog spiel from earlier, if you fuse with Squamata, you can send Schism from Deck to GY, and when you detach Anoyatyllis from Aggregator, Anoyatyllis can add back said Schism. Next, Hedgehog can add a Shaddoll monster from Deck to hand which you do not need to do 99% of the time, and Wendi Special Summons a Shaddoll from Deck face-down which is usually going to be Hedgehog. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">For Spell/Traps: 1 <strong>Instant Fusion</strong> which can get either <strong>Master of Ham</strong> or <strong>El Shaddoll Winda</strong>. You see, if you draw Instant Fusion, <strong>Nephe Shaddoll Fusion</strong>, and another Shaddoll, you can actually Instant Fusion into Winda, equip Winda with Nephe Shaddoll Fusion and change its Attribute to WATER, and fuse into Anoyatyllis. This is because Winda counts Summons while it is on field as opposed to something like <strong>Summon Limit</strong> which can count Summons even before it is activated. So that is something cool to keep in mind. 1 <strong>Shaddoll Fusion</strong> because maybe you draw it going second and you can fuse 2 Shaddolls with different Attributes from Deck to make Apkallone to negate a face-up card and search a Shaddoll card when it's sent to GY. 3 <strong>Nephe Shaddoll Fusion</strong> which is an Equip Spell that equips to a Shaddoll monster, changing its Attribute to an Attribute of your choice, and while it's equipped, you can Fuse into a Shaddoll Fusion Monster using the equipped monster and a monster from hand or field. This gets you your WATER for Anoyatyllis most importantly. 1 <strong>Foolish Burial</strong>. 3 <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">which can either Special Summon a Level 9 monster from hand or target a Level 9 monster on field and Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters with different names with a different Type and Attribute than the targeted monster. 2 <strong>Emergency Teleport</strong> as 2 extra ways to access Wendi for another Shaddoll to fuse with. 3 <strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3 <strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">can Ritual a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down. And you can banish it during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. 3 <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>.

It does prevent both players from Special Summoning monsters from the hand or GY using Spell/Trap effects, but this will never come up or be a detriment to you because it is just a Level 9 to make Aggregator at the end of the day. And if it's sent to GY, it can target and add a Shaddoll Spell/Trap from GY to hand. 1 <strong>El Shaddoll Construct </strong>which can be made with a Shaddoll and a LIGHT monster. On Special Summon, you can send a Shaddoll card from Deck to GY, and if it battles a Special Summoned monster, it destroys that monster at the start of the damage step. And it can target and add back a Shaddoll Spell/Trap from GY to hand when it's sent to GY. 1 <strong>El Shaddoll Apkallone</strong> which can be made with 2 Shaddoll monsters with different Attributes. On Special Summon, it can negate the effects of a face-up card on the field and if it is sent to GY, you can add any Shaddoll card from Deck or GY to hand and then discard 1 card. 1 <strong>El Shaddoll Winda</strong> which can be made with a Shaddoll and a DARK monster. It cannot be destroyed by your opponent's effects and it limits both plays to Special Summoning once per turn when it's face-up on field. And it recycles a Shaddoll Spell/Trap from GY when it's sent there. 1 <strong>Master of Ham</strong> which Special Summons a Flip Monster from Deck face-down on Fusion Summon or when its flipped face-up. And funnily enough, since we are playing a lot of Flip Monsters, you can banish 2 Flip monsters from GY or face-up field to Special Summon it from GY in face-down Defense Position. 2 <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> which is a Ritual Search when sent to GY. 1 <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>. 1 <strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong>. 1 <strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> which </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">can send a monster from Extra Deck to GY on Xyz Summon, and it can target monsters in your GY and detach an equal number of Xyz Materials to attach those monsters to itself which can be used to loop Herald. 1 <strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1 <strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. 1 <strong>S:P Little Knight</strong>, 1 <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, and 1 <strong>Gravity Controller</strong>. </span></p><p><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Side Deck: 3 <strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>, 3 <strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong>, 3 <strong>Triple Tactics Thrust</strong>, 1 <strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong>, 2 <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>, and 3 <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>.</span></p>"

Originally, the archetype was unplayable as a standalone deck as they lacked the appriopriate cards to function by themselves. The most play they saw was being used an engine with Guitaar and Miccs. I personally used to run them in a Clownblade deck with the Star Seraphone engine back then.<br /><br />In 2022, however; they received support cards in Dimension Force. These new cards completely changed the deck and allowed them to not only be playable as a standalone deck, but could actually make fairly decent end boards. Since then, although the archetype has continued to remain largely unknown or forgotten, Symphonic Warriors have only become stronger thanks to cards such as Barrone De Fleur and the Therion cards.&nbsp;<br /><br />But as fun and powerful as Symphonic Warriors can be, they suffer from two primary weaknesses. Firstly, they have very limited starting combos, heavily relying on opening Synthess along with DJJ. Because of that, cards such as Scrap Golem and Crystron Rosenix were added to allow Scrap Recycler to become a one card combo in cases of extremely unplayable hands. Of course, the end board will be nothing great but still better than nothing. Those two cards also do not negatively affect your hands that much, so drawing them isn't too much of a problem as they can be pendulum summoned or used as discard fodder for Guitaar.<br /><br />The other weakness is consistency. Because they already suffer from a limited amount of starting combos, Symphonic Warriors practically live or die on being able to access them. Unfortunately, they do not have their own search card, hence why Small World and Ignknight Reload are needed.&nbsp; Upstart Goblin can be replaced but still benefits consistency.<br /><br />As for other details? The reason why the Therion cards are not played at maximum copies is because of the end boards Symphonic Warriors can create. They, alone, are able to create boards with 4-5 negates. Thus, the Therion cards are not always necessary but still add to the end boards nonetheless. And the reason for Planet Finder is because of opening hands with cards that would normally be searched during combos. So, it was chosen to be added as an additional target by Gear Gigant X, which then will be pendulum summoned and used to search the Therion field spell.<br /><br />Symphonic Warriors are a fun but frustating deck to play. They can create strong boards, however; they suffer from many weaknesses such as consistency, linear combos, and struggling to go second. Although they aren't able to compete with the meta, they're still great for casual tournaments or for some simple, plain fun.</p>"
