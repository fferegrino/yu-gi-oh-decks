It was somewhat inspired by an earlier tournament version of the deck. The goal is to use the resilience of Albaz to get out some of the Dark Magician's win conditions such as the Dragon Knight combo or the Dragoon. Because of the how the Albaz deck works, I found that Albaz's cards can kinda deal with most threats on win duels on its own. I would want to be able to get out a Dragon Knight combo a bit faster, but you will likely last long enough to bring it out for duels. That, or you won't need it.</p>"

Jet bounces a card and will summon itself back from the GY for free basically, Dragon Spirit banishes S/T every time it's specialed so you're usually atleast sniping one thing with it per time, Alternative Blue-Eyes actually has good use since you can destroy the Ken you give them then use it as material for a rank 8, Giantrainer is just... more draws.

C101,"<p>Hello and welcome to another guide, where I'll be explaining how to FTK with C9. Here, C101 will play an important role in that regard. Let's jump into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mIXRzhVXLw"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" cards.</p><p>2) Make sure you have 2 x Level 4 monsters at your side to XYZ Summon Gunkan. Utilize either Saryuja or ""Monster Reborn"" and while at it, activate ""Black Garden"".</p><p>3) Overlay into C101 with ""Barian's Force"" by using Gunkan as material. If you have planted flowers to opposing side and Special Summoned with ""Monster Reborn"", you can gift them to opponent by playing ""Mystic Box"". Destroy a rose to give it and then, attach said monster as material for C101. You can also reset C101 with Book spells, for your information.</p><p>4) Your aim should be to have at least 10 materials with C101 but the more, the merrier. When you think it's enough, overlay into ""Barian Hope"" via C101. Then, activate ""Clockwork Night"" to change the type of all monsters on the battlefield to&nbsp;<strong>Machine.</strong></p><p>5) With required type/attribute/rank present, activate ""Astral Force"" to jump into ""Number 9"" and lead the way with ""Barian's Force"" to C9.</p><p>6) Activate both abilities of C9 for the FTK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 9: Dyson Sphere"" can be found within ""Colossal Mech"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force"" + ""Number C101"" + ""CXyz Barian Hope"" can be found within ""Sword of the Seventh One"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Centurion's a fairly small engine, and you can play it in a variety of decks that don't block Synchro Summons, although playing it pure or with a couple of small resource engines splashed in feels like the most optimal move, since you can fit plenty of non-engine staples to supplement and insure plays.</p><p>The basic Centurion strategy is this: simple combos that spit out Level 8 and Level 12 Synchros left and right, during your turn and during your opponent's turn with the help of your Field Spell. Your main-deck Centurions will be constantly shifting between being monsters and being Continuous Traps - the fact that they're Traps allow you to use their effect to Special Summon themselves during the opponent's turn, and the cards all work together to protect each other when they're not tagging in and out - Primera protects your high-level cards from effect destruction, Legatia provides your low-strength cards with battle immunity, and Stand-Up Centurion! protects itself when a Centurion monster exists. It's an incredibly easy strategy to pick up, but where the average player separates from the advanced is how you follow-up - you might be able to King Calamity your opponent once in a while, but if that gets blocked, utilizing your surviving pieces is crucial for you to build back, which this deck can do if it really needs to.</p><hr /><p>Basic Centurion Combo - 1.5 card combo (requires <strong>Stand-Up Centurion! + 1 other card)</strong>, survives Droll, cannot be Nibiru'd:</p><ol><li>Activate&nbsp;<strong>Stand-Up Centurion!</strong></li><li>Use&nbsp;<strong>Stand-Up Centurion!</strong>, discard 1 card for cost<ul><li><em>Resolve:&nbsp;</em>Place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> from Deck into S/T Zone as Continuous Trap</li></ul></li><li>Use&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve: </em>Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> from S/T Zone</li><li><em>On Resolution:</em> Trigger&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong><br /><ul><li><em>Resolve</em>: Add&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Normal Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong></li><li>Activate&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:&nbsp;</em>Place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong> from Field into S/T Zone and place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong> from Deck into S/T Zone</li></ul></li><li>Use&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:</em> Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong> from S/T Zone</li></ul></li><li>Synchro Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Legatia</strong> using&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong><ul><li><em>On Summon:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>Trigger&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Legatia</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Draw 1 card</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><em>During End Phase</em>: Activate&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Legatia</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:</em> Place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> from GY into S/T Zone.</li></ul></li><li><em>During Opponent's Turn, when it's safe:</em> Use&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> CL1, Use <strong>Centurion Trudea</strong> CL2<ul><li><em>Resolve</em>: Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong> from S/T Zone and increase its Level to 8; Special Summon <strong>Centurion Primera</strong> from S/T Zone</li><li><em>On Resolution:&nbsp;</em>Trigger&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera&nbsp;</strong>CL1, Trigger <strong>Stand-Up Centurion!</strong> CL2, Activate <strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong> from GY CL3 targeting&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:</em> Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI&nbsp;</strong>from GY and place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong> into S/T Zone; Synchro Summon&nbsp;<strong>whatever Synchro is best for the situation</strong>;&nbsp;add&nbsp;<strong>whatever Centurion card is best follow-up for next turn</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><p>The best play (until it inevitably gets banned) is to summon&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Dragon</strong>, then using its Quick Effect immediately to summon&nbsp;<strong>Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity</strong>, which will lock your opponent out of all on-field effects for the rest of their turn, allowing you to run with that momentum for the remainder of that Duel.</p><p>If you start with&nbsp;<strong>Emblema of Oath</strong>, you can use that to Set&nbsp;Stand-Up Centurion! from your Deck and make plays like normal.</p><p>If you start with&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong>, you can Normal Summon Primera to add Stand-Up Centurion! to your hand. From there, you activate Stand-Up, use its effect to discard to place Trudea into the S/T Zone, Special Summon it, then continue plays from step 5.</p><p>If you start with&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong>, you can Normal Summon Trudea, use its effect to place Primera into the S/T Zone, Special Summon Primera, add and activate Stand-Up, then use Stand-Up to place Emet VI into the S/T Zone. From there, continue plays from step 6.</p><p>If you have all the combo pieces you need while you're building during your first turn, add <strong>Truth Centurion</strong> instead of a second Stand-Up or another Centurion monster - this gets you an omni-negate for next turn in case the opponent has a strong hand or GY effect to try to break you. During your opponents turn, for the Primera search, I like adding&nbsp;<strong>Faith of Centurion</strong> on the off-chance your Legatia is outed during the turn - you can use it to recoup the Primera that Legatia would have re-placed, giving you material for another Synchro on your turn.</p><hr /><p>Now for the side engines and unorthodox staples.</p><p>A minimal <strong>Bystial package with 1 Magnamhut and 3 Druiswurm</strong> acts as powerful GY disruption, can provide bodies on the board for defense, and provide strong effects. Druiswurm's non-destruction removal is always solid when it gets triggered, and Magnamhut can either fetch a Druiswurm or recoup a lost Signer Dragon. In addition, them all being Level 6 opens up the Level 10 Synchro package of <strong>Chaos Angel and Baronne de Fleur</strong>, in case your initial plays get interrupted and you only have Primera on-board.</p><p>Two <strong>Kashtira Fenrir</strong> give you a good option going first or second - you can summon the first, search the second, then use the second as your discard fodder for Stand-Up. And of course, there's its second effect that banishes one of your opponent's cards face-down if they use a monster effect. Finally, it being Level 7 opens up the Level 11 Synchro package without wasting your Normal Summon on Ash Blossom - specifically, <strong>Psychic End Punisher.</strong></p><p>Because of the large amount of space for hand traps, I've elected to run a <strong>Crossout Designator</strong> package, split between the Main and Side Decks. As good as this deck is against Droll and Nib, a well-timed Ash or Imperm can stop your plays if you didn't draw a second piece of follow-up. Splitting the negation between <strong>Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermenance</strong> gives you counterplay against both if you draw Crossout in your opening hand, and of course, running <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> at 3 is almost never a bad thing. There is also one copy of <strong>Nibiru</strong> in your Main Deck, in case you get the chance to go crazy - while a basic Centurion combo only performs four Summons, placing Fenrir or a Bystial on the board before that during the same turn will land you with a Primal Being Token as soon as Legatia is summoned. As for your Side Deck handtraps, you have two more copies of Nibiru for actual use, 1&nbsp;<strong>Droll and Lock Bird</strong>, just in case you're forced to use Terraforming or Prosperity, 1&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Ogre and Snow Rabbit</strong>, which would kill your Stand-Up if not countered, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Dimension Shifter</strong>, which is a Garnet for you but also shuts down a floodgate that would kill your ability to recoup resources.</p><p><strong>There Can Be Only One</strong> is just your average side-board floodgate. The only Centurions that match types are Legatia and Emet VI, meaning you can play under this card most of the time.</p><hr /><p>This is absolutely not the final version of the deck. Like all archetypes that originate from Deck Build Sets, there's likely going to be new support in future releases, and I didn't even elect to add&nbsp;<strong>Bonfire</strong> to this list, which is just another 1-3 copies of Trudea - I wanted to keep this list restrained to Valiant Smashers and earlier, to make it as accessible as possible to the earliest adopters of this archetype. Centurion has had incredible results in the OCG, and I'm looking forward to being one of the first to run it here in the TCG.</p>"

Destroy EVERY card the opponent has on summon is great especially since it can be summon on their turn and the fact that it burns for the combined original attack of every destroyed monster means an opponent could loss just by trying to push for lethal. The restriction on the burn damage might seem a little annoying but is in reality really easily to meet. The fact that monster is UNAFFECTED by other card's means that the opponent can't even negate it and if they somehow survive the burn damage they're gonna have a hell of a time getting off the field.
