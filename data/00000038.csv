It was somewhat inspired by an earlier tournament version of the deck. The goal is to use the resilience of Albaz to get out some of the Dark Magician's win conditions such as the Dragon Knight combo or the Dragoon. Because of the how the Albaz deck works, I found that Albaz's cards can kinda deal with most threats on win duels on its own. I would want to be able to get out a Dragon Knight combo a bit faster, but you will likely last long enough to bring it out for duels. That, or you won't need it.</p>"

Jet bounces a card and will summon itself back from the GY for free basically, Dragon Spirit banishes S/T every time it's specialed so you're usually atleast sniping one thing with it per time, Alternative Blue-Eyes actually has good use since you can destroy the Ken you give them then use it as material for a rank 8, Giantrainer is just... more draws.

C101,"<p>Hello and welcome to another guide, where I'll be explaining how to FTK with C9. Here, C101 will play an important role in that regard. Let's jump into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mIXRzhVXLw"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" cards.</p><p>2) Make sure you have 2 x Level 4 monsters at your side to XYZ Summon Gunkan. Utilize either Saryuja or ""Monster Reborn"" and while at it, activate ""Black Garden"".</p><p>3) Overlay into C101 with ""Barian's Force"" by using Gunkan as material. If you have planted flowers to opposing side and Special Summoned with ""Monster Reborn"", you can gift them to opponent by playing ""Mystic Box"". Destroy a rose to give it and then, attach said monster as material for C101. You can also reset C101 with Book spells, for your information.</p><p>4) Your aim should be to have at least 10 materials with C101 but the more, the merrier. When you think it's enough, overlay into ""Barian Hope"" via C101. Then, activate ""Clockwork Night"" to change the type of all monsters on the battlefield to&nbsp;<strong>Machine.</strong></p><p>5) With required type/attribute/rank present, activate ""Astral Force"" to jump into ""Number 9"" and lead the way with ""Barian's Force"" to C9.</p><p>6) Activate both abilities of C9 for the FTK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 9: Dyson Sphere"" can be found within ""Colossal Mech"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force"" + ""Number C101"" + ""CXyz Barian Hope"" can be found within ""Sword of the Seventh One"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Centurion's a fairly small engine, and you can play it in a variety of decks that don't block Synchro Summons, although playing it pure or with a couple of small resource engines splashed in feels like the most optimal move, since you can fit plenty of non-engine staples to supplement and insure plays.</p><p>The basic Centurion strategy is this: simple combos that spit out Level 8 and Level 12 Synchros left and right, during your turn and during your opponent's turn with the help of your Field Spell. Your main-deck Centurions will be constantly shifting between being monsters and being Continuous Traps - the fact that they're Traps allow you to use their effect to Special Summon themselves during the opponent's turn, and the cards all work together to protect each other when they're not tagging in and out - Primera protects your high-level cards from effect destruction, Legatia provides your low-strength cards with battle immunity, and Stand-Up Centurion! protects itself when a Centurion monster exists. It's an incredibly easy strategy to pick up, but where the average player separates from the advanced is how you follow-up - you might be able to King Calamity your opponent once in a while, but if that gets blocked, utilizing your surviving pieces is crucial for you to build back, which this deck can do if it really needs to.</p><hr /><p>Basic Centurion Combo - 1.5 card combo (requires <strong>Stand-Up Centurion! + 1 other card)</strong>, survives Droll, cannot be Nibiru'd:</p><ol><li>Activate&nbsp;<strong>Stand-Up Centurion!</strong></li><li>Use&nbsp;<strong>Stand-Up Centurion!</strong>, discard 1 card for cost<ul><li><em>Resolve:&nbsp;</em>Place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> from Deck into S/T Zone as Continuous Trap</li></ul></li><li>Use&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve: </em>Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> from S/T Zone</li><li><em>On Resolution:</em> Trigger&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong><br /><ul><li><em>Resolve</em>: Add&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Normal Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong></li><li>Activate&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:&nbsp;</em>Place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong> from Field into S/T Zone and place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong> from Deck into S/T Zone</li></ul></li><li>Use&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:</em> Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong> from S/T Zone</li></ul></li><li>Synchro Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Legatia</strong> using&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong><ul><li><em>On Summon:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>Trigger&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Legatia</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Draw 1 card</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><em>During End Phase</em>: Activate&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Legatia</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:</em> Place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> from GY into S/T Zone.</li></ul></li><li><em>During Opponent's Turn, when it's safe:</em> Use&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong> CL1, Use <strong>Centurion Trudea</strong> CL2<ul><li><em>Resolve</em>: Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong> from S/T Zone and increase its Level to 8; Special Summon <strong>Centurion Primera</strong> from S/T Zone</li><li><em>On Resolution:&nbsp;</em>Trigger&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera&nbsp;</strong>CL1, Trigger <strong>Stand-Up Centurion!</strong> CL2, Activate <strong>Centurion Emet VI</strong> from GY CL3 targeting&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong><ul><li><em>Resolve:</em> Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Emet VI&nbsp;</strong>from GY and place&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong> into S/T Zone; Synchro Summon&nbsp;<strong>whatever Synchro is best for the situation</strong>;&nbsp;add&nbsp;<strong>whatever Centurion card is best follow-up for next turn</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><p>The best play (until it inevitably gets banned) is to summon&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Dragon</strong>, then using its Quick Effect immediately to summon&nbsp;<strong>Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity</strong>, which will lock your opponent out of all on-field effects for the rest of their turn, allowing you to run with that momentum for the remainder of that Duel.</p><p>If you start with&nbsp;<strong>Emblema of Oath</strong>, you can use that to Set&nbsp;Stand-Up Centurion! from your Deck and make plays like normal.</p><p>If you start with&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Primera</strong>, you can Normal Summon Primera to add Stand-Up Centurion! to your hand. From there, you activate Stand-Up, use its effect to discard to place Trudea into the S/T Zone, Special Summon it, then continue plays from step 5.</p><p>If you start with&nbsp;<strong>Centurion Trudea</strong>, you can Normal Summon Trudea, use its effect to place Primera into the S/T Zone, Special Summon Primera, add and activate Stand-Up, then use Stand-Up to place Emet VI into the S/T Zone. From there, continue plays from step 6.</p><p>If you have all the combo pieces you need while you're building during your first turn, add <strong>Truth Centurion</strong> instead of a second Stand-Up or another Centurion monster - this gets you an omni-negate for next turn in case the opponent has a strong hand or GY effect to try to break you. During your opponents turn, for the Primera search, I like adding&nbsp;<strong>Faith of Centurion</strong> on the off-chance your Legatia is outed during the turn - you can use it to recoup the Primera that Legatia would have re-placed, giving you material for another Synchro on your turn.</p><hr /><p>Now for the side engines and unorthodox staples.</p><p>A minimal <strong>Bystial package with 1 Magnamhut and 3 Druiswurm</strong> acts as powerful GY disruption, can provide bodies on the board for defense, and provide strong effects. Druiswurm's non-destruction removal is always solid when it gets triggered, and Magnamhut can either fetch a Druiswurm or recoup a lost Signer Dragon. In addition, them all being Level 6 opens up the Level 10 Synchro package of <strong>Chaos Angel and Baronne de Fleur</strong>, in case your initial plays get interrupted and you only have Primera on-board.</p><p>Two <strong>Kashtira Fenrir</strong> give you a good option going first or second - you can summon the first, search the second, then use the second as your discard fodder for Stand-Up. And of course, there's its second effect that banishes one of your opponent's cards face-down if they use a monster effect. Finally, it being Level 7 opens up the Level 11 Synchro package without wasting your Normal Summon on Ash Blossom - specifically, <strong>Psychic End Punisher.</strong></p><p>Because of the large amount of space for hand traps, I've elected to run a <strong>Crossout Designator</strong> package, split between the Main and Side Decks. As good as this deck is against Droll and Nib, a well-timed Ash or Imperm can stop your plays if you didn't draw a second piece of follow-up. Splitting the negation between <strong>Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermenance</strong> gives you counterplay against both if you draw Crossout in your opening hand, and of course, running <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> at 3 is almost never a bad thing. There is also one copy of <strong>Nibiru</strong> in your Main Deck, in case you get the chance to go crazy - while a basic Centurion combo only performs four Summons, placing Fenrir or a Bystial on the board before that during the same turn will land you with a Primal Being Token as soon as Legatia is summoned. As for your Side Deck handtraps, you have two more copies of Nibiru for actual use, 1&nbsp;<strong>Droll and Lock Bird</strong>, just in case you're forced to use Terraforming or Prosperity, 1&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Ogre and Snow Rabbit</strong>, which would kill your Stand-Up if not countered, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Dimension Shifter</strong>, which is a Garnet for you but also shuts down a floodgate that would kill your ability to recoup resources.</p><p><strong>There Can Be Only One</strong> is just your average side-board floodgate. The only Centurions that match types are Legatia and Emet VI, meaning you can play under this card most of the time.</p><hr /><p>This is absolutely not the final version of the deck. Like all archetypes that originate from Deck Build Sets, there's likely going to be new support in future releases, and I didn't even elect to add&nbsp;<strong>Bonfire</strong> to this list, which is just another 1-3 copies of Trudea - I wanted to keep this list restrained to Valiant Smashers and earlier, to make it as accessible as possible to the earliest adopters of this archetype. Centurion has had incredible results in the OCG, and I'm looking forward to being one of the first to run it here in the TCG.</p>"

Destroy EVERY card the opponent has on summon is great especially since it can be summon on their turn and the fact that it burns for the combined original attack of every destroyed monster means an opponent could loss just by trying to push for lethal. The restriction on the burn damage might seem a little annoying but is in reality really easily to meet. The fact that monster is UNAFFECTED by other card's means that the opponent can't even negate it and if they somehow survive the burn damage they're gonna have a hell of a time getting off the field.

Play with FIVE copies of your most powerful Sky Striker card! <br /><br />Right now, blind second strategies are in a good position to tackle the meta because of the nerfs to Tearlaments - the only deck that does relatively well vs. boardbreakers. The dominant decks right now are Kashtira and Purrely, both decks that fold to boardwipes, Nibiru, and freely trigger Triple Tactics Thrust. Thrust searches the out for each of these decks, and you're free to go off with Sky Striker's unparalelled grindgame and boardbreaking potential! <br /><br />After the gamestate has been simplified, this is where Sky Strikers come in! in addition to having enough main deck space to fit in the mandatory ""Maxx C"" package (9 cards), the strategy can also comfortably fit powerspells like Lightning Storm, Dark Ruler No More, Raigeki and Triple Tactics Talent! The Sky Striker engine also has cards that excel at cracking boards like Widow Anchor and Afterburners.&nbsp;<br class=""ContentPasted0"" /><br class=""ContentPasted0"" />The time-tested strategy with blind second Sky Strikers is to destroy most if not all of your opponent's resources that they slap down on the board going first, and then close out the match with Sky Striker's grind game. This is done by setting up multi-role and if you cannot, you prioritize getting Engage! from deck and using it as much as possible especially with it's extra +1 draw.<br /><br />The current meta allows for Lightning Storm and Raigeki to obliterate most duelist's boards this format since they generally spend all their resources building their ""unbreakable"" board only to fall to 1-2 cards. For example, you can bait out your opponent's singular S/T negate (Like Spright Carrot/Baronne) with Afterburners then obliterate everything afterwards with Raigeki! If that's not enough, Raye and friends can clear the board very well during the battle phase and with Zeke's banish.&nbsp;</p><p><br class=""ContentPasted0"" />If your weakened opponent hasn't surrendered yet due to the sheer resource advantage and offensive pressure this deck generates, you can clear the board with a plethora of cards including Linkage, allowing Raye to OTK all by herself!<br /><br />This Sky Striker list is an updated version of my earlier Sky Striker decks, specifically for the October 2023 Masterduel metagame. <br /><br />Remember, RAYE IS BAE!!!</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Repeat until there is nothing to fetch with ""Primal Seed"".</p><p>5) After the activation of ""Soul Absorption"", activate Sage to discard everything in your hand.

Saturn+Trident,"<p>(<strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong>Keep an eye on how many Extra Deck cards your opponent have and plan accordingly.)</p><p>Greetings! Did you know there is another card similar to <a href=""/card/earthbound-greater-linewalker-10340"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Earthbound Greater Linewalker</strong></a>, seen in ""Side Deck""? Just like how Linewalker sets your opponent's LP to 3000, Pendransaction does the same but there is a catch: You need to have at least 15 more Extra Deck cards than your opponent. Thanks to Trident, you can setup in your favor. Let's get into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/AlsguTMnP_A"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Throughout the game, perform these actions below in preparation of Pendransaction:</p><ul><li>Use Pendulum ability of Garuda to destroy a spell/trap and deliver Garuda to Extra Deck as face-up.</li><li>Discard Alector + Saturn with Ravenous, even just one will do.</li><li>XYZ Summon ""Abyss Dweller"" by using 2 x Cthugua as materials and activate Abyss to not be disturbed by effects coming from your opponent's GY, which will be filled with Extra Deck monsters thanks to Trident later on.</li></ul><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" cards. For sake of convenience, banish Extra Deck monsters for Chaos Emperor, which are Librarian as DARK and Integrator as LIGHT.</p><p>3) If you have either Alector or Saturn in your hand but not both, Special Summon one of them via Saryuja. Then, make sure Alector + Flamvell is present on the battlefield, where you can also use ""Monster Reborn""...</p><ul><li>If board space is your concern, you can also add ""Offerings to the Doomed"", found in ""Side Deck"". However, it's vital to add Offerings if your opponent has only one Extra Deck card. Reason is that even though you can send only Saryuja to GY, how can you also send Trident to GY afterwards?</li></ul><p>4) Synchro Summon Trident with Alector + Flamvell. Then, activate Trident to send up to three of your monsters to GY, where you can also include Trident to send up to three Extra Deck cards to GY. If there are Extra Deck monsters present, focus on them first and repeat until your opponent has no Extra Deck cards. By reviving Trident and 1-2 more monsters with ""Monster Reborn"", you can repeat this step as many times as you can. As explained in #3, if your opponent has only one Extra Deck card, you have to add Offerings to clear Trident manually...</p><ul><li>Since Trident clears up to three board spaces, you can XYZ Summon Pendransaction by using Monk+Panda as materials. Never ever do with 2 x Cthugua, be warned.</li></ul><p>5) If you have depleted your opponent's Extra Deck via Trident, you can revive Saturn with ""Monster Reborn"" and activate ""The Sanctuary in the Sky""...</p><ul><li>If interested, know that you don't have to use Saturn + Sanctuary duo to FTK with Pendransaction. You can remove these two and add any FTK cards to your liking. You can check this <strong><a href=""/deck-search/?&amp;cardcode=Earthbound%20Greater%20Linewalker%7C&amp;author=154160&amp;offset=0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">link</a></strong> to see Linewalker decks, where you can add said FTK shenanigans but there is catch: For each new Extra Deck monsters, you have to add more of Pendulum monsters as Extra Deck face-up. Feel free to have a look at ""Side Deck"" for other Pendulum monsters you might add in the future.</li></ul><p>6) It's time to return Extra Deck cards to where they belong...</p><ul><li>If they are in BZ, ""Primal Seed"" is your best friend.</li><li>If they are in GY, ""Pot of Avarice"" + ""Pot of Generosity"" are your best friends.</li></ul><p>7) If you have done everything correctly, you should have 15 Extra Deck cards while your opponent has none. Finally, activate Pendransaction to set your opponent's LP to 3000 and tribute Saturn for the FTK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Abyss Dweller"" can be found within ""Forgotten City Dwellers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pendransaction"" can be found within ""Emerging Monstrosity Recon!"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Choose the outcome as&nbsp;<strong>heads&nbsp;</strong>to always skip your opponent's turn, at the cost of sending two of your monsters to GY.</p><p>3) Special Summon 2 x Level 1 dudes with Panda. Next, XYZ Summon Dullahan with these little dudes and overlay into Mischief.</p><p>4) Before jumping into End Phase, here is your checklist:</p><ul><li>Have you changed the button on the lower right corner of the screen to either ""ON"" or ""Auto to not miss anything?&nbsp;It can be changed within settings under ""Duel"", where you can change ""Activation Confirmation"" to ""Switch + Hold"" for manual setup.</li><li>Do you have monsters other than Mischief + Time Thief + Arcana trio? Don't forget to have at least two monsters for Arcana, so that you can skip your opponent's turn by sending them to GY.</li><li>Have you sent Balerdroch + Sabres to GY? You can either send both with Ravenous or hold them in-hand to send them into GY with ""Into the Void"".</li><li>Have you set Bird Sanctuary + DNA Surgery? These will come in handy later on.</li></ul><p>5) After your opponent's turn has been skipped, during your Standby Phase, Special Summon Balerdroch and activate the ability of Redoer to attach top of your opponent's Main Deck. Then, shuffle a card from your hand on top of your Main Deck to bring forth Sabres. When you end your turn, send Balerdroch + Sabres to GY for Arcana.</p><p>6) Repeat what was explained in #5 until Redoer has 6 materials attached and nothing more. Then, activate ""Bird Sanctuary"" and ""DNA Surgery"". By changing the type of every monster on the battlefield to&nbsp;<strong>Winged Beast,&nbsp;</strong>you can attach Redoer into Mischief via ""Bird Sanctuary"" for the victory!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Arcana Force XXI - The World"" + ""Light Barrier"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

C101+Barian Hope,"<p>Good day to you! Some time ago, I made a FTK based on <a href=""/deck/silent-chaotic-sphere-380092"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>C9</strong></a> with C101. Today, I decided to do the same thing but based on Number 43. Let me see...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5HWRrTDQpt0"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" cards.</p><p>2) Special Summon Yajiro via Saryuja. You have to place Yajiro at the center of the battlefield or Yajiro will detonate itself. Then, place Saryuja opposite to Yajiro with ""Shien's Spy"" and gift Yajiro with same card to rightmost side afterwards.</p><p>3) Set ""Waking the Dragon"" to where Yajiro can bounce. The reason is that when we revive a monster with ""Monster Reborn"" and place the monster at where said trap is, Yajiro will destroy Waking. This allows to Special Summon a monster from your Extra Deck. Repeat this process until you brought forth Number 43 + Number C101 + Reprodocus. Note that Reprodocus and C101 should point towards each other.</p><p>4) It's time to attach monsters with C101. Start with sucking Yajiro and then, reset its ability with Book spells to repeat as many times as possible. Then, revive a monster and gift to opposing side because C101 can only attach Special Summoned monsters from opponent's side of battlefield.</p><p>5) Meanwhile, enlarge your hand with ""Primal Seed"" cards by targeting each other and adding banished card as extra to your hand.</p><p>6) Repeat these steps explained in #4 + #5 until you think you had it enough. Then, replace C101 with Barian Hope, pointing towards Reprodocus.</p><p>7) If you have attached enough materials by repeating #4, Barian Hope should have good amount of ATK. You can boost even further by activating ""Stoic Challenge"".</p><p>8) If you have expanded your hand by repeating #5, ""Torpedo Takedown"" will work well in your favor. After changing the attribute of Barian Hope to WATER with Reprodocus, you can activate Torpedo by detaching a material from Barian Hope. While Torpedo deals damage in multiples of 400 for each card in your hand, same amount will be also granted to Barian Hope.</p><p>9) Thanks to last five steps, if executed well enough, the ATK of Barian Hope should be larger than your opponent's LP. If you recall, Number 43 was Special Summoned with ""Waking the Dragon"", explained in #3. Play ""Mystik Wok"" for the final blow by tributing Barian Hope and choosing its ATK. What is going to happen is that you will gain LP equal to ATK Barian Hope had and Number 43 will convert healing into damage against your opponent for lethal damage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Stoic Challenge"" can be found within ""Blazing Warriors"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Number C101"" + ""CXyz Barian Hope"" can be found within ""Sword of the Seventh One"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Level 9 Spotted ⚠️,"<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Dragonmaid really is not the best engine to be running if you want to get a Level 9 monster on board easily. I guess that this realistically is more of a&nbsp;<strong>Summoner of Illusions</strong> showcase for Prediction Princess than it is a ""Dragonmaid Prediction Princess"" Deck, but I'm still combing through all the Level 9 monsters in the game and putting them into a Prediction Princess Deck. Are there any actual benefits to playing Dragonmaid in Prediction Princess? Literally no. The Main Deck Dragonmaids in&nbsp;<strong>Chamber Dragonmaid</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Parlor Dragonmaid</strong> are very Normal Summon reliant and there is also no real good way to search a Dragonmaid monster through in-archetype cards except for <strong>Kitchen Dragonmaid</strong> which is yet another Normal Summon who is one of the worst searchers I've seen for an archetypal card. This Deck is using them in order to search&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Changeover</strong> which Fusion Summons&nbsp;<strong>House Dragonmaid</strong> out of the Extra Deck, getting you a Level 9 monster on the field whose Type and Attribute are perfect for&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> in this Deck. Yes, the days are over for us where we </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">""need"" to use Monstrosity because of&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong> access off of&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong>, but we are playing the best of both worlds in both a Monstrosity line and Instant Fusion for Master of Ham in this Deck. I do really like <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/ham-prediction-princess-378532/"">Ham Prediction Princess</a> and going all in to search for Instant Fusion for Ham access and I do think that is much better than bidding on Monstrosity, but I am currently experimenting with Prediction Princess making use of the various Level 9's in the game and seeing if they can actually make a functioning Deck.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For our Main Deck monsters: 3 <strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>. 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>. Again, I think that playing a combination of 5 Prediction Princess Ritual monsters consisting of some number of Tarotrei and some number of Tarotreith is a good Ritual Monster concentration for the Deck. However, I've had some time to dwell on Tarotreith and I figured that since it is the more ""important"" of the two Rituals for plays on your opponent's turn, I'd rather be playing a higher concentration of it. Tarotreith can be Ritual Summoned or Summoned from hand or GY via Tarotrei's End Phase effect. On Flip, it can Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down and as a Quick Effect, it can Flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. Tarotrei can Quick Effect Flip a monster face-up or face-down and can Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY in face-down Defense Position during the End Phase. 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> which on flip adds a Prediction Princess monster other than itself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand. If it's Tributed and sent to GY, it can Summon itself back face-down, and while on field, it gives your Ritual Monsters targeting and destruction protection. 2 <strong>Deus X-Krawler</strong> which negates all of your opponent's monsters' activated effects on field after it has been flipped face-up, and when it's destroyed on field, it can add a Level 9 with a different Type and Attribute than it from Deck to hand. I would play 1, but having another copy in Deck is good in case you drew one in your opening hand to still have Monstrosity live. You could play 1 <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> in place of the second Deus X, but that's up to you. 3 <strong>Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</strong> which adds a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell from Deck to hand on Normal or Flip Summon. When you don't have access to the Dragonmaid portion of your Deck or access to <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>, Manju helps you get to more of your Ritual pieces for your Prediction Princess plays. 1&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Ernus</strong> which is pretty much only here as a way to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Dragonmaid from hand by discarding it. Also, I guess it also acts as a Dragon monster for Fusion Material for House Dragonmaid. You could cut this card if&nbsp; you want, but having a way to get a Dragonmaid onto the field without using your Normal Summon and having an extra Dragon for Fusion Material just in case is pretty alright. 3&nbsp;<strong>Chamber Dragonmaid</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Parlor Dragonmaid</strong>. Chamber adds a Dragonmaid Spell/Trap from Deck on Summon and Parlor sends a Dragonmaid card from Deck to GY on Summon. Chamber will usually be searching&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Changeover </strong>for a Fusion Summon whereas Parlor will be sending either Changeover or&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Tidying</strong>. If you draw Parlor and another Dragon, you can send Changeover, Changeover bounces Parlor to hand to add back itself, and you can Fuse into House Dragonmaid from there. If you draw say Parlor and&nbsp;<strong>Foolish Burial</strong>, you can Normal Parlor to send Tidying, use Foolish to send Chamber, Tidying banish from GY to Summon Chamber from GY, and Chamber search Changeover for a Fusion Summon. 1&nbsp;<strong>Summoner of Illusions</strong> which on flip Tributes another monster to Special Summon a Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck which is destroyed during the End Phase. Mind you that this is a MANDATORY effect, but it works wonders in a Deck like this. So what are your options? Well, your best options are monsters who don't have an important effect that activates specifically on Fusion Summon, a way to negate cards and/or effects, or a generally good effect, but most importantly, they cannot say ""Must be Fusion Summoned"" or ""Must first be Fusion Summoned"". Let's go through them:</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>~ Naturia Exterio -</strong> This card is basically infinite Spell/Trap negates by banishing a card from GY and sending the top card of your Deck to the GY.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>~ Invoked Mechaba - </strong>&nbsp;This card can negate a Spell/Trap Card or monster effect by discarding a card of the same type. It's a very solid piece of interruption and negation.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>~ Dragonmaid Sheou </strong>-&nbsp; An omni-negate that bounces itself back to the Extra Deck afterwards to Summon a <strong>House Dragonmaid</strong> from Extra Deck. Excellent for this specific Deck.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">~ <strong>Eldlich the Mad Golden Lord </strong>- He cannot be destroyed by any card effect, including its own destruction via&nbsp;<strong>Summoner of Illusions</strong>'s effect during the End Phase. And if he sticks around, you can Tribute a Zombie, most likely being himself, on your turn to take control of a face-up monster your opponent controls, period.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>~ Despian Proskenion</strong> - During the Main Phase, it can Quick Effect banish a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link from your opponent's GY or Special Summon it to your field.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>~ Gaia Prominence, the Fierce Force</strong> - It's a bit of a stretch, but by discarding a card, you can negate an opponent's activated monster effect in the hand or GY.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">~ <strong>Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World -</strong> This substitutes an activated monster effect or an activated Normal Spell/Trap Card of your opponent with ""Your opponent discards 1 card."" This is a bit more situational as you can't activate this effect if you, yourself, have no cards in hand because that would make it an illegal activation. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><strong>~ Mamonaka the Vaylantz United</strong> - During the Main Phase, it can Quick Effect target an Effect Monster in your opponent's Main Monster Zone and place it face-up in the Spell/Trap Zone in the same column as a Continuous Spell, but if that Zone is occupied, it's instead destroyed and your opponent is burned equal to its ATK.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">~ <strong>Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart</strong> - This card targets and shuffles a card your opponent controls into the Deck on Special Summon. It isn't as good as some of the other monsters here, but it is definitely a consideration somewhat, and it also is a Level 9 so it can technically act as a Monstrosity target on your opponent's turn.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">~ </span><strong style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Red-Eyes Dark </strong><strong>Dragoon </strong>- It cannot be destroyed or targeted by card effects, period. Yes, this includes <strong>Summoner of Illusion</strong><strong>s</strong>'s End Phase effect. You cannot pop cards with its first effect because it was not Fusion Summoned, meaning no Normal Monsters used for it Fusion Summon, but it is still an untargetable, indestructible omni-negate once per turn.</p><p>~ <strong>Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</strong> - If you are willing to play another Albaz Fusion in the Extra Deck, this card is a Quick Effect banish 1 monster on the field. And no, it cannot use its other effect to destroy all monsters your opponent controls during the End Phase if your opponent gets rid of it because it wasn't Fusion Summoned.</p><p>~ <strong>Rindbrumm the Striking Dragon</strong> - This card negates your opponent's activated Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link Monster's effect and returns a monster on field to the hand. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>~ Tearlaments Rulkallos</strong> -&nbsp; Rulkallos negates the activation of a card or effect that would Special Summon a monster(s) and sends a Tear from hand or field to GY, including itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>~ Dark Cavalry </strong>- As a non-once per turn, it can discard a card to negate an activated card or effect that targets a card on field. This includes your opponent targeting their own cards as well which gives it a lot more utility, but just like Gaia Prominence, it is only a consideration.</p><p>~ <strong>Millennium-Eyes Restrict&nbsp;</strong>- When your opponent activates a monster effect, it can target an Effect Monster on your opponent's field or in their GY and equip itself with that monster, gaining ATK/DEF equal to that monster's ATK/DEF and it negates the activated effects of all monsters with the same original name, and prevents them from attacking. Because we are also playing&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> in this Deck, it wouldn't hurt much to play this card because you can either use it as interruption or protect yourself against handtraps on your turn.</p><p>For Spell/Traps: 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong>. 3 <strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which can Ritual Summon a Prediction Princess from hand or GY face-up or face-down and it can banish itself during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. 1&nbsp;<strong>Foolish Burial</strong> to send a Dragonmaid for reasons I stated earlier or it can send Tarotrei or Tarotreith because Underworld Ritual can Ritual Summon from GY. 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which can Special a Level 9 from hand or target a Level 9 on field and Special Summon 2 Level 9's from Deck with a different name, different Type, and different Attribute. 1&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Changeover</strong> which can Fusion Summon a Dragon Fusion Monster using monsters from hand or field. If it's in GY, you can bounce a Dragonmaid you control to your hand and add this to your hand. 2&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Tidying</strong> which can target a Dragon monster you control and a card your opponent controls or in their Gy and return them to the hand. You can use this card for interruption if you draw it, but as for its GY effect, you can banish it to Special Summon a Dragonmaid from hand or GY which may come up in your combo. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>.</p><p>Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Naturia Exterio</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Dragonmaid Sheou</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>House Dragonmaid</strong> which is our Level 9 target of choice for Monstrosity in this Deck. It can be made with a Dragonmaid and a Dragon monster. 1&nbsp;<strong>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham&nbsp;</strong>which can be Summoned via Instant Fusion and on Fusion Summon, it can Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down which gives you access to&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Alligator's Sword</strong> <strong>Dragon</strong> which can also be Summoned via Instant Fusion. If you draw Monstrosity and the Dragonmaid line, you don't need to go into Master of Ham for Bibliomuse, in that case, you can Summon Alligator's Sword Dragon for a Dragon for Fusion Material for House Dragonmaid. Your other options are <strong>Curse of Dragon, the Magical Knight Dragon</strong> and <strong>Darkfire Dragon</strong>. 1 <strong>Herald of the Arc Light </strong>to send off of <strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> for a Ritual Search. 1 <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>. 1 <strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong> which can detach any number of cards to pop the same number of cards and it can attach a monster it destroys by battle to itself as Xyz Material which makes it good for board clearing and making Zeus. 2 <strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> which sends a monster from Extra Deck to GY on Xyz Summon and it can detach materials to reattach monsters from GY which means you can recycle Herald for more searches. 1 <strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1 <strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong> for a Rank 9 option. 1 <strong>Gravity Controller</strong> to Link off Aggregator.</p><p>Side Deck: 2&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>, 3 <strong>Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju</strong>, 1 <strong>Kurikara Divincarnate</strong>, 3 <strong>Triple Tactics Thrust</strong>, 2 <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>, 1 <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>, and 3 <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>.&nbsp;</p>"
