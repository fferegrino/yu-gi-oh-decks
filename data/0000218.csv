The side deck is full of possible cards I need to experiment with it some more to figure out the ratios of cards but I found there's a new way to build it prioritizing the banishes so you can use Neptune to return them all and have a 3k beater. The deck isn't heavy on negates only because it's a work in progress and I wanna try the cards out over time it will be condensed. Have fun and experiment with this profile until you find a ratio that works for you! good luck have fun!

Just following the recommendation cards that are listed below. ___________________________________________  <strong>[Key Cards]</strong>: 3 Main Engine - <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a> - <a data-name=""Performage Damage Juggler"">Performage Damage Juggler</a> - <a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>  <strong>[Recommend]</strong>Â to Search/Use - <a data-name=""Lyna the Light Charmer"">Lyna the Light Charmer</a> (Hand) &amp; <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> (Spell/Trap Zone) - <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a> (Hand) - <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a>Â (Spell/Trap Zone) = <a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a> (Hand)  ___________________________________________  Once you finally set up your cards. You will proceed with the next step by activating â<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>â effect to send out â<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>â from your hand to the GY. Then use ""<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>"" effect to become Earth Attribute that allowed you to Summon â<a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend"">Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend</a>'' card from either hand or Deck by sending both â<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>â and â<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>â from the field to the GY, which make them to trigger of their effects by Chain Link 2 and bringing it back â<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>â from the GY to the field along with â<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>â by it own effect. Now you have finally had a chance to Summon â<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>â from either hand or Deck by its own effect. After that use â<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>â effect to search out â<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>â from your Deck then add it to your hand which is the only best Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF/Level 4/Light Attribute monster that can be able to search out by ""<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed - Dharc"">Familiar-Possessed - Dharc</a>"" effect when it Summoned by it own effect.  <strong>Reminder:</strong>Â Do not activate ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" effect during your turn when it Summoned to your field, it will disable you for summoning from the Exta Deck unless if you have too. (This is an Optional)  You will soon basically understand the concept of which cards you might ever use during the set up once you finally figure out how the Charmer's strategy works. Do the rest which I already listed of all the cards that might be used for the final board set up at the below.  ___________________________________________  <strong>[End Board]</strong> â¢Â <em>Field:</em> - <a data-name=""Borreload Salvage Dragon"">Borreload Salvage Dragon</a> - <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> + {<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a> = <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Magicians</a>} (Opponent's Turn) â¢Â <em>Spell/Trap:</em> - <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> (face-up) - <a data-name=""Possessed Partnerships"">Possessed Partnerships</a> (set) = <a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a> (Opponent's Turn) - <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a> (Spell/Trap Zone)(Equipped by ""<a data-name=""Borreload Salvage Dragon"">Borreload Salvage Dragon</a>"" effect) â¢Â <em>Hand:</em> - 1 Draw (Your turn) - Extra Draw (During your Opponent's Turn) - Added: <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted</a> (During your Opponent's Turn)  ___________________________________________  <strong>Tips</strong>: You might not actually get them from the opening hand with exactly cards. So I prefer you to try something else with different cards in your hand if one of the Key Cards are missing. You should better rely on your additional cards in your hand that might help you to set up your cards. Keep it in your mind that ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" is just an additional card to use Familiar-Possessed - Lyna's Effect to search out ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" from your deck to the hand.  Since Lyna &amp; Dharc familiar monsters havenât been revealed yet in TCG. I came up with those ideas by adding â<a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>â and â<a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a>â from the Deck to gain more consistency. I didn't actually plan to add them on my Deck in the first place since I want to prove that this Deck can win without relying on any Limited cards. Â I might actually replace the â<a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>â and â<a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a>â including the â<a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>â later once the Light and Dark familiarâs monster has been finally released in TCG. By replacing it with two copies of â<a data-name=""Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin"">Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin</a>â Field Spell card and one â<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>â Spell card.  ___________________________________________  <strong>[Additional]Â </strong>for moreÂ Consistency You can use ""<a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>"" as additional for ""<a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>"" or any Level 4 monster from your Deck like ""<a data-name=""Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre"">Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</a>"" or any Performage monster depending what card you need. Requirement: 1 any Spell card, except ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" card, if not, you can use it as well if you have too. I include â<a data-name=""Summoner Mon"">Summoner Mon</a>kâ from my Deck Profile since It actually works very well for any Level 4 monster."

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series.  ""D/D/D"" (ï¼¤ãã£ã¼ï¼¤ãã£ã¼ï¼¤ãã£ã¼ DÄ«dÄ«dÄ«), known as DDD in the English manga, and pronounced ""Triple D"" in the dubbed anime, is a sub-archetype of the ""D/D"" archetype used by Declan Akaba in the Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V anime and special manga chapter. The ""D/D/D"" monsters serve as the ""bosses"" of the ""D/D"" archetype due to most of the archetype's gameplay focusing on their Summoning, along with the fact that ""D/D/D"" monsters generally have higher ATK/DEF and stronger effects than non-""D/D/D"" ""D/D"" monsters.

If you have Yasha in your hand you can then SS them to Link to the bigger Yuki (L4) with Dakki, Yuki, and Yasha.  REZD is moreso just filler and a card I've used in every Zombie deck since it came out, so you don't have to use them. Vampire Fraulein is a good defensive option and can make going into L4 Yuki-onna easier if Yasha isn't available. Doesn't really have answers to everything, but that's why it's a casual deck."

At the end of the day it's Rageki effect is the life blood of the decks ability to control the tempo and with the limiting of Meow Meow one has to become creative with how they'll extend. As a result I stacked the deck with ways to get your linking off the ground even after you have spent your Meow Meow on turn 1. Likewise, control pieces are sprinkled throughout the deck to handle the most common archetypes you'll be facing. Whether that's droplet for breaking Drytron boards or the new Lord of the Heavenly Prison whose purpose is to allow you to search out any spell card in your deck."

That being said, I think my deck is pretty good, though it could use more interrup","Honestly, I'm trying to make Fallen of Albaz playable. So far, I think this deck is pretty good, though it can be way better. It does brick if you don't draw the right combo. That being said, I have played through bricks and somehow I have won those matches. Then again, my opponent was bricking at times. I'll post the combos later, but don't hesitate to offer advice or some critique.  Alright, if you go first, you better hope you get ""Aluber, Jester of Despia"" and another ""Despia"" monster (either ""Tragedy"" or ""Dramaturge"" (preferably the latter)). Along with a ""Nadir Servant"" ( though you can still make plays without it).  Normal Summon the ""Aluber"", search for the ""Theather"", or if you already have it in your hand then search for ""Branded Opening"".  Use your ""Theater"" to fusion ""Aluber"" and ""Dramaturge"" and summon ""Masquerade the Blazing Dragon"" then Special Summon ""Dramaturge"" from the grave in Atk position. The ""Masquerade"" will constantly charge your opponent 600LP for every card and effect activated. And you can choose when to use ""Dramaturge"" effect to negate a monster's effect whenever an Extra Deck Monster is Special Summoned. So choose carefully. Not only that, your ""Aluber"" is in the GY, just waiting in the graveyard for your opponent to remove your fusion monster on the field.  Well, the Dogmatika package is pretty simple, send an extra deck monster (""Albion the Branded Dragon"" or ""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"") add your ""Dogmatika Ecclesia"" then you special and add the ""Fleurdelis"" (or the ""Dogmatika Punishment"") and end your turn. During the end phase, ""Albion"" will activate and you go ahead and set a Judgement of the Branded from deck to your back row (or if you sent ""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"", just add the Fleurdelis). It honestly comes in handy. Just a reminder, that ""Dogmatika Punishment"" is a double-edged sword, especially in a Fusion-based deck like this. So try to use ""Dogmatika Punishment"" as a last resort only."

There's also plenty of cards to banish to boost Maju and Eater. The Extra Deck isn't used. I've only included Link monsters that the deck can go into. But the Extra Deck is used for Prosperity and Eater. If anything, Borg Blocker would be the only Extra Deck monster worth making.  Most of the deck is budget. I only use Prosperity because I own them. You can always use more Desires or Extravagance. There's no substitute for the second most expensive card, Bookmark.  This is just a fun deck to play.

I mean, look, they say Zombie right on the card? Well, not quite. I've struggled when building Zombie Eldlich decks in the past. The Eldlich engine is a testy thing that takes tuning to hum, and previous builds have felt schizophrenic. When I sit down to pilot a deck I want to know what deck I am piloting, not some hybrid deck where half the time I'm playing Eldlich and half the time I'm playing Zombies. So the marriage of the two archetypes was not as natural as you might have suspected.  However, Golden Lord is straight up a Zombies card, Zombie World doesn't conflict with Eldlich cards gameplan and is good right now, and by running a small zombies package and a more formidable Eldlich Line I know what the deck is - an Eldlich deck that runs Zombie World and very occasionally Balerdroch.  So, starting from the top, I put in my tech cards first. 3 Zombie World, as a floodgate that disrupts a lot of different archetypes, 1 Necroworld Banshee as copy #4, plus 1 Foolish Burial as copy 5 of Zombie World as well as being a way to send Bloom or even just Golden Lord. Then Solemns and Imperm, because these cards are good, at this point these are pretty obligatory in my Eldlich builds for their power and versatility. For Golden Land trap monsters, 3 Conquistador, and 2 Huaqero is probably the best ratio. You don't need to grind forever, and 5 of these are the right number, since you only need to access 1 Eldlixer in most turns, and since you need to summon Golden Lord for them to be live you don't want to brick on these cards. 1 Golden Land Forever, because it is a searchable Solemn, made better by our normal summon being a Zombie. 3 Red, 1 White. I'm back on the white. You just need to see these, either to send them to the GY, or to search them for more value on the follow-up, so even though White is a lot worse, it really is still quite good, and even better in a deck with the Zombies engine. I think you need to play 3 Eldland 3 Golden Lord. Here's my reasoning: Seeing Eldland is always better than seeing Lord. But if 2 Lords get banished you want your cards to still work that third turn. So even though 5 might be a better ratio for ""Golden Lords"" I think 6 is still the right number, you want to see your lord, you want to see your Eldland, you don't mind seeing them together. That left room in the deck for a small Zombies package. 1 Shiranui Solitaire and 3 Uni-Zombie seemed like the right number of Uni-Zombie to run. You actually don't want to brick on this card as much as you do at 5 copies in this version of the deck, but you do want the consistency boost up to the 4th copy. I only wanted to run the 1 Bloom and the one Balerdroch. These cards all play pretty nicely with the Eldlich Engine, and are mostly here to support that, but also put up Zombie World even more consistently in matchups where Zombie World is good while being useful Eldlich utility cards in their own right. This small Zombies package best mitigates the ""schizophrenia"" problem the deck could have with a more Zombie World focused plan. That left room for 1 card, and I wanted it to be a consistency booster, and if it was a 1 of I wanted it to be more impactful than Upstart. Performapal Popperup carries a potentially high cost in life points, in exchange for letting you discard 3 to draw 3. Holy crap. Even better, since you discard UP TO 3. Yet nobody plays this card. And the reason is pretty simple, it is just Ash bait, and if you get Ashed you've just discarded a card, or potentially a bunch of cards, for no value. But tbh it being Ash bait is pretty good IMO, especially since it sets up my Gy even if it does get Ashed, and if it doesn't it'll turn mediocre hands into explosive ones single handedly. The card is particularly powerful in Eldlich since you want your cards in the GY so much and can set your cards to minimize lifepoint loss. I don't love it as card advantage enough to run 3 of it, I don't even necessarily want to see it that often, but sending for cost alone makes this card pretty worthwhile IMO.  In tuning I've decided to try a second copy of the countertrap. It's just really good in this deck and easily searchable, and you often want to search a second after using the first.  Ice Dragon's Prison is really good in Zombie World decks, by virtue of Zombie World making all monsters on the field and in the GY Zombies, so I switched to that plan. I also decided you really do only need 2 of Cursed Eldland. The card is nuts, but with the consistency boost provided by Zombie cards, you have enough access to Golden Lord that you want to brick out less on the Eldland. That left room to move an Ice Dragon's Prison to the main, the card is a huge blow-out with Zombie World, and we'll usually make Zombie World, and on top of that the card usually won't be dead. This frees up 1 slot in the side, for Red Reboot against other Trap.decks.  In further tuning I'm back on the hand traps in the side, and I remembered Called and Zeus are cards so I threw them in."

And within that deck, the Speedroid cards I had were my go-to cards to help me win in the end. And so, I decided to finally get around to making this deck. There's only two ways I can see this deck going wrong. 1, You don't get any tuners in your starting hand (which shouldn't be very likely), and 2, Having your opponent OTK you. I'm mostly worried about being OTKed, mainly because of the fact that a decent amount of the Speedroid's effects revolve around summoning from the graveyard, but that's only some of them. Anyway, onto the strategy I planned.  <span>STEP ONE</span> - The first thing you need to do is get out a decent Synchro monster so you at least have a little bit of protection. I recommend Chanbara, to help get it's ATK boosted before your opponent can get some high-levels on the field.  <span>STEP TWO</span> - Next, you need to get out Kitedrake, but ONLY ONE!!! You need to keep the other one in the Extra Deck, so you have some board wipe abilities for late game.  <span>STEP THREE</span> - Finally, you need to get out your Clear Wings to help you keep up some high ATK. With this, you should be secured the win.  I took a lot of pride making this deck, and I think it'll work very well. Best of luck on your next duel!"

Somebody stop me! (This is only maybe good, and won't be for long, but it is a good reference for what the package could l","So let me preface this deck by saying this - unless you think Necrovalley is actually very good when you play it, don't play it in Altergeists. This is kind of a test list, just me drumming up another deck that can make use of Necrovalley while it is good. Having said that, I'm not sure it is good enough to run in this meta, and Altergeists isn't a perfect home for it. It certainly won't be good enough post-BODE. Still, I thought the idea was intriguing, so I decided to share my list.  The next thing I want to say is that I am not an expert at Altergeists. I still don't even know their combos, and the deck for some reason has always been hard for me to get a grasp on. I think I'm finally starting to figure out why Altergeists are so powerful however, this deck excels at putting up interaction, for a dumb trap deck the engine is really quite good. Slow the game down to where 1 for 1 trades matter and win on high quality 1 for 1 trades.  I went for a version with no hand traps, aside from Imperm which makes the cut for being a trap card for Multifaker. There are a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, there just wasn't space to fit in a Necrovalley package with 6 hand traps. Secondly, hand traps other than Imperm, obviously, are too low-impact this format to be worth running when instead to can run plans that are still good going second.  So, onto the line-up. Pretty standard for Altergeist cards, 3 Meluseek, 3 Multifaker, 3 Mario, 1 Kunquery, 2 Silq, with 3 Spoofing, 2 Protocol, and 1 Manifestation. The standard line-up is fine in Necrovalley, some effects get shut off but Protocol protects most of your effects. 3 Meluseek, 3 Multifaker, and 3 Spoofing is for easy access to multifaker. 3 Mario 2 Protocol is still correct, since you need your number of Altergeist monsters to be higher and since Protocol is better as a card searched by Mario than drawn on its own. 1 Manifestation, the first effect still works under Protocol which is when you will search for this, and you won't always draw Necrovalley, which will likely hurt the opponent more. Still a 1 of, just here to search.  Then we have exactly 5 copies of Necrovalley, the 3 actual copies plus 1 Terraforming and 1 Metaverse. Metaverse is necessary for increasing the number of traps cards in the deck, and is just better than Commandant here (and maybe elsewhere). It lets you back up a Necrovalley with another instant-speed copy if you see them together. We run exactly 5 of these cards, because while you do want to see a copy you never really want to see multiple copies of this card, and because this way you have the perfect sized package to side in Secret Village of the Spellcasters and Imperial Order (side out Terraforming).  Pot of Extra is here to dig through cards, and from here on out everything is pretty standard. Imperms for the Multifaker interaction, Solemns, and a few tech-choice traps. I really like Torrential Tribute combined with Solemn Strike in this deck as a board breaking tool, so I'm on 3 Torrential Tribute. I'm also on Dogmatika Punishment, because the downside doesn't matter and getting to pop 2 is huge upside.  So, one downside with the deck is you're playing with Necrovalley in 1/3 of your games. The Secret Village plan is too important to run Necrovalley most of the time in games 2 and 3, realistically. So you're looking to cheese game 1s with Necrovalley and then play future games with Secret Village. Is that really worth the space? You have to ask yourself that. But remember 1 game is half of what you need to win a match, so the answer to this could be yes, if Necrovalley will cheese you those game 1s in your meta. The other downside is you are hurting yourself in some ways that are crucial to your own grind game - in a grindy enough format this might not be the answer, and it's one of the reasons that even though Necrovalley stacks up well against the top decks right at this moment, I don't know if it is good enough to run in Altergeists right now. However, this version is overall, quite functional, and has the potential to grind those games out under Necrovalley, so don't be discouraged to try it if you're expecting a lot of Dry and Tri in your meta.  Overall I'm glad I made this deck list. It helped me learn a little about Altergeists, and I feel like I have a better understanding of the deck now than before I built this list."

I already explained Despia deck idea in one of my last decks, so lets move to the Invoked engine explanation, combo and card choice:  Everything that Invoked do only need one card and this engine don't have bricks if used in a fusion deck, so can be used in a amount of decks much bigger then my despia engine ;-; also is one of the easiest archetypes. The most important card is Aleister the Invoker, he only uses your normal summon to get a boss monster with a ""omni"" negate and banish effect.  <strong>Invoked one card combo: </strong>Magical Meltdown hand. Activate Magical Meltdown ~Meltdown add Aleister from your deck ~Normal summon Aleister ~Aleister add Invocation ~link summon Salamangreat Almiraj using Aleister ~link summon Secure Gardna using Almiraj ~activate Invocation to fusion summon Invoked Mechaba. You not need to use Magical Meltdown to start the combo because Magical Meltdown simply searches for Aleister and this is what you really need to get Mechaba.  The deck has 2 Magical Meltdown because adding one more would make the deck have 41 cards and also because Terraforming is like another copy of Magical Meltdown, so virtually you will be using the normal engine. I am just testing Guardian Chimera because it can be summoned with Despia, Theater of the Branded and has effects that can be good in sometimes, but you can trade it if you don't want (or have a way) to use it.  &nbsp;  I will stop uploading Despia decks and back to my Orcust journey, bye.  &nbsp;  GLHF"

Our choice of main deck monsters are <a data-name=""Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy"">Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy</a> which is our XYZ/Synchro enabler, <a data-name=""Mudan the Rikka Fairy"">Mudan the Rikka Fairy</a> who searches <a data-name=""Rikka Sheet"">Rikka Sheet</a> to disrupt our opponents or <a data-name=""Rikka Tranquility"">Rikka Tranquility</a> that lets us stall or setup and Extra Deck play, <a data-name=""Primula the Rikka Fairy"">Primula the Rikka Fairy</a> who is a free body and helps us make our Rank 4 and 6 and lastly <a data-name=""Erica the Rikka Fairy"">Erica the Rikka Fairy</a> who lets us beat over big boss monsters and can revive itself from grave.  Next is the Extra Deck Rikka's, First is <a data-name=""Rikka Queen Strenna"">Rikka Queen Strenna</a> which is how we recycle our Rikka S/T and when tributed can ""rank-up"" into the other 2 if needed, Then we have <a data-name=""Kanzashi the Rikka Queen"">Kanzashi the Rikka Queen</a> that protects our monsters by tributing a plant monster in hand or field if they would be destroyed and can also act as Monster Reborn when a card has been tributed, Lastly is <a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop the Rikka Queen</a> who is our main boss monster and 1 of our main disruption tools, her first effect lets us Tribute our opponents monsters at SS2 and the second effect booster her by 200atk every time a card(s) is tributed.  <strong>Aroma:</strong> This is our second advantage engine which has high synergy with Rikka and gives us access to strong cards like <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a>, <a data-name=""Aromage Marjoram"">Aromage Marjoram</a>, <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a> and <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a>. Sweet Marjoram does it all, SS2 Pop, Targeting protection and searches one of our key cards <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a> which in tandem with her creates an infinite value engine that can either recycle our other engines, let us dodge banishing removal, Trigger sent to GY effs or revive something every turn all while keeping our lifepoints topped up. <a data-name=""Aromage Marjoram"">Aromage Marjoram</a> is our GY Disruption and Battle Phase punisher while <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy"">Aromaseraphy</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Aromaseraphy&quot;&gt;Aromaseraphy&lt;/a&gt; Jasmine""> Jasmine</a> is battle protection that synergises well with petal to tutor any plant we want out of our deck. These two engines together create an extremely potent control shell that is flexible and gives us a ridiculous amount of card advantage.  <strong>Predaplant:</strong> This give us more disruption with predaplanning, strong fusion boss monsters and access to Super Polymerization one of the strongest board breaking cards in the game. This engine really helps solidify our mid game and keep our opponent off of big boss monsters.  <strong>Traps:</strong> Our trap line-up is simple, Disrupt as much as possible. The rest are pure advantage cards that further push our greedy mid-late game.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <p><span><em><strong>Openers</strong></em></span></p> &nbsp;  Our deck isn't that dependent on getting a starter but knowing what your options are is important here's the most common openers for the deck.  <strong>Petal into Mardel:</strong> Summon <a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Rikka Petal</a> and activate its effect to search <a data-name=""Mudan the Rikka Fairy"">Mudan the Rikka Fairy</a>, summon Mudan by tributing Petal and Activate Mudan to search Either <a data-name=""Rikka Sheet"">Rikka Sheet</a> for disruption or <a data-name=""Rikka Tranquility"">Rikka Tranquility</a> for value. This is our standard opener and what we will typically do against most decks.  <strong>1 Card Marjoram Setups:</strong> Normal summon <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a>, sending <a data-name=""Dandylion"">Dandylion</a> and summon 2 Tokens, Link <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> and 1 of the tokens into <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> and activate its effect sending it and the other token to the GY, summon <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a> and activate her effect to search <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a>. This opener is really great against rogue or unrefined strategies since a single disruption is enough to derail these kind of decks but can punished by certain decks.  <strong>Jasmine/Mardel:</strong> Summon <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> in the Centre Column and send <a data-name=""Dandylion"">Dandylion</a> to summon 2 Tokens, Link the 2 Tokens into <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a> and activate its effect tributing <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> to summon <a data-name=""Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light"">Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light</a> and search either Petal to get the Rikka engine started or <a data-name=""Rose girl"">Rose Girl</a> if your engine is already going. This opener is really only ideal into control matchups since it gives us our engine as quickly as possible while also providing solid defense.  <strong>Set 4 Pass:Â </strong>This is probably the 2nd most common opener in this deck but not necessarily a brick, as long as we can continually disrupt the opponent they will eventually have the same ceiling for power that we currently do, which is exactly what we want because we have inevitability in that once we draw our engine cards we can easily start out advantaging our opponent and win from there. <p><em><strong><span>Midgame</span></strong></em></p> &nbsp;  Midgame is tricky because its extremely dependent on what your opponent is doing and what you have access to but generally at this point you should be deciding how many turns you can realistically close the game out in and how you are going to accomplish it. Here are some things to look out for in the midgame.  <strong>Abusing Blessed Winds: </strong><a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a> is one of your key cards in the mid game using each effect to its fullest potential is important.  Keeping your engine's going with the first of effect is crucial to get into a winning position, shuffling back your Rikka cards ensures you have the fuel to keep grinding out your opponent. Dodging removal with the 2nd effect is probably the single most important thing to keep in mind at all times, remember we only have 1 <a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Rikka Petal</a> and no way to recover it, if it's banished we are suddenly cut off from one of our main engines. The 3rd effect is basically just looping both marjoram's if they hit grave, it doesn't come up that often but can be strong when you get the chance.  <strong>Predaplant's:Â </strong>Midgame is where predaplants start becoming more relevant, <a data-name=""Predaplanning"">Predaplanning</a> can keep our opponent off of XYZ's and Synchro's while <a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a> and <a data-name=""Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra"">Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra</a> can act as unconventional removal. P<a data-name=""redaplant Verte Anaconda"">redaplant Verte Anaconda</a> also spikes in the midgame turning any 2 monsters into Super Polymerization which can be game winning on it's own.  <strong>Establishing Bosses:Â </strong>In the midgame we really want to summon our boss monsters like <a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop the Rikka Queen and </a><a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram and keep reviving them with cards like </a><a data-name=""Rikka Tranquility"">Rikka Tranquility, </a><a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds and </a><a data-name=""Super Team Buddy Force Unite!"">Super Team Buddy Force Unite!, this often ends up being your win condition.</a>  <strong>The Advantage Trinity:Â </strong>This is the point in the game where your secondary advantage engines start kicking in, <a data-name=""Card of Safe Return"">Card of Safe Return</a>, <a data-name=""Dark Factory Of More Production"">Dark Factory Of More Production</a> and <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a>, These cards give us immense card draw and let us draw into our powerful trap cards in order to keep disrupting our opponent.  <strong>Making the most of our traps:Â </strong>Traps are our main way of controlling the pace of the game and defending ourselves from big pushes from the opponent, knowing when and how to use your traps is matchup dependent but there are some fundamental's you can apply to any matchup. <ul>  	<li>Always keep your opponent's summon limit in mind when choosing when to use your disruption.</li>  	<li>Is the card worth removing? If the card is easily removed in battle refrain from using your removal too early and save it for a bigger threat.</li>  	<li>Am I on a clock? A clock refers to the amount of turns your opponent can lethal you from, if you feel like your opponent is trying to race you down then you can be more loose with your removal cards.</li>  	<li>How much has my opponent committed to a play? The more value you can get from each of your removal cards the better, shotguning your <a data-name=""Ring of Destruction"">Ring of Destruction</a> too early might leave you with less value than if you had waited.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <p><span><em><strong>Late Game</strong></em></span></p> &nbsp;  <strong>Ending the game:Â </strong>By this point we should have enough board presence to close the game out with our boss monsters, always keep cards like <a data-name=""Super Team Buddy Force Unite!"">Super Team Buddy Force Unite! and</a><a data-name=""Super Team Buddy Force Unite!"">Â </a><a data-name=""Erica the Rikka Fairy"">Erica the Rikka Fairy in mind when trying to close out games.</a>  <strong>Don't get too greedy:Â </strong>Ensure your plays are all trying to close out the game, don't keep playing for value as you may get punished by a top-deck from your opponent.  &nbsp;"

This deck is meant to be as cheap as possible as the cards in it are the ones I have access to at the moment, so this deck isn't complete, there are a lot of better cards and interesting strategies, but I'll tell you some cards that are great to add at the end of the explanation, be patient. 2. This deck is a lot of fun, it's a little hard to understand at first, but reading a little about the basic combos and playing you can get the hang of it as the strategies are pretty simple. 3. I've been playing Yu-Gi-Oh for a while now and since I started I've been learning a lot and I would like to ask that if you have any suggestions for Staples or cards to put in the deck don't hesitate to write a comment below. That said, let's go to the deck: The deck revolves around Tindangle Jhrelth as it will be our seeker and also who will start our combos, the first combo will be activating its effect by discarding a card from the hand and another from the deck to summon it for special. some options depending on your hand. For starters, suppose you have 1 Tindangle Jhrelth in your hand and you also have 1 Terrifying Toddler of Torment, you can use the Tindangle Jhrelth effect by discarding Terrifying Toddler of Torment along with the Tindangle Intruder, from that we can specially summon the Terrifying Toddler of Torment also activating the effect of Tindangle Intruder making its special summon and still bringing Tindangle Jhrelth by its own effect, making you start with 3 monsters on the field besides still having your normal summon if needed. Another combo with Tindangle Jhrelth is with the Tindangle Dholes, in which case you just need another Tindangle in your hand or in your deck (even the Dholes itself can be in the deck), use the Tindangle Jhrelth effect and play in Graveyard 1 Any Tindangle and the Dholes, this will make the Dholes activate its effect in the graveyard by summoning the Tindangle you threw there along with it by special summoning face down, this combo is one you can use at the beginning but you will use several times in duels. Besides these there are several combos with Jhrelth, you will build your own depending on the game progress. Another card I would like to highlight is the Terrifying Toddler of Torment, this card can create a good consistency for the deck because from it we create several moves during the duel, especially if used together with Jhrelth, Tindangle Intruder, Armageddon Knight and Subterror Succession, who next to him can turn an empty field into a sea of ââflip monsters. Now I'll talk about the last card I'd like to pay attention to here, as it is one if not the most important card for the deck, after Jhrelth of course, the Tindangle Delaunay card, from it you can create the Tindangle Acute Cerberus, a Extremely powerful card that combined with other cards and effects of cards Tindangle can be your greatest triumph against your enemies, especially if it's for an OTK, in addition Delaunay is a great card for defense with its effect of summoning 3 Tindangle monsters from the graveyard to the field, but with a small detail, this card does not have a limitation on how many times it can be activated in the graveyard, making it possible to bring up to 9 Tindangle cards face down in one turn, creating several problems for opponents and great opportunities for you. Finally I wanted to mention some great cards that the Deck can take advantage of a lot that I didn't add because as I said, I don't have in real life, Subterror Behemoth Fiendess is a great card that has a generic effect and very interesting for flip monsters, great card for be added to the extra deck, some hand traps would be awesome for the deck too, which one is up to you, but Ash is a great choice for any deck, finally some 3,4,5 and 6 level XYZ focused on negations and also in raw power, the entire Utopia family could be a great addition. Well, I hope you liked it and if you did I would like you to comment and say if you liked the build, maybe when I get new cards I'll make a new build with the most complete deck so I'll see you guys another day."

Wanted to use Wynn or Ghost Mourner you pulled from Me","The wind attribute in Yu-Gi-Oh used to be the one of the most under supported attributes. Recently all this changed, as support for the ailing attribute exploded into the scene with Windwitch, Dragunity, Armed Dragon, Gusto and Speedroids releasing in almost every set the past year. I affectionally call this mishmash of cards âWind Soupâ for the several wind engines it uses. This deck functions as monster spam synchro deck which turbos out notable wind boss monsters like Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon and Armed Dragon Thunder LV10. Wind Soup also can field the incredible strong and recently released Baronne De Fleur and Hi-Speedroid Clear Wing Rider. With this deck, you will generate gale force winds that will surely storm down your opponent!  Wind Soup features a whopping 5 different archetypes that work together fluidly to generate enough boss monsters to overwhelm your opponent. Despite their differences, Armed Dragon, Windwitch, Dragunity and Gusto function with synergy and grace, so that dueling your opponents will be a breeze!  The <span><strong>Armed Dragon Engine</strong></span> is comprised of 13 cards. <em>3x of Armed Dragon Thunder LV3, LV5, LV7,</em> and one of <em>LV10</em>. <em>3x Armed Dragon Flash</em> (basically this archetypeâs Emergency Teleport) is also included for maximum consistency. No other Armed Dragon cards are used since room in this deck is tight, and is sacrificed for the other archetypes.  The main goal of this engine is to turbo out itâs archetypal badass powerhouse, Armed Dragon Thunder LV10. This big guy represents a quick effect destruction during your opponentâs turn (+ itâs cool because of the nostalgia factor. CHAZZ IT UP, MANJOUME THUNDAAA!!!)  This engine is fairly uncomplicated. Each Armed Dragon Thunder requires a monster as cost to âlevel upâ to itâs next form, finally ending on the boss monster itself. The ideal discard for Armed Dragon Thunders are other Armed Dragons, which all give rewards being discarded for a Dragonâs effect (LV3 = Draw 1 card, LV5 = search any level 5 or higher wind dragon, LV7 = search any Armed Dragon card). Dragunity Arma Gram and Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms also love being discarded, since they can resurrect themselves from the GY.  This engine can also search out any level 5 or higher wind dragons as well, so if youâre missing Tempest, Dragon Ruler or Storms or any Dragunity Arma Gram, you can search it out through Armed Dragon LV5.  The <span><strong>Windwitch Engine</strong></span> is comprised of 5 cards: <em>3x Ice Bell, 2x Glass Bell, and 1x</em> <em>Snow Bell</em>. The main reason for this engine is to give you a powerful wind synchro. Being one of the ways to get Crystal Wing in this deck, it is immune to destruction through the use of Ice Bell. The engine brings out a monster negate, + to send Wind Pegasus to the GY, giving you a powerful ""target and shuffle"" back into the deck removal once a card of yours is destroyed. Best of all, this is accomplished <em>without using your normal summon </em>saving it up for something like Armed Dragon LV3 or Pilica, Descendant of the Gusto<em>.</em> The use of Windwitch cards lock you into wind, and monsters from the Extra Deck other than level 5 or higher wind monsters, but that should be fine in Wind Soup, since thatâs all the monster you summon anyway!  The Windwitch Crystal Wing turbo combo is as follows: <ol>  	<li>The main starter here is Ice Bell, allowing itself to special summon from the hand if there are no monster cards on the field.</li>  	<li>Ice Bell summons Glass Bell from deck, triggering both of their field effects at once (Glass Bell searches Snow Bell from deck and Ice Bell burns for 500. hint: Chainblock with Glass Bell as chain link 1 and Ice Bell as chain link 2 so they cannot handtrap/negate your Snow Bell search).</li>  	<li>Summon Snowbell from the hand since you now fulfill it's special summoning requirement of controlling 2 wind monsters.</li>  	<li>The level 7 synchro you summon using Icebell + Snowbell depends on your choice. Usually you summon Wind Pegasus to destroy an opponent's backrow with it's effect, and allow for a potential ""shuffle an opponent's card back into the deck"" effect when a card of yours is destroyed. You can also summon Winter Bell if you want to give Diamond Bell its ""twice"" per turn destruction effect.</li>  	<li>Finally, you summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon into the Extra Monster Zone (to allow more space for generaider tokens) using your level 7 synchro + Snow Bell. Using Snow Bell, your synchro monster is now immune to destruction effects, which makes it very annoying to out. You can also summon Diamond Bell for it's board breaking capability (it can destroy up to two cards on the field with it's effect.)</li> </ol> The <span><strong>Dragunity Engine</strong></span> offers another combo line dedicated to turboing out Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon. Like the Windwitch combo, this is accomplished without using your normal summon! With only 1 and a half cards, (Dragunity Remus and a discard), you will have a 3000 ATK boss monster on the field with a once per turn monster negate! The engine is comprised of only 7 cards in the maindeck: <em>3x Dragunity Remus, x1 Dragunity Legatus, x1 Mist Valley Baby Roc, and x2 Dragon Ravine and x1 Dragunity Knight â Gae Dearg </em>in the Extra Deck. Keep in mind that this combo locks you into Dragon special summons for the rest of the turn. If you wanna summon something else, leave this combo for last!  The Dragunity Crystal Wing turbo combo is as follows: <ol>  	<li>The main starter here is Dragunity Remus. Discard Dragunity Remus to search out Dragon Ravine.</li>  	<li>With Dragon Ravine, discard any card to search from deck Dragunity Legatus (choose your discard wisely).</li>  	<li>SS Dragunity Legatus from hand since you control a Dragon Ravine.</li>  	<li>SS Dragunity Remus from the GY (this locks you into Dragon special summons for the rest of the turn.)</li>  	<li>Synchro Legatus + Remus together for Dragunity Knight â Gae Dearg.</li>  	<li>Use Gae Deargâs effect to search Mist Valley Baby Roc and discard Baby Roc.</li>  	<li>Baby Roc summons itself from GY once sent from hand to GY.</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon using Dragunity Knight â Gae Dearg + Mist Valley Baby Roc.</li> </ol> The <span><strong>Gusto Engine</strong> </span>is the smallest engine of this deck, composed of only 4 cards: <em>x2 Pilica, Descendant of the Gusto, </em>and<em> x2 Emergency Teleport</em>. I included this in Wind Soup because Emergency Teleport was recently semi-limited! Pilica is psychic, so she is an incredible target for this card.  Pilica, Descendant of the Gusto functions as a very adaptable extender. Upon summon, Pilica resurrects any wind tuner from the GY, so she can theoretically be any level 4-7 synchro in this deck! <em>Old Entity Hastorr, Hi-Speedroid Chanbara, Daigusto Sphreez</em>, etc. can be made depending on the set-up in the GY.  For example with the Windwitch combo, you have two wind tuners in the GY, a level 1 (Snowbell) and level 4 (Glass Bell). You can make Clear Wing Fast Dragon for an additional negate, or Â summon Old Entity Hastorr for itâs âchange of heartâ effect.  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/52oUKoB""><strong>Here is an example:</strong></a>  The Gusto Engine, made more consistent with Emergency Teleportâs semi-limit adds an extra layer of extension, synergy and power to your already beefy wind boards!  This deck also features <span><strong>generic wind support</strong>,</span> which tie the deck together adding more consistency.  <em>Wynn the Wind Channeler (x3)</em> is arguably one of the best cards in the deck, since she searches virtually any other wind attribute card in the deck! Missing a combo piece like Armed Dragon LV3, Ice Bell or Dragunity Remus? If Wynn is in your hand, they are only a discard of itself + a wind monster away! (Please Komoney, release the other Channeler Charmer attributes already). If you pulled shiny Wynns with your recent 2021 Megatins, this would be the perfect deck to use her in.  <em>Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms (x1)</em> is also an extremely versatile card, allowing the player to search any dragon with the discard of itself + a wind monster. While itâs searching power is not as potent as Wynnâs, it can search out Dragunity Remus and Armed Dragon LV3. Tempest can summon itself relatively freely from the GY, so it can function as a +2400 beatstick. Itâs ability to return itself to the hand is the cherry on top, since you can potentially re-use itâs searching ability multiple times in a duel!  <em>Ghost Mourner and Moonlit Chill (x3)</em> functions like a more specific Effect Veiler that does burn. Interrupt your opponent during a vulnerable part of their combo and punish them with burn damage! Itâs also a wind monster and tuner, granting it synergy with cards like Pilica (can resurrect her from GY for synchro plays) and Wynn/Tempest (wind monster for discard.) Versus specific opponents, you may wanna swap this card for the stronger wind hand trap, Droll &amp; Lockbird.  <em>Pot of Avarice (x3)</em> isnât a wind support card, but it functions as very easy draw power in this deck. Every combo saturates your graveyard with 5+ cards, so itâs very easy to meet the conditions of card.  <span><strong>General Tips - </strong></span>I play tested this a lot in Yugioh OMEGA versus real opponents and bots. Here are the things I've learned about it. <ul>  	<li>While the current decklist is semi-casual, you can actually be fairly competitive with Wind Soup. Take out all the Armed Dragon cards and include the Speedroid Engine featured in the side deck. Limit your opponentâs plays with devastating continuous traps like Imperial Order, Anti-Spell, and Gozen Match. Pot of Prosperity is nice too (replace pot of avarice). Going first, you will have triple Crystal Wing supported by crippling backrow.</li>  	<li>You can play this deck going first or second. The cards that you can cut are the Gusto Engine, 3 Ghost Mourner and 1 Windwitch Glass Bell giving you 8 maindeck slots to work with.</li>  	<li>When using GY reliant cards like Pilica, Descendant of the Gusto, Pot of Avarice, Dragunity Arma Gram and Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms, take note of which cards you are banishing/summon/returning to deck! You donât want to take certain cards out of your GY before you can use them, like Wind Pegasus @Ignister.</li>  	<li>Careful of being locked into certain cards! Being locked into wind isnât a concern in this deck. However, cards like Dragunity Remus lock you into Dragons for the rest of the turn. Windwitch Ice Bell lock you into only level 5 of higher wind monsters from the extra deck. Ideally if you have both Windwitch and Dragunity cards in hand, itâs best to summon Windwitch cards first before you are locked into Dragons. Keep this in mind when comboing!</li>  	<li>Here are your average boards <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/7ep7Ex7""><strong>going first</strong></a> and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/fPJVuQ5""><strong>going second</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li> </ul> <strong>Concluding Commentary</strong>  The first ever structure deck I ever got was Structure Deck: Dragons Roar. There cards I particularly liked from the structure deck were the Armed Dragon cards, so they have had a special place in my heart. I can finally live our my childhood dream of using Armed Dragon in a semi-competent deck! Obligatory: â<strong><em>CHAZZ IT UP! MANJOUME THUNDAAA!!!</em></strong>â  With the ridiculous amount of wind support that has come out recently, both generic and archetypal, I made it my mission to make a SUPER WIND DECK, culminating with the deck âWind Soup.â The only thing I regret about Wind Soup is failing to incorporate into this deck the âWind Barrier Lock,â where you summon Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds, tutored from deck by Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty. If anybody figures out, let me know in the comments!  Be the tempest, generate hurricane force storm winds and blow your opponents away! With Wind Soup, dueling will be a BREEZE!  If youâve read the entire thing, I congratulate you. It mustâve been hard to make it through all the wind puns. Â I apologize. <em><span>not</span></em>  GLHF Duelists!"

By excavating five cards it is almost guaranteed to excavate one of the 25 rock monsters in the deck, which each allow further field presence or protection from hand-traps, such as ""Koa'ki Meiru Guardian"". The Adamancipator synchro monsters are incredibly powerful, such as ""Adamancipator Risen - Raptite"", which acts as all of the main deck Adamancipator tuners, and ""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"", which is both capable of returning opponent's threats to the hand and negating key cards.  Koa'ki Meiru: These cards allow you to prevent your opponent's hand traps such as ""Nibiru, the Primal Being"" which would normally end your turn. ""Koa'ki Meiru Supplier"" acts as a free body and searches other Koa'ki Meiru monsters which can later be summoned or used for discard.  Naturia: These three extra deck monsters each prevent your opponent from using a key game mechanic, and due to the ability of ""The Earth - Hex-Sealed Fusion"" allows you to summon ""Naturia Exterio"" from your extra deck by only controlling one of the synchro monsters. This card essentially wins the game if paired with a card such as ""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"".  Prank-Kids: These cards allow for a one-card double ""Raigeki"" that also has 3000 ATK and DEF. The abilities of the Prank-Kids monsters allow for free rock monsters if your opponent disrupts the combo, and ""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"" can be used to equip onto ""Borreload Savage Dragon"". The combo is: normal summon any Prank-Kids monster. Link this monster to make a ""Prank-Kids Meow-Meow-Mu"" and use the ability of the Prank-Kids monster to summon ""Prank-Kids Fansies"" (if not the one that was first summoned). Use these two monsters to summon ""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"" and use it and ""Prank-Kids Fansies""' abilities to both add ""Prank-Kids Pandemonium"" from your deck to your hand and to send and summon a Prank Kids monster so that you have all four different names (one on field, three in GY).

If that fails and you either have frost or treat, special summon them. Next, you want to link 2 to Verte, Pay the 2K to bring out big boi Dragoon.  <strong>Way Number 2: (Medium)</strong>  Open Hand, if you got a Live Twin, same as Way Number 1, except to the link. Depending on your position, you'll either want to pop a card or draw a card. If you want to POP a card, link summon Evil Twin Lil-la FIRST, then use their effect to special summon a Live Twin Ki-sikil from grave. Next, you'll want to link summon Evil Twin Ki-sikil using Evil Twin Lil-la and Live Twin Ki-sikil, then using Evil Twin Ki-sikil bring back your other Evil Twin monster. Once that happens, Ki-sikil (Evil Twin) will use its effect to pop one card off the field! Do the opposite form of link summoning if you want to draw a card. Next you'll want to link summon into Trouble's Sunny (Once it releases into the TCG). Her effect is really good against decks that try to OTK you from my experience. I'd advise against using her quick effect UNLESS it's a monster with higher ATK. Her GY effect is also really good, which can pop a monster off your opponent's side of the field if you throw an Evil Twin monster from deck to GY.  <strong>Way Number 3 (Hard[Not really]):</strong>  Open Hand, if you have Serziel, normal him to bring either Basilius or Evil Eye Reemergence to your hand, (You'll want to make sure you have those in your hand). If you already have them in your hand, get Selene instead. Next, special summon Basilius and activate Evil Eye Reemergence. Next, you'll want to link 3 into Zerrziel and attach Selene to it, and BOOM! Game for you! Alternatively, you can just use Selene on Serziel instead.  <strong>If you found other ways to play this deck, please let me know!!! Thank you!</strong>"

Also wanting to Cyber Dragons and Dark Magicians playstyles are simila,"First off, I would like to owe thanks to Konami. Secondly, this deck is very strategic its very own format. Have you players noticed something similar??? No??? If so, good, then if not, I'll explain why this deck is like this. This deck is an turbo for Extra Deck access. If you notice, this format's playstyle is similar to Cyber Dragons but why??? Because Konami claimed Dark Magician and Cyber Dragons are suppose to play in a similar fashion to each other, which makes more sense if you look at both Cyber Dragon cards and DM cards you can see where Konami is correct about their playstyles being the same. For examples, Magicians Rod = Cyber Dragon Core. DM = Cyber Dragon. Nachster = Souls. Galaxy Soldier = Apprentice. Illusion of Chaos = Herz. Chronicle Magician = Vier. BBTaS = Machine Duplication. Timaeus = Overload. Secrets of DM = Power Bond. And etc... That being said, this deck is great. Currently undefeated at 10-0."

Psy-Frame archtype negate stuff while you don't control monsters(or control Psy-Framelord Lambda), so monsters like Exblower have a good synergy here.  I don't think i need to explain anymore Psy-Frame cards so lets jump to <strong>Springans Combo:Â </strong>Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda + Springans Watch, active Sand Sea ~Active Watch ~Watch searches for a Springans monster and Springans Captain Sargas, 1 to your hand and 1 to the GY ~Attach Sargas to Exblower ~Exblower now has 3100 atk ~ attach other Springans if you need to destroy something in the field.

I knew the game had changed so much since I last played in roughly 2003 and after extensively reading about the existing BEWD support--including copious warnings and admonitions from seasoned players that such a deck was inconsistent, often bricked and generally could not compete. I believed them for the most part, but I also wasn't sure how much I would like YuGiOh as a game itself. If I was going to start playing again and learn the game, I wasn't going to invest in some more or less unknown archetypal deck recognized as being competitive. Frankly I had no concept of what 'competitive' meant in present-day YuGiOh six months or so ago. I wanted something familiar, interesting and extensive enough to really sink my teeth into learning. That was Blue-Eyes White Dragon.  As it turns out, it couldn't have happened any other way. Because of fairly regular support releases for the archetype, building Blue-Eyes nearly hits all the major summoning mechanics of YuGiOh--and if it doesn't hit them, it's at least adjacent to them. Looking at both the Fusion and Ritual Blue-Eyes deck builds, I decided I preferred fusion and set to work building as strong a deck as I could. I studied card text and combo plays, building and testing new versions of my deck to casually duel at my neighborhood card store on Saturdays. Another player, now a good friend of mine, offered to teach me the game and patiently walked me through the present-day game mechanics and trouble-shot my deck with me. Whether I won or lost--and at the start, I almost always lost--I found that thoughtfully summating the games and matches didn't just help me improve my deck build; before long, I started to grasp the basic theory at work in YuGiOh. <h2><strong>Blue-Eyes Dragon Link: When the most-competitive-build-possible still can't compete</strong></h2> As the theory came into focus, I began to understandÂ <em>whyÂ </em>my BEWD deck couldn't compete against certain archetypes--that being an article for another time. Now I had the foundation to look at the top meta-performing decks and think about them critically by way of comparison to my own. Naturally the closest analog to what I had started playing was Dragon Link, which unbeknownst to me at the time had just taken a serious body blow on the forbidden and limited list: Guardragon Elpy, a ridiculous card I never got to play with but badly wish I had, was banned and Striker Dragon was limited to x1. Some of the more competitive Blue-Eyes players had already tread the path of creatively applying the BEWD engine to Dragon Link, and even with the deck taking a hit, it still seemed capable of building the kind of boards that Dragon Link is known for building.  It meant moving away from the Blue-Eyes extra deck monsters--first scaling down the fusions to two or three like Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon; then down to just Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon, which can be contact summoned, and excising the fusion engine completely; then swapping the Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon / Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon synchro package for the off-brand but far more powerful Chaos Ruler / Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss. That last change forced the most extensive reworking of my deck yet, forcing me to introduce several level-7 dragons in order to build into Hot Red Abyss and make use of his incredible omni-negate. There's absolutely nothing in BEWD that accomplishes this on its own so before long, I was running a small Rokket engine. It quickly became a bigger Rokket engine when I understood through practice just how much more power and consistency cards like Quick Launch and Rokket Tracer give Dragon Link as a deck.  When local tournaments resumed in my area, I started competing on Saturdays. Generally I would win 2 matches and lose 2 matches--never getting blown out turn-1 in the 2 losses but certainly unable to play through the statistically certain occurrence of bricking the opening hand. The last straw came in game-1 of a recent tournament, in which my opening hand consisted of Blue-Eyes White Dragon x3 and Sage with Eyes of Blue x2. I could normal summon Sage and add a tuner to my hand, but with no BEWDs left in the deck, I couldn't even pop Sage with Sage to bring out a Blue-Eyes monster from my deck. It was such an uncannily bad hand that it led me into the world of hypergeometric probability. As it turns out, the chances of drawing all three unredeemable bricks in the opening handÂ <strong><em>is</em></strong><em>Â </em>about 1 in 1000, meaning this was a very particular freak-circumstance unlikely to repeat soon. More disturbing, however, was learning that a 40-card deck running 3x copies of Blue-Eyes White Dragon--a level-8 normal monster with nothing to its name but 3000 ATK / 2500 DEF--will draw into at least one of those blue bricks in about 33% of opening 5-card hands.  <em><strong>At present in the TCG, Blue-Eyes Dragon Link is without a doubtÂ </strong><strong>the most competitive build for the archetype.Â </strong></em>It actually integrates the 3 vanilla BEWDs into the Dragon Link resource system to generate card advantage and eventually make major rank-8 plays for the end-board--and when it works, it works about as well as the Rokket engine does. But no amount of creative integration can change the simple fact that the deck still runs 3 copies of a normal monster that, ordinarily, cannot be normal summoned. <h2><strong>Brick Theory and Resource Systems in YuGiOh</strong></h2> YuGiOh's resource system is the deck itself and the amount of cards the player has access to using at any given time. Hand-traps and even single disruptions are so powerful because even slight deficits in card advantage can quickly become game losses if the affected player cannot continue to extend their position. Bricking is a different problem with the same outcome. The disruption comes from the deck itself when the opening hand fails to provide enough starters to establish your position on the board. But within the category of 'bricking', there are two different types of bricks.  A player bricks if their opening hand consists of superior extenders without the necessary starters. This forces either suboptimal plays or ends the player's turn entirely. If they can survive into the next draw phase, however, they may draw into a starter that would suddenly make those dead extenders in-hand become live. This is a <em><strong>relative brickÂ </strong></em>since the cards bricking the hand in one moment can easily become live with the addition of a starter. Just about every deck can brick in this way, even the most competitive decks in the meta-game--though it should be said that the most competitive decks are built to lower the probability of this bricked-out game state.  Drawing into cards like Blue-Eyes White Dragon is different, even if the principle at work is similar. By itself, BEWD is absolutely not, nor has it ever been, a starter since it cannot be normal summoned without tributing and does not have any effect in-hand, on-board or in-graveyard. In early YuGiOh, the card's high attack strength could compensate for its lack of effect and difficult summon condition, making it an additional (secondary/tertiary) extender into a player's win condition. But outside of the most casual of settings in the year of our Lord 2021, Blue-Eyes White Dragon cannot even be classed as an additional extender. Starters and extenders, both superior and additional, canÂ <em>make useÂ </em>of the monster, like Melody of Awakening Dragon (starter) or Blue-Eyes Alternative Dragon (extender) but the card itself doesn't advance the player's game position. It is a dead-in-the-hand <em><strong>absolute brick</strong></em>--and unfortunately decks built around Blue-Eyes pretty much have to run x3 copies.  Compare it to the two Dragon Link field spells:Â Dragon Ravine or Boot Sector Launch. These are cards a player never wants to see in the opening hand (or God forbid, both) because they are easily and incidentally searched in the process of any basic Dragon Link combo board unfolding. They are relative bricks in that they represent an added restriction on the player's resources, namely the opportunity cost of drawing a card you would have eventually added to hand instead of a starter or extender. Both can be played from the hand anyway, however, and potentially act as starters or extenders depending on the rest of the cards in-hand.  Blue-Eyes White Dragon, a card that has a ~33% chance of showing up in the opening hand of someone playing a 40-card deck, is not a relative brick, even though it too can be easily and incidentally searched and added to hand. At present, it is an absolute brick that can neither start nor extend plays on its own.  I look forward to the forthcoming Blue-Eyes support in the Battle of Chaos set scheduled for release in the USA in February 2022. Who knows how much the new fusion cards will help the archetype and open new possibilities for playing the deck? Practice is the only criterion of truth so time will tell. It's no exaggeration to say the deck archetype itself allowed me to learn and enjoy modern YuGiOh. Dialectically, however, that's exactly why I've discarded the build for competitive play. <h2><strong>Finally, on the deck itself:</strong></h2> Dragon Link is a powerful deck format that can accommodate several different types of engines, but social practice has demonstrated that the Rokket engine is second-to-none in generating consistency and power for the deck. Read enough deck profiles and you'll realize that Dragon Link decks are not the most creative builds you'll come across, this one included. In fact, the only twist worth noting is the Number 97: Draglubion Xyz Dragon package in the Extra Deck, which I've held over from previous decks as an OTK win condition in lieu of the ludicrously expensive Accesscode Talker. Naturally this requires more access to making rank-8 plays than the Rokket engine generally delivers so I run Galactic Spiral Dragon at x2, which easily summons itself from the hand or graveyard and can make all monsters you control level-8 for one turn, and--less out of the ordinary--Chaos Dragon Levianeer at x2. In general, I want to make Number 38: Hope Harbinger by itself first, rather than through Number 97: Draglubion. While Draglubion can bring out Hope Harbinger too, neither Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon nor Number 100: Numeron Dragon can be optimally summoned by other means in this deck, effectively rendering them dead in the Extra Deck.  In most cases, I'll only make one or the other: Number 92 or 100. The general principle is that you never want to make Number 100 going first since it has no ATK without detaching its one and only material and cannot attack on the first turn anyway. Only very rarely will I make Draglubion at all going first--better to save your options for extending or rebuilding towards an OTK on turn-2--but if it's game 2 of a match and I know I'm going to face a restrictive board on my opponent's turn, the only acceptable Draglubion summoning target is Number 92. For the most part, though, these are plays to make if I lose the coin toss and get forced into going second or to power through a turn-2 or 3 OTK.  The side deck here is a generic toolbox consisting of a suite of hand-traps and tech-removal spells and traps."

Use ""Ojamatch"" to get to your ""Armed Dragon Thunder"" monsters whilst also triggering ""Ojamagic"". The Invoked engine can help assist in your strategies as ""Invoked Mechaba"" is a LIGHT Machine and has a few synergies with your ""Ojama"" cards. ""Ojama Red"" can summon the ""Ojama"" Brothers after they have been searched by ""Ojamagic"" and provide access to a Rank-4 Link. ""Ojama Pajama"" offers very strong protection for all of the deck's boss monsters and can search out key cards, including ""Ojamagic"", which can be then dumped and triggered. ""Ojama Blue"" can be used in combination with ""Ojamatch"" to lead to massive card advantage if the opponent has a monster with &lt;2100 ATK and they have no disruptions. The ""ABC"" monsters can be used as Link material to trigger their effects and afterwards you can banish them from the GY for ""ABC-Dragon Buster""."

Itâs a hyperactive combo deck designed to dump as many xyz monsters on the field as possible, mostly rank 8 dragons and numbers. Itâs really solid at otks and does itâs job very well, they got new support and recently I decided to make a complete guide to the archetype, my card reasonings and stuff of the like.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Before that Iâll explain what cipher is. Cipher is a archetype built out of light monsters, at least intended to be that way, there are two additional monsters who ended up with cipher in their names, I play one of the said monsters in this deck for extra names. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">My run down with this archetype and optimal ratios from my understanding.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Biplane</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Biplane is a new monster debuting in the anime collection, it was used once and never again in the anime, it retained its anime effect though and has another effect to boot. Biplane can summon itself from your hand if you own a cipher monster. It can also relevel two cipher monsters to be level 8, itâs thirty effects is that it snags a cipher card from your deck to your hand if destroyed, this effect will pretty much never be used unless your opponent crystal wings or something.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Biplane is played at a triplane ratio due to the lack of better extender options cipher has and the fact that you need level 8 monsters</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Twin Raptor</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Twin Raptor is one of the best cards the archetype has to offer, combined with Biplane this card is a solo x dragon, Twin Raptor can summon itself if you donât own anything and then summon a cipher from your deck once per turn, the second effect locks you out of anything but ciphers for the rest of the turn but you can summon whatever you like before that, and in the end a free boss is a free boss.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 3 Twin Raptor in any cipher build. Doesnât matter one bit on anything else just play 3, even if more support comes out Twin Raptor should stay eternal.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Wing:</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Wing is a simple card, it summons itself from your hand if you have a cipher and it also can tribute itself to add on 4 levels to all of your ciphers, itâs an extender and thatâs kinda it</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 2-3 wing, wing would normally be played at a lower ratio but I wonât lie, ciphers doesnât have much to work with so we have to use what we have</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Mirror Knight</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mirror Knight is the only in archetype grind tool Ciphers have. It has a revival effect for if a cipher gets bombed by battle and<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">Â  </span>a search effect at the end of the turn it was sent to the graveyard, at a glance this card sucks, and it kinda does, but itâs effect has something the other ciphers lack which is providing a follow up play next turn.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 3 knight, not because of itâs battle revival effect but because a follow up play is something ciphers lack so you need to have what you can have for a follow up.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Entranger</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card is very different compared to nearly any other cipher, first off, it was obviously made with no intention of being used for actual xyz monsters. But free xyz materials that reincarnate and a search on use is amazing.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 2, entranger will keep on recurring and is searchable enough that 3 is definitely not too necessary.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Storm Cipher</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Storm Cipher was obviously not intended to be a cipher but it works, itâs a bad beatstick for the extra monster zones and itâs a cyberse, itâs searchable via mining providing six extra names though.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You can play 0 or 3 in pure builds if you choose to do so, but play 0 in variants, ciphers donât have a lot of names to work with so storm cipher can be kinda a 3 of in pure, only because itâs actually level 4 though, in other builds you donât play the card at all.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Soldier</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is unintentionally the oldest cipher card, and it shows. It sucks these days and there isnât much to say about it.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">PLAY ZERO, I know we are tight on space but this card is an absolute useless waste of cardboard and shouldnât be played in any deck: period</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The star of the show, this monster is super important for ciphers for providing a name to rank up with</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 3, you need it to rank up and even cheese your opponents with its own effect along the way!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A neat monster with spot removal and reincarnates your galaxy eyes that you get for absolutely free</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play one, youâll never need it more than once a duel and can easily go duels without it but itâs a nice option to have regardless.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Neo Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card is hilarious, only for one reason though, vampire xyz monsters. The idea here is to take your opponents field, overlay them all for vampire, attack with Galaxy Eyes, main phase 2 overlay vampire and you got yourself a Zeus, if you stole 3 monsters for this then you got 4 materials to boot!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 1, it takes the rank up spell and is a one shot deal thatâll likely rope you the win when it goes off, I love the card but space is tight and this card only needs to resolve once in a whole duel.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">X Dragon is a neat monster that allows a recycle of a dragon xyz, and you can summon it for basically nothing.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play one or two, games donât last long enough for you to use any more than that</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Interference</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Interference was used a lot in the anime, it doubles the atk of a cipher who shares a name with your other ciphers. Itâs not able to be negated thanks to it triggering in the damage step, itâs cheesy but it sometimes does rope in a random win.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 0 or 1, ciphers donât need much of a win con because of how big of monsters they can already make but if you like gimmicks it could be used at one. I opted 0</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Double exposure</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It doesnât have the cipher namesake but it a solid card as far as ciphers go, you canât search it but it makes you get level 8 monsters so I play it regardless.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play two, due to a lack of cards that let level 8 monsters hit the field I play that at two for that purpose, Iâd play one if it was searchable but itâs not.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rank-Up-Magic Cipher Ascension</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The rank up card for ciphers, there isnât much to say about it than that.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 3, this is the card that lets you put Neo Cipher out, I cannot stress playing 3 enough, neo cipher is a ridiculous card that you want in your toolbox</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Bit</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card is straightforward enough, it gives you an xyz control and a destruction protection effect, itâs not a opt either so thereâs that too. Sadly most removal these days are not by destruction</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 0, this card just doesnât have the merit to catch up with the rest of the game and is not worth the space in any cipher deck, itâs just an unnecessary brick.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Spectrum</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher spectrum revives a monster and brings out another cipher to boot, but only if your opponent destroyed the first monster.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play none of this card as well, thereâs nothing this card does thatâs of any use in a cipher deck.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Double Cipher</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Sure it has a stupid duplication effect, but if your opponent has the biggest monster on the field than whatâs another cipher monster with the same attack as another one of your monsters going to do against that? Also ciphers and numbers are big, you are probably going to have the biggest thing out at all times anyways.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 0, thereâs nothing that justifies playing this conditional card thatâll never get used and has an effect that isnât even that rewarding, if it were a spell then maybe weâd be talking something else like drago future in the side if your opponent will likely summon something that is big enough to trigger it, but itâs just a trap so drop the concept.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That wraps up every cipher card! Now for engines and techs you would like to run</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The most important one is this small Zexal engine: </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 utopic astral hope</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 zexal field</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 double or nothing</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 utopia double</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 utopia dragnir</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This engine is actually the best engine to run in ciphers at the moment, it gives you a monster who has the ability to jump start a boss and an amazing field spell that gives you a free materials, in fact at the moment this is the engine that is basically necessary.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This engine is highly recommend, it allows you to play tons of other different numbers and Iâll just say it, PLAY THIS ENGINE, you canât go that far without it.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Extension on small zexal engine: tiny photon engine.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2-3 photon thrasher</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 reinforcement of the army</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 number 90</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Number 90 can attach thrasher from your deck so the fact that it doesnât have any materials when dragnir summons it wonât matter. At the point where you are playing both the zexal engine and the photon engine you have enough Warriors to run rota as well. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The win con engine:</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 number 97</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 number 37</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 number 100</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">0-1 number 92</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Who likes big numbers? I do, and hereâs how to make them, as you know ciphers pump out big xyz monsters, this engine profits the most from it, I do highly recommend this engine because of how funny it can be watching numeron dragon getting as big as it does</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The vampire xyz</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Sheridan and the undead vampire can overlay over monsters you take from your opponents, itâs a funny tactic.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Thatâs what I got in this deck, there are many more techs I missed but this build has a few to work with, this build is likely not the best possible cipher build but it should give you a basic idea of how to play them, I canât exactly say that there are any specific combo lines though, just mess around with it and try it for yourself!</span></p>"
