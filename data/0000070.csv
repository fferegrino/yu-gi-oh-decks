With the ","Okay. What. The. Hell?! After months of ridiculing Time Thief players for thinking this deck could one day be good - Konami release Time Thief Perpetua; a card <em>so</em> good and <em>so</em> irritating to play against, that I might actually consider playing this deck. When I day-dreamed about what Rank 4 Toolbox what become relevant in 20202, I would've never guessed that Redoer, pass.dek would be a top competitor. So, with embarrassment and overwhelming excitement - I bring to you, Lunalight Time Thief..

A good starting point would most likely be: the engines. I'd like to think of this concoction of cards as a Tesla Cybertruck: It has an unnecessary amount of mechanics, and on announcement was ridiculed by everyone. However, like its metaphorical counterpart, people have warmed up to it and it turned out to be pretty cool in concept and fun....to the person playing it. In my opinion, the Lunalight engine is way to underrated to not be used in this build. Opening Tiger is like being a kid in a candy shop - minus the candy, the shop, or the fact that you're a grown man playing a children's card game. You basically run 9 copies of it - so not opening him is just simply bad luck. For the Danger! engine, you want to max out on the level 4's - as this is a R4nk toolbox deck after all.  Mothman comes up the most, so I'd recommend maxing out on him - especially in a 60 card deck. The time thief engine is pretty self-explanatory. Your best normal summon is Kaleido Chick, but when you somehow don't manage to open it (despite having like 12 copies of it), you want to go into regulator and use its effect for a free rank 4.

Your ideal board would be Redoer, Perpetua and Flyback (that is assuming you cant make things like I:P into Apollousa on your opponents turn). But what happens if you don't open the right cards to extend into your monsters? Well, I run a small, 3-card Raidraptor engine to unclog your hand and get enough monsters to make a redoer. The combo is as follows: make Force Strix, use its effect to search the Lanius, special summon him and make Wise Strix, his effect special zephyros, get another monster on board and make Redoer then banish itself, special Zeph by setting a S/T and returning it - make I:P and then on your opponents special back Redoer and link him away into Unicorn. This is a weak, but optimal hand if you open practically unplayable.

To end off, the side deck. The side deck with this build isnt really match-up based -  it's just preference wise. I'd suggest you side the Utopia Double package after game 1 if you know you're going second. The extra deck is pretty tight but if you know you're going second then you can easily just otk and get the match win. I'd also side Castel, because he's a generic rank 4 with a spin ability. Armageddon knight was a card that I originally ran, but its more of a side card or just optional. Obviously, if you open it then you plus a lot - but it wastes your normal for a simple pitch 1 which isn't quite so optimal. In short it's a situational card - so use it wisely. I've seen people run Dragun and F0 dragon in side - but the problem is you don't really make F0 with this deck - as the main rank 4's you are making turn 1 are Perpetua and Redoer. So it's a -2 in the extra that you really need. Dragun is slightly better in my opinion, but with this build; you already run 6 garnets and adding two more could make it even more bricky - which is really crucial in a sixty-card build.

Overall: this build is a hefty 8.7/10. This is one of the better builds out there - and ends on a lot of negates fast, especially with the new support. The deck is nice on paper and on the field - which helps it be one of my favourite so far. I've spent effort making this deck and hopefully you'll enjoy using it to crush your opponents dreams as you silently whisper for the 6th time 'Redoer effect'. Thanks a lot to my sensei and friend, Yumi, for teaching me how to use this deck and telling me all these great combos of his. Big shoutout to him!"

You run the eight hand traps to stop your opponent from getting a board, then you typically want to Synchro summon with the Blackwings and generate enough damage to defeat the opponent. However, there is going first potential with the extra deck as well. Normally Blackwings suffer from a lack of quick effects that you can use during the opponents turn to disrupt making it hard to stop the opponent with just hand traps if you even draw them; nbut with I:P Masquerena you can link climb into Knightmare unicorn during their turn and bounce a troublesome card to the hand. You can also make Borreload  Savage Dragon when you go first as well which is a great negating monster. The reason these expensive monsters must be run is because Simoon the Poison Wind ( Your main Combo starter) locks you into dark extra deck monsters, so these are the best you could make going first if you want to maximize your plays. The main brick of the deck is of course Mare Mare but it is essential to Mare Mare for closing games. It is very easy for Blackwings to make Yazi evil of the yang zing and he not only pops a card on the field but also summons Mare Mare which turns into Borrelsword. If you do happen to brick Mare Mare, Twin Twisters is a great card that can help discard it from your hand. Mare Mare can later be shuffled back into the deck with Pot of Avarice which opens up the option to do the Yazi play again and lets you draw two cards as well. There are more draw power cards besides Avarice like Allure of darkness and Upstart Goblin which are meant to help make the deck more consistent. Black Whirlwind lets you add Monsters to your hand so it is sort of draw power but is more of a combo starter as it lets you pick which Blackwings you need to start Synchro Summoning. Foolish Burial is an extender which is meant to send Steam or Zephyros to the graveyard so you can use their effects for whatever situation you are currently in. Twin twisters is just a generic backrow removal which is also useful for discarding Mare Mare, Steam the Cloak, and Zephyros the Elite if you happen to have them in your hand. The rest of the deck is the Blackwing engine which is used mainly to Synchro summon, however some Blackwings like Gale the whirlwind have decent effects. I have searched long for a better blackwing deck then the one I built but I believe this is the most consistent and powerful version that is currently available until Raidraptor Wise strix comes to the TCG. Thank you for Viewing my deck list and I hope you have a good time playing it if you do happen to try it out for yourself. If you have any suggestions on how I can improve the deck feel free to message me your ideas, I am always open to improving my favorite deck. Once again, Thank you!"

'Towers' may not be the big dog anymore with links running around, but team him up with 'Skybase' and even they are in trouble. Speaking of links, 2018's 'Genius' solved the pendulum handicap for them, allowing them to go off like before.

<p class=""LC20lb DKV0Md"">Please check my other decks. You will not regret. Something nice for everyone will be found.</p>
Very interesting and  short link combo starting from one card, with an overwhelming end result. Thanks to the fact that we only need one card we have more cards to counteract the opponent's cards.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Adamatia archetype is focused on excavating cards from the top of the deck to special summon other rock monsters to gain access to synchro monsters and solid backrow cards. Their effect is generic so it allows several gameplans, here I propose a control oriented build. The gameplan will be to maximize the excavating effects of our monsters to summon generic rock monsters and synchro monsters with good control effects when seting a backrow.

&nbsp;

The main deck monsters separates into 2 ccategories : the tuners that special summon themselves to excavate cards and speciel summon monsters amongst them, and the non-tuners that trigger effects when summoned by Adamatia monster's effects. The tuner monsters are the basis of the deck's strategy : they share the effect of excavating the top 5 cards of the deck to special summon a level 4 or lower non-tuner rock monster that was revealed, and can speciel summon themselves by different ways (Adamatia Analyser summons itself if only the opponent controls a monster, Adamatia Seeker summons itself if we control another Adamatia monster and Adamatia Researcher summons itself if we control another rock monster). The other Adamatia monsters shares the effect of sending back any synchro monster of their attribute from the field or graveyard to the extra deck to go back to the top of the deck, and trigger an effect if summoned by an Adamatia monster effect : Leonite can send an Adamatia monster from the hand/graveyard to the top of the deck, Raptite send a rock monster from the hand/graveyard to the top of the deck and Dragite is a 1 card draw. The non-tuner monsters are important to constantly recycle ressources and are an alternative way to place a specific monster on top of the deck so we are sure to special summon it later. The cycling effect is generic so we can recycle monsters like Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon.

To complete this engine we have Koa'ki Meiru Guardian and Koa'ki Meiru Wall that are targets for the adamatia tuner's effect and can negate respectively monsters and spells effect activation. Gigantes is an extender that opens plays on Granite Loyalist to unlock mediocre hands and can break backrows in some specific configurations.

Lastly Ash Blossom pairs with Infinite Impermanence to restrain opponent's play and allow easier OTKs when going second, and can also backup our boards when going first.

&nbsp;

The spell and trap package of the archetype is quite good and polyvalent. First Adamatia Laputite is a field spell that boost all rock monsters to create a fair number of beatsticks and make our boards harder to break (a simple Koa'ki Meiru monster go to 2400 Atk), and has the usefull ability to take 5 Adamatia cards of the deck and place them on top in any order so we can have access to all our cards folowing the situations. Adamatia Sign is a generic reborn for rock monsters that is not once per turn, and can place any Adamatia monster of the deck on it's top if reborning an Adamatia monster. Adamatia Resonance is a counter trap that handles a monster effect and Adamatia Relieve tributes x Adamatia monsters to destroy x+1 cards on the field, being a good disruption effect against many decks.

Lastly Pot Of Avarice is an alternative way to recycle specific cards of the graveyard and draw 2 cards, to search out backrow cards/hand traps after we made our board. It's also an excllent card to start a grind game if the opponent broke our board.

&nbsp;

The extra deck Adamatia monsters also have a shared excavating effect : Raptite excavates thee top 5 cards to special summon any rock monster revealed, Leonite takes 1 revealed Adamatia card to the hand and Dragite bounces x or less cards to the hand, w being the numbr of rock monsters revealed. Adamatia Rise Dragite is a great OTK generator that can get rid of annoying monsters and backrow simultaneously. They also have a quick effect that triggers during the opponent's turn if a monster of their attribute is in our graveyard (mostly the non-tuner Adamatia monsters) : Raptite banishes 1 card from the opponent's graveyard, Leonite reborns a rock monster (usefull to bring back Koa'ki Meiru monsters) and Dragite is a spell/trap negation. Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon and Dragon Ogre Deity Of Tenyi are easy to summon and consist on monster effect negation / banishing disruption that can also highly pressure boards during battlephases.

Granite Loyalist and Abyss Dweller are easy to summon xyz4 monsters, the first can search out any rock monster to unlock bricky hands or extend boards and the second locks the opponent's graveyard to backup our final board, being a stop to specific decks.

The link package is generic. Salamangreat Almiraj is a destruction protection and is also a fire type monster that is easy to summon that enables the quick effect of Adamatia Rise Leonite. Knightmare Phoenix and Unicorn can especially handle backrow cards to OTK if we go second or grind the game in some specific configurations, and Borreload Dragon is a way to bypass annoying monsters like Avramax. Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess is a good grind game option to prevent monster effects that triggers during the battle phase and push OTKs.

&nbsp;

The side deck :

It's designed to enhance going second match ups, so first twin Twisters and Red Reboot destroys backrow, the second card being able to completely shut down trap relevant decks like Altergeist and Subterror.

Mind control steals monsters to handle powerfull monsters like Apollousa or at least force out négations, and Super Polymerization can neutralize boards of decks that are out of range of Nibiru. Nibiru is a stop to almost all combo decks when used at the right timing, and opens easy OTKs with Adamatia Rise Dragite.

Lastly Dinowrestler Pankratops is a free special summon that heavily pressure boards of control decks like Subterror and Altergeist with it's quick effect.

Jack A' Booran","Just a pure list for Mayakashi without any engine shenanigans, about as basic as you could get while still being playable in current year. The goal is still to get to Hajun or die trying, then do the typical synchro ladder with Dakki. Can either go first or second, though going first is generally safer because of the inherent inability of Mayakashi to play through disruption, as well as all of the quick-effect revival cards that need to be set/summoned first. I opted not to include Yuki-Onna the Absolute Zero Mayakashi as I wanted this list to be realistic to make IRL and who knows when she's hitting the TCG, but once she's imported you should make space for her in the extra deck if you can help it."

There are two ways to win with this deck, OTK or Stall. I like to play the stall variation.

Basic Prank Kids Combo - Any Two Prank Kids and a polymerisation of any sorts.

The best possible hand one could get with this deck would be:

Going First :

Prank Kids Dropsies, Prank Kids Lampsies, Magical Meltdown, Ash Blossom , Solemn Judgment.

If you are in a 40 min tournamant and they dont disrupt at all, You can win slowly on time and control the match.

.....

I will write a bit more soon.

Very good Megalith deck with Cyber Angel Benten engine. Reinforced with a small “crystron needlefiber” – “glow up bulb” combo giving us extra Link 4.

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/very-good-megalith-deck-2020/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/very-good-megalith-deck-2020/</a>

Trickstars great archetype, of course shows its full class with 3 x ""trickstar light stage"" and with 3 x ""terraforming"". But you can still kick some butts quickly ;) but nowe you must have good hand. It could be easier to win  with Utopia Double OTK mechanic (instant fusion and double or nothing), but I wanted to keep something from original  charm of this archetype.

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/pure-trickstars-2020/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/pure-trickstars-2020/</a>

This deck prevents from using enemy monsters effects and blocks his extra deck.  Much better deck than other decks with this archetype.

Simple and fun deck for fans of Red Dragon Archfiend. Master Rule 4 &amp; 5 [  better on 5 ;)  ].

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/red-dragon-archfiend-deck-2019-3/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/red-dragon-archfiend-deck-2019-3/</a>

Do you like Gren Maju, banish cards gain a lot LP and ATK. But you think in these times with this deck I won't win with anyone. Nothing more wrong, with a good idea you can do a lot. And this is the most beautiful in YGO new life old cards.

Its a trap heavy deck with 2 Xyz Monsters. They have 2 effects. The first is the trap effect the other effect has all Paleozoic traps. When a Trap activates they can be special summoned from the graveyard but the opponent can chain to the trap a other card and the Paleo not comes to the field. All Paleozoic Monsters are unaffectet against Monstereffects and there are normal monsters (not the 2 Xyz). Anomalocaris is the bossmonster of this archetype. It needs 3+ Level 2 monster and in either turn it can detach 1 Material to pop a card on the field. When a trap comes to the grave from our side he can mill the top card our deck and when its a trap we can add it. When not it comes in the grave. This effect goes only when it has a trap as a xyz material. Opabinia allows us to use our Paleozoic traps from our hand. And when this good boi has a Trap as a Material he can detach one material to search 1 Paleozoic Trap.

Up to Upstart, up to 3 Solemn Judgement, made room for a second Eternity. I'm down one land search in the maindeck, and running a Terraforming over Demise of the Land. Demise is good if you know you're going first, but pulling a spellbook to the hand might be more useful. You don't need the extra deck - you can make Crowley or Linkuriboh, maybe I:P into Unicorn if you want, though really you're trying to just get to a Jowgen lock. There's also the Relinquished monsters, since Droll is big against us and is #1 hand trap right now. Still couldn't find room main. Monster Reborn comes in as a way to make Priestess or Thousand-Eyes in the matchups where Thousand-Eyes is really good. Set Rotation is for field spell decks, notably other Mystic Mine decks and dinos. Droll is for SPYRAL. Evenly Matched and Raigeki are to help break boards, still useful against SPYRAL but just good when you know you're going second. I feel like the one Raigeki is still worth it, just for retaining value in a protracted game. Matched is also our answer to back-row. Kycoo is for Orcust, anything that banishes monsters or recurs monsters from the GY. Dark Ruler No More also helps against SPYRAL while just generally being a strong card, and helps combo with Jowgen. Instant Fusion is mostly for all the Droll, but doubles as removal. Notably, both of the creatures it summons are Spellcasters, meaning you can use Spellbook of Life to get 1 negate off of Millennium-Eyes or lock boards up with Thousand-Eyes. Secret Village is less useful than it was when Skystriker was everywhere, but it's still a good way to lock people down/trip people up. Mostly it turns off Cosmic Cyclone and Twin Twisters, helping to protect Power of the Guardians, but it can be a seriously disruptive card."

One good combo is to use booster dragon or borreload dragon<span>  <span>to point to zones to put your elpy and pisty. I also sided super-poly to take advantage of the three borreload furious dragon as you can use your opponents DARK dragon monsters (which aren't exactly rare.) I also sided E-HERO core, which admittedly is weird. But, its no surprise that HERO decks are going to be incredibly good in the formats to come. And using your opponents E-HEROs as fusion material for core will be good for disrupting your opponents plays.

Try to start with Crystal Conclave and any Crystal Beast (other than Pegasus). When it is destroyed in battle, Sapphire Pegasus can be used to quickly bring out another beast. When you draw another Conclave, destroy the one on the field to bring Pegasus to your hand. Set Conclave and summon Pegasus to summon another beast. Destroy Conclave once more to get Pegasus into your hand, then bring it out again to summon another Crystal Beast. The goal here is to quickly get out as many Crystal Beasts as possible. Use Torrential Tribute to send them to the graveyard and use Maiden, Master, or White Stone to get a Blue-Eyes out after. When all the types of Crystal Beasts are in the graveyard, you can summon Rainbow Dragon (ideally summon both). Use Advance Darkness and get remove them from play to summon Rainbow Dark Dragon. Deep-Eyes makes a good backup since it gains power based on dragons in the graveyard. I have not gotten to use it too much yet so it will likely have bugs to work out. It may work very well with cards like Stardust Dragon and other dragon synchros."

Very interesting and  short link combo starting from one card, with an overwhelming end result. Thanks to the fact that we only need one card we have more cards to counteract the opponent's cards.

Lucky coin deck but not only that. A decent hybrid deck made up from burn cards , floodgates and of course random effects. Joey Wheeler would be proud.

With Crusadias underrated special summoning ability, and Rokket one","So when I make these deck uploads - a lot of people ask me ""Why?"". Well, if no-one else is going to make 6 negate combo's after a control-supporting banlist than who will?! For today's quirky amalgamation of cards; I decided I would mix in one of, in my opinion, the most underrated link-climb decks with the iconic deck of yugioh VRAINS' favourite villain. Crusadia Rokket's have surprisingly impressed me over the coming days: I've managed to somehow make a decent board while having card advantage (all using an OTK-centered archetype). So with that being said - let me explain..

The main strategy, and idea, behind starting off the combo is making your generic Guardragon combo: Spatha into Elpy, Elpy into Red MD, etc. What you want to do however, is instead of making Saryuja, make Apollousa. This will be your first negate. Then you want to combo-off with Striker Dragon and using him, get out your infamous Borreload Savage. A third combo you can do - is pitch your Galactic Spiral Dragon and bring it back. Then you can simply use its effect with something like Crusadia Draco, and make your Number 38. The rest of course relies on how well you draw - which with this deck tends to be pretty well.

Alongside these three - you can end on cards like Hieratic Seal and Avramax - for that added protection. I decided to run Sanaphond mainly because of fear that Orcust will still be a thing - but it rarely came up in play-testing so I'd advise you cut it for something better in general - or just something you prefer to play. I'd also at one point considered playing Needlefiber - but it seemed to bricky and inconsistent towards my ideal combo. You can easily pull off the same effect with just your Rokket Tracer.

In general: this deck is about a 7.9/10 - only with the fact that this new format definitely promotes Control over Combo. Still it's an original take on the Crusadia deck and seems consistent and fun to play with. There is definitely room for improvement and I encourage you to look into bringing out the decks full potential. I believe if I focused more on the Rokket aspect of the deck I could've achieved some bonkers results - but I am content with how it turned out anyway!"

Monstrosity will help with the bricky hands seeing as you can just drop them straight out on board (it being quick play is also pretty spicy), but with the banning of IB there's no way to actually serach this out now making it less consistent, but it's still to good of an anti brick to not want it I feel. There's also Generaider Boss Quest so you can return and search, but with the only other search being Mardel you can't hope to rely on that either. Loptr is a great addition to the deck, as he can tribute himself to bring out any of your giants, you could possibly slot in Condemned Witch instead of Lilith if you  wanna go balls deep into summoning Loptr, they both serve a similar role so it's personal choice (Lilith guarantees you a field spell or Impermanence whereas Witch nets you a Generaider) and as seeing that the normal summon isn't that important in the deck because of the field spell you can afford to drop em in most situations.

The Boss you wanna get out first is either Hoarr or Utgard, but preferably Hoarr as he can negate anything once a turn and his discard effect isn't awful either depending on matchup, but Utgards' banish anything effect is nothing to laugh at either. After you have those 2 out though it's whatever works in the situation you're in. Mardel searches ANY generaider card when she's summoned from anywhere which is nice, Hela can bring em back from the grave (she can tribute herself for the effect too) so I feel having em both as a 1 of is justifiable.

The Invoked package speaks for itself really, adds more consistency to the deck as a whole giving you more plays. So there's not much to be said about it, pretty bog standard.

Very good Megalith deck with Cyber Angel Benten engine. Reinforced with a small “crystron needlefiber” – “glow up bulb” combo giving us extra Link 4.

Trickstars great archetype, of course shows its full class with 3 x ""trickstar light stage"" and with 3 x ""terraforming"". But you can still kick some butts quickly ;) but nowe you must have good hand. It could be easier to win  with Utopia Double OTK mechanic (instant fusion and double or nothing), but I wanted to keep something from original  charm of this archetype.

This deck prevents from using enemy monsters effects and blocks his extra deck.  Much better deck than other decks with this archetype.

The stat remains the same, spam out as many monsters as you can to overwhelm anything you opponent might have with high attack monsters but it can now set up a board of its own, being able to make Appaloosa, hope harbinger, and dark law turn 1 to stop anything your opponent may do

I do believe this deck is very powerful in its own right considering that colossus did just get banned. but fear not! because I believe that this deck can be the solution to thunder dragons for the time being until they get new support. this deck uses some spicier tech in the deck to accommodate for the loss of colossus. the idea of the deck is more of what I like to call ""Titan Control"". meaning that this is a more control style deck rather than just an OTK central build that everyone is trying to go for. the idea of the deck is to summon titan first turn using ""anaconda"", and once you do that you will have other cards in your hand or some number of cards to help you control the board. be sure to not overextend as it can be a mistake that some people can make when playing this deck(remember the goal is to get titian out first turn). once you get titan out the first turn, you are set to make your plays for next turn because your opponents will assume that titan will automatically be a threat and will have to use up there resources to remove it from the board. anyway, have fun with this deck and leave a like for more updates to the deck."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4wUcBkL8JU

Galaxy Photon and Cyber Dragon both has synergy thanks to Cyber Repair Plant which can search Galaxy Soldier and continuing your play to both Galaxy or Cyber Dragon. Repair Plant is searchable through Cyber Dragon Core which is also our 1 card starter making it is the best card in this deck, I will explain the combo.

Normal summon Core, search Repair Plant, ss Almiraj (making Repair Plant online), use Repair Plant search Galaxy Soldier, ss Soldier search another one, ss another Soldier (we need 2 light monster fodder in total), overlay both Soldier ss Cyber Dragon Nova, use Nova ss Core from GY, ss Cyber Dragon Infinity, link off Almiraj and Core for Verte Anaconda on another extra zone, use Verte send Red-Eyes Fusion (for Dragun negation+monster pops+burn) or Overload Fusion (if you have 2 Cyber Dragon monsters in GY for Rampage multiple atk+backrow pops+dumps Cyber Dragon monsters to GY).

Cyber Dragon lineup: 1 Cyber Dragon (great going second, discard fodder), 3 Core (best card, main starter, searches Cyber spell), 1 Herz (discard fodder, recycle/search Cyber Dragon), 1 Revsystem (extender), 3 Emergency (searches Core or other Cyber Dragon monsters), 1 Repair Plant (searchable from Core, searches Galaxy Soldier, Photon Orbital, or any Cyber Dragon monsters). The monsters are all contact fusion material which means free removal.

Galaxy Photon lineup: They mainly act as extenders (except Galaxy Soldier which is our main combo). 1 Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon (rank 8 play centered around this card), 1 Afterglow Dragon, 1 Galaxy Knight, 1 Galaxy Braver, 1-2 Photon Thrasher (free monster), 1 Photon Vanisher (free+plus, searches Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon), 1-2 Orbital (Galaxy and Photon monster searcher), Galaxy Wizard (searches Galaxy and Photon card; backup plan when you only have 1 fodder for Galaxy Soldier; ss Soldier search Wizard, normal summon Wizard, use Wizard tribute and search Galaxy Expedition, use expedition ss Soldier for Infinity or lv8 if you have another lv8 extender), 1 Galaxy Expedition (high lv extender), 1 Galaxy Zero (revives Galaxy/Photon for extender or XYZ rank-up).

Fusion lineup: Vanilla Red-Eyes and DM (Dragun material), 2 Red-Eyes Fusion (just in case it is drawn), 1 Magicalized Fusion (free Dragun), 1 Overload Fusion (for Rampage play backrow pops + multiple atk OTK). The fusion spells are all searchable by Verte.

Complementary cards: handtraps (preferably light), RotA (searches the Photons which are free ss monsters), Monster Reborn (extender, revives your boss monsters or for XYZ rank-up), Cosmic Cyclone (banishes backrow).

Extra deck: Self explanatory.

Side deck: Matchup specific.

Pros: Great going first or second, first turn board have both negations and pops, big monsters, can play through single target/negation handtraps but the board will end only with Dragun, fusion (contact too) and XYZ dont need link marker anymore in MR5.

Cons: Possible bricking with many big level monsters, contact fusing in MR5 only works with mostly link/pendulum monster, hard facing Cyber Dragon mirror."

The main combo is: <a data-name=""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a> + <a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Urnight"">Koa'ki Meiru Urnight</a> (summon any koa'ki meiru of the same type/ attribute on the hand) + <a data-name=""Ties of the Breathren"">Ties of the Breathren</a>

Koa'ki meiru cards are very dependent of the ""<a data-name=""iron core of koa'ki meiru"">iron core of koa'ki meiru</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""diamond core of koa'ki meiru"">diamond core of koa'ki meiru</a>"", so I tried to filter the most relevant cards. Most of the monsters in this deck are the same attribute and type making easier to pay his cost on the field.

If you start the first turn you'll be on the <em>advantage</em> on the most cases. Use <a data-name=""Ties of the breathren"">Ties of the breathren</a> and summon 2 more rock monsters:
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Wall"">Koa'ki Meiru Wall</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Overload"">Koa'ki Meiru Overload</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Guardian"">Koa'ki Meiru Guardian</a></li>
</ul>
These monsters can dismantle the opponents play and slow all his deck using <a data-name=""drop off"">drop off.</a> <a data-name=""core reinforcement"">Core reinforcement</a> let you re-use tributed monsters in the same turn. <a data-name=""Koa'ki meiru Maximus"">Koa'ki meiru Maximus</a> is very situational, use it to decide the duel.

You will face plenty of light and dark based decks, if that happens, <a data-name=""Koa'ki meiru Drago"">Koa'ki meiru Drago in the first turn</a> will lock the opponent's hands and you can reveal himself or maximus as cost. Always summon monsters that have the the same attribute and type on the hand.

Use <a data-name=""Statue of anguish pattern"">Statue of anguish pattern</a> and <a data-name=""Cyber shadow Gardna"">Cyber shadow Gardna</a> on the side deck to destroy multiple cards."

Rata/RANK10YGO: ","This is a Train deck that uses the new Level 10 EARTH Machine, Landscaper Goldilocks. Its ATK-boosting effect and nuke effect both fit with the overall theme of Trains, which is to summon Rank 10 beatsticks and run the opponent over. Due to the Level 10 Monsters being easy to summon and having downsides to compensate for that, Skill Drain is a welcome addition to this deck. The name of this deck is inspired by AC/DC's song ""Highway To Hell""."

Simple draw lock deck. Forbids an opponent SS monsters. Take your opponent spells or traps (with good hand bo,"TACTICS - Founding of this deck are very simple. The point is to know what type monsters use opponent (if you start game you dont knowe that, if you second np). And use ""Archnemesis Eschatos"" for Lockdown oponents. We use ""dark world dealings"", card destruction or ""Danger! Mothman!"" second effect to know type opponent monsters. Late as standard in this deck type. Add, draw, SS loop use ""Saryuja Skull Dread"" and ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" to draw more. We summon and  use  Link and when we draw ""Archnemesis Eschatos"" we use hise effect. Before we'll probably  we need use too Reprodocus link effect.       If opponent uses for example decks (Hero, Salamngret, Altergeist, Orcust, Cyber Dragon, Zombie, Abc, D/D/D, Fluffal... is completely lock. And we are use Virus traps, with good hand we take opponent spells and traps.

Going second: add, draw, SS loop use knightmare link to clean the field. SS appropriate boss monster, we use ""Archnemesis Eschatos"" attack and win ;)

All mine decks are well tested and optimized in terms of draw power, dead hand, synergy. balance &amp; combo.  All this to give you the best possible version of selected deck.

Please check my other decks. You will not regret. Something nice for everyone will be found.

Pure perfection and synergy.

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/jumpin-jack-time-thieves-pure/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/jumpin-jack-time-thieves-pure/</a>

For the uninitiated, I'll get up to speed on the key cards of both this version and the previous, so there may be some copy-pasting.

Time Thieves are an archetype debuting in Soul Fusion, boasting cool L4 monsters and an interesting Xyz to swing around. Sadly, at the time it was more of a splash engine that couldn't really function without outside support. With the arrival of Ignition Assault, however, a new slew of clock cleaners popped up and brought plenty more to mess up people's decks with card swiping and bouncebacks.

It's more of a slow-paced archetype, I feel, but that doesn't mean it's without its strong points. With the addition of cards from both Phantom Knights and Danger!, it's a force to be reckoned with. So without further ado, the deck of many turned heads awaits.
<h2>New Monsters</h2>
One of the best cards to have Turn 1 with this deck is <a data-name=""Time Thief Regulator"">Time Thief Regulator</a>. When this cute robo-pooch is the only monster on your field, Tributing it lands you two free Time Thief monsters with different names from the deck. It's extra well-boding if you get Startup in the same hand, since you can Special Summon it and save your Normal Summon for another good Xyz material monster.

A prime target for the bow-wow's benefit comes in the form of <a data-name=""Time Thief Winder"">Time Thief Winder</a>. Normal or Special Summoning the handsome blighter grants a Candina-esque effect that searches any Time Thief card from the main deck, whether it's a monster or backrow. Its effect from the hand is just as good, as you can bring it out just by detaching a material from an Xyz monster you control. Overall, a great card to have at three and try and revive whenever possible.

<a data-name=""Time Thief Bezel Ship"">Time Thief Bezel Ship</a> makes headlines with its ability to revive itself from the grave by detaching a material from an Xyz monster you control, much like Winder. Do bear in mind that if you simply have it sent to the grave by itself through Links or other methods, however, it'll be banished and unable to use. So it's best to use it as future Xyz material afterwards, so you can continue to recycle it as you please. That's not to say its Quick Effect isn't also useful, since it Tributes itself to attach a card from your opponent's graveyard to a Time Thief Xyz you control. This effect is similar to another card we'll get to later, so do keep a lookout.

Last but not least as far as the main deck Thieves is <a data-name=""Time Thief Chronocorder"">Time Thief Chronocorder</a>. First glance might have you tilt your head and wonder why this is worth play, but looking into it, you'll find that it can revive itself should your Time Thief Xyz leave the field by a card effect, including its own, and also Tribute itself to have your opponent take battle damage they would've inflicted to you the Battle Phase you sent it away. It's another card that's banished if revived from the GY this way, so Tribute it in dire situations like when a super powerful tool would whittle you down by a large margin, otherwise use it for future Xyz material much like Bezel Ship.

&nbsp;

<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a> acts as a free summon should you control another Phantom Knights monster. Upon banishing it from the grave, you can add a Phantom Knights backrow card from your deck to your hand, like Shade, Fog, or Rank-Up. It and another new monster acts as prime material for a very certain Xyz that comes in surprising handy, so keep on the lookout for it.

That very monster is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a>. Its power up effect is more of a bonus, but what really sells it is the ability to let Silent Boots summon itself for free and banishing it from the grave pretty much acts as a Candina, letting you search for any The Phantom Knights card in your deck, not just a backrow. Note the ""The"" part in it, as Fog Blade can't be searched this way unlike Silent Boots.

<a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a> replaces Foolish Burial from the previous build, as the mere summon lets you send a DARK monster from your deck to the grave. This will allow you to get to the beneficial effects of Ancient Cloak or Time Thief Bezel Ship much easier, not to mention it's a Level 4 monster, making it an applicable Xyz material for  <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>, Perpetua, or any of your other go-to Xyz monsters.

The Danger! monsters of the deck act as a way to both gain quick, easy material for Xyz and Links, as well as to generate card advantage. This is in part by the fact that these cards can summon themselves and draw a card right afterward, and this effect isn't once-per-turn for any of the monsters listed.

The first of which would be <a data-name=""Danger! Mothman!"">Danger! Mothman!</a>. Being one of the two L4's of these particular kinds of monsters, its discard effect allows you to draw one and then discard one, which can let you get off the GY effects of monsters like Bezel Ship and Silent Boots should they be in your hand. Don't get discouraged too much if it gets discarded when you try to summon it, however. Because if you have this next monster in your hand, you won't have to worry too much.

<a data-name=""Danger! Chupacabra!"">Danger! Chupacabra!</a> is another L4 who discards to revive a Danger! from the grave, other than itself. This way you can bring back Mothman! for further Xyz summons or any of the others for Links as well.

Another great monster of this kind if your wallet can take it is <a data-name=""Danger!? Jackalope?"">Danger!? Jackalope?</a>. Its discard effect allows you to Special Summon a Danger! right from the deck. It also makes for a fine R3 material considering if you have Phantom Knights both on the field and in the grave.

And that brings us to the one Limited monster of this variety, <a data-name=""Danger! Nessie!"">Danger! Nessie!</a>. Its discard warrants a search for any Danger! monster from your deck. In the case of this monster and Jackalope?, you'll want to discard those as soon as possible, favorably with Mothman! or Chupacabra! if possible.
<h2>Spells/Traps</h2>
Starting things off is actually a card that actually requires non-specific cards to get its mileage out of. Since your Main Deck is pretty much all DARK monsters, <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> is used to get a draw 2 in exchange for a DARK monster you might not necessarily need in your hand at a given point. Use this to, well, draw extra cards you may need or try and bait an Ash Blossom so your Time Thief Regulator isn't the one on the receiving end of it.

<a data-name=""Time Thief Startup"">Time Thief Startup</a> is a pretty cool card to have Turn 1, letting you Special Summon a Time Thief from your hand for free. Its second effect in the GY is miles better, as it banishes itself to attach one each of a Time Thief monster, spell, and trap from your grave to a Time Thief Xyz monster you control. After putting it to use Turn 1, if at all, you're likely best off using it as an attachment from the deck or discarding with a Danger!.

<a data-name=""Time Thief Hack"">Time Thief Hack</a> is a Continuous Spell protecting your Xyz monsters the turn they're summoned, but its secondary effect is worth more mention. This effect lets you target an Xyz monster you control to power it up by 300 ATK times its materials. And should at least one of those materials belong to your opponent, boom. Direct attack.

<a data-name=""Time Thief Flyback"">Time Thief Flyback</a> attaches a Time Thief card from the deck to your Time Thief Xyz monster straightaway, most often another Flyback for the bounceback effect. Though it also banishes itself from the grave to employ the Bezel Ship-esque effect of attaching a card from your opponent's grave to your Xyz monster. Another card that's primarily for attaching from the deck, but not too shabby on the field or the grave either.

<a data-name=""Time Thief Retrograde"">Time Thief Retrograde</a> is the real cream of the crop, especially since it can be searched with Winder. Should you control a Time Thief Xyz, you can negate an opponent's Spell or Trap and attach it to that monster as material, setting up respective card detachment effects and swiping even more materials.

With <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a> off the banlist at last, Xyz decks among this caliber can truly shine now. Being a card you can activate at a moment's notice or during your opponent's turn, it shifts any material-less DARK Xyz you control into a much more powerful form. Sadly, Outer Entity Azathot is still banned, so not as powerful plays can really come through. Luckily, that doesn't mean this card is devastated. You can still do things like, say, morph your Break Sword into a Redoer or Perpetua or, even better, make a Dark Rebellion into a Dark Requiem, the added attachment effect of Launch making it able to get off its effect instantly with 3000 ATK to swing around.

<a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> joins Retrograde's side as a reliable negation/disruption to add to the deck's power. Not only that, but in the GY, it banishes itself to Special Summon a Phantom Knight from there. So effectively, you could say, bring out a used Break Sword to Rank Up into a Redoer or Perpetua or set up another use of Silent Boots. A surefire card to run three of.

<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a> is a must to search using Silent Boots or Ancient Cloak, and a great card to start your first turn with. If you have no traps in your grave, you can activate it the turn you set it, bringing it to your field as a L4 DARK monster, so it's perfect to use for this deck's boss monster to get that bounceback effect off fine and dandy. And speaking of...
<h2>Extra Deck Monsters</h2>
The indisputable boss monster of the deck is none other than the Akira the 3rd of Yu-Gi-Oh!, <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>. This versatile young scamp attaches a card from the top of your opponent's deck every Standby Phase, and that fuels its crazy detaching effect. With a monster, it banishes itself until the End Phase to protect itself from harmful effects and destruction, so be sure to detach other kinds of cards from it to get their effects off, too. Detaching a spell lets you draw a card, simple enough. But by detaching a trap, you'll achieve a non-targeting bounceback of any face-up card on your opponent's field, including one of their seemingly indomitable monsters. And to add insult to injury, if it's a main deck card you returned during your opponent's turn, during your Standby Phase you get to attach the card you returned. I can't tell you how many times I narrowly escaped danger with this guy and paid back with my own crazy play.

Next comes Redoer's sweet, sassy counterpart, <a data-name=""Time Thief Perpetua"">Time Thief Perpetua</a>. This ever-helpful, defensive cutie bears two great effects: one to detach a material to revive a Time Thief from the grave -- including Redoer -- , and another to attach a Time Thief card from your deck to any Xyz monster you control, not just Redoer, to use as material. And it's a Quick Effect, too. So for free, you get to restock the materials of your powerful Xyz monsters you need to get into shape to power up your plays.

<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> makes for another generic material R4 that can go in a long way. Bearing an effect you can activate at any time on any turn, you detach one to prevent your opponent from activating card effects in the grave. This way, you won't have to worry about the effects of cards like Doomking Balerdroch, Destiny HERO Malicious, or the Shaddoll main deck monsters giving you much trouble.

<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> is an easy-to-summon walking MST, bearing a Quick Effect that detaches a material to pop any backrow on the field. Not much else to say, though it's joined by another windy companion.

<a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a> might not be the most powerful Xyz monster in terms of attack, but its effect can come in clutch if used just right. Detaching one material at a time acts as a <a data-name=""Paleozoic Canadia"">Paleozoic Canadia</a> of sorts, only lacking the ability to activate on your opponent's turn, to set a monster they control face-down. Detach two at once, and it shuffles it into the deck instead.

<a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a> is a sort of ""if all else fails"" monster when you desperately need to stall out some powerful monsters from your opponent for a while. In defense, it forces all your opponent's monsters into defense and prevents them from activating their trigger effects, so it's definitely worthwhile if you're in need of a turn or two to gather resources without worry that the turn they would have used to utterly end you will have already passed.

<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Break Sword"">The Phantom Knights of Break Sword</a> is surprisingly powerful in the right hands. More often than not, you'll be using its effect to pop itself and one of your opponent's cards at the same time. The former may sound dumb, but it actually revives two Phantom Knights (which are most likely the Silent Boots and Ancient Cloak it was likely used to summon) and amps up their levels by one, letting you then go into a new Rank 4 to continue your plays.

<a data-name=""Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon"">Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon</a> is mostly used as a beatstick for a quick smack, given its ability to halve and gain a monster's attack by detaching its two materials. That'd be run-of-the-mill and pretty arbitrary if we weren't also running the aforementioned Rank-Up quick play, which upgrades it into <a data-name=""Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon"">Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon</a>, a far more powerful and useful form. So long as Rebellion is still attached to it, you can either snatch the whole of an opponent's monster's ATK for itself or negate the activation of another monster's effect to destroy it and revive an Xyz monster from the grave. I wouldn't fret about keeping good materials on it, though. So long as <a data-name=""Time Thief Perpetua"">Time Thief Perpetua</a> is on the field, its own quick effect can help keep attaching Time Thief cards for it to use if your deck is supplied with them.

Meanwhile on the side of <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Blaze Falcon"">Raidraptor - Blaze Falcon</a>, it acts as another RUM Launch target for either a Redoer or Perpetua fresh out of material and you need something to keep its use going. You'll want to bring it out on your turn in ATK, as it can attack directly while it has material. And once it inflicts damage whilst doing so, it lets you pop an opponent's Special Summoned monster free. Otherwise, you can detach a material if this isn't possible to pretty much Raigeki all your opponent's Special Summoned monsters and burn for 500 each.

Your typical Link setup consists of cards like <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> for deck returns and possible additional draws, <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> for backrow popping, and <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> for being able to summon these during your opponent's turn, surprise them with their respective effects, and protect them from card effects. You can also use <a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a> to power up all your DARK monsters while also making sure LIGHT monsters are on the weaker side, as well as adding a DARK monster from your grave to your hand when it's destroyed. This especially works if you're having Redoer attack directly using Hack's effect, just a heads-up. Other than that, a little <a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a> can go a long way in terms of whittling down your opponent's offenses.
<h2>Side Deck</h2>
The side deck I've included goes into some options if certain cards aren't your thing and some would work better than others. <a data-name=""Danger!? Tsuchinoko?"">Danger!? Tsuchinoko?</a> goes on the field whether you summon it successfully or discard it, while <a data-name=""Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite"">Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite</a> is a great card to easily bring out, especially with stuff like Armageddon Knight to support it.

Also along for the ride is <a data-name=""Bujinki Ahashima"">Bujinki Ahashima</a>, a Link that lets you summon two monsters of the same level from the hand and grave, then immediately Xyz summon with both. It also pops a backrow your opponent controls should an Xyz monster it points to detach a material for its effect. Might not be the best option, but you could say it has its place.

The Utopia Engine is available as well, consisting of your summoning order of <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a>, <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a>, and <a data-name=""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"">Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</a>, as well as their respective power-up spell <a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a>. It's a reliable beatstick package, if not an overkill one, that can easily scale some high power walls.
<h2>Notable Combos</h2>
<h4>1. Hand: Time Thief Regulator</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Summon Regulator with a Normal Summon or Startup, then tribute to summon any pair combination of Winder, Bezel Ship, or Chronocorder.</li>
 	<li>Xyz Summon Redoer from the Extra Deck to start the card-snatching journey. If Winder is in hand, you can detach a material from Redoer to summon it for free; especially good if you only used Bezel Ship and Chronocorder, as you can then detach Bezel Ship to summon it back and set up future Xyz summons.</li>
 	<li>At any point when Winder is summoned, search for Retrograde or another Time Thief card that is beneficial to discard for a Danger! monster summon, such as Flyback, Startup, Bezel Ship, or Chronocorder.</li>
 	<li>After getting two more L4 monsters out, Xyz for Perpetua and activate her Quick Effect to attach Time Thief Flyback to Redoer for free, setting up his bounceback effect later.</li>
 	<li>Set Retrograde and pass the turn.</li>
 	<li>During opponent's turns, continue to attach Time Thief cards to Redoer using Perpetua, who can also re-summon other Time Thieves from GY and set up more searches and Xyz Summons, as well as attach cards from your opponent's deck with Redoer's Standby Phase effect.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Hand: The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak/Shade Brigandine and Silent Boots</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Normal Summon Ancient Cloak, allowing you to Special Summon Silent Boots. If Shade Brigandine is in hand, summon it first, then Silent Boots, and try to summon another L3, like Ancient Cloak or Danger!? Jackalope? after another Phantom Knight is in the GY.</li>
 	<li>Xyz Summon The Phantom Knights of Break Sword, and activate its effect to destroy itself and any card your opponent controls.</li>
 	<li>Upon destruction, activate Break Sword's secondary effect to summon Ancient Cloak and Silent Boots from GY. Make sure Ancient Cloak is in Attack Position.</li>
 	<li>If possible, summon another L4 monster, like a Danger! or a Time Thief under the effect of Startup or if you used Bezel Ship's GY effect while Break Sword was on the field.</li>
 	<li>Xyz Summon Redoer, then activate Ancient Cloak's effect to grant Redoer 800 extra ATK and swap itself to Defense.</li>
 	<li>Xyz Summon for Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon and use its effect to detach both its materials to sap an opposing monster's ATK.</li>
 	<li>When both are in GY, banish Ancient Cloak to search for Rank-Up Magic Launch and banish Silent Boots to search for Fog Blade, setting both and passing the turn.</li>
 	<li>During your opponent's Main Phase, activate Magic Launch on your Rebellion to make Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon, potentially negating a monster effect of your opponent, getting rid of said monster, and summoning an Xyz from your GY, such as Break Sword for a potential Link Summon.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Hand: Armageddon Knight</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Normal Summon Armageddon Knight, whose effect will proc and allow you to send either Silent Boots or Ancient Cloak to the GY.</li>
 	<li>Banish said Silent Boots or Ancient Cloak from the grave to add Shade Brigandine to your hand.</li>
 	<li>Set Shade Brigandine, then immediately activate it to Special Summon itself from the backrow as a L4 monster, if you've made sure no traps were in your grave.</li>
 	<li>Use Armageddon Knight and Shade Brigandine for the overlay of Redoer. This will allow you to be able to use both Redoer's monster and trap detachment effect right off the bat.</li>
 	<li>Optionally, you can bring out several more L4 monsters, either with Winder's hand effect, Bezel Ship's GY effect, Startup, or the Danger! cards Mothman! and Chupacabra!, for the Xyz Summon of other monsters like Perpetua, Tornado Dragon, Abyss Dweller and the like.</li>
</ul>
The rest of the cards and combos are rather self-explanatory, so feel free to experiment with the set as a whole and even report back some discoveries on plays you've made with it. Would love to hear your feedback and experiences!"

Moving into the 2020 Format you'll need to edit the overall game plan and expect a big of a more awkward start. You need to rely on the trap cards a bit more in order to defend yourself during your opponent's turn. With Lady Debug at 3 the main deck's consistency is even stronger than before, its kind of crazy; you now have 8 copies of gazelle! Despite losing Stallio this deck still is incredibly powerful and really consistent. If konami wanted to kill this deck they should've followed Thanos's advice and go for the head (Gazelle)"

You have a variety of bossmonsters to choose, and it's prepared for almost every situation. It can negate a lot, with calamities, number 38, or the savage dragon. It can crush greater beatsticks, with the full armor or the sun dragon.

In MR5, XYZ or synchro spam will be even easier, to quickly end the game with calamities.

Clear the backrow, defend your dragons with a azure-eyes and just beat it down.

Dangers are a huge help here, so you won't brick.

if anything goes wrong, and your enemy's low, summon CeD and do lots of burn
