Once again ill go over the main combo and a side combo.  Main Combo- If you start with Genex Undine, your perfect. Summon Genex Undine and uses the effect to send rosenix to the grave and you add a genex controller to your hand, next banish rosenix to summon a token then link the token off for a link spider uses link spider to summon controller and don't syncrho yet. Link off Spider and Controller to summon halqifibrax. Uses halqifibrax to summon out pengiun from your deck. then if you have a Silent angler or white stingray special summon them (note: if you have both try to summon stingray first because angler locks you out of special summoning from the hand) Now syncrho into Shooting Riser dragon if able or into White Aur dolphin. Then end your turn, if your going second feel free to atttack. On your opponets turn uses halqifibrax and bring out Shooting Riser dragon. Synchro into White Aura Bihamut (Another thing to note: White aura can revive itself as long as the token it summons is on the field but it can't revive itself if destroyed by battle.  &nbsp;  Side combo- Do the same as above but instead of going in to White Aura Bihamut go into White Aura Whale since Whale destroys all attack postion monsters.  &nbsp;  The Main Idea of The Deck  You want to synchro into as White Aura Bihamut as fast as possible and maybe try to get two of them on the field  &nbsp;  Once again this deck is not supposed to be a Meta or Competitive deck and I'd love some advice in the comments but lets not be to harsh, If you have question on how the deck works just comment below and ill try to answer.  &nbsp;  Thanks,  Sparko  &nbsp;"

Still has a one card combo. Budget alternatives to certain cards in the description.,"Union Carrier getting banned hurt the consistency of the deck somewhat. We were able to make Cyber Dragon Infinity and ABC Dragon Buster off of one card. With the hit there are different ways and there is still a one card combo using Crystron Halqifibrax.  The combo goes like this: <ol>  	<li>Search or Activate Hanger (2 card combo if you have a machine plus unauthorised activation). Use hanger to search B and summon it.</li>  	<li>Equip B with Driver, then banish driver to equip Torque tune gear, then special summon it.</li>  	<li>Link Summon the B and Toque Tune Gear to summon Halqifibrax. Chain link 1 Halq, Chain link 2 B.</li>  	<li>Summon Deskbot 001 with the effect of Halq (plus search another piece with B for follow up plays)</li>  	<li>Link Halq and Deskbot 001 to summon Mehca Phantom Beast Auroradon.</li>  	<li>Activate Auroradon when summoned, thus summoning 3 tokens, this will trigger Deskbot 001 form grave and it will special summon itself.</li>  	<li>Synchro Summon Deskbot 001 and one of the tokens to summon Herald of the Archlight.</li>  	<li>Activate Auroradon effect to destroy 2 tokens and summon Coltwing from deck.</li>  	<li>Activate Coltwing effect summoning 2 tokens, this will again trigger Deskbot 001 summoning it from grave.</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Phonon Pulse Dragon using Deskbot 001 and one of the tokens. When summoned change it's level to 1 using it's own effect.</li>  	<li>The Coltwing will be level 7 because of the token and use it along with Phonon Pulse Dragon to special summon Borreload Savage Dragon and equip it with Halq.</li> </ol> This will leave you a board with 2 negates (Savage and Herald) plus Auroradon and a token.  Different plays can be done depending on the hand but this is all off one Union Hanger.  &nbsp;  BUDGET OPTIONS  Some cards can have alternatives.  If you don't want to run Ash and Nibiru, you can swap them out for D.D Crow, Effect Veiler or Solemn Judgement.  If you don't want to run Halqifibrax, then remove it along with Auroradon, Deskbot 001, Torque Tune Gear, Coltwing and all the synchros and replace them with the Symphonic Warrior engine. This means adding 3x Symphonic Warrior Guitaar and 1x  Symphonic Warrior Miccs, this can give you an extra normal summon on activation. In the extra deck add Gear Gigant X, this will allow you to search Symphonic Warrior Guitaar. Plus Miccs is a level 5 so could be used to summon Infinity. Other than that the other extra deck spots can be replaced with cards such as Daigusto Emeral, Apollousa, the Knightmares or Bujinki Ahashima (allows for an xyz summon) from which you'll summon Gear Gigant x  &nbsp;  The Deck is very consistent and can end on powerful boards, you can still equip other ABC pieces and trigger their effects to summon Dragon Buster easier instead of other combos. But it has the same drawbacks as before, it's very susceptible to hand traps. The deck could potentially play through an Ash Blossom depending on your hand, but an Imperm, Veiler or Nibiru will pretty much end any plays."

The synergies between Paleozoic and Pacifis allow this deck to keep up in advantage and beat down on your opponent after disrupting their plays  <strong>Pros: </strong> <ul>  	<li>It's different, no deck is preparing to play against this one</li>  	<li>Forces your opponent to change their gameplan to hope to deal with it.</li>  	<li>About as dense on draw power as you can get, running many strong draw cards in 40</li>  	<li>Surprising burst kill options with Gren Maju and Phantasm Spiral Grip</li> </ul> <strong>Cons:</strong> <ul>  	<li>The deck is over 50% traps, you can end up with no engine, and having to use what you opened to force a topdeck war.</li>  	<li>It can be outpaced by most strong engines, if you don't snuff plays, you end up behind.</li>  	<li>Almost completely reactive, if your opponent opts to do nothing your only pressure is attacking with relatively small monsters.</li> </ul> <strong>Points - 4:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Pot of Extravagance - 1/2 Point</li>  	<li>Pot of Prosperity - 1/2 Point</li>  	<li>Card of Demise - 1/2 Point</li>  	<li>Sea Stealth Attack - 1/2 Point</li> </ul> <strong>A Note on Chains</strong>: <p>Piloting this deck properly requires a good grasp of chaining and priority.  Whenever you activate a trap, your opponent always has the opportunity to respond before you continue to build your chain. What this means is that if you are trying to summon out your Paleozoic monsters, you need to be aware that your opponent can block this from happening by responding to your trap with a Monster Effect or Quick-Play Spell, since Paleozoics need to chain <em>directly</em> to the activation of a Trap Card.  Somewhat related is the inclusion of Accumulated Fortune in this Deck, which can be triggered easily if your opponent starts the chain (e.g. Cl1 Opponent's card, Cl2 Your trap card, Cl3 Your opponent can respond but if they don't this is a Paleo, Cl4 Accumulated Fortune regardless of your opponent's response.) Another thing of note with accumulated fortune is that in can be used in chain with your own Pot of Extravagance, circumventing Extravagance's restriction and drawing 4 cards.</p> <strong>A Note on Pacifis:</strong> <p>Pacifis the Phantasm Spiral City is a card with some wacky rulings, I can't cover everything, but here are some things to keep in mind.</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Pacifis' effects always activate on a new chain, in contrast to the Paleozoics.</li>  	<li>Pacifis' effect to search is mandatory, and applies it's Summoning restriction whenever it activates, even if you have no search targets.</li>  	<li>Pacifis cannot ""see"" anything activated before it on a chain, this is relevant in the case of Metaverse.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p></p>"

The danger package is really good but the problem is that you do not want to discard ""<a data-name=""Chaos Daedalus"">Chaos Daedalus</a><a data-name=""Chaos Daedalus"">""</a> or ""<a data-name=""The Chaos Creator"">The Chaos Creator""</a> and they are very important for the strategy of the deck.  &nbsp;  You want to go first with this deck and set up a well protected board. If you draw ""<a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>"" you almost always want to search ""<a data-name=""Chaos Daedalus"">Chaos Daedalus</a>"" if you have a light monster to discard because he is a very good boss monster for your end board which gives your monsters targeting protection. But you can also search combo extenders that cannot be normal summoned or set like ""<a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a>"". She is very good for the deck because she can dump ""<a data-name=""Doomking Balerdroch"">Doomking Balerdroch</a>"" from the deck if she gets banished. If you have no way of getting ""<a data-name=""Zombie World"">Zombie World</a>"" you can even dump ""Necroworld banshee"" but remember that you cannot use the effects of those cards in that turn so Doomking is always the best choice. Valkyria can also banish ""<a data-name=""Shinobi necro"">Shinobi necro</a>"" in the GY to get a free tuner on the board and there are a lot of cards that banish valkyrie to activate her dumping effect like ""<a data-name=""Chaos Daedalus"">Chaos Daedalus</a>"", ""<a data-name=""The Chaos creator"">The Chaos creator</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>"" or even ""<a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Vendread core"">Vendread core</a>"" if you have Zombie World on the field.  &nbsp;"

I still play them from time to time in a very casual format. I was so hyped when the Abhyss support was announced and overjoyed when we got this unexpected alien support. Pincer Lord and Buster are really good and synergize very well with the old alien strategies.  Here's my take at Alien Abhyss. The aim is to have Pincer lord and another alien monster on the field (most of the time alien buster) with virus set. You have a trap raigeki coupled with a very good stun. The deck has a surprisingly good grind. Recombination and Buster both have nice eff in grave and the abhyss package allows you to keep putting board presence in the late game.

Dark Hole! (Nani!? *music intensifies*)  Ok, so to make this short and simple, Lightning Storm is very powerful if you're going second. You could side it, and it would fit in well with this deck, but Dark Hole has been way more effective for me. I would have played 2 earlier and 1 Raigeki, but my perfectionism was getting in the way. Even in this meta, I've seen a surprising amount of second and third turns where you still have cards on the field, whether it be a fog blade, or a face-down Orcust Knightmare which you've tribute summoned... (What? Am I the only person who's been forced to do that?) Even though lightning storm hits spells and traps, too, I feel like the Dark Hole has still been more useful for me. So yeah. Fight me.  Combo 1: (Starting with <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> in hand) <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Girsu, send <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> from deck off his effect</li>  	<li>Since you don't control any other cards, activate Girsu's effect and create a token to both player's fields--I love this effect, because it shuts down PSY-Framegear Gamma, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, even <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence, since they now have something on their field</a></li>  	<li>Banish Orcust Knightmare from the GY, send World Legacy - ""World Wand"" from deck to GY. If you opened with Wand, send Orcust Cymbal Skeleton instead off this effect. Banish World Wand from GY to special summon your Banished Knightmare. Use Girsu and the token to link summon <a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automaton"">Galatea, the Orcust Automaton</a> (if you sent Cymbal Skele instead, you'd summon Galatea first, then banish Cymbal Skele from GY to special summon Girsu)</li>  	<li>Activate Galatea's effect, shuffling the banished World Wand (or Cymbal Skeleton) into deck, then setting <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel (or really any Orcust spell/trap, depending on your playstyle)</a></li>  	<li>Use Galatea and Orcust Knightmare to Link summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche, activating his effect to send </a><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak (or torn scales) to GY to set Phantom Knights' Fog Blade from deck; banish Ancient Cloak from GY to add another Fog Blade to hand, then set it.</a></li> </ol> That's the combo. yeah, I know, not very combo-y since you only end on 2 negates; you do have a loaded GY that you could potentially mess around with on your opponent's turn, but in truth and honesty the original combo I had in mind went down the drain when I realized <a data-name=""Gravity Controller"">Gravity Controller</a> can't be used as a link material first turn it's on the field. There are some alternations for this combo I'm still working on, so if anybody has suggestions, feel free to share them (and no, unban Harp does not count as a suggestion)  Alternations for this Combo (that do exist because yes) <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Girsu, send <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> to GY, then create your token</li>  	<li>Banish Knightmare to send <a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">Orcust Cymbal Skeleton</a> to GY; use Girsu and your token to summon Galatea</li>  	<li>Banish Cymbal Skele from GY to special summon Girsu back from the grave.. Activate Galatea's effect, shuffling Knightmare into deck and getting out <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a></li>  	<li>Use Galatea to summon <a data-name=""Dingirsu, Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, Orcust of the Evening Star, using his effect on summon to equip the banished Cymbal Skeleton</a></li>  	<li>Use Dingirsu and Girsu to Link summon <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena, then pass turn</a></li> </ol> --On your opponent's turn, you can banish Cymbal Skele form GY to special summon Dingirsu back from the GY, sending a card your opponent controls hopefully mid-combo. Then, after you've done that, you can use him and I:P to link summon Knightmare Unicorn, shuffling another card they control (hopefully also mid-combo)  Second Alternation: (if you open with Girsu and some other extender, like <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a> of <a data-name=""Fiend's Sanctuary"">Fiend's Sanctuary)</a> <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Girsu; do the thing where you send Knightmare and create a token. Then summon your extender</li>  	<li>Use Girsu and your extender to link summon <a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automaton"">Galatea, the Orcust Automaton. Banish Knightmare from GY, send Cymbal Skele from deck to GY; banish Cymbal Skele from GY to revive your Girsu</a></li>  	<li>First, use Galatea's ability, shuffle the banished <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> into your deck, bringing out <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel from deck. Then use Galatea to summon Dingirsu, equipping your banished </a><a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">Orcust Cymbal Skeleton</a><a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">.</a></li>  	<li>Use Dingirsu, your token, and your revived Girsu to link summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche, do the thing from the first combo to get 2 fog blades.</a></li> </ol> The difference between this and the original combo, is that now you have Dingirsu, along with Cymbal Skele in grave. Since you have Babel on field, you can activate Cymbal Skeleton on your opponent's turn, banishing him to special summon Dingirsu--use his other effect to send a card your opponent controls to the GY, plus since he's a dark XYZ monster, you can get an additional pop off of <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche if you summon Ding into a zone Rusty's pointing to. So 2 negates, 1 pop, and 1 non-targeting send.</a>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Second Combo: (starting with <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a> in hand) <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Torn Scales, activate it's effect, discarding a card to send <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak from deck to GY</a></li>  	<li>Use Torn Scales to link summon <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj; Banish Ancient Cloak from GY to add Silent Boots to hand--chain Torn Scales's ability to special summon him back from GY</a></li>  	<li>Since you control Torn Scales, special summon Silent Boots from hand. Use Silent Boots and Almiraj to link summon I:P Masquerena --simply because you need the Dark attribute-- then use I:P and Torn Scales to link summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a></li>  	<li>Activate Rusty's effect, send Ancient Cloak from deck to GY to set Fog Blade from deck to field. Banish Silent Boots from GY to add a second Fog Blade to hand, then set it.</li> </ol> So yeah, it ends pretty similarly except now your Rusty can't be destroyed by your opponent's card effects. Not as rad as the last combo, in my opinion, but I'm still working on it--I'm sure there's some random PK card hidden in my collection that does something cool...  &nbsp;  Third Combo: (starting with <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> and <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a> in hand) <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Torn Scales, discard Girsu to send Ancient Cloak to GY</li>  	<li>Use Torn Scales to link summon Almiraj, banish Ancient Cloak to add Silent Boots; when Ancien Cloak is banished we can Reborn (Rebirth?) Torn Scales from grave</li>  	<li>Since you control Torn Scales now, special summon Silent Boots from hand; use him and Scales to link summon Cherubini in the zone Almiraj is pointing to. Activate Cherubini's effect, sending Cymbal Skeleton to the GY</li>  	<li>First (this is important) Banish Silent Boots from grave to add Shade Brigandine to hand, then set it under Almiraj's zone (this is also important) THEN you can banish Cymbal Skeleton to special summon Girsu from GY into the zone between Almiraj and the set Shade Brigandine; since it has two cards in its zone, it becomes a tuner. On summon, activate Girsu's effect and send Orcust Knightmare from deck, do the cycle (banish Knightmare from grave, send World Wand from deck, banish Wand to special summon Knightmare)</li>  	<li>Use Knightmare and Almiraj to link summon Galatea, shuffle the World Wand into deck to set, then activate Orcustrated Babel (&lt;very important, I've forgotten before and it sucks) then use Galatea to xyz summon Dingirsu, equipping banished Cymbal Skeleton</li>  	<li>Use Dingirsu and Cherubini to link summon Rusty Bardiche; activate Rusty's effect sending any PK card to GY (I prefer Ancient Cloak, but it doesn't really matter at this point, since you've already activated Cloak, Boots, and Scales' abilities) then setting Fog Blade directly from your deck.   ---(Credit to the many Orcust players before me:) on your opponent's turn, you can banish Cymbal Skeleton from GY (quick effect, because of Babel) to special summon Dingirsu to a zone Rusty Bardiche is pointing to, which allows you to both pop a card (Rusty) and send a card on the field (Dingirsu)---</li>  	<li>Then you activate the still face-down Shade Brigandine, using him and your Girsu to Synchro summon Borreload Savage. Equip Cherubini to him from your grave, giving him 2 negates and 250 additional attack--note, you could use Galatea to give him more attack, but unless you're playing dinosaurs or trains or something, it should be fine at that, in addition to the fact that Galatea is better to have in grave. Feel free to use her, though.</li> </ol> So we've got an omni negate, a monster negate, and two pops. Not ridiculously amazing, but should be able to shut down your opponent. Now yes, a nibiru or an ash, or even a ghost ogre could damage this, (i admit it) so chances of this combo going off are small. Even if they hit it partway through, though, it wouldn't be too hard to set up an acceptable end board (something similar to the first and second combo)  You could go into Dragoon if you're willing to play more bricks and take up a couple more extra deck slots (instead of Savage) but honestly I find myself drawing too many bricks already, not to mention the fact that I feel like a terrible person every time I summon him. On that same happy note, there's not really an excuse to play Mystic Mine in this deck since Babel's going to be taking up the field spell space, so there's still hope for your soul :)  --I've actually slowed down on the pure PK Orcust style, and started adding Shaddoll cards--being able to send <a data-name=""Reeshaddoll Wendi"">Reeshaddoll Wendi off of Cherubini is actually pretty broken, plus there are some sweet 2-card combos where you can end on Rusty and Winda. (I have a nasty tendency of turning any control deck into a combo one) Anyway, if any of y'all have suggestions for that, or just this deck, please feel free to say something.</a>  Anyway, if you read all that I'd be very surprised. Peace out, lads"

AKA the worst deck possible.,"So, I've been binging 5d's now and I think Greiger's a cool character, so here's a deck utilizing Reactors. I decided to add in a Machina engine to make plays easier to do, mainly getting a body on field to summon Summon Reactor because level 5 go brrrrrrrrr. If you can't tell by now, Reactor's are horrible. They don't even negate. To make them as ""playable"" as possible, i added a few bandaids of sorts. I added Machina's to get more bodies on board, so you can go into more links and such or tribute for Summon. I also added Mystic Mine in case you're in a situation where you're just sitting on 1 monster against a spam combo deck, and Double Summon, to get multiple Reactors or normal summonable Machina's on board along with Reactors. I made this deck in more of a going 1st control focus, so I added a good few traps for that. I wanted to include more, but I had no space. You can include more in the side deck tho. This deck sucks but, it was the best I could think of. Also, this made me realize Machina's are a great engine. I think i'll try them out more."

I focused the main board for going first, the schism play catches a lot of people off guard turn 1; I have sideboard extra deck cards when you need to go second because winda is only viable going first and you want extra plays for Zeus going second. The ideal end board turn 1 for this deck is Drident, Maximus, Winda floodgate, a monster negate, and 2-3 pops with eldlich and punishment/n'tss. Omega is the mvp of this deck, you want to constantly send him off with maximus to recur your extra deck. I have ash blossom in place of gamma because I found that gamma wasn't live nearly as much as I would have liked it to be, but you could opt to side out ash for gamma because it protects a lot of your starters like nadir or eldland. I focused the sideboard on blowouts for going second, as well as a couple of answers to the current meta. It isn't a cheap deck but if you have the cards I would highly recommend trying this out, the deck plays really well."

He actually turned into a pretty cool dude over the course of GX ngl. Anyway, this is a going second OTK styled deck around Ancient Gears. This deck is mainly centered around summoning out the fusions as fast as possible, the main one being Megaton golem, as it's the most generic and accesible of the fusions. I also included a small Cyber Dragon package with Chimeratech, to remove bodies from the board and get a beater on the field.  Limiter Removal is also there to make OTKs way easier, but it is unsearchable sadly. Additionally, this deck is pretty consisent due to the huge amount of searching S/T and on summon searching monsters, but if going first you could potentially brick on Anchient Gear Golem and/or Cyber Dragon so be wary of that. Cyber Dragon can be sided out for Dark Hole, as Dark Hole triggers your own monster effs. Fun fact: The reason Heavy Storm is still banned is because it would make Ancient Gears tier 0 : )"

What Cubics like to do is bring out their boss monster Crimson Nova the dark Cubic lord who basically there once they have him out tries to go for an otk. They bring him out by showing 3 Cubic cards from your hand with different names so that you can special summon him, this is not a once per turn effect and he can reveal a second copy of himself to bring him out. You do need to search him out tho which you can do that by sending their spell cards to the grave. What their spell cards like to do is banish them selves from your graveyard in order to add a cubic monster from your deck to your hand or a Cubic monster from your graveyard to your hand. How will you send them to the grave though you may ask. the easiest way is by using foolish burial goods but there are more ways than just that. You can also use reasoning in order to get a special summon and mill some cards though unlike most cubic decks mine has more monsters that can be normal summoned so its a bit less useful than others but still great if u get lucky but usually u just want it for the summon and a chance to get some spells milled. We also have summoned monk though probably the best way to get the spells in the graveyard. When you normal summon him he goes to defense mode but by discarding a spell you can special summon 1 level 4 monster from your deck which you will want to summon Duza. What Duza does is when he is normal or special summoned you can send a Cubic card from the deck to the grave. Also if that spell you discarded was cubic karma then you can get 2 free searches off of the 1 summoner monk. You can also use the danger monsters to discard spells into your grave. If you did look at the list though I bet you are wondering why I have Zoodiac Drident in there. Well if I were to use mind control or crackdown on a Zoodiac monster I could use it. If that were the only use though I probably wouldn't use in in here. That is why I also like to take the monster to go into Verte Andaconda and if u wanna add Dragoon then you can use it for that but I use it in here so that I can special summon a free starving venom or another super poly target but its most likely gonna be venom dragon cause you can use the effect to also change one of your opponent's monsters into a dark. Since you used an opponent's monster for that summon as well though you just took out 2 of their monsters and still have your 2 monsters in case you also wanna go into a unicorn and remove more stuff and get a cubic spell discard for a search. We also play accesscode talker just cause it's a great card same with Apollousa. Underworld goddess in case we already used super poly. The knightmare cards we play just because they are great as well. Other than the Zoodiac and Superdreadnought though the rest of the monsters in extra can be whatever. I just put in some rank 4s that can deal with a lot of stuff depending on the situation. Dark Rebellion if I need to beat over something real quick, Number 41 if I need to stall for just a minute and Castel if I need to bounce a monster. Now that I say it though why would I want to use Superdreadnought? We use him so that we don't accidently lose from our own cards let me explain. Our boss monster Crimson Nova the Dark Cubic lord has an effect where any time we end our turn he will deal 3000 damage to both players. Sometimes though you wont have that life to spare but he doesn't care. So you can use Superdreadnought so you dint die and deal 2000 damage plus that can win games for you if you somehow brought out 3 Crimson Nova and your opponent is still not dead that will seal the deal. What do you guys think about this deck though. If you guys want more deck profiles like this though you can check me out on youtube as Kuriboh Gaming and when I hit 100 subscribers I'm going to start making deck lists daily. If you have any decks you want me to try to make comment on a video and I will be happy to post a video on it with a side deck as well."

Aleister core:  3x because you can fusion everything in your hand, if you wanted to, if you posses the required materials in hand of course. The sole purpose of this build is making everything as effeciently as possible.  Eldlich core:  Kinda standard playing, but i opped for the triple eldlich because getting idp sucks:).  The trickstar engine:  Thats your verte anaconda turbo and sacky materials for the mechaba.  If everything plays out, you have a extra disruption (lightstage) in your turn and play 6 cards less in your deck which boosts consistency.  Red eyes engine:  Its dragoon why not play him..  Disclaimers:  i added some disruption trap cards but feel free to play around with this. It works great for myself, baiting out negates from a opponents dragoon or/and clearing troublesome cards for example etc etc.  Extra deck:  Caliga, mechaba and dragoon are your priority but the rest of the invoked monsters and artemis, invoker of madness are crazy good aswell.  Elysium is mental when you need to get rid of troublesome monsters in the grind game.  The generic xyz package for eldlich with zeus for extra spice.  Anaconda because anaconda  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This and other things have became a passionate hobby to me so in this context the  Paleozoic Frog deck appear to me the most.  The Paleozoic card are almost an ideal representation of  animals that once lived on Earth( on the  Cambrian Period), so well detail  which got me in love. So enough about boring stuffs and let's get into the deck.  &nbsp;  <span>One to rules them All</span>  The paleozoic  Frog  is a strategy  based in a control type of deck using traps ( and occasionally handtraps) as the main resource of such action. The majority of Paleozoic archetype are trap <span>cards</span>  with a variety of effects, while having a gimmick to summon themself as a monster (AQUA levEl 2 , 1200 ATK/ 0 DEF) in a CL1 with a trap. Frogs are leval 2 AQUA monster which have the abillity to sworm the field fast as they can, while aiming to go for the big guy of their archetype Toadally Awesome (what a goof name), a Rank 2 aqua monster with a totatlly awsome omni negate effect.  Both engine were born to be together, they are so complementary for each other that makes a fearsome rogue strategy.  <span>Who is who on Cruj (a silly brazilian joke)</span>  <span>Frogs everywhere</span>  <span> 3x <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a>: Our silly boy , swap frog is the heart and soul for the frog engine. First of all , the first effect ( a frog's  Foolish burial when it's summoned) is not  once per turn, so you can bounce itself for a additional Gy set up,  like  a <a data-name=""Ronnintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a> and a  <a data-name=""Dupe frog"">Dupe frog</a>. You can even use<a data-name=""Toadally Awesome""> Toadally Awesome</a> effect to summon Swap frog from deck  to extend you plays to go in a second Toadally Awesome.</span>  3x <a data-name=""Dupe frog"">Dupe frog</a>: A control's  graduated, this cute little frog is our food for <a data-name=""Swap frog"">Swap frog</a> and<a data-name=""  Ronnintoadin"">  Ronintoadin</a>  to work well. It has a second major effect  to add a frog monster to your hand from deck which is good also because you can use it to go in a link monster  (<a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> or <a data-name=""Mista boy"">Mista boy</a>)  2x <a data-name=""Ronnintoadin"">Ron</a><a data-name=""Ronnintoadin"">intoadin</a> : This wanna-be samurai can be summon fron your  Gy banning  a  frog card and that's not a once per turn effect. The sworm ability  of this card are incredibly.  3x <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>: A XYZ monster with so much power. These little bastards can detach  a material to summon a frog from deck , tribute an Aqua monster to negate ANY effect and  if  they go to Gy , can recover a  water monster( itself or  other another frog). The scariest part is that none of theses effects are ""hard"" once per turn ( in other word, if you have more the one on field you can use  this effect again), making this card a fearsome entity. If  you have<a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder""> Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a>, this card becomes  even more Scariest.  &nbsp;  <span>Honorary Frogs</span>  2x <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a>: An Idol makes an apperance in this deck. She is a brillant extender, you can  use <a data-name=""Swap frog""> Swap frog </a>to send <a data-name=""Dupe frog"">Dupe frog</a> to GY , bounce itself to send a <a data-name=""Ronnintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a>  to Gy, use the <a data-name=""Ronnintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a> to summon it  and go into  Marincess Coral Anemone summon again <a data-name=""Swap frog"">Swap frog</a> from Gy. using another time it effect  to send another  dupe frog to bring Ronintoadin once more to go into <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>... phew... <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> is insane...  1x <a data-name=""Mista boy"">Mista boy</a>: one of the elemental links , it can boost <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> and if goes to gy , recover any water monster.  1x <a data-name=""Cat Shark"">Cat Shark</a> : A rank 2 XYZ cute fellow can boost even more the atk of <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>.  &nbsp;  <span>Cambrian period</span>  2x <a data-name=""Paleozoic Pikaia"">Paleozoic Pikaia</a> : <i><b>Pikaia </b></i> is an extinct, primitive  animal known from the Middle Cambrian that looks like a Eel.

Our  Canadia is a Bool of  moon in a trap card form, flipping any non link monster as you like  to stop our disturb any link, synchro ou XYZ plays. This is not as impact outrageous as a  Solemn Strike,however it breaks the  tempo of you opponent and this is the most importat thing.  3x <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a> : <i><b>Dinomischus</b> </i>is a rare fossil animal from the Cambrian period, looking like a  actinia or  a Jellyfish offspring. Our Dinomischus is a insane card that can banish any face-up card of the field and, like  Pikaia,  can set hte  Gy with any card. Removing from play an  Eldlich or a Zoo is what makes this deck scare.  3x <a data-name=""Paleozoic Olenoides"">Paleozoic Olenoides</a>:<i><b>Olenoides</b></i> was a trilobite(<b>Trilobites</b>  means ""three lobes"" are a group of extinct marine artiopodan arthropods, looking like <span>Woodlouse</span>) from the Cambrian period. Our Olenoides will destroy any spell/trap card on field. No flood gates like mystic mine or  There can be only one, just perfect  2x <a data-name=""Paleozoic Opabinia"">Paleozoic Opabinia</a>:<i><b>Opabinia regalis</b></i> is an extinct, <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Stem group"">stem group</a> arthropod found in the Middle Cambrian ,was a soft-bodied animal, averaging about 5.7 cm in length (excluding proboscis), and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail, looking like a alien crab or a giant shrimp. Our Opabinia, a XYZ monster can add any paleozoic card  from deck to your hand and also makes any Paleozoic trap carda an hand Trap.

Powered Jersey can easily otk  <strong>2x U.A. Blockbacker - </strong>Though powercrept by Link Monsters, it is a 1 time use bagooska. Can be cut to 1  <strong>2x U.A.

I decided to make an Ancient Gear OTK version because I love them and i'm a Crowler simp. Anyway, this is a IRL build so it's missing some stuff like Verte. It's as budget friendly as possible and just desgined to use cards that are A) cheap or B) that I already own. This is a variant focused towards blind second  OTKing, using big beater fusions and some really annoying to out Machina's. The Ancient Gear part of it is incredibly consisent with on summon searchers and such, and the Machina part helps a ton with field swarming. I also included generic hand traps and Dark Ruler No More for blind seconding. Have fun!"

Even though I did catch up, I'm still pissed because I could have gotten literally anything else done besides this, like going outside and living a life. Anyways, lets get into to it:</span>  <span>I couldn't stand the thought that Calamities being banned meant that pure scraps were unplayable. ""Level 9 Synchros were their whole thing! What now?""</span>  <span>Then I remembered that I can summon the Simorgh link in Scraps thanks to Scrap Searcher</span>  <span>Before we talk about that let's start off with the basics:</span> <p><span>What Do Scraps do exactly?</span></p> <span>If you don't know what they do already despite being a well known engine in machine decks, soon to be even more well known when Scrap Raptor comes along, I really don't know what to say. To some it up, they are basically the older synchro brother of Unchaineds and Fire Kings, except some of the effects only go off when they are destroyed by other Scrap monsters. Of course, they make up for this by having one card that Fire Kings, Unchained, and every other self-destruct archetype wish they had, Scrap Searcher</span> <p><span>What is Scrap Searcher?</span></p> <span>Scrap searcher is not a searcher, but it is a really good card that summons itself from the grave when a Scrap monster is destroyed, besides Scrap Searcher. The good thing about this effect is that it is not a hard once per turn, so if you have 2 of these in your grave, you can get off this effect up to 6 times a turn, which is funny when you do it. It also helps you avoid ash sense you can use it to chain block some effects that would summon monsters from the deck. Not to mention the fact that it is also a winged beast monster, so we can use it summon 'Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty' for cards like Apex Avian and Wind Barrier Statue (That's right, Bird up 2! Electric Boogaloo)</span> <p><span>How will you protect the barrier statue?</span></p> <p><span><span>Well, their are two ways:</span></span></p>  <ol>  	<li><span>We summon Drident and use its effect (Daniel)</span></li>  	<li><span>We can use Cloudcastle's second effect (the cooler Daniel)</span></li> </ol> <span>Cloud castle is a level 9 synchro well known for being used in Virtual World decks because it is able to reuse XX-Saber Gottems to hand loop your opponent. Scraps can do this as well, but they also make use of Cloudcastle's forgotten second effect: being able to prevent level 8 or lower monsters from attacking the turn they are normal or special summoned. This makes it so unless our opponent can normal summon a level 9 or higher monster Or special summon a level 9 or higher wind monster, they will be unable to attack wind barrier statue, thus the lock is safe. Plus, we can rip two cards from their hand with Gottems which can sometimes help us avoid things like Dark Ruler No More.</span> <p><span>What if the Opponent is actually playing a Wind Deck?</span></p> <span>Every deck needs a back up strategy in case their stun fails. Unless you're playing Evilswarms and Monarchs, in which case, your back up plan is 'even more stun.' Scraps back up combo gives you up to 3 negates in the case that your opponent is running an actual wind deck, so it is very adaptable. The board will have Admancipator Risen - Dragite, Borreload Savage Dragon, and Apex Avain. I'm pretty sure that will be enough to deal with all the pure wind decks we currently have out there.</span> <p><span>The Deck's Playmakers</span></p> <p><span>(skip if you're already know how scraps work)</span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>Scrap Golem: Poster boy of the deck. Your goal is to summon him as many times as possible to abuse his No-HOPT revival effect. Sadly The last place you want him is in the hand sense two of our cards can summon him from the deck. We run three begrudgingly because if we ran 2 and draw into even 1 of them, our combos are severely hampered.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Factory: the field spell. When a scrap monster is destroyed by a card effect, you can immediately summon another. You will almost always be summoning Scrap Golem. If not, then probably raptor or scrap searcher.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Wyvern: every now and again Konami releases a single, bloated card for a random, old archetype that no one remembers. This either does nothing for the deck cause it needed way more than 1 card (Cloudians) or raises the deck to rouge/local status for a time (Volcanics). This card is the latter. It revives a scrap monster in exchange for a card and acts as a scrap factory in exchange for a card (including your opponent's). This card feels like Sunlight Wolf in a way. On one hand, it's attack and link rating are way too low for it to be a boss monster, but Just like a boss it screams at your opponent ""If I go off, your probably dead."" If you're running out of wyverns in the extra deck, pop a Scrap Goblin and recycle one.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Raptor: Remember that random, single card I was talking about? Scraps got that card twice. It gives you an additional normal summon while setting off cards like factory and searcher, then searchers a card. Scrap raptor is your starter and not opening with it means your turn may be slightly awkward, which is perfectly fine sense Scraps an awkward archetype already.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Chimera: Zero to Hero, just like that. Scrap Raptor being a tuner that gives you a second normal summon is exactly what was needed for this card to be good. If you don't open up with Factory/Raptor, Chimera/Raptor will do just fine sense Raptor searches Factory.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrapyard/Fossil dig: Searches Raptor. That's it, simple and efficient.</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Why I run:</span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>Tri-brigade Fraktall: Scrap searcher is able to be sent to the grave through Fraktall. Doing so before you play any of your scraps will force your opponent to use their ash blossom if they have one, otherwise we can chain scrap searcher's effect as the final effect in most chains of monsters with in our deck, so our cards like Scrap Wyvern, Scrap Factory, and Scrap Raptor will be safe. </span></li>  	<li><span>Fire formation Tenki: Searches Fraktall and can be popped with scrap wyvern instead of factory or a monster. </span></li>  	<li><span>Infinite Impermanence: a literal hand trap is great thing to have. In emergencies we can set this card and pop it with wyvern, which will help save a monster to ensure our plays can continue.</span></li>  	<li><span>Phantazmay: we don't like to see quite a few cards in our hand with this deck. Luckily this card can shuffle those monsters back in to the deck so we can summon them later while giving us better cards to play with.</span></li>  	<li><span>Wynn the wind charmer, Verdant: so you can link away the barrier statue when it's time</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Why I don't run:</span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>Scrap Recycler: Scraps have no good machine monsters. The only way I could add good machine monsters in here without bricking it up any worse is by making the deck less synchro based, which is something I don't personally want to do. Also, Scrap Raptor is searchable by two unlimited spells. That's 9-8 starters practically, any more than that is overkill.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap dragon: You can replace Drident and Chakanine with Scrap dragon and Bagooska if you want. Bagooska is sometimes a nice back up option if wyvern is negated and makes the wind barrier statue much more of a pain to deal with. Drident, however, can allow us to combine both main end boards occasionally, so the deck ends up having a higher ceiling.</span></li>  	<li><span>Rank 9/Second cloud castle: Overkill and too much extra deck devotion.</span></li>  	<li><span>More hand traps: If you feel the absolute need to main 2 more handtraps or the 2 Forbidden Droplets you 'borrowed' from your friend, you can replace One for One and Monster Reborn. They aren't as important as one might think.</span></li>  	<li><span>Accesscode: Borrelsword feels like a much better card in this deck. With 1 scrap golem on your field and your opponent's field empty, you can inflict 8300 damage. With Accesscode, only up to 7600 lp, not enough to otk. Plus if you plan to build the deck IRL when raptor comes out, it's much cheaper, and the deck already has pretty decent board breakers in the form of Scrap Twin Dragon and Wyvern. That's my opinion though. If you prefer Accesscode, well go ahead and run it then, no ones stopping you.</span></li>  	<li><span>Supply squad: Bro wake up, it's 2015 again. In all seriousness though, Grind game decks that destroy monsters during every turn, including their opponent's, can turn this card into a pot of greed, so Fire Kings and Machinas can use this. This is a combo deck that only destroys during their own turn, and they are no longer as good as a grind deck sense they don't have many consistent control options. As result, this card is just to slow for it to be any use.</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Cards I wish I could run:</span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>Trishula</span><span>: </span><span>It is very easy to summon this card in this deck, but sadly XX-Saber Gottoms is just so much easier to use.</span></li>  	<li><span>Adamancipator Signs: Scrap golem is a rock monster. Before scrap raptor was announced I could summon Golem with signs, allowing the deck to somewhat function properly. But with Scrap raptor, we can use scrap factory consistently, so there is no longer a reason to use signs.</span></li>  	<li><span>The tricky: I tested it in the deck, and it was a very interesting card. It could summon itself by sending a monster to the grave, which allowed cards like Searcher, Golem, and Goblin to be brought back later. Plus it was level 5 so I could easily use it for synchros. If scraps do get an additional card soon, I would love for it to be similar to the tricky except with destroying a card instead of sending one</span></li> </ul> <p><span>The Niches each card has</span></p> <p><span>(skip if you want to regret losing to sacred beast that one time)</span></p> <span>Scraps have some weird interactions, so here's a small guide on them:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Scrap storm: if your opponent is about to use Effect Veiler or Impermanence on your monster, this card will be your saving grace. It can target a Scrap monster you control and destroy it, saving them from effect negation, and it draws a card while putting a Scrap Searcher in the grave. On top of that, you can use it on your opponent's turn in combo with Scrap Wyvern by targeting another Scrap monster you control, allowing you to go plus three by using Wyvern's effect and pop a card your opponent controls, but this is a much slower strategy we don't normally use.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Orthros: If your Chimera or Raptor get's hit with a Impermanence or Effect Veiler, You can summon this card while Searcher is in the grave and Scrap Factory is on the field to set off their effects and continue your plays. We run one sense it's searchable by Scrapyard</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Searcher's second effect: Scrap Searcher has a second effect that blows up all your monsters besides Scrap monsters when it's summoned. This may be painful for us, but with Scrap Golem, we summon it to our opponent's field and nuke it. This also get's around cards like I:P Masquerena or Marincess Battle Ocean because Searcher is on their field so it's technically their own card.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Goblin's second effect: It can not be destroyed by battle, but if it is attacked in defense position, it will be destroyed at the end of the battle phase. By summoning it to our opponent's field in attack position, we can attack it as though we're attacking directly. This effect can also come in handy when our opponent uses cards like summon limit or majesty's fiend. For summon limit, because it blows itself up with an effect, we can then summon Scrap Searchers from the grave for tribute fodder next turn for Scrap Golem and then up their field with the Searcher combo from earlier and you can add chimera back to the hand to resummon goblin. As for majesty's fiend? Scrap Goblin's effect is a forced activation, but is an activation none the less, so it won't even blow itself up at the end of the battle phase. I know these are very small niches, but they give the deck some hope it can stall out until you top deck a miracle.</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Mind Set </span></p> <p><span>(also known as the pep talk)</span></p> <span>Listen, if you're looking for a deck that always has some easy pathways, this is not your deck. You will get hands that look terrible. You may just have to tribute summon Golem. You may have to dump Goblin to the grave instead of Searcher just to use Chimera. It's painful when in it happens, but the fun in this deck is overcoming those moments and using those janky plays to your advantage. And the best part: you can constantly evolve this deck. If you don't like the objective of this deck, that's fine, you can run Scrap Recycler and add in stuff like Machina Colonel or the Kaiju engine to make it much more aggressive. Insert Topologic Bomber dragon Along with the Gizmek Orochi for a quick field nuke. Maybe try mixing it with another archetype and see how well that does. There's no 'right' way to build a Scrap deck, this is just my preferred method. So, if you find some interesting tech that gives this deck the 'edge' that it needs, don't be shy to test it. </span>  <span>With that in mind, h</span><span>ere's a video that shows off a couple of decent combos to get you started because I can't be bothered to write them out (sorry for bad sound quality):</span> <p><span>2 Card Combos</span></p> https://youtu.be/5z7qInHse7s"

I think that I will likely be playing BA for the rest of this format now. <h1>About the Deck:</h1> Burning Abyss is a very interesting deck seeing that it has been fairly relevant for it's entire life since back in the duelist alliance era of Yugioh. The BA monsters all work by being able to either special summon themselves from the hand if you control no backrow, or they can gain an effect upon being sent to the graveyard. This along with all the main deck monsters being level 3 dark fiends has lead to the deck being able to be played in a great variety of ways, some opt to use these cards as combo pieces in 3-axis style combo decks (decks that combo using primarily level 3 monsters) such as Phantom Knights and a variant of the current best deck of the format Dragon Link. The BAs have also been used as a very strong control engine, by being able to constantly generate and maintain card advantage by using the ""floating"" effects of the BA monsters to be able to have a constant resource loop in an attempt to out-grind your opponent, this second version of the deck is what the focus of this list. <h1>The Decklist:</h1> <h2>Main Deck:</h2> <h3>Monsters:</h3> 2x <a data-name=""Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This is one of the best cards in this deck, it allows you to revive another BA when sent to the grave, this can be used to great effect as a resource loop alongside their rank 3 monster which we will get to later.  3x <a data-name=""Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This is one hell of a card, being able to float into a BA from deck is just so strong for furthering your plays as well as making just getting you off to the races to begin with.  2x <a data-name=""Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This can search a level 3 dark fiend during the end phase of the turn it was sent to the graveyard, this can allow you to set up plays for the next turn, or give you fodder for some of your trap cards.  2x <a data-name=""Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This is pretty great removal for the deck because sending this off of some of your traps can gain them extra mileage, it's weakness being that it does target.  1x <a data-name=""Alich, Malebranche of the Burning Abys"">Alich, Malebranche of the Burning Abys</a>s - This is a similar card to farfa, but it negates instead of banishes.  1x <a data-name=""Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This can float into summoning a BA from hand, it's not all that great, but good enough to run at 1.  1x <a data-name=""Calcab, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Calcab, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This isn't all that great of a card, but because of the the other control deck running amok in this format, it's good to be running one for when you need it.  3x <a data-name=""Tour Guide From the Underworld"">Tour Guide From the Underworld </a>- This is the best level 3 fiend support card in the game, it just fetches you a level 3 from deck, this can be the most useful card in your deck.  3x <a data-name=""Fiendish Rhino Warrior"">Fiendish Rhino Warrior</a> - This card is mainly used for it's second effect to send a fiend from deck to grave, but it's first effect can be useful at times if you don't want your BAs to blow themselves up.  1x <a data-name=""Absolute King Back Jack"">Absolute King Back Jack</a> - This card is a very useful card in trap heavy decks such as this, seeing as it can stack your deck as well as set a trap from the top of your deck. <h3>Spells:</h3> 1x <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> - This card is really strong since it can insulate you from handtraps as well as be a very good source of interruption on your opponent's turn, but it's at one so you play as many as you can, but right now that's one. (please bring this back to three)  3x <a data-name=""Mask Change II"">Mask Change II </a>- This is a kinda instant win button against most decks that you resolve it against, Dark Law is one hell of a card.  3x <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force</a> - This is really funny in combination with some other cards to make a really funny VFD. <h3>Traps:</h3> 3x <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> - This card just looks at your opponent's card and say boldly and loudly ""NO!"", it's life point cost does not matter much in the modern game, and being able to negate key cards such as a feather duster or the summon of a major combo piece of a deck is just really strong.  3x <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike </a>- This is for the combo decks that Judgement can't handle, mainly monster effects, this along with the next card are also good at securing some plays against big bosses  3x <a data-name=""Fiend Comedian"">Fiend Comedian</a> - This is a very interesting card, most coin-flip cards are just awful, but this one is very interesting seeing as both of it's effects are actually beneficial to you; either you get to banish your opponent's entire grave, or you get to mill cards that could give you advantage in other ways.  3x <a data-name=""Fiend Griefing"">Fiend Griefing</a> - This is kinda similar to the above card, but toned down and without the coin-flip. Sending a BA to the grave to then banish a card in your opponent's grave is very strong right now.  3x <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> - This card can be a great equalizer against decks that like to overextend, just slapping this down and watching as your opponent's whole board disintegrates into nothing is just so good.  3x <a data-name=""Needle Ceiling"">Needle Ceiling</a> - Similar to torrential due to how it can just evaporate a board, this one can be used at any time so long a there are 4 monsters on the field. It is certainly not quite torrential, but it's very good.  3x <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus </a>- This is a very good versatile removal card, the discard can trigger your BAs and getting it  back from the grave has many uses  3x <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick </a>- This is like Back Jack in the way that it lets you set a trap from deck and use it that turn, so it's basically three extra copies of every other trap in the deck. <h2>Extra Deck:</h2> 2x <a data-name=""Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss</a> - This is the key rank 3 of the deck, being able to mill a bunch of cards and float into a recycle is very nice and it what enables most of your plays.  1x <a data-name=""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss </a>- This card is also just amazing; being able to send a level 3 to the grave as well as protecting your BAs is a very useful card to have.  1x <a data-name=""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"">Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal</a> - This is the main ""boss monster"" of this deck if it really had one, the ability to quick effect mill any card is just so good, and so is floating into a BA from the extra deck.  1x <a data-name=""Dante, Pilgrim of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Pilgrim of the Burning Abyss</a> - This is an okay card, the best option to float into with Beatrice's effect and that's about it.  1x <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dark Law"">Masked HERO Dark Law</a> - You summon this with Mask Change II and get free wins against most of the meta right now.  1x <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a> - This is a strong negate that can also protect you from handtraps.  1x <a data-name=""Number 48: Shadow Lich"">Number 48: Shadow Lich</a> - This is useful for a detach during your opponent's turn as well as giving a token for link plays.  1x <a data-name=""Mechquipped Angineer"">Mechquipped Angineer</a> - This is a stepping stone to use astral force on for the next card  1x <a data-name=""Number 67: Pair-a-Dice Smasher"">Number 67: Pair-a-Dice Smasher</a> - This card is VFD, but really funny. I honestly love this card and with a PK deck topping with it, I just had to make it fit.  1x <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> - This is used to close out games as a finisher to go in for lethal.  1x <a data-name=""Topologic Trisbaena"">Topologic Trisbaena </a>- This can be used with some other cards to get rid of your opponent's backrow.  1x <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> - Strong generic removal/interruption.  1x <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> - Can be used to link off the dinomisc or to get rid of tokens your opponent has given to use with <a data-name=""Lost World"">Lost World</a>.  1x <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena </a>- You use this to go into unicorn during your opponent's turn to get an interruption. <h2>Side Deck:</h2> <h3>Monsters:</h3> 3x <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> - This is a good handtrap to combat most of the meta right now <h3>Spells:</h3> 1x <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> - This is a blowout against any other backrow focused deck, and should really be in any side deck. <h3>Traps:</h3> 1x <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order </a>- This is another blowout card that can win you the game on the spot against the right deck.  2x <a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance</a> - This is to help you not get blown out by HFD or anything like that.  3x <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a> - More generic backrow outs, but this can also get rid of/play under order.  3x <a data-name=""Witch's Strike"">Witch's Strike</a> - This is typically considered a bad card, but as of late it seen some play and been kinda great when you can resolve it.  2x <a data-name=""Broken Line"">Broken Line</a> - It's an ok card for going second against decks that play big boss monsters. <h1>The Sacrifices:</h1> Some cards are just too expensive for a more budget focused deck, and some I simply don't really like.  <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a> - This is the best xyz monster in the game, but it's not cheap as a result.  <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> - This is one of the best link monsters in the game, also very pricey  <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity </a>- This is also an insane card that happens to be really expensive  <a data-name=""The dragoon package"">The dragoon package</a> -<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon""> Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> is an insane card, but not only does that come at a cost, it also makes you run quite a few garnets  <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison </a>- Is one of the best traps in the game, however it's not cheap in the slightest. <h1>Potential Techs:</h1> <h2>Predaplant engine:</h2> <span>(3x <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a>, 3x <a data-name=""Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio"">Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</a>, 1x <a data-name=""Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra"">Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</a>, 1x <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>, &amp; 1x DARK LV3 Fiend fusion monster)</span>  This engine gives you a bunch of level three bodies to work with seeing as you have 6 ""starters"" for the engine with one brick and a generically good extender. The problem I face with this is just that it takes your normal summon, and takes up too much space to be really worth it in a slower BA variant. <h2>Phantom Knights Engine:</h2> (1x <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a>, 1x <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a>, 1x <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>, 2x <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a>, &amp; 1x <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a>)  To be honest I love PK Fire as a deck, but seeing as this is a more pure variant, alongside the fact that you are making the deck a fair bit less consistent, you also are running a lot more high impact traps that just do more than fog blade under most cases. <h2>Other BA Cards:</h2> <a data-name=""Barbar, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Barbar, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This was used in the topping decklist, however I don't like it simply because it's only real use is to burn your opponent in time, I'd rather just run a name at that point honestly  <a data-name=""Fire Lake of the Burning Abyss"">Fire Lake of the Burning Abyss </a>- This is an okay card, but it does take two BAs to use and it also is just a less generic less powerful torrential or needle ceiling in most cases.  <a data-name=""Virgil, Rock Star of the Burning Abyss"">Virgil, Rock Star of the Burning Abyss</a> - This is also a pretty good card, but it is outclassed by Knightmare Unicorn under most circumstances, the best use for this card would be to use in the tzolkin engine maybe <h2>Other Random Tech Pieces:</h2> <a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a> - This card is very good due to the great amount of disruption, but also play extension it can bring, however, it also can proc BAs at the worst possible time, and if that happens it's not so good.  <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>  - A really strong blowout handtrap against most combo decks, but it doesn't do much else, nor does it completely end the turn of those decks always.  <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter </a>- It's a very good card, but after some testing I think lancea is better  <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> - Another big blowout card against some decks, it is very good, but alongside not being the cheapest (but still doable) a lot of the top decks either don't care about it, or can effectively play around it  <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment </a>- Playing this alongside some choice extra deck cards could be very good, but I'm not sure how good it would be.  <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops </a>- This is a great going second card, but with it at one you don't see it enough for it to matter.  <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a> - Great against dragon link, but I'm not too sure how good a free body and cycling you hand really is. <h1>A Small Playing Guide:</h1> Mostly the play this deck makes aren't super substantial enough to need a combo guide, however there are some card interactions you should know for reference. <h2>Dante and Cir, the Heart &amp; Soul of the Deck:</h2> One of the most basic interactions that the deck makes the most of, for this you need to at first have a cir attached to Dante as material. When Dante is sent to the grave for any reason, you can use cir to bring back Dante and Dante can put cir back in hand. This allows for a resource loop that can gather a ton of advantage over the course of a game to really grind out your opponent. <h2>Fiend Griefing, an Example of Pure Utility:</h2> Fiend Griefing is a card the provides a ton of utility for the deck, being able to mill any fiend to the grave as well as ridding your opponent of valuable grave resources is a very strong thing. The cards you can mill off of this can create either massive swings in advantage for you, or can create additional pieces of disruption that your opponent will then have to deal with. If you want more setup, you can mill graff to fetch any BA from deck, cir to get something from the graveyard, scarm to get a tour guide during the end phase, or in some cases libic to get something out of your hand. To go for the disruption route you can send farfa to banish, alich to negate, or back jack to tutor out a trap from the top of your deck that you can use that turn. <h2>Must Outs! Cards That Create Big Problems:</h2> Some cards in this deck can create massive issues for you opponent, forcing them to use their outs on it, these are cards like Dark Law. With how strong effects that can lock your opponent from the graveyard are, if you drop one of these you basically get to say ""If you want to play this turn, use your removal to out this"". If your opponent doesn't have an answer for these cards, they can be huge problems, but these can also be used to bait out any negations or other outs that may be otherwise used on other pieces of your deck. <h2>Big Tempo Swings with Gossip Shadow:</h2> Gossip Shadow is another great utility card, being able to negate monsters from the hand or field can lead to some devastating pushes in tempo a fair amount of the time. However, be aware that this negation comes at a disadvantage in being able to let your opponent draw a card, meaning that you should not use this on one for one trades, you basically have to use this against big haymaker cards, or cards that go into an inherent minus to either gain a large tempo swing or to set plays up. This draw effect does have some upsides too, such as not negating the activation itself meaning it will waste any hard OPT effects, the draw also applies for you too, so that can also be a big swing for you. <h2>Against The Meta:</h2> Any deck worth it's salt has to at least be aware of how it stacks up against the current heavy hitters in the format, so that is what we will be exploring next. <h3>Dragon Link:</h3> This deck is currently the king of this format, but this deck's playstyle is something that dragons aren't fully equipped to deal with, yes they can hit some of your monsters and maybe a single trap, but set five pass is just something the deck can't always deal with.  Cards to side in: <ul>  	<li>Lancea</li>  	<li>Witch's Strike</li>  	<li>order</li> </ul> <h3>Eldlich:</h3> This deck has a fairly reasonable match-up against this deck, because of all the graveyard hate you play it can steamroll Eld in several cases, but you will never out grind eldlich it's the best control deck for a reason, to win this match-up you HAVE to use one of your unfair haymakers like Dark Law to stop their recursion all together.  Cards to side in: <ul>  	<li>lancea</li>  	<li>anti-spell</li>  	<li>waking the dragon</li>  	<li>order</li>  	<li>all backrow removal</li> </ul> <h2>Dogmatika/Invoked/Shaddoll:</h2> I'm grouping these decks together because they have a lot of the same weaknesses as each other, as well as all three being blended in with each other frequently. These decks do rely a lot on the graveyard, as well as key cards they have to resolve throughout the course of their plays, if you can hit those two aspects of the deck, then you are in good shape.  Cards to side in: <ul>  	<li>order</li>  	<li>backrow removal</li>  	<li>anti-spell</li>  	<li>Witch's strike</li> </ul> <h2>Dino DNA:</h2> Misc is a broken card, but this deck does have ways to still try to interact with dinos, for instance misc does not also block effects from the graveyard, so bread and butter traps like griefing and comedian still can give your opponent trouble, also gossip shadow can hit the as it activates from the hand if need be. Misc also only protects from activated effects, this means anything continuous can also get the job done.  Cards to side: <ul>  	<li>lancea</li>  	<li>order</li>  	<li>anti-spell</li>  	<li>waking the dragon</li> </ul> <h1>How to Make Budget Work:</h1> I should start with the standard definition of budget for Yugioh decks, the price range for a budget deck is around $100 to $150 for both main and extra deck (not incuding side deck). This deck does meet those criteria. The main point I wanted to touch on is that budget deck are going to be worse than decks without those same price limitations if they try to do the same thing, so instead of trying to find alternatives for those really expensive cards, it's better to try something different that maybe not as many decks are prepared for. <h1>Edits &amp; Why I Made Them:</h1> Back Jack to one - I did this because I never felt like it really came up at more than one  Cherubini to one - I did this because I almost never actually go into it and I needed more extra deck space  Cutting fortune tune - I never once actually went into it, on paper it's a really good card, but it just never came up.  Cutting cicada king - this card never once came up at all, so I cut it.  Adding rubic and the synchro package - I'm trying something different, and if it does not work out as I hope, I'll probably cut it.  cutting the synchro package - tour guide doesn't let you synchro summon with the card you summon off of it, so I was stupid and dumb  added back cicada king and put in some more rank threes - I suddenly have more extra space, soooo I added some more rank 3s.  Side deck overhaul - So the reason I changed the side so much is that after some testing, most of it never came up, so I changed things around.  Cutting Broken Line out of the main deck - I needed space for my new funny engine, so I cut one of the less impactful cards I play.  Cutting Karma Cut - I wanted to play three of each of the solemns and needed to cut a few cards.  Pair-A-Dice stuff: I love this card so much and now that it has been proven to work with decks that work with rank 3s I just had to play it. <h1>Conclusion:</h1> I'm really happy to see BA being a successful deck in the current meta. Seeing one of my favorite decks duke it out with the likes of Dragon Link and Eldlich is just such a great thing, but I wanted to bring a version of the deck that you can reasonably buy. Forgoing some strong staples is tough, but the deck still is very good. BA is one of the decks that keeps me playing this awful game and to see that it can still hold up after all this time is just amazing."

The Sky Galloping is there for the ultra poly then spiral fusion when you draw it. One overlooked interaction is that if you give your opponent ""Gateway to Chaos"" with ""Set Rotation,"" they will not be able to activate it and field spells will be shut down for the rest of the duel. Feel free to take out the link 4s. I think I went into borreload once, but I just needed spots in the extra, so maybe stuff for the Dogmatica match up. Constructive feedback is greatly appreciated (keep in mind I'm playing to a budget still + the hand traps I own and want the deck fairly pure)."

It gives more consistency for distributing A-Counters and it solves the main problem the deck initially had involving cards like <strong>Alien Ammonite</strong> and <strong>Alien Mars</strong>. If there were better reptile starters in the game, then this deck would be a solid casual deck. I mean at this point it already is but you don't always open a hand that immediately does something. This deck aims to go second, but there are cards in the archetype that makes going first a good choice also.  <strong>Alien Mother</strong> is a solid choice going second. She steals anything she destroys which means you have free link material for things like <strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong> and <strong>Underworld Goddess</strong>. <strong>Alien Overlord</strong> is another solid card going second due to how easily it can spread A-Counters, but you might want to side 1 out going first if you don't see yourself able to make explosive link plays. 3 <strong>Nihil</strong> for grave set-up and it can search <strong>Snake Lily</strong>. 1<strong> Alien Telepath</strong> since its a good form of Spell/Trap removal for the deck. 3<strong> Alien Buster</strong> which gives more removal and A-Counters. 3 <strong>Alien Kid</strong> since he fuels <strong>Ze'loor</strong>. 1<strong> Alien Mars</strong> for continuous effects I guess. 3 <strong>Alien Dog</strong> which is an extender and more A-Counters. 3 <strong>Ammonite</strong> which gets you to<strong> Gol'gar</strong> or <strong>M-Frame</strong>. 1 <strong>Yamoimori</strong> which is simply a way to pop <strong>M-Frame</strong> and set-up for <strong>Echidna</strong>.  Spell and Traps are simple. 3 <strong>Code A Ancient Ruins</strong> since its a source of A-Counters and it can be looped due to being a soft opt with multiple <strong>Gol'gar</strong> which gives more link material. 3 <strong>""A"" Cell Recombination Device</strong> for consistency and A-Counters and grave set-up. 3 <strong>Mysterious Triangle</strong> for removal and extension. 3 <strong>Snake Lily</strong> as grave set-up and extension. 1 <strong>Snake Rain</strong> which could realistically be replaced with something like <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> or even <strong>Reptilianne Lamia</strong> if you're that kind of person. 2 <strong>Droplet</strong>. 3 <strong>Prosperity</strong>. 1 <strong>Mass Hypnosis</strong> which is<strong> Mind Control</strong> for 3.  Extra Deck. 1<strong> </strong><b>Zeus</b>. 2 <strong>King of the Feral Imps</strong>. 2 <strong>Gol'gar</strong> which is removal and he can loop <strong>Ancient Ruins</strong>. 1 <strong>Underworld Goddess</strong>. 1 <strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong>. 1 <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>. 2 <strong>Ze'loor</strong> which is <strong>Bagooska</strong>, a searcher, and an additional normal summon for <strong>Ammonite</strong>. 2 <strong>Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame</strong>. 1 <strong>Reptilianne Echidna</strong> as something to link into and for maybe 1 or 2 searches. 1 <strong>Clara &amp; Rushka</strong> if you desperately need to link off 1 normal summon.  Side Deck. 2<strong> Nibiru</strong>. 3 <strong>Phantazmay</strong> which is back in the format due to <em><strong>Dragon Link</strong></em> and <em><strong>Prank-Kid</strong></em>. 2 <strong>Dark Ruler</strong>. 3 <strong>""A"" Cell Scatter Burst</strong>. It is not your best option for A-Counters, but it does set-up things like <strong>Mass Hypnosis</strong>. 3 <strong>Planet Pollutant Virus</strong> which is interruption and free A-Counters. 2 <strong>Mass Hypnosis</strong> to side in going first."

All to the banish realm! This deck has the potential of ridiculous HP and damage with minimal e","This entire deck built around banishing your own cards to build up insane damage and HP, but to also banish the opponent's cards and ultimately their entire deck.  Banishing your own cards for crazy damage through Necroface, Eater of Millions and Gren Maju. And a ridiculous amount of HP with Soul Absorption. Soul Absorption helps to alleviate the necessary damage from taking 3k damage to activate Inferno Tempest. You can use Battle fader (BF) and Swift Scarecrow (SS) and Kaijus to force this, with the stronger kaiju on their side (Try to use one 3k damage kaiju on their side and one on your side as well). With this, you can attack with 0 attack from either BF or SS and take 3k damage to activate Inferno tempest from your hand. PLEASE NOTE, that if you want to activate Inferno Tempest by taking opponent damage during their turn, Inferno Tempest needs to be set, which will still activate and work during their turn.  Inferno Tempest and D.D. Dynamite is the crux of this build, as once you have activated Inferno Tempest first and then D.D. Dynamite, most opponents will be at your mercy, with no monsters and possibly decked out with the addition of Necroface ability. Generally don't set D.D. Dynamite until u activate Inferno Tempest and then set it, as it will activate at the beginning of the very next turn (which is hella nice), just to be on the safe side.  The main con with this build is that you have the possibility of banishing essential or necessary cards, and or decking yourself out. But don't fret as there are many ways to win with this deck, that has the potential of crazy high damage and HP with Gren Maju and Soul Absorption.  Another con, could be that your stuck with either less or exactly 3300 HP left, depending whether u want to use Kaijus or not. In which u won't be able to activate Inferno Tempest, so hopefully, Soul Absorption comes in handy then. And finally, there is the main con for having 60 cards, is that your hand can completely brick or in my experience for some reason, u get 3 of the same god damn card (For me its 3 Inferno Tempests or Keep getting Kaiju when I actually want Kaiju Slumber).  All the other cards are just fodder but help keep you alive and clear the field whenever needed until you get what u need.  In my experience in using this deck, is to just activate Inferno Tempest as earliest as possible, and then just hope that Necroface ultimately decks out the opponent out. Having at least one monster in hand or on the field first is important too, plus if you have actually nearly decked yourself out, just hope to god to pick up a Necroface and go for a full restart ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Since banishing is what this deck works around, having 60 cards is kind of necessary. you can bring it down to maybe 50, but you only increase decking yourself out before being able to achieve anything  I hope, that if you do give this a try, it works out. As this is the first deck that I have published, open for legitimate criticism, and welcome new ideas. I have built 7 versions of this deck and this one has had the greatest success.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

I love their artwork and concept that they only gain their effects when they are special summoned by the effect of another GB monster.  You cant play GBs like in the 2008s however, it is possible with cards like Mystic Mine. Yes I know, Mystic Mine bad but you don't stall out your opponent to death in this deck and it is more being used as a dark ruler. Also, you have access to pop your own Mystic Mine with Gladiator Beast Gyzarus.  Defensive Tactics in the side deck because I like the artwork.  &nbsp;  <strong>The Ancient Warrior Engine</strong>: Because this deck wants to go 2nd and because Ancient Warriors are my favorite Archetype in the history of Yugioh, I felt like that this is a good addition to Gladiator Beasts. You play<strong> 2x Guan Yun</strong>, who is bascially a Pankratops and <strong>1x Lu Feng</strong> who is the Garnet of this deck, however it is not the end of the world if you draw him (similar to <strong>speedroid taketomborg</strong>). Lu Feng is a free extender, as you want to search him with the link Monster <strong>Double Dragon Lords</strong>, however if you end up on the link monster and Lu Feng (which is not hard at all) that is still a good board to end on. I didnt include cards like <strong>Sun Mou</strong> because Gladiator Beasts need their normal summon.  &nbsp;  <strong>Some cards I didnt include on purpose: </strong>  <strong>Gladiator Rejection:</strong> Bad if you draw multiple copies of, isn't searchable and wanted to play a more slower version so....  <strong>Gladiator Beast's Respite:</strong> Did include it in my deck, however the deck size with this card was at 42, so cutting all three of them cards and add an Upstart gets its job done, too.  <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>: <em>Defensive Tactics</em> better than Dark Ruler ( no debating)  <strong>Gladiator Beast Andabata: Useless</strong>  <strong>Harpie's feather duster</strong>: Im budget friendly, also <em>Evenly Matched</em> is already in the main  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

A casual fun deck.,"<span class=""style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"">With this you really want to go first and set up Rafale and Wiz negates and preferrably also have some handtraps. The most important handtrap of the deck is probably Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit as it ran trigger Folgo's effect on your opponent's turn and get you 1 or 3 draws, which can be some further hadntraps to disrupt opponent. Such as Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. The deck is really vulnerable to disruption. If you don't have Rookie Fur Hire, infinite impermanence alone can just prevent you from being able to do anything. It was hard to fit any other archtypes into this deck because the basic first turn Fur Hire combo needs you to have basically two fur hires + Beat in hand to search Rafale, then link summoning Folgo and special summoning Wiz from deck. That's why I also have Pot of Extravagance even though it prevents me sometimes from drawing with folgo. I need more cards n hand to pull of the combo more consistently. I tried to find any good one card combos that could get folgo out more easily but couldn't think of any. So I just made a pure Fur Hire deck. I tried Tri-Brigades for example but didn't really like them. Non-Fur Hire cards just take too much space in hand and cause bricks.</span>  Replays:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ2AnzuQVsI"
