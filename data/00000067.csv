Summoner monk is used as a bridge to connect both engines together ; same goes as well for vendread charge to make Exciton! Deck is very combo Heavy with many lines. You can bridge to any ritual monster or spells in the game with the vendreads. So yes mitsurugui can be incorporated. So far the deck can still be improved to your liking. Honorable mention if you would want to use vendread Reunion to extend your combos you'll need 2 slayers an 1 Battlelord but if you want more protection add 2 Battlelords in main or side deck. Battlelord is an excellent side deck card. Hope you enjoy have fun! I almost forgot the deck can draw 5 with 1 necromancer all you need is number 60, crosssheep and sucker you can also with just 1 normal Summon of dark necromancer and any 1 ritual in hand make SP little knight with 2 banish, slayer with 2 banish, Battlelord with 2 banish on turn 1 with a total of 6 banishes plus if you have Engraver than just goes even more nuts.&nbsp;</p>"

Just use the handtraps, simplify your opponent's gamestate, then outgrind them with your relentless Regenesis deck core! Even your Regenesis monsters get sent to the graveyard during your opponent's turn, they all just return to your hand in the endphase, and their spells like ""Regenesis"" and ""Code"" can ressurect your monsters from the GY and Banishment! Not to mention that every single Regenesis monster is a massive beatstick, so you can also equalize your opponent's board in the battle phase by running everything over, especially with the 5000 ATK Regenesis Lord! The Dogmatika cards also grant additional power and synergy to the deck, since the many forms of Fleurdelis are 2500ATK/2500DEF, making them a perfect fit for the strategy!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

I&rsquo;m including this deck in the 'Meta' section even though it&rsquo;s just been released and I haven&rsquo;t even had a chance to try it locally yet. I see a lot of potential in the archetype: it isn&rsquo;t stopped by the usual handtraps or many boardbreakers in the current meta, although unfortunately it is vulnerable to Droll. I hope that over time we find a better way to play it, maybe by mixing it with other archetypes and revising the card ratios, since at the moment it offers few flex options.</span></p>"

Time to combine it with Branded!","<p>The next evolution in fusion technology is finally here in Masterduel, and it is Dracotail! These spellcaster dragons do relatively few actions for a lot of impact! Everytime you fusion summon with Dracotail monsters, can set a Dracotail spell/trap from deck, then get an additional effect which breaks your opponent's board, giving this strategy inherent board breaking capabilities. Dracotail Faimena can also fusion summon as a quick effect during the Main Phase, meaning you can fusion summon turn 0 and immediately start interrupting your opponent! This low amount of special summons Dracotail does allows it to perfectly play in Maxx ""C,"" creating a lot of advantage and interruptions while minimizing the amount of draws your opponent gets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Paired with Branded, Dracotail becomes near unstoppable! Phryxul is the perfect card to bridge both Branded and Dracotail decks! Phryxul is the perfect card to bridge both Branded and Dracotail decks! This strategy generates a ton of massive beatsticks on field, smashes through established boards with in-engine cards, and generates a ton of advantage! Albax and Phryxul has truly made the ultimate fusion strategy!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

He ended on Desirae + Ceasar, I used droplet only with monsters, and he didnt even chain something else and negate with Desirae, maybe because he forgot or didnt have a playable Spell/Trap (f.e. Purification was a dead backrow), so I got rid of his board super quickly and he again didnt have enough followup because he wasnt able to do any Misu things again.<br /><br /><br />Decklist:<br />I have barely changed the list in the last couple of weeks.</p><p>Main Deck is almost completely set in stone for now, the Fiendsmith engine to go for Ceasar is theoretically optional, but its so powerful I feel like its mandatory. Also really important against Dracotail because they have multiple monster effects that fuse and you usually dont want to use the MST+Trap on those.</p><p>In the extra, I rarely make Gossip Shadow Zeus, or with the FS even Totem Bird, but they should still be in the list I feel like. Gossip Shadow is just to break boards if they let me make a Rank 3, because an end board piece that lets the both players draw a card while I dont play handtraps is terrible.</p><p>For Fallen &amp; The Virtuous, you can play Alba Lenatus instead of the 3rd Albion to make some people think youre actually on branded stuff :P. In this deck you could even play more targets because the Trap recycles Fallen &amp; The Virtuous.</p><p>In the side deck, I side Charmies for going second, <br />Ash mostly for matchups because the only charmy that hurts is Purulia and barely anyone plays it right now. I just played it to try it, never drew it.<br />Droll for certain matchups, didnt side against Mitsu FS because of the FS part so if they have a good hand its just a -1.<br />Tenki for going first to brick less, but plays into droll sadly.<br />Judgement for breakers going first and Yummy and Warning also for Yummy.</p><p>Didnt play an our for Liger because noones on Lunalight at my locals right now. I would play Lava Golem if I needed an out probably.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, 4-0, lost one Duel total, and im super happy. I dont get why I dont see this deck more in the TCG, the deck is crazy, even before the busted support the will come out in Burst Protocol, and super fun because you get to annihalate boards in the draw phase. nice Snatchy, nice I:P, nice Forced Release, Idiots :D.</p>"

Pretty consistent (probably 4/5 hands lead to ftk). Can just play mitsu the rest of the time (with 7 extra bricks). Not terrible (could probably take a local) but not great either. Pure Mitsu is definitely better, but this is way funnier (and more hype).</p><p>Note: FTK dies to every handtrap in the game, hence called by and crossout. If you get hand trapped, just switch to playing mitsu.</p><p>Note2: Fusions are just prosp targets. Change them out for whatever. Can also run extrav (in which case, run as many duplicates of the central cards as you can), but it feels worse, since it is a one card ftk (just need habakiri).</p>"

Can they work well together? DEFINITELY!,"<p>Let's face it, Dracotail is pretty friggin' strong in the ""lower power"" format of GENESYS (I think it will get more points added in the next points update), where not much can contest the insane advantage engine that these spellcaster dragons can give to the duelist. Combine that with Chimera, and you'll find that yourself with an incredibly powerful fusion deck with a bazillion cards in hand, field and GY to overwhelm your opponent with sheer card advantage!&nbsp;<br /><br />Everytime you fusion summon with Dracotail monsters, can set a Dracotail spell/trap from deck, then get an additional effect which breaks your opponent's board, giving this strategy inherent board breaking capabilities. Dracotail Faimena can also fusion summon as a quick effect during the Main Phase, meaning you can fusion summon turn 0 and immediately start interrupting your opponent! Arthalion and Secreterion can also recycle your powerful monsters from the field and GY as well, ensuring you can a near infinite grindgame!</p><p>Chimera is an incredible advantage engine capable of overwhelming your opponent with so much resources, interactions and draw power - represented in a fusion deck! For example, one Mirror Swordknight is a whopping +7 in card advantage! While in GENESYS it loses out on some consistency with Cornfield Coatl costing a whopping 33 points, the strategy is still competent in this format's power vacuum giving the duelist incredible boss monsters such as Diabellze (anti-spell) and Guardian Chimera (draw and destroy big beatstick).&nbsp;</p><p>Combined together, this fusion of these two powerful archetypes can obliterate any opposing strategy in GENESYS!</p><p>If you have any questions about this deck, feel free to ask me in the comments below!</p><p>GLHF Duelists!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

The latest Masterduel Selection Pack ""Aerial Superiority"" has been a massive boon for this seemingly forgotten Ishtar sibling, granting Odion a powerful combo trap deck! Able to play comfortably into Maxx C, Mulcharmies, Droll, Nibiru and even Dimension Shifter, while being ultra consistent and packing 20+ staple slots... Odion's strategy has surprisingly been incredibly competent even in the hyper competitive Duelist Cup defeating the likes of Dracotail, Mitsurugi and Maliss!<br /><br />Not only do you get to spam the field repeatedly with 2-3 Apophis the Swamp Deity's omni-negates, when paired with Statue of Anguish Pattern all these trap monsters become ""pops!"" All these cards are searchable and summonable turn 1 thanks to Odion's signature strategy, activating trap cards the same turn they were set with ""Temple of the Kings,"" another iconic piece of Yugioh anime history now suddenly made competitive!&nbsp;<br /><br />How about going second?

There, Fusion Summon ""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"" with Hex + Saryuja as materials and put it to where Yajiro would pop it.</p><p>4) After Yajiro pops Dragon Knight, Narwhal starts blasting your opponent. To make it a loop, ""Centrifgual Field"" is here to revive Dragon Knight thanks to two facts...</p><ul><li>You have to revive a Fusion material named on Fusion monster. In the case of ""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"", it's ""Dark Magician"".</li><li>Since Dragon Knight is also named as ""Dark Magician"" while in GY, Centrifugal picks up ""Dark Magician"" which is Dragon Knight.</li></ul><p>5) Repeating what was explained in #3 and #4 is what you need to win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 30 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Summoner Monk"" + ""Centur-Ion Legatia"" can be found within ""True Awakening of the Oathbound Knights"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Upstart Goblin"" can be found within ""Bonkers Bikers' Wild Wheels"" Secret Pack to save 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G.
