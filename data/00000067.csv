Summoner monk is used as a bridge to connect both engines together ; same goes as well for vendread charge to make Exciton! Deck is very combo Heavy with many lines. You can bridge to any ritual monster or spells in the game with the vendreads. So yes mitsurugui can be incorporated. So far the deck can still be improved to your liking. Honorable mention if you would want to use vendread Reunion to extend your combos you'll need 2 slayers an 1 Battlelord but if you want more protection add 2 Battlelords in main or side deck. Battlelord is an excellent side deck card. Hope you enjoy have fun! I almost forgot the deck can draw 5 with 1 necromancer all you need is number 60, crosssheep and sucker you can also with just 1 normal Summon of dark necromancer and any 1 ritual in hand make SP little knight with 2 banish, slayer with 2 banish, Battlelord with 2 banish on turn 1 with a total of 6 banishes plus if you have Engraver than just goes even more nuts.&nbsp;</p>"

Just use the handtraps, simplify your opponent's gamestate, then outgrind them with your relentless Regenesis deck core! Even your Regenesis monsters get sent to the graveyard during your opponent's turn, they all just return to your hand in the endphase, and their spells like ""Regenesis"" and ""Code"" can ressurect your monsters from the GY and Banishment! Not to mention that every single Regenesis monster is a massive beatstick, so you can also equalize your opponent's board in the battle phase by running everything over, especially with the 5000 ATK Regenesis Lord! The Dogmatika cards also grant additional power and synergy to the deck, since the many forms of Fleurdelis are 2500ATK/2500DEF, making them a perfect fit for the strategy!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

I&rsquo;m including this deck in the 'Meta' section even though it&rsquo;s just been released and I haven&rsquo;t even had a chance to try it locally yet. I see a lot of potential in the archetype: it isn&rsquo;t stopped by the usual handtraps or many boardbreakers in the current meta, although unfortunately it is vulnerable to Droll. I hope that over time we find a better way to play it, maybe by mixing it with other archetypes and revising the card ratios, since at the moment it offers few flex options.</span></p>"

Time to combine it with Branded!","<p>The next evolution in fusion technology is finally here in Masterduel, and it is Dracotail! These spellcaster dragons do relatively few actions for a lot of impact! Everytime you fusion summon with Dracotail monsters, can set a Dracotail spell/trap from deck, then get an additional effect which breaks your opponent's board, giving this strategy inherent board breaking capabilities. Dracotail Faimena can also fusion summon as a quick effect during the Main Phase, meaning you can fusion summon turn 0 and immediately start interrupting your opponent! This low amount of special summons Dracotail does allows it to perfectly play in Maxx ""C,"" creating a lot of advantage and interruptions while minimizing the amount of draws your opponent gets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Paired with Branded, Dracotail becomes near unstoppable! Phryxul is the perfect card to bridge both Branded and Dracotail decks! Phryxul is the perfect card to bridge both Branded and Dracotail decks! This strategy generates a ton of massive beatsticks on field, smashes through established boards with in-engine cards, and generates a ton of advantage! Albax and Phryxul has truly made the ultimate fusion strategy!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

He ended on Desirae + Ceasar, I used droplet only with monsters, and he didnt even chain something else and negate with Desirae, maybe because he forgot or didnt have a playable Spell/Trap (f.e. Purification was a dead backrow), so I got rid of his board super quickly and he again didnt have enough followup because he wasnt able to do any Misu things again.<br /><br /><br />Decklist:<br />I have barely changed the list in the last couple of weeks.</p><p>Main Deck is almost completely set in stone for now, the Fiendsmith engine to go for Ceasar is theoretically optional, but its so powerful I feel like its mandatory. Also really important against Dracotail because they have multiple monster effects that fuse and you usually dont want to use the MST+Trap on those.</p><p>In the extra, I rarely make Gossip Shadow Zeus, or with the FS even Totem Bird, but they should still be in the list I feel like. Gossip Shadow is just to break boards if they let me make a Rank 3, because an end board piece that lets the both players draw a card while I dont play handtraps is terrible.</p><p>For Fallen &amp; The Virtuous, you can play Alba Lenatus instead of the 3rd Albion to make some people think youre actually on branded stuff :P. In this deck you could even play more targets because the Trap recycles Fallen &amp; The Virtuous.</p><p>In the side deck, I side Charmies for going second, <br />Ash mostly for matchups because the only charmy that hurts is Purulia and barely anyone plays it right now. I just played it to try it, never drew it.<br />Droll for certain matchups, didnt side against Mitsu FS because of the FS part so if they have a good hand its just a -1.<br />Tenki for going first to brick less, but plays into droll sadly.<br />Judgement for breakers going first and Yummy and Warning also for Yummy.</p><p>Didnt play an our for Liger because noones on Lunalight at my locals right now. I would play Lava Golem if I needed an out probably.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, 4-0, lost one Duel total, and im super happy. I dont get why I dont see this deck more in the TCG, the deck is crazy, even before the busted support the will come out in Burst Protocol, and super fun because you get to annihalate boards in the draw phase. nice Snatchy, nice I:P, nice Forced Release, Idiots :D.</p>"

Pretty consistent (probably 4/5 hands lead to ftk). Can just play mitsu the rest of the time (with 7 extra bricks). Not terrible (could probably take a local) but not great either. Pure Mitsu is definitely better, but this is way funnier (and more hype).</p><p>Note: FTK dies to every handtrap in the game, hence called by and crossout. If you get hand trapped, just switch to playing mitsu.</p><p>Note2: Fusions are just prosp targets. Change them out for whatever. Can also run extrav (in which case, run as many duplicates of the central cards as you can), but it feels worse, since it is a one card ftk (just need habakiri).</p>"

Can they work well together? DEFINITELY!,"<p>Let's face it, Dracotail is pretty friggin' strong in the ""lower power"" format of GENESYS (I think it will get more points added in the next points update), where not much can contest the insane advantage engine that these spellcaster dragons can give to the duelist. Combine that with Chimera, and you'll find that yourself with an incredibly powerful fusion deck with a bazillion cards in hand, field and GY to overwhelm your opponent with sheer card advantage!&nbsp;<br /><br />Everytime you fusion summon with Dracotail monsters, can set a Dracotail spell/trap from deck, then get an additional effect which breaks your opponent's board, giving this strategy inherent board breaking capabilities. Dracotail Faimena can also fusion summon as a quick effect during the Main Phase, meaning you can fusion summon turn 0 and immediately start interrupting your opponent! Arthalion and Secreterion can also recycle your powerful monsters from the field and GY as well, ensuring you can a near infinite grindgame!</p><p>Chimera is an incredible advantage engine capable of overwhelming your opponent with so much resources, interactions and draw power - represented in a fusion deck! For example, one Mirror Swordknight is a whopping +7 in card advantage! While in GENESYS it loses out on some consistency with Cornfield Coatl costing a whopping 33 points, the strategy is still competent in this format's power vacuum giving the duelist incredible boss monsters such as Diabellze (anti-spell) and Guardian Chimera (draw and destroy big beatstick).&nbsp;</p><p>Combined together, this fusion of these two powerful archetypes can obliterate any opposing strategy in GENESYS!</p><p>If you have any questions about this deck, feel free to ask me in the comments below!</p><p>GLHF Duelists!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

The latest Masterduel Selection Pack ""Aerial Superiority"" has been a massive boon for this seemingly forgotten Ishtar sibling, granting Odion a powerful combo trap deck! Able to play comfortably into Maxx C, Mulcharmies, Droll, Nibiru and even Dimension Shifter, while being ultra consistent and packing 20+ staple slots... Odion's strategy has surprisingly been incredibly competent even in the hyper competitive Duelist Cup defeating the likes of Dracotail, Mitsurugi and Maliss!<br /><br />Not only do you get to spam the field repeatedly with 2-3 Apophis the Swamp Deity's omni-negates, when paired with Statue of Anguish Pattern all these trap monsters become ""pops!"" All these cards are searchable and summonable turn 1 thanks to Odion's signature strategy, activating trap cards the same turn they were set with ""Temple of the Kings,"" another iconic piece of Yugioh anime history now suddenly made competitive!&nbsp;<br /><br />How about going second?

There, Fusion Summon ""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"" with Hex + Saryuja as materials and put it to where Yajiro would pop it.</p><p>4) After Yajiro pops Dragon Knight, Narwhal starts blasting your opponent. To make it a loop, ""Centrifgual Field"" is here to revive Dragon Knight thanks to two facts...</p><ul><li>You have to revive a Fusion material named on Fusion monster. In the case of ""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"", it's ""Dark Magician"".</li><li>Since Dragon Knight is also named as ""Dark Magician"" while in GY, Centrifugal picks up ""Dark Magician"" which is Dragon Knight.</li></ul><p>5) Repeating what was explained in #3 and #4 is what you need to win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 30 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Summoner Monk"" + ""Centur-Ion Legatia"" can be found within ""True Awakening of the Oathbound Knights"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Upstart Goblin"" can be found within ""Bonkers Bikers' Wild Wheels"" Secret Pack to save 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Dracotail Faimena can also fusion summon as a quick effect during the Main Phase, meaning you can fusion summon turn 0 and immediately start interrupting your opponent! Arthalion and Secreterion can also recycle your powerful monsters from the field and GY as well, ensuring you can a near infinite grindgame!<br /><br />This build of Dracotail features a whopping 19 handtraps! Theoretically, your opponent would be hardpressed to play through all those handtraps, then Dracotail can smash through any ""half-board"" they would make. The interruptions Dracotail can make with it's three traps (1 bounce of ATK position monster, 1 spell negate, 1 GY banish, 1 pop with Gulamel, 1 fuse with Faimena) backed by handtraps are also very difficult for any meta deck to play through. The game boils down to proper usage of handtraps and interruptions - forcing a simplified gamestate where the superior Dracotail engine can flourish!<br /><br />The simple, straightforward but potent midrange playstyle of Dracotail is now yours to yield - the dominant strategy on ladder!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Toy Box engine is excellent first or second even in a format where MST.deck is so potent.&nbsp;</p><p>For extra deck, the other options I have considered are Zapper Shrimp + Satellite Warrior, or Genex Arms Zero and the dark level 6 synchro tuner that enables it. Nibiru is still scary, so I am testing Muddy Mudragon into Mechaba as an out to it or at least a line that forces a Nib earlier than the end of main.&nbsp;</p><p>Side deck is what I've been testing the last month; Subdual into Diabellze often just FTKs Radiant Typhoon or other quick play decks and is still good v other decks that use spells, I like siding in Morrian going first and have Reframing in the side for decks that I think will bring in Evenly matched, although Scourge is a main decked card that can help here too. Of all the going second cards that still suit WF, I have found that 3 dark ruler in main backed with 3 swords of concealing light and 3 fusion tag works best. Concealing is very good in this deck as you can book the board and then send it for WF cost. And Fusion Tag turns any monster on board into Saint Azamina so you can tribute off any monster your opponent controls (even towers) for Azamina.&nbsp;</p><p>Gravity Collapse is probably optimal here but I just find that card to be boring when playing locals or with friends. Synchro Zone is a semi floodgate but is good in synchro decks too for its other effects.&nbsp;</p><p>Final word is on how good Diabellstar Vengeance is. being able to pop a card, then either summon a book of eclipse in Silvera or Poplar to then place two WF in backrow, and quick synchro into Snake Eye Vengeance Dragon is excellent. And you can then follow that up with summoning Snake Eye Doomed Dragon which deals with 1 card, 1 monster in backrow, pop a cont spell + a monster in BP with Vengeance, and another monster placed in backrow with Doomed.&nbsp;</p><p>I think in a post droll environment this deck can thrive, but it still has its old weaknesses plus it can brick or draw awkward hands. I think this version could maybe be optimised by dropping chicken game for hand traps or droplets, but this is what I'll be testing for now.

The December 15th Points Update did hurt this Deck at all. If anything,&nbsp;<strong>Droll &amp; Lock Bird&nbsp;</strong>going to 25 points means that we are no longer playing that card.&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong> going up a singular point is literally nothing. I have been messing around with different cards in the Main Deck ever since my previous list, and I have figured that this is pretty much what I want to see in the Main Deck: The Deck aims to blind second, it Main Decks a whole bunch of non-engine including going second cards, and we are just trying to interrupt the opponent's plays on their turn as much as possible to force them to end on a simplified board (more or less) in order to break through with whatever they have with your large Gimmick Puppet Xyz Monsters and inflicting damage whenever and wherever possible. It realy does help that Gimmick Puppet's Main Deck is not pointed at all except for&nbsp;<strong>Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls</strong> and the Rank-Up-Magics with&nbsp;<strong>Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force</strong> being the only RUM to be pointed at 5. Even so, with all of the pointed non-engine that I chose to play, I literally had like almost 20 to like 25 points left, which is why there are some interesting choices in cards that I am playing.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For handtraps, we have 3&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Mulcharmy Fuwalos</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Mourner &amp; Moonlit Chill</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>D.D. Crow</strong>. I am not playing&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion&nbsp;</strong>at all. While it is not too costly to play considering that it is only 5 points per copy, D.D. Crow kind of covers most of what Belle is meant to cover in all honesty. If you are using Belle offensively, you are trying to negate your opponent's effect that is either adding a card(s) from GY or Speical Summoning a Monster Card(s) from GY, and Crow covers both of these areas while being at 0 points. The only time I would probably play Belle over Crow is if I need to use Belle defensively, specifically to negate my opponent's D.D. Crow on one of my cards in the GY. While it would theoretically be wise to run Belle over Crow in Gimmick Puppet, a Deck that is subsceptible to Crow banishing one of your key cards in GY, I am purposefully choosing to play offensive handtraps to hit the opponent. At best, Belle is a Side Deckable card, but I feel that the cards that I am currently Side Decking are much more important than Belle. Nibiru is just a nice card all around, but do be careful about the interaction between popping the Primal Being Token with the effect of&nbsp;<strong>Number C15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter</strong>. Hunter detaches to target and destroy a card your opponent controls, and if it was sa monster, damage is inflicted to your opponent equal to its original ATK. The Primal Being Token's original ATK is ?, so its original ATK is treated as 0 and your opponent will not take any damage. Unless the Token is too big to run over, you are never using Giant Hunter's effect to pop the Token because Hunter can pop any card your opponent controls and possibly even deal a bunch burn damage if you destroyed a monster, so its effect wisely. Fuwalos is really nice because if you do draw cards off of it, you can draw into your multitude of non-engine. Actually, I would recommend playing&nbsp;<strong>Mulcharmy Purulia</strong> or even&nbsp;<strong>Mulcharmy Meowls</strong> because if you shift some points around, you can fit a playset of either in the Deck as well, and it helps you in the same way as Fuwalos does. Mourner negates a Special Summoned monster's effects and if that monster were to leave the field, your opponent takes damage equal to its original ATK, which is great to pair with the effects of your GImmick Puppet Xyz Monsters inflicting effect damage as well. Ghost Ogre is Ghost Ogre. It is really nice in a more limited format.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Gimmick Puppet Main Deck Monsters, we have 1&nbsp;<strong>Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Gimmick Puppet Rouge Doll</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Gimmick Puppet Cattle Scream</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Gimmick Puppet Little Soldiers</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Gimmick Puppet Scissor Arms</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Gimmick Puppet Terror Baby</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Gimmick Puppet Fiendish Knight</strong>. I won't go into all of them in detail, but I'll explain their general purposes. Bisque Doll and Dreary Doll are terrible cards to open. They are more or less additional Level 8 Gimmick Puppet names in Deck for Rouge Doll to Summon or to dump into the GY with&nbsp;<strong>Condolence Puppet</strong> to use their GY effects. Normally, I would not play them, but they do help with protection (in the case of Bisque Doll) and extension (in the case of Dreary Doll). Rouge Doll in hand translates to 2 Level 8's on field. Cattle Scream is an extender and it gives a Gimmick Puppet Xyz Monster with it under it the effect to target and Special Summon a monster from your opponent's GY to their field, which can then be popped with any of your GImmick Puppet Xyz Monsters and burn your opponent. Little Soldiers dumps a Gimmick Puppet monster from Deck as cost and then makes its own Level equal to that monster's Level. It's GY effect can also help with turning your Level 4 Gimmick Puppets into Level 8's if necessary. Scissor Arms is just a worse version of Little Soliders, but it serves the same purpoe on field. It is probably the most cuttable one though. Terror Baby revives a Gimmick Puppet from GY in Defense on Normal Summon and its GY effect makes it so that your opponentcannot activate cards or effects in response to your Gimmick Puppet monster effects for the turn. Fiendish Knight is just a much better way to recurr Gimmick Puppet monsters from GY than Terror Baby and it can even recurr itself.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Spell/Traps: 2&nbsp;<strong>Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force</strong>. This is 10 points total for both copies, but I will explain. I had like 6 points still available, so I cut the&nbsp;<strong>Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force</strong> I was intiially playing for a second copy of Argent Chaos Force. Argent Chaos Force is just the best RUM Spell for Gimmick Puppet. You can argue that&nbsp;<strong>Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force</strong> is also really good. Yes, it can negate the effects of all other face-up cards on the field, but it can't Summon a CXyz monster. It can only make Number C monsters, and sometimes, you want to make an additional <strong>CXyz Gimmick Puppet Fanatix Machinix</strong> for its 3100 ATK instead of a crummy Giant Hunter with 2500 ATK (because that's all we get in this format due to <strong>Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings </strong>being pointed at 50 each). Besides, you can recurr Argent Chaos Force multiple ways, either through its GY effect or through&nbsp;<strong>Gimmick Puppet Fantasix Machinix</strong>.&nbsp;3&nbsp;<strong>Piri Reis Map</strong> because we don't have Mansion to search for a Gimmick Puppet monster from Deck in this format. 3&nbsp;<strong>Condolence Puppet</strong> which sends Gimmick Puppet names from Deck to GY up to the number of your opponent's monsters Special Summoned from the Extra Deck +1. Also, it has a GY effect to make a Machine Xyz Monster you control unable to be destroyed by your opponent's card effects while it is face-up on the field. 3&nbsp;<strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>. You could just play 2 and then cut like Scissor Arms to play 2&nbsp;<strong>Final Bringer of the End Times</strong> or something. Finally, 1&nbsp;<strong>Service Puppet Play</strong> which steals monsters your opponent controls up to the number of Gimmick Puppet Xyz Monsters you control and you can banish it from GY to target an Xyz in either GY and Summon it to either field.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: We are playing&nbsp;<strong>Super Starslayer TY-PHON - Sky Crisis</strong> because we had the extra points to do so. It does hurt your Fanatix Machinix, but Fanatix Machinix can be used as a beater at that point. 3 <strong>CXyz Gimmick Puppet Fanatix Machinix</strong>. Basically, it searches a Puppet Trap on Summon, it can detach 1 and Special Summon a monster from either GY to your opponent's field, and if a monster(s) is Special Summoned to your opponent's field, you can target 1 of them and destroy it, inflicting damage equal to half its orignal ATK. 3&nbsp;<strong>Gimmick Puppet Fantasix Machinix</strong> which detaches 1 to add a RUM and give you an extra Normal Summon for a Machine. Also, it can being itself back to either field if you make a Gimmick Puppet Xyz and then you can add a RUM from GY to hand. 3&nbsp;<strong>Number C15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter</strong> which detaches 1 to target and pop a card your opponent controls, burning your opponent equal to a destroyed monster's original ATK if it destroys a monster. 3 <strong>Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder</strong> which can twice per turn detach a material during your Main Phase 1 to target and destroy a Special Summoned monster your opponent controls, inflicitng damage equal to its original ATK if that monster was an Xyz Monster. 2&nbsp;<strong>Gimmick Puppet Gigantes Doll</strong> which can detach 2 to steal up to 2 of your opponent's monsters until the End Phase, locking you into Gimmick Puppet monsters and only being able to attack with Xyz Monsters. It can also Tribute itself to make all your monsters Level 8 for the turn.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Decl: 3&nbsp;<strong>Dogoran, the Mad Flame Kaiju</strong> which is just really good removal and it has a high ATK which can be helpful to pop and inflict damage with your Gimmick Puppet Xyz Monsters.&nbsp;<strong>Lava Golem</strong> also works, but it does prevent you from Normal Summoning, so unless you have a Rouge Doll to go into Fantasix Machinix, you can't rely on Little Soldiers or Scissor Arms to start your turn. 3&nbsp;<strong>Shared Ride</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Mistaken Arrest</strong>. Shared Ride can be set going first to allow you to draw into handtraps on your opponent's turn whenever they search. Mistaken Arrest prevents both players from adding cards from Main Deck to hand until the end of your next turn after it is activated. You can literally recurr your Gimmick Puppets like Rouge Doll and Fiendish Knight from GY with Rouge Doll also Special Summoning from Deck. You aren't affected by this card at all. 3&nbsp;<strong>Twin Twister</strong> for Spell/Trap removal. This could be&nbsp;<strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong> instead if you want. 3&nbsp;<strong>Solemn Judgment</strong> because we need some good cards to back up literally just a pop with Fanatix Machinix and maybe like 1 to 2 or 3 steals off of Service Puppet Play.</span></p>"

Nasten does nothing half the time outside of being a body to summon off of Indulged to set up a fusion off of Dark Dance for Eveningstar, or to summon with Valhalla as a body on field. Ixchel is still a draw 2 and if you have Gulgalta in hand then that's a search to top it off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am 100% convinced that anyone running more than 1 Superbia and 1 Gulgalta is coping. That's not to say that either is particularly bad, it's moreso that this deck already has a problem with it's monsters doing nothing in hand (save for Ixchel) and very little in grave, and the ones you want in the grave do nothing in the hand except for being discard fodder for Condemned. Also, Superbia can't res. itself and can't proc it's res. off of a copied Contact since it misses timing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Under the best possible circumstances you can get 1 spell negate, 1 monster negate, 1 monster steal, and a quick fusion into a board wipe. If you manage to also have Nasten or Ixchel on the endboard then that's another use of one of the traps, though it's usually better to just use them as fodder for the on-field activation of the traps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Combo can be flexible, but getting to Eveningstar through any means possible is the number one priority since he not only grabs backrow but is also just a good endboard piece via copying Dark Dance in grave to summon First Darklord using a binned Morningstar. Generally you'll want to start by summoning Djehuty who then fetches Indulged, giving your opponent a Nasten or Ixchel and adding Superbia, Golgalta, or Morningstar to hand. Indulged + Kambi or Hecatrice discard for Valhalla into summoning any name in hand alongside Indulged or Djehuty will also do it. Either way, make Condemned, discard the added name off of Indulged and bin one of the others BUT absolutely make sure that Gulgalta and Morningstar are in rotation (Gulgalta summoned off of Djehuty into making Condemned using them is also viable). Gulgalta can add either Dark Dance or Banishment (Add banishment if you don't have Contact), then you can either summon Gulgalta if you have contact and fuse away one of the tokens + the Darklord on the opponent's field for Eveningstar or add Banishment, Banishment for Dark Dance, and hope you have the material for Eveningstar. From there Eveningstar can set Banishment if you haven't used it already or Contact + either Enchantment or Sanctified, then Eveningstar effect to copy Banishment effect to add the other trap or a name if you need fodder for the set trap. With Morningstar in grave with Dark Dance, you SHOULD be able to have at least one of the traps alongside a boardwipe off of summoning First Darklord with Morningstar as material.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Update + Access is there for when you inevitably get to turn 3 and Rebellion can be swapped for their new trap card, which isn't on YGOpro yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck was kinda just slapped together so it may not be optimal, especially considering the lack of generic fairy endboard pieces. However I think it's a decent show of what Darklords can potentially do now that they actually have a way to access more of their backrow and have enough fodder to activate it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, and they can finally CONSISTENTLY summon First Darklord. Did I mention that? Did I mention that Darklords ONLY NOW have a way to CONSISTENTLY summon The First Darklord, their ONLY boss monster until now? Because the ONLY way to do it previously on the opponent's turn (so that First Darklord ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING outside of it's res.) was through Darklord Uprising, which is a FIVE CARD COMMITTMENT since you not only need to have Uprising and the three material (in hand or on field) for First Darklord, but also A DISCARD. The bonus for using Uprising was gaining up to 2900 LP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

One was born into luxury, inheriting wealth and power and eventually controlling one of the world&rsquo;s most influential companies. The other was born into hardship, never knowing stability or even parental care, surviving by moving from town to town.<br />Originally, their deaths were meant to reflect this imbalance, but both ultimately die at the hands of police, giving them a shared moment of injustice. One soul was newly married, only to discover her husband&rsquo;s cruelty&mdash;he married her solely to steal her company. There is an implication she may have been pregnant, highlighting the deep and persistent unfairness faced by women. The other soul&rsquo;s life reflects the quieter injustice endured by men of the common class, marked by neglect and disposability.<br />In the afterlife, they find themselves in purgatory. One is unable to speak, while the other remains aware and reflective. Together, they attempt to find meaning and comfort in each other&rsquo;s presence before the cosmos resets, knowing their time is limited.</p></blockquote></div></div><div id=""chapters"" style=""border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" role=""article""><h3 id=""work"" class=""landmark heading"" style=""color: transparent; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-weight: 400; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word; line-height: 0; opacity: 0; height: 0px; clear: both;"">Work Text:</h3><div class=""userstuff"" style=""border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word; line-height: 1.5;""><p style=""color: #2a2a2a; font-family: inherit; font-size: 15.12px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px; text-align: center;""><strong style=""border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-weight: bold; font-style: inherit; font-size: 15.12px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">⛧ Two Souls Too Late ⛧</strong><br />By VexatioMemoriaAeternumLamentaVenerabilis, and GPT ^_^&nbsp;</p><p style=""border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px; text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><span style=""color: #2a2a2a; font-family: inherit;""><span style=""font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style=""color: #2a2a2a; font-family: Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif, GNU Unifont;""><span style=""font-size: 15.12px;""><span style=""font-size: 18pt;"">⛧ Petals at the Edge of Purgatory ⛧</span><br /></span></span></p><p style=""border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: #2a2a2a; font-family: Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif, GNU Unifont;""><span style=""font-size: 15.12px;"">In life, she was known as Beatrice.</span></span></p><p style=""border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: #2a2a2a; font-family: Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif, GNU Unifont;""><span style=""font-size: 15.12px;"">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=""border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px;""><span style=""color: #2a2a2a; font-family: Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif, GNU Unifont;""><span style=""font-size: 15.12px;"">A quiet girl who noticed the world too deeply and spoke too softly for it to reward her.

Rahu fuses Faimena and Urgula from deck to make Gulamel setting Horn and Flame, and finally use Urgula to bottom itself and add Faimena back to hand and Albion to set Fallen and the Virtuous in the End Phase.<br /><br />Fallen of White Dragon is a 1 card combo to make Eccelsia of the Black Dragon who can summon Cartesia from deck for more quick effect Fusions.&nbsp; Otherwise its pretty similar to the current builds, its just another layer of utility, and since Fallen can summon Ecclesia from grave she can start this combo going second or if you don't need your Normal for Lukias or Mululu.</p>"

Odion's strategy has surprisingly been incredibly competent even in the hyper competitive Duelist Cup defeating the likes of Dracotail, Mitsurugi and Maliss!<br /><br />Not only do you get to spam the field repeatedly with 2-3 Apophis the Swamp Deity's omni-negates, when paired with Statue of Anguish Pattern all these trap monsters become ""pops!"" All these cards are searchable and summonable turn 1 thanks to Odion's signature strategy, activating trap cards the same turn they were set with ""Temple of the Kings,"" another iconic piece of Yugioh anime history now suddenly made competitive!&nbsp;<br /><br />Just like the ""pure"" Odion deck, the main strategy is to dominate your opponent with multiple negate/pops with your Apophis trap cards. However, the difference is that Fiendsmith adds a whole new layer of interactions that your opponent has to deal with, either by baiting their handtraps or facing down Desirae's omni-negate If you thought Odion was strong, how about Odion AND the strongest engine in the format?</p><p>If you have any questions about this deck, feel free to ask me in the comments below!</p><p>GLHF Duelists!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

The deck's start is fragile, but if we know how to dodge interruptions and master it, it can still make its mark. Since September 2025, I have tested various lists to include the Jurrac lineup without giving up the cards that help us play second (HTs). This list is a return to the origins, when Fire King was played with the Pots. Avoid Fossil Dig, it often just makes us draw Droll and reduces the deck's flex. I keep Miscellaneousaurus, but not the Bridge that sends it to the graveyard, because to resolve Meteor we often have to sacrifice other crucial combo lines. The extra deck contains only what is necessary; the side deck offers powerful answers to decks that dominate this meta. Leave a comment with suggestions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Seems like one of the better ways to play the Hands. I'm also experimenting with including a full (albeit trimmed down) kashtira engine and making it 50 cards. They synergize really well, but my ratios were getting weird. Birth letting you normal summon the bigger hands is great. Still might be feasible. Need to do some testing to find out.</p><p>Decided not to run more than 1 of the Hand trap hand (Godos) as he is dead going first. Just a blank card to use for material. Seems decent going second though, so you could include more. I see some lists run 3, and it seems fine.</p>"

HANDS WILL WIN,"<p>Pretty fun list. Can put out some nice plays. Its a little stronger in Advanced, due to Coatl and Zombie Vampire, but the lower power level in Genesys more than makes up for it. You could easily switch emmisary of wax for more hand traps, but being able to stall an entire turn is pretty good in a more mid-range deck like this. It's also free tribute fodder, as the effect stays active even after it leaves the field.Extra deck XYZ are generic, and can be swapped. Do whatever for the side deck. Miradora is actually pretty good, as it is an extra 7 for your generic Xyz. I've also seen super polyy used, but that feels like more poiints than it is worth.&nbsp;</p>"

The format is weaker, and no one is really prepared for this deck or even really understands what it does.&nbsp;</p><p>The deck plays shifter to its benefit; you don't always want to activate it turn 1 in case you're going first and would rather have your ritual monsters in the grave, but it barely affects you going second and if your smaller rituals are banished after being properly summoned, they come back.&nbsp;</p><p>Points are on&nbsp;</p><p>3 Shifter, 3 Pre Preparation of Rites, 2 Preparation of Rites, 1 Ichiki Sayori Hime, 3 Manju the ten thousand hands</p><p>And 3 copies of Mulcharmy Fuwalos in the side</p><p>As I am running Manju and extra copies of Nikitama + Sakitama (both fairies), I managed to fit in playsets of Herald of Orange Light and Herald of Green Light. I wanted to try and fit in the shufflers too but the deck already struggles to function so it felt like a bridge too far.&nbsp;</p><p>With 2 Sakitama, 2 Nikitama, 1 Ichiki, 3 Manju, 6 Heralds, we are at 14 fairies to fuel their discard effect, so it seemed like a worthwhile option. We also have numerous searchers with Manju and the Prep cards so hopefully this will allow us to access our engine reliably.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually this deck is ran blind second because the two boss monsters are much better when they have targets to shuffle or bounce. In this instance I'm trying another tech option in two copies of the Vaylantz field spells, as each one sets the other to your opponents field. This allows you to have a valid target for Shinobaroness' powerful shuffle and summon from deck ability for a Turn 1 Amano Iwato that does not bounce back.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore your opponent has to have dark hole or imperm in order to use Monster Effects, or have an inherent summon that is 2000+ to out it.&nbsp;</p><p>Other options to consider are using 33 points on Terraforming for easier access to either Vaylantz or Shinobirds field spell, running 3 copies of everything relevant including Amano Iwato, or prioritising Called by the Grave at 20 points.&nbsp;</p><p>You could make a pure blind second version of the deck using your points on Super Poly, Droplet or more charmies.&nbsp;</p><p>There are lots of options. Code Igniter is a recent rank 4 that benefits the deck by allowing you to ritual summon with only rank 4s and a ritual monster&nbsp;</p>"

Now essential Albaz fusions like Titaniklad and Albion are cheaper or free points-wise, giving this beloved fusion strategy about 25 more points to play with!&nbsp;<br /><br />I've personally placed points on consistency combo pieces such as an additional Quem (3 points) and Bystial Saronir (a whopping 20 points)! I think it's justified to spend such a large amount of points on Saronir since it opens up combo routes with Granguignol/Albion the Shrouded Dragon.Quem to search out any Branded spell or trap, which usually is Branded Fusion. Consistency is king, since the strategy can already comfortably play going first of second!</p><p>Another incredible development (or lack there-of) from the December 2025 points list update is the lack of hits to the small Dracotail engine this deck uses (x1 Phryxul, x1 Urgula, x1 Pan, x3 Rahu, x1 Horn and x2 Gulamel). These cards remain free, while the only minor hit to the engine is just 3 points to Dracotail Flame, which Branded has plenty to use after the points update! Dracotail continues to allow the deck to plow through boards going second, since a single Rahu results in multiple destroyed cards, several set Dracotail spells/traps and a 2800ATK beatstick to beat over with in the battle phase.<br /><br />As for me, I'm farming my GENESYS Locals with this deck, I've been mostly undefeated so far with my results! You can do it too! :D<br /><br />Here is the main combo for GENESYS Branded featuring 1 Aluber, 1 monster and 2 discards:&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><p>1. Normal summon Aluber and activate Aluber's effect to search Branded Fusion.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Activate Branded Fusion to summon Albion, using Albaz and Phryxul from deck.&nbsp;</p><p>3. CL1 Albion to fusion summon Lubellion using Albaz + Aluber, CL2 Phryxul to set from deck Rahu Dracotail.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Activate Lubellion discarding 1 card fusion summon Mirrorjade using Lubellion + Albaz.&nbsp;</p><p>5. Activate Rahu Dracotail to fusion summon Gulamel, using any monster in hand and Dracotail Pan from deck.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Activate Pan's effect to set any Dracotail trap from deck (whatever is relevant to the matchup) and to destroy Albion on field.&nbsp;</p><p>7. During the End Phase, Albion adds to hand Branded Opening.&nbsp;</p><p>8. Activate Branded Opening to summon from deck Quem.&nbsp;</p><p>9. Activate Quem to send to GY Cartesia.&nbsp;</p><p>During your opponent's turn, Quem can summon Cartesia for further fusion plays, Mirrorjade can banish a monster and Dracotail trap with Gulamel's targeted destruction! This is the simplest combo, but stronger endboards can be made if you have the correct hand.&nbsp;<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

A lot of the decks that have A-to-Z either don't have a way to bring it out or just are pretty bad. This won't be the most meta deck, but it should be a fun way to get out beloved creatures. The side deck can allow you to focus more on ABC or the XYZ Hyper Dragon Cannon by swapping out the original pieces which are all Garnets. This is based on a deck I used in Master Duel, but I tried to modify it for the TCG. I have recently gotten back into paper, so I hope to get this tested more. Always open for feedback.</p><p>The main through line for this deck is to get X-Hyper Cannon out. Ideally its in your opening hand or you use Union Activation to throw X-Head Cannon into the GY and get it. You will search and attack B-Buster Drake and then special summon it. From there, link into Platinum Gadget and search for Y-Yare Head. Special summon it and then attach B-Buster Drake from the GY and special summon it again. Then Fusion Summon Union Controller by banishing Platinum Gadget and Y-Yare Head. Search for Union Hanger, play it, and then search for Z-Zillion Tank. When you summon Z-Zillion Tank, you will attach the banished Y-Yare Head and let the Union Hanger Trigger activate to add Union Driver. Then use Union Driver to switch to B-Buster Drake or one of the other ABCs. You will special summon it and Y-Yare Head and Y-Yare Head target B-Buster Drake (There will be a lot of it).</p><p>Using B-Buster Drake and A-Assualt Core, you will want to Link Summon Sillohoute Rabbit and set the continuous trap. Add any ABC or original XYZ monster(s) to your hand or graveyard. You can use two B-Buster Drakes as well, it is important to make sure to have two Light Monsters in your hand so manage your robots accordingly.</p><p>Use Y-Yare Head and Z-Zillion Tank to go into Galaxy Photon Dragon, it is important to use these two as if you use the other ABCs, they will not trigger their GY effects. Galaxy Photo Dragon will detach either monster to bring in Galaxy Soldier to your hand. You will discard a Light ABC or XYZ to bring out Galaxy Soldier and then use it's effect to bring in another. Xyz summon Cyber Dragon Nova and then Xyz Cyber Dragon Infinity.&nbsp;</p><p>Once there you can go a few different paths, if you have managed your XYZ materials accordingly, you should be able to bring out XYZ-Hyper Dragon Cannon while you only have two other monsters in the main monster zones. You will then use its effect to reveal the OG XYZ-Dragon Cannon and banish XYZ-Hyper Dragon Cannon to bring out the three pieces from the GY. Then banish the three OG to bring out XYZ-Dragon Cannon.</p><p>From there, you can banish ABC pieces to bring out ABC-Dragon Buster. Then if both are on the field, you can bring out A-to-Z Dragon Buster Cannon.&nbsp;</p><p>If you get Terraforming, it can help you bring out Union Hanger or more optiminally Therion Discolosseum to bring out Therion ""King"" Regulus. Equip him with a ABC based on what you need.</p><p>That is the main combo line. Depending on your opening hand and starter creatures, you can be a little flexible based on what you use. The Utopia Cards where added for an alternate monster if you get stalled in the combo or trying to bring it around with less than optimal cards. There might be better options, as I test it I will find out.</p>"

This gives you a Solemn, which is extra nice because it gives your endboard layering which you so desperately want.&nbsp; Specifically it lets you have a spell/trap negate *that isn't a monster effect* in play.&nbsp; with 2 omni negates&nbsp; 1 monster negate and a monster pop in your GY you're in a pretty scary position overall for many decks.&nbsp;<br /><br />in order to facilitate this instead of playing the classic 3 Fusion deployment 1 Cartesia, we instead play 3 Summoner monk and 1 more board breaker.<br /><br />The current theory is I'll either open medius or the field spell, if you open both you end up with a 4 negate endboard. though it kinda depends on how much you want to play around nibiru how much followup you have, the less you play around nibiru the stronger your endboard becomes.&nbsp;<br /><br />The ability to go from ""nib proof by weaker"" to ""oh my god wtf"" is actually really nice.&nbsp; you have the ability to make a 4 negate endboard which I say ""good luck :smile:<br /><br />One other option to consider in the extra deck is Guardian chimera,&nbsp; it allows for extra ceiling when going first and is an interesting multipop going second, especially combined w/ty-phon but ehh it's 33 points :/<br /><br />24 engine 16 non-engine but have strong ceiling anyway due to being able to convert non-engine to engine cheaply</p>"

Yami Marik uses a variety of cards to discard it to the Graveyard, e.g. ""Foolish Burial"" or ""Rope of Life"", and then revive it with ""Monster Reborn"". If ""Monster Reborn"" is not in his hand, he searches for it with ""Left Arm Offering"". He further relies on retrieving ""Monster Reborn"" to his hand after using it initially to continue to revive ""Ra"" again and again, using ""Magical Stone Excavation"" and ""Spell Reclamation"", which comes to replace the anime-only ""Zombie's Jewel"". Since ""Ra"" cannot be Special Summoned, three copies of ""Dark Spell Regeneration"" are run, that would allow for ""Ra"" to be brought back from the Graveyard using ""Monster Reborn"". Finally, ""Blaze Cannon"" and ""Sun God Unification"" are added to give ""Ra"" some of its anime effects and to allow Yami Marik to restore his Life Points before ""Ra"" leaves the field.</span></p>"

Overall great protections against destruction from either battle or card effects. No battle damage taken during battles. Use the opponent's ATK power against themselves. Lots of searching ability. Graveyard revivals and graveyard effects. Can easily 'snatch steal' opponent's monsters. Can easily wipe monster zones with kaijus and lava golem, removing those pesky negate cards. Pretty consistent and versatile with a handful of options and a modicum of control.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size: 24pt;""><strong>Goal:</strong></span> <br />Go second, wipe their board and tribute their strong effect monsters (especially negates) with your <strong>Kaijus</strong> or <strong>Lava Golem</strong>. Equip <strong>Double Edged Sword</strong> to your <strong>kaiju/golem</strong> or their strongest available ATK on the field, hit them multiple times in one turn (using <strong>Heavenly Gate</strong> field spell, or <strong>Uzuhime</strong>'s ability) for massive reflect damage and OTK.&nbsp;<br /><br />**<em>NOTE</em>: Due to Mikanko monsters' effects, the battle damage that you would normally take from attacking the opponent with a <strong>Double Edged Sword</strong> on their monster, is 'ALSO' reflected back to the opponent - essentially the damage they take is doubled. A single attack on a monster with 4000 or higher ATK wins the game, and 2000 of that atk power comes from the equip itself, so a 2k atk power monster left on the field can spell instant doom for the opponent**<br /><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 24pt;""><strong>Main combo: </strong></span>(TBA)<br /><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 24pt;""><strong>Secondary combos:</strong></span></p><p>Make use of <strong>Fire Dance</strong> with/and/or <strong>Sanaki</strong> to get multiple mikankos on the field in one turn. You can use <strong>Ha-Re</strong>'s ability to search for <strong>Fire Dance</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mikanko Rivalry</strong> trap can activate either <strong>Angelica's Ring</strong> (spell negate) or <strong>Axe of Fools</strong> (monster eff negate) during your opponent's turn.&nbsp;</p><p>Equip <strong>Water Arabesque</strong> to your <strong>kaijus/golem</strong> on the opponent's field to return them to your hand (usually after attacking them for battle damage, in MP2), get a free summon, and then be able to use their special summon tribute effects again in the same or next turn.

Your first goal is to do stupid broken stuff with Psychics, ideally ending on Psychic Blaster Mk-II / one of the Level 11 Synchros, and a Teleport Fusion. Your second goal is to do stupid broken stuff with Kashtiras, locking your opponent's field with Shangri-Ira, setting up a Fenrir and Unicorn, sitting on Ariseheart's big fat Macro, etc. In an ideal world, you're bridging between the two of these with cards like Parallel Teleport, to get the both of best endboards or, at the very least, a toolbox summon of any specific maindeck Kashtira during your opponent's turn. You also have a lot of flexibility to go into other lines, with Prototype Psychic Blaster letting you get Psychic Blaster Mk-II out without using your Silent Psychic Magician for the turn, the Kashtiras letting you easily go into Baronne or Chengying, etc. There's significant room to improve this specific list, though.</p>"

Here is a cook using the fact the best Centur-ion starter is a Dark Pyro.,"<p>This is a deck I have build to try and make Ashened work. originally I played with Volcanic, but I found that the ceiling was just to low and was looking at Pyro's that could be searched with Infernal Flame Banshee and found Trudea.&nbsp;<br /><br />The lines are highly varried as if you find one starter or the other the lines completely change. The locks of the Ashened cards can make it so you can't synchro as there are no Pyro Synchro monsters that have any value yet, but you can still use the Centur-Ion cards to set up a Synchro summon on your opponents turn.<br /><br />You can if you wish to focus more on the Centur-ion part, remove the super poly's to instead play Auxila and have more points for possible hand traps. Since I found you sometimes get locked out of the Centur-ion synchro's I found it wasn't worth the 33 points to play. If it ever gets cheaper that will definitely be worth it. I am also not sure on the centur-ion spell/traps to play, currently I play 1 of each except the token generator but you can swap these around for sure.<br /><br />Finally the extra deck can probably be improved, if you do not wish to focus on super poly and instead go more Centur-ion focus, you can absolutely play more synchro monsters for the Centur-ion tool box.<br /><br />Pyros!</p>"
