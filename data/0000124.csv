Top tier meta contender in the OCG, soon to be TCG.","Fuck the other Invoked variants, we have small children with disturbing eldlich monstrosities. The children part is meta in the OCG, and i'm betting it's gonna be meta in Amurica once the rule of Dragon Link falls. But here I  made a deck to show off the capabilities of it. AKA a cool fusion/link deck that shits out fusion/link fodder, makes big monsters, and then slowly realizes on turn 40 that it has no other game plan because Battle Butler is hard to make use of (would appreciate suggestions on how to re-use him after tributing him, thankies). Jokes aside, the Prankids spam out resourcse to make big monsters with okay effects, and the Invokeds fuse together to steal opponent's cards as they fuse. The main synergy comes in the varying attributes of the Prankids, unlocking many fusions for you to go into, and the fact that they're both meta fusion archetypes. Anyway, deck list. 3 Rocksies- Key component of the small children, provides draw and fodder 3 Lampies- Fodder and burn, another key component 3 Dropsies- A effect Dzeef would hate, with more fodder 3 Fansies- Graveyard setup and fodder 3 Aleister- Key component of Invoked engine, mainly used to fuse together 3 Ash- can put a chokehold on a lot of decks, as most decks search heavily 2 Ogre- nice monster removal that can get annoying stuff like that weird synchro Borreload away 3 Ghost Belle- underapreciated ghost girl, shut's down a lot of decks 3 Prank Kids Prank- Graveyard set up and more fodder, but also allows you to re-use resources and draw 3 Prank Kids Place- Good searcher with some okay stat changing effects, although they can help to beat over problem monsters like Dragoon or the weird synchro Borreload 3 Prank Kids Pandemonium- The archetypal fusion spell, fantastic card, although it locks you into Prank Kids so i reccomend getting your Invokeds out first 3 Invocation- oh, you think that's your Ash? you mind if I just, make a Purgatrio with it? 1 Instant Fusion- gets out Raidjin and some of the Prankids fusions to start off or extend combos 3 Desires- Great draw spell, although cost is heavy, lookin at you Johnny 2 Prank Kids Plan- some battle protection and link summoning, not very good i probably should've cut it lol Extra Deck Bullshit 2 Battle Butler- 3k beater with a raigeki and resource recovery and a badass name. Just unsure how to make more use of it since he has to tribute himself to use this effect. I really wanna make a loop of him tbh since he's not a once per turn 2 Rocket Ride- Insta target, gets out more resources you already spent and gets out a little damage sometimes 2 Weather Washer- Other insta target with an okay-ish effect, only really good as a secondary option to Rocket imo 1 Elysium- great target to build up into, can destroy boards 1 Magellanica- 3k beater, wish Aleister would've become a cat girl instead of this but eh 1 Mechaba- GY setup and negates 1 Augodies- Dunno how to spell it's name but, can remove monsters and grow to be a big beater 1 Purgatrio- beefy beater against swarm decks, great target to use with your opponent's Ash Blossom 1 Roarin Rooster- Feather Duster on legs, and monster recovery. Link version of Butler basically 1 Bow Wow Bark- Monster recovery yet again 1 Dodo-Doodle-Doo- Spell recovery which is really nice in a fusion archetype, and general resource recovery. Playing guide This deck isn't super complex or anything. You want to link climb with the Prankids to get to the link-4, and use the Prankids effect to garner more resources as they're linked away. Use the resources gathered by the linked Prankids to fuse into a Battle Butler, and then use your opponent's cards (and probably hand traps lol) against them as you go into a Invoked monster, hopefully Mechaba for negates or Purgatrio against swarm decks. Afterwards, rip and tear your opponent (hopefully by the effect of Place) until you eventually get them in OTK range and win. (Things to note! Going second is best, and you should definetly run TTT  in case your opponent hand traps any of your Prankid's resource garnering effects. My dumbass forgot to run it. If you decide to play this deck, run TTT instead of Plan.)"

DESTROYS DRAGOON AND BUSTER LOCK! OUTS DRAGON LINK!!!!!! 3x Aleister- part of the invoked engine, serves to make some fusions for us as well literally all the non ritual Impcantations- i'm not gonna go through all them, they do the same thing. They fetch more Imps from the deck to provide mass fodder to get out your Hungry Burger and finally get some meaning in your worthless wife. 3x Ash- Cripples a lot of meta decks that this is gonna be playing against, as they're all very search heavy 3x Invocation- Other part of the Invoked engine, steal your opponent's monsters to fuse 3x Hamburger Recipe- OH, YOU GOT APPOLUSA???? HUNGRY BURGER MOTHER FUCKER 3x Inception- Serves to get out Chalislime and Crealtar with the leftovers that you didn't tribute for Hungryburger. 1x Instant Fusion- gets out an easy card like Raidjin or Caliga to screw over the opponent, and fodder to tribute for Hungry 3x TTT- The mass amount of SS from the deck due to the Imps can be negated heavily by ash, so TTT helps us gain advantage off of that The extra deck~ 2 Elysium- great target to build up into, can destroy boards 2  Magellanica- 3k beater, wish Aleister would've become a cat girl instead of this but eh 2  Mechaba- GY setup and negates 2 Augodies- Dunno how to spell it's name but, can remove monsters and grow to be a big beater 2 Purgatrio- beefy beater against swarm decks, great target to use with your opponent's Ash Blossom 2 Raidjin- Book of moon on legs, screws over problem cards 2 Cocytus- Big wall l0l 1 Caliga- big floodgate that can easily stop the opponent since Hungry is a vanilla monster playing guide Why do I do these things? Basically, you'll want to start by normal summoning Aleister, and getting the search, and fusing into whatever you need. Due to the Imp's restriction's, you need to do this first before you do your other plays. Once you're done with your Invoked bullshit, you  spam the Imp's hand effects to swarm the field heavily with a ton of the imps. Then tribute into our boy Hungry. Afterwards, use the leftovers (if you can) for Chalislime and/or Crealtar. Then OTK like a chad. Any suggestions are appreciated. This deck is gonna top the next YCS. Just watch it."

Doki Doki can be played at any number for magnet decks, but if you plan to use the normal monsters in your deck, 2-3 of these really help get them out of your hand and into your grave, <strong>where they belong.</strong> the card also synergizes great with Sentry Soldier of Stone (played at 2), as one Doki Doki can discard it and instantly you have 3 monsters on the field for link summons and xyzs, possibly more if Doki Doki summoned Gamma while you have another Magnet Warrior in the hand, <em>or</em> Delta while Magnetic Field is out.  finally onto Delta, its main effect (hard once per turn) dumps a level 4 or lower Magnet Warrior from your deck straight to your grave, which is where the fun begins. Electromagnet Warriors thrive off of being in the grave, as they can be summoned back with Magnetic Field to do their magic, or more importantly be sent their as material to summon Berserkion <em>or</em> give an already summoned Berserkion more material to ruin your opponent's field with.  the normal monster Magnet Warriors are completely optional, as they can be cumbersome in the hand and can lead to inconsistency, but they're suprisingly versatile when combined with other cards. discard fodder for Doki Doki, can be summoned with Gamma if your hand's lacking Electromagnets or for a quick Knightmare link summon, optimal targets for Delta's destruction effect to prevent banishing Electromagnets needed to summon Berserkion, you name it. i haven't had too much consistency problems myself with 6 of these, but be wary of using more than that.  Magnetic Field adds tons of utility to your plays. being able to summon Electromagnets back from the grave really broadens your options, and also has a neat effect where if <em>any</em> monster in this deck (aside from handtraps but you get what i mean) battles or is battled, and the opponent's monster is still on the field, it goes straight back to the hand, or the extra deck if it came from there.  as for handtraps, i reiterate that i got my roots in yugioh from duel links, so i have <em>no idea</em> what's the best ones to run, same goes for tech cards like Called By The Grave or Infinite Impermanence or whatever. i just kinda put whatever seemed like good cards into this and ran with it. <em>This and Extra Deck cards need suggestions.</em>  now, i know what you've been thinking, <strong>""what are you doing playing enemy controller this isn't duel links you foolish child""</strong>, and my answer to that is Econ's take ability is underrated, can do some absolutely wack things, especially in the middle of your opponent's turn. it's also nice to have another layer of protection against attacks. it's <em>totally</em> not just in because i have no idea what other tech cards to put in, <em>totally.</em>  and now, we get to Polymerization and the massive lad that is <em>Imperion Magnum the Superconductive Battlebot.</em> using 2 of Valkyrion and Berserkion in the deck means that you'd have to have a miracle to summon a third Imperion in one duel, so while Magnum is played at 2, Polymerization could be played at 2 or 3, dependeing on how dependent you want to be on using Imperion over Berserkion. Magnum here can be considered the <em>magnum</em> opus of the Magnet Warrior archetype, with a stupidly huge 4000 atk and def, an omni (i think) negate once per turn, and a float effect similar to Berserkion's. it can be very hard for your opponent to handle an Imperion, especially since you can still fill up your field for link summons and xyzs, but make sure not to waste your omni negate and leave it open to destruction, and if you have a second Poly in your hand you should avoid summoning Berserkion or Valkyrion so Magnum's float works properly in the case it is destroyed, letting you use Berserkion pops before using Poly again for another Imperion. just make sure your second Magnum doesn't get destroyed too, because once you've used up both Valks and Berserks, the float effect doesn't work  every link monster is new to me, so i have no idea which ones to choose in particular. just went with common link monsters like Knightmares and Borrel Dragons. xyzs are just generic rock support. <em>This and Handtraps/Tech cards need suggestions.</em>  <em>don't even get me started on side decks</em>  &nbsp;  welp, here's the first draft of the Magnet Warrior Bible. hey, at least i can link this in future itterations of my magnet decks for those that have <em>no idea</em> how to play magnets. if you just tl;dr'd my whole explanation, i need help with what handtraps, tech, and extra deck monsters to use, so please give suggestions to me, if you couldn't tell by now i'm desperate <strong>please i have no idea what support cards are good for this</strong>"

This is my 50th deck, and this includes a list of every card used, and why I use them, as well as ","<span>I can't believe it's finally time! Deck number 50! I will surely be making more decks, so don't worry. Anyways, Paleozoic Frogs are my favorite deck in the game. They’re a blast to play, and are a relatively unique deck in the game. It is one that I myself recommend you to play, so I am here to show off my list, along with explanations for cards and what not. Let’s begin! Starting with...</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>The Monsters:</strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Swap Frog: Swap Frog is one of 3 frog monsters used in this deck, and for good reason. It’s an easy card to summon, and when summoned, has the ability to send a frog to your GY, which is likely to be Ronintoadin. If the card was special summoned with its own effect, you can send a Ronintoadin to your GY, in order to summon it, banishing the monster sent to the GY for Swap Frog’s special summon. Then, you can easily go into Toadally Awesome.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Dupe Frog: Dupe Frog is the second of the 3 main deck frogs you’ll see in this deck. While its effect is not the greatest, as it is a “when” effect, and thus has the ability to miss timing if it is used as link material, or something of the sort. However, of all the other frogs (that are not Swap Frog and Ronintoadin), it is the best. (Also its art is adorable, look at him, he’s graduating college. Tell him that you are proud in the comments or else.)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Ronintoadin: Last, and certainly not least, we have Ronintoadin, the second best of the 3 main deck frogs! If it is in your GY, you can banish one of your other frogs to special summon it! This effect is NOT limited to once per turn, fortunately, and you can do some amazing plays with this card!</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Spells/Traps:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Imperial Order: Imperial Order is unfortunately limited, and for good reason. Blocking out spells for little cost is ridiculous, as many decks rely on their spell cards to actually function. While this card requires you to pay 700 LP every Standby Phase, that isn’t much of an issue, as you should be finishing games before that turns into an issue.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Solemn Judgment: Solemn Judgement; the most iconic of the solemn trap cards, is also one of the most useful, as it negates any summon, spell, or trap. While the cost of paying half your LP may seem large, it in reality is not, as the card can never kill you, and LP do not matter all that much.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Solemn Strike: Strike has a slight edge over Judgement, as it can negate monster effects, whereas Judgement was unable to. However, that is, truthfully, its only edge. It’s the worst Solemn trap card featured in this deck, but it is still good.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Solemn Warning: Definitely the second best solemn trap card. This has the ability to negate not only summons, but cards/effects that have effects to special summon. This means that this card is capable of negating things like Red-Eyes Fusion for a less steep cost than Judgement. But, considering that this can only negate summons, Judgement slightly beats it in terms of versatility.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Infinite Impermanence: For any deck that uses trap cards, Infinite Impermanence is a must-have staple card, and that definitely applies here. This card not only functions as a hand trap, but as a generally useful negation card. You WANT to open this card, as it lets you stop your opponent’s plays on turn 1. If your opponent plays a deck reliant on a lot of continuous spells/traps (or spells and traps in general), you can bait them into playing into the Imperm Column.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Canadia: This card functions as a sort of pseudo Book of Moon. This card, being a terror in Duel Links, is also incredible in this deck, as it can function as non-removal removal, ignoring things such as destruction protection, and whatnot. But, there are some more useful Paleozoic traps, believe it or not. So now, we shall move on.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Dinomischus: Dinomisc (not Miscellaneousaurus), is on the higher end of trap cards in general, and is heavily boosted due to the fact it is a Paleozoic trap card. Its effect provides useful removal, being able to rid problem cards from your opponent’s board, or to banish combo pieces away to potentially wreck your opponent’s plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Paleozoic Hallucigenia: This is not the most useful of the Paleozoic traps, but it can be useful in a pinch. However, this card is mainly used for the effect is has in the GY, which is shared by all Paleozoics, and to trigger other Paleozoic cards from the GY, as its effect doesn’t waste any important resources.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Paleozoic Marrella: This card can set up your GY with some other Paleozoic cards, or  can be used for deck-thinning purposes. But, this isn’t the most useful in this deck, as you shouldn’t need to send Paleozoics to the GY.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Olenoides: Olenoides, or Olen for short, acts as this card’s main way to remove spells and traps, functioning as an MST of sorts. This can easily remove problem cards from your opponent’s field, be it a pesky Mystic Mine, or a dreaded backrow card. This is one of the 3 “better” Paleozoic cards, and is a staple 3 of in any Paleo Frog list.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Trap Trick: Ah, Trap Trick,  you remind me of a specific archetype… but what could it be? Nonetheless, Trap Trick is an incredible card for this deck, allowing you to search things such as Infinite Impermanence, or your Paleozoic cards, and then it allows you to activate it on that turn. The one downside this card has is that you can only activate 1 trap card after it is used, but that isn’t that much of an issue, truthfully.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Warning Point: This card is just… wow. It’s an amazing trap card. Not only does this thing negate effects, it essentially makes the monster useless, especially if it is normal summoned. Not only is this thing searchable by Trap Trick, increasing its versatility tenfold, it’s not limited to once per turn, letting you absolutely destroy your opponent’s plays, better than almost any other card in this deck. What was Konami thinking when they created this powerhouse?</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder: At this point, are you surprised this is in a deck I made? This card is probably one of the best XYZ monster in the format, and instantly increases the consistency of any XYZ based deck. But, in this deck, you won’t be wanting to immediately go into ZEUS. It’s more of a situational card here, that you’ll only want to use sometimes, as the other XYZ monsters are just plain better for what this deck tries to do.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Paleozoic Anomalocaris: I more so run this card to humor the Paleozoic archetype. You don’t want to be using this card all that much, but it is an option. While it may be able to pop a card on the field, it isn’t worth the effort to summon this thing. Especially when one of its “advantages” is having more ATK than its superior counterpart, Opabinia.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 45 Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition: That’s a long name, huh? Number 45 is mainly used for its effect to block effects of cards, and cards with that same name. This can be extremely effective against things like Cyber Dragon, but like the above 2 XYZ monsters, is quite situational in this deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Toadally Awesome: Oh boy, here we go! This card is what makes this deck possible. When you get Toadally Awesome on board, you are automatically at an advantage. This thing not only generates advantage, but allows you to negate, and steal your opponent’s cards. So if they use a lot of staple spells and traps, you’ll be sure to steal it with this frightening amphibian(s)! During the Standby Phase, the best target for its effect is Dupe Frog (on your opponent’s turn) and Swap Frog (on your turn). If you can protect the frogs summoned by this, you can summon another Toad for absolutely free, allowing you to set up more rank 2 plays. This card, when sent to the GY, can also recycle itself, so if you tribute it for its own negation effect, you can just put it right back into the Extra Deck! The best cards to use for this are your Paleozoic trap cards, as when they are detached as XYZ material, they do not get banished, due to the ruling that XYZ materials are not considered to be on the field (which comes up a lot more than you think it would). Overall, Toadally Awesome is a totally awesome card, and makes this deck function. Bless you, you beautiful bastards. Edit: Toad has been freed! As it is now unlimited, this deck runs 3 of them! Hooray!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Sky Cavalry Centaurea: This card actually serves as a really good removal card, and isn’t as situational as you think it would be. Its effect does not target, and bypasses destruction. This is the main card you want to use to be able to bring out your ZEUS, as its effect occurs during the Battle Phase when it attacks (or is attacked).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin: This card is primarily used in a similar manner to Number 45, serving as a situational pseudo Infinite Impermanence.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cat Shark: Cat Shark is one of the better rank 2s in this deck, and is primarily used towards the end of the game, as this card creates potential for a large number of OTKs, and lets your Toadally Awesome(s) beat over cards it otherwise could not have defeated by itself, and provides you with large attack stats in order to quickly finish a game.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Paleozoic Opabinia: This is the 2nd best XYZ monster in the deck, only being beaten out by Toadally Awesome. The fact that it not only can search Paleozoic trap cards, but allows you to activate them from the hand (granting them a bit of protection from basic s/t removal, and making your opponent unsure if you have any trap cards to activate). You will always want to go into this card after summoning a Toadally Awesome if you can do so.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Unicorn: Do I really need to explain why Knightmare Unicorn is so good? It provides non-destruction removal for little to no cost, and backs it up with a pretty decent body. It may be a tad bit tricky to summon at times, but it’s usually worth it for removing problem cards/monsters that would otherwise be hard to get rid of.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Marincess Coral Anemone: Originally this spot was taken up by Number 29 Mannequin Cat, but considering that this card is much less situational, and is more useful in a deck like this, allowing you to recover things such as Paleozoic Opabinia, Mistar Boy, and your frog monsters for free. This card is a staple in any deck revolving around WATER monsters, and it’s truly criminal that it hasn’t seen that much play.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Mistar Boy: One of the better cards in the deck, this will very likely be a part of your endboard, as this not only provides your WATER monsters increased power, but has a floating effect to recover your monsters in the GY if it is destroyed. This card provides incredible amounts of utility for this deck, and is a must have for Paleo Frogs.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Side Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Gravedigger's Trap Hole: A generic trap card for opponents whose decks are very handtrap heavy. Not only does it negate, but it does a massive chunk of burn damage, which is actually very useful (considering the amount it does).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Ice Dragon's Prison: It’s a staple trap card, and provides great removal, or even material for your XYZ/link monsters.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Paleozoic Hallucigenia: Another copy in case you wanted to side in more.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Paleozoic Marrella: Same as above.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Pikaia: Couldn’t really find much use for Pikaia in the main deck, as its effects don’t give as much utility as something like Olenoides or Dinomisc. But, it is still a good Paleozoic card, and deserves to be put in the Side Deck for that reason alone. (Also Pikaia just sounds like a weird Pokemon ngl)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x White Howling: Really good spell negation, however Imperial Order is better. But, if you do want to have more negates on spell cards, this is the way to go. I myself have used it in many matches, and it has won me a lot of games.</span>  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  <span>Oh boy! We’re finally done with all of the card explanations! Now onto more explaining… how fun. Starting with:</span>  &nbsp;  <span><span>Potential Questions:</span><span> </span><span> </span></span>  <span><span>Q. Why do you not run Treeborn Frog?</span></span>  <span>A. It doesn’t do well with this deck, as it requires you to have no spells or traps on field to activate it, which is the opposite of what this deck tries to have on board. Also, its level doesn’t synergize well with any of the other cards.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Q. Why do you run Paleozoic Anomalocaris if you claim it to be bad?</span>  <span>A. While Anomalocaris isn’t the greatest, it does serve a niche in this deck that is nice to be filled.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Q. Why do you not run Barrier Statue Of The Torrent?</span>  <span>A. It would take up space used for things such as Warning Point, or the Solemn trap cards, and isn’t really necessary for this variant of Paleozoic Frogs.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><span>Q. Why do you say ZEUS is situational?</span><span> </span></span>  <span><span><span>A. This deck wants a strong board presence, as that is how most of its negates are able to exist. ZEUS wipes the board.</span> </span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Q. Frog?</span>  <span>A. Frog.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>Strategies: </span></strong><span> </span><span>This list (and Paleozoic Frogs in general) is a control deck, and is centered around disrupting, and ruining, your opponent’s plays through the work of trap cards, and Toadally Awesome. Examples of potential plays/combos:</span></span>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li><span>Special summon Swap Frog from hand, by sending a Dupe Frog to the GY, then use its summon effect to send Ronintoadin from your deck to the GY.</span></li>  	<li><span>Normal summon Swap Frog from hand, and use its summon effect to send Dupe Frog to GY.</span></li>  	<li><span>Link summon Marincess Coral Anemone using the 2 Swap Frogs.</span></li>  	<li><span>Use the effect of Marincess Coral Anemone to special summon a Swap Frog from your GY.</span></li>  	<li><span>Use the effect of Swap Frog on summon to send Ronintoadin to the GY.</span></li>  	<li><span>Special summon Ronintoadin by banishing a Dupe Frog.</span></li>  	<li><span>Link summon Mistar Boy by using Swap Frog and Ronintoadin as materials.</span></li>  	<li><span>Special summon 2 Ronintoadin from your GY by banishing 2 of your frogs.</span></li>  	<li><span>XYZ summon Toadally Awesome</span></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span>Another combo (this one is more simple, and you are much likelier to get this than the last):</span>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li><span>Special summon Swap Frog by sending either Dupe Frog or Ronintoadin to the GY, then use its summon effect to send the other of the 2 frogs from deck to GY.</span></li>  	<li><span>Special summon Ronintoadin.</span></li>  	<li><span>XYZ summon Toadally Awesome.</span></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span><span>Anyways, onto a guide of how to play this!</span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>This deck, as stated before, is a control deck, so you want to disrupt your opponent the best you can using your trap cards. Things such as Paleozoic Canadia, Warning Point, Solemn Warning, and Paleozoic Dinomischus are great reactions to your opponent’s normal summon, and many work on special summons. The best reaction to a special summon (primarily to a big combo piece, such as Romulus for Dragon Link) is Infinite Impermanence, however Solemn Warning can do what Imperm tries to do as well. Then, you’ll be wanting to use your Paleozoic trap cards from the GY to special summon themselves as monsters, in order to go into XYZ plays (primarily for Toadally Awesome). If you get Swap Frog, but no other monsters, normal summon it, use the effect to mill Ronintoadin, and use the other effect to return it to hand. (The return to hand is cost, so it can’t be negated).</span>"

It goes second. You don't have to rely on<strong> Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</strong> to start your plays since you can just go through the regular <strong>Crusadia</strong> link climb without it. However, starting off with <strong>Slumber</strong> and<strong> Kyoutou Waterfront</strong> allow you to get your plays off more frequently and using less resources.  Your general maindeck <strong>Crusadia</strong> package is playsets of <strong>Arboria</strong>, <strong>Draco</strong>, and <strong>Maximus</strong>.<strong> Crusadias</strong> summon themselves to a link zone so you want to have as many of them with different names in your hand. <strong>Arboria</strong> is <strong>Balelynx</strong>, <strong>Draco</strong> recycles<strong> Crusadias</strong> to hand, and <strong>Maximus</strong> doubles your <strong>Equimax's</strong> damage. <strong>Leonis</strong> can be played, but he doesn't bring that much to the table as he only gives piercing damage. <strong>Reclusia</strong> can definitely be sided for some removal, but you rather use it for link climbing instead and it doesn't contribute to making your plays that much either.  Your <strong>Kaiju</strong> package consists of 3 <strong>Radian</strong> and 3 <strong>Gameciel</strong>. <strong>Radian</strong> can be used as generic removal since he is a <strong>Kaiju</strong> or he can be used as a target for <strong>Slumber</strong>. If you control him, he can be used to boost your<strong> Crusadias'</strong> ATK. <strong>Gameciel</strong> is also removal, but he is probably the best card in the deck no joke. If you have <strong>Waterfront</strong> on the field, your link climbing generates enough <strong>Kaiju Counters</strong> to have <strong>Gameciel</strong> be at least 3 or even 4 negates in response to your opponent's board, handtraps, and their backrow. If you summon using <strong>Slumber</strong> on an automatic simulator, often times, the first kaiju you pick is summoned to your field, so you have to pick <strong>Gameciel</strong> first. You can play other <strong>Kaijus</strong> like <strong>Thunder King</strong> or <strong>Dogoran</strong> instead of <strong>Radian</strong>, but <strong>Radian</strong> has the potential to just have you gain more advantage when it comes to using your <strong>Crusadias'</strong> ATK gaining effects.  Other cards in the maindeck include <strong>World Legacy - ""World Crown""</strong> and a <strong>Magicians' Souls</strong> package. <strong>World Crown</strong> is a pseudo-<strong>Crusadia</strong> as it does summon itself to a link zone. It acts as a negate for Extra Deck monsters which is another layer of protection during your link climbing. You have a lot of spells in this deck, so you can use <strong>Magicians' Souls</strong> to draw into more <strong>Crusadias</strong> or into extending enablers. If there is ever a Spellcaster<strong> Kaiju</strong>, you can say goodbye to <strong>Apprentice Illusion</strong> in the deck.  Your field spells consist of <strong>Kyoutou Waterfront</strong> and <strong>Crusadia Revival</strong>. <strong>Waterfront</strong> is your enabler of your <strong>Kaiju</strong> plays and <strong>Revival</strong> makes one of your<strong> Kaiju</strong> links into a <strong>UCT</strong>. <strong>Terraforming</strong> is here to search for the previously mentioned <strong>Kyoutou Waterfront</strong> and <strong>Crusadia Revival</strong>. <strong>Slumber</strong> is monster removal and gets you to your<strong> Kaijus</strong>.<strong> Crusadia Testament</strong> is a target for <strong>Leonix</strong> if you have access to <strong>Revival</strong> already. You want <strong>Revival</strong> more than <strong>Testament</strong> in most situations. <strong>World Legacy Succession</strong> is just for extending. <strong>Pot of Desires</strong> and <strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong> are your draw engine to get into extenders.  Your Extra Deck is all link monsters since you aren't summoning anything else. <strong>Knightmare</strong> package of course. <strong>Crusadia</strong> Link package: 3 <strong>Magius</strong>, 1 <strong>Spatha</strong>, 3 <strong>Leonix</strong>, and 3 <strong>Equimax</strong>. <strong>Magius</strong> and <strong>Leonix</strong> search extenders while <strong>Equimax</strong> is your monster you are relying on to OTK. <strong>Spatha</strong> is very conditional. It moves a monster to a different zone. It isn't that relevant in <strong>Kaiju Crusadia</strong> as it is in <strong>Mekk-Knight Crusadia</strong>. <strong>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</strong> can be taken out, but it is sort of a last ditch effort to wall-up if you make it using a <strong>Kaiju</strong> or some other lvl 7 or higher monster. <strong>Borrelsword</strong> you can make if you can't finish your opponent turn 2 and it goes back to you on turn 4. <strong>Avramax</strong> is another option for you to go into to wall-up.  Side deck is to tech against certain decks going second. <strong>Nibiru</strong> to prevent large negate boards. <strong>Phantazmay</strong> to gain advantage against link decks. <strong>Token Collector</strong> is a body for link material and it prevents your opponent doing <strong>Linkross</strong>/<strong>Auroradon</strong> plays and you don't get <strong>Nibirued</strong>. <strong>Called By the Grave</strong> as another option to protect your plays from getting handtrapped. <strong>Harpies' Feather Duster</strong> to out backrow. <strong>Impermanences</strong> to disrupt your opponent and <strong>Red Reboot</strong> to prevent getting hit by a trap.  Things that you can choose to put in this deck are things that can just summon themselves from hand or grave. <strong>Pankratops</strong> is definitely a good card to put into the deck. <strong>Gamma</strong> is also an option, but it is very clunky in the deck."

Iyvanne summons a token when equipped with noble arms, then use the token and medraut to go into isolde.  On her summon add brothers to your hand or custennin depending on what you have currently.  With isolde's second effect, yeet another 4 noble arms to the GY and summon borz.  Then use iyvanne and borz to go into rank 4 artorigus.  From there use his summon effect to equip 3 noble arms, depending on the situation and the opponent's deck.  if you can use glory to equip a fourth noble arms and set the until the noble arms are needed once again, it is recomended that you do.  &nbsp;  The cards in the deck vary from combo pieces to removal options and adds.  &nbsp;  This is my favourite archetype and one of my favourite decks.

This deck might not be the best evilswarm but its something i hope this deck will make people stop looking down on them. evil swarms are ment to be in other archtypes but this one might change that a little.

After watching a championship video, I saw that a lot of the cards they used wouldn't be able to stand up against a single Lunalight Leo Dancer, except Ultimate Conductor Tyranno. So, I decided to make a deck that could consistently get out Leo Dancer and some other cards while still being able to push through some negates. This dack is not as good as I originally thought, though it is getting better. Right now this deck is on Update 1. Anyway, now the deck:</span>  <span>This deck is supposed to, as I already said, get out Lunalight Leo Dancer. It can do this in a ton of different ways, and does not require a specific huge combo like the World Lock Isolde Combo deck I saw. So, I will just explain the purpose of the cards in the deck:</span>  <span><span>Main Deck</span></span>  <span><span>Lunalight Monsters:</span></span>  <span>3x Lunalight Wolf: Wolf is a great monster used to fusion summon using your graveyard. Is very useful when combined with Lunalight Kaleido Chick.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight Crimson Fox: Crimson Fox is useful to change your opponent's monsters to 0 ATK and negate an effect that targets your Lunalight cards to mess up your plays.</span>  <span>1x Lunalight Blue Cat: Blue Cat is nice for increasing your monster's attack, although I only have 1 because it is not extremely useful.</span>  <span>3x Lunalight Kaleido Chick: Kaleido Chick is basically the heart of the Lunalight archetype. It is useful in </span><i><span>so</span></i><span> many ways! One: It allows you to skip steps in your fusion summoning. By sending Panther Dancer to the GY, you are able to use Kaleido Chick itself as Panther Dancer or use Wolf to banish Panther Dancer to get Leo Dancer. Or, if you can you could do both! Also, the effect of sending the card to the GY is the requirement, so Infinite Impertinence is basically useless against it if you have a Wolf. Two: It allows you to recycle your Polymerization. Three: When it is banished, say by Wolf or Allure of Darkness, it prevents your opponent from activating effects during the battle phase of annoying cards like Quaking Mirror Force or D.D. Warrior.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight Emerald Bird: Emerald Bird is useful on the Normal or Special Summon to discard a card like Lunalight Yellow Martin or Lunalight Serenade Dance, and then pick up a new card to replace it. It is also nice when sent to the Graveyard, as you can recycle Kaleido Chicks and Yellow Martins.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight Yellow Martin: Yellow Martin is great for searching out Lunalight Fusion, or, if you can discard it, Lunalight Serenade Dance. Yellow Martin is also useful to return Emerald Birds or Kaleido Chicks back to your hand to use next turn, or just give you and extra material to fusion summon with.</span>  <span>1x Lunalight Purple Butterfly: Purple Butterfly is kind of like Blue Cat, but it can banish itself from your GY to special summon a Lunalight monster from your hand. It can be useful in certain situations, but again, like Blue Cat, is not useful enough to have more than one copy.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight White Rabbit: White Rabbit is good for getting Rid of your opponent's back row of spell/trap cards, although it only returns them to the hand. It can also be useful to get back Lunalight monsters from your GY.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight Black Sheep: Finally, the last Lunalight monster! Black Sheep is useful for searching out a polymerization or recycling Lunalight cards. Although that is pretty much it to Black Sheep, it is a useful enough effect to have two of it.</span>  <span><span>Lunalight Spell/Traps:</span></span>  <span>Luna Light Perfume is technically not a ""Lunalight"" spell card, so it will be in the ""Other Spells"" section.</span>  <span>3x Lunalight Fusion: The Fusion Summoner of the Lunalights. Lunalight Fusion is a nice card that allows you to, if your opponent controls a monster from the Extra Deck, use a monster from your Deck or Extra Deck as material, so you can pull out a Leo Dancer using a Panther Dancer from your Extra Deck. There really isn't much more to say about it.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight Serenade Dance: Used mostly for its Special Summon ability in your GY, Serenade Dance can easily pull out a Kaleido Chick or, if you want, an Emerald Bird. It can also be useful when you summon a fusion monster, but that is not its main purpose in this deck.</span>  <span><span>Other Monsters:</span></span>  <span>1x Shaddoll Beast: Shaddoll Beast is good for drawing a card, and summoning El Shaddoll Winda &amp; El Shaddoll Construct.</span>  <span>1x Shaddoll Hedgehog: Another Shaddoll monster for Winda &amp; Construct, Hedgehog can also potentially be used to search out a Shaddoll Fusion or another Shaddoll monster.</span>  <span>1x Shaddoll Falco: Yet another material for Winda &amp; Construct, this birdy can also provide some extra protection in tight situations.</span>  <span>2x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring: Obviously, Ash Blossom is used to negate what your opponent does on their turn.</span>  <span><span>Other Spells:</span></span>  <span>2x Luna Light Perfume: Perfume is a nice card to search out Lunalight Wolf or another Lunalight monster you really need at the time. It can also come in handy to revive some of your previously used Lunalights. Sadly, Luna Light Perfume is not technically a Lunalight card, so it cannot be searched with Yellow Martin.</span>  <span>2x Allure of Darkness: Allure of Darkness s useful for draw power, and can be used to banish Kaleido Chick to use its banished ability.</span>  <span>1x Polymerization: The classic fusion spell that can be searched with Black Sheep.</span>  <span>1x Foolish Burial: Foolish Burial can be used to mill Yellow Martin to get Lunalight Fusion, or to mill Shaddoll Beast for a draw, or to mill any other monster you want.</span>  <span>2x Foolish Burial Goods: Is useful to mill Serenade Dance for a Special Summon or Perfume for a search.</span>  <span>3x Shaddoll Fusion: Shaddoll Fusion is used to summon El Shaddoll Winda &amp; El Shaddoll Construct, preferably using monsters from the deck.</span>  <span>1x Fire Formation - Tenki: Is useful to search out a Lunalight monster, except wolf, with a nice side effect of giving all your Beast-Warrior monsters 100 ATK.</span>  <span><span>Extra Deck</span></span>  <span><span>Lunalight Monsters:</span></span>  <span>2x Lunalight Leo Dancer: The Boss monster. A truly amazing card that battles you to victory with 3500 ATK and the ability to attack twice and destroy all monsters your opponent controls.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight Panther Dancer: Lunalight Panther Dancer is a pretty good Fusion monster, with a solid 2800 ATK and the ability to attack a lot and gain more ATK. The main reason it is in, though, is that it is necessary to get Leo Dancer, as it is one of the materials. I dropped down to two Panther Dancers in this update, and I think I should have done it a while ago. Panther Dancer is not necessary at three, as it really doesn't hurt consistency.</span>  1x Lunalight Cat Dancer: Cat Dancer is the bottom of the Lunalight fusion chain, however it is not extremely bad, and I have 1 of it because it helps to get out Panther Dancer. Cat Dancer can also be a decent stall card for tight situations, as it is unable to be destroyed by battle and is really easy to summon.  1x Lunalight Saber Dancer: Saber Dancer is not part of the Lunalight fusion chain, but is a great card in its own right. If you need a big hitter with 4000+ ATK, Saber Dancer is the card to choose, because it gains massive amounts of ATK and even has the protection of not being able to be targeted by card effects. Also, Saber Dancer can be good to send to the GY with Kaleido Chick to use its epic GY effect to boost ANY fusion monster you control by 3000 ATK until the end of the turn. However, take notice that it cannot be used the same turn it is sent to the GY.  <span><span>Other Monsters:</span></span>  1x El Shaddoll Winda: Winda is a truly amazing card. It both decimates your opponent by making them only able to Special Summon once and cannot be destroyed by card effects, so it is not extremely easy to get rid of. Winda being so powerful and easy to summon is the only real reason that I have a Shaddoll boost and 3x Shaddoll Fusion to get Winda out as often as possible.  1x El Shaddoll Construct (Suggested by SoonToBe, new in this update): Construct is also a pretty good Shaddoll fusion monster. It allows you to mill a Shaddoll on summon, which is nice. Plus, it can take down monsters bigger than itself with its attack effect. One minor problem is that you have to use Wolf to summon it, but if you use it from the deck with Shaddoll Fusion it doesn't usually matter.  1x Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Tiger King: Definitely the longest name on the list, although not the worst effect. Tiger King allows you to immediately set Tenki, which then allows you to search out a level 4 or lower Beast-Warrior. Tiger King also lets you negate all monster effects on the field except Beast-Warriors, so your opponent has no monster effects but your Lunalights are safe and effectful.  1x  Diamond Dire Wolf (Suggested by amorphage, new in this update): Dire Wolf is a pretty good card for this deck, being a Beast-Warrior deck. It allows you to destroy your opponent's cards and your own. This also can trigger some of the Lunalight's ""sent to the GY by card effect"" effects, which is a plus. I usually prefer Tiger King, but Dire Wolf can get rid 0f some Spell/Trap nuisances like Mistake.  1x Raider's Knight (new in this update): Raider's Knight is only used to get Arc Rebellion, and is pretty nice in this deck because all the monsters are DARK.  1x Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon (new in this update): Arc Rebellion is basically the master of OTKs. His effect is completely ridiculous, gaining the ATK of all other monsters. And, not to stop there, since he was summoned off Raider's Knight, it negates all other monster's effects! Also, if you don't want to negate the effects, you can just detach Raider's Knight. The only downside is that other monsters cannot attack, but usually all that attack can still get an OTK of one attack.  1x Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom: Scratch Tiger King having the longest name, Ferrijit's is longer. I have Ferijit in the deck because it allows you to Special Summon a Beast-Warrior from your hand, and then get the higher link Tri-Brigade or just use the effects of the monster summoned.  1x Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen: Wow. I think this is the winner for the longest name. And the highest link. I have Shuraig because it is nice for un-targeting banishment of your opponent's cards.  It is also nice if your opponent manages to get rid of it, you can search out pretty much any of your Lunalights as long as you banished things with Wolf.  1x Predaplant Verte Anaconda: Anaconda is a great card in any fusion deck, as it lets you copy any fusion spell from your deck. This lets you copy both Lunalight Fusion and Shaddoll Fusion, whichever you need.  <span><span>Side Deck</span></span>  My Side Deck is mostly full of hand traps, so you can tune your hand traps to what your opponent's deck does the most.  <span>Monsters:</span>  2x Nibiru, the Primal Being: Great against decks that Special Summon a lot, especially monster with low ATK.  2x Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju: The classic Kaiju that gets rid of a monster your opponent controls.  1x Alpha, the Master of Beasts (new in this update): The replacement for Pankratops, Alpha is a great card for going second, as it gives you an automatic 3000 ATK monster to get rid of negating monsters like Apollousa. Then you can return it and any other Beast, Beast-Warrior, or Winged-Beast monsters to your hand to return more monsters your opponent controls to their hand. And, after that, you can Special Summon it right back if your opponent still has a monster.  2x Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit: Nice for getting rid of monsters like Halqifibrax or Isolde after they use their effects, although it does not negate the effect.  2x Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion: Great against decks that use their GY a lot.  2x Droll &amp; Lock Bird: Great against Decks that search a lot.  <span><span>Spell/Traps:</span></span>  2x Lightning Storm: A great card for starting your tun with to get rid of your opponent's back row of spell/trap cards or monsters.  2x Infinite Impermanence: Great against decks that use monster effects a lot.  &nbsp;  So yeah, that's basically it. Have fun using the deck if you want, look at my other decks please, and comment on how you think I can make this better.  &nbsp;"

Help me.","<span>For starters</span>  <span>Why do I do this? I've created a deck with so many engines and combo pieces that I don't know what the decks main archetype is and what is an engine anymore. I'm afraid. Credit to Toon for both giving me this idea and motivating me to put more effort into this after I saw her frog deck. Anyways, this is an OTK based going-second deck about getting beeg boys and doing beeg damage.</span>  <span>Pros and Cons</span>  <span>Pros: The deck can easily get out some huge monsters and pile up damage, and it doesn't search too often so Ash and cards like it can't affect the deck very much.</span>  <span>Cons: The deck can brick, hard, on occasion, due to various factors; banishing combo pieces like Aleister, Gren and Aleister's normal summons conflicting, etc. </span><span> </span><span>Deck list</span><span> </span><span>3x Thunder King- One of the biggest monsters in the deck, if not the biggest. Thunder King clocks in at 33k, being a very large monster. Although, it’s not much more than that, as we have no way to get Kaiju counters. So Thunder King is just a big body on the field for OTK’s and one of the primary targets for Interrupted, the second being Gamaciel. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Jizikuru- Jizikuru more so serves as a secondary copy of Thunder King. With the same attack value, Jizikuru also is the equivalant of a vanilla on the field. Although, he can still wreak havoc. In the situation where all your Thunder Kings are banished or in the graveyard, you want to use a back-up Jizukuru as a target for Interrupted. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Gamaciel- Gamaciel is another one of the key kaijus for the engine (?). He can easily out problem monsters like Borreload and Appolousa, clearing the way for his buddos to OTK. Gamaciel is the secondary target to Interrupted, the first being Thunder King, since Thunder King can easily run over him.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Kumongous- Kumongous serves as the final Kaiju, and as a secondary copy of Gamaciel. With only 200 more attack, he can still easily out things and be run over by the stronger monsters like Thunder King. Kumongous’ life is pain.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Aleister- a key part of the deck, Aleister enables us to go into many strong Invokeds. Although, he has no way to special summon himself, making him conflict with Gren Maju on occasion, due to both of them wanting to normal summon themselves. (If you are in the situation of having both, I recommend choosing based off of which is more fit to handle the current situation. If you have a Desires in hand, go for Maju. If your opponent has hard to out monsters or if you want/need to turbo into a fusion, go for Aleister.) If Aleister is on the field, my favorite 3 targets for him are Augodies, Purgatrio, and Mechaba. If you’re in the late game and have fusions in the grave to fule Augodies, you can go into her and banish the strongest to make a strong beater.  If you’re playing against a swarm style deck like Dragonlink, you can go into Purgatrio to clear them out. And if you have lots of cards in your hand that you don’t have much of a use for, you can go into Mechaba. The other Invokdes are good as well and have their own situations to use them in.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Gren Maju- Gren Maju serves as one of the decks (possible?) biggest beaters. As long as you have a good amount of cards banished off of Desires and/or Stromberg, you can have a at least 4000 Maju. Maju easily enables OTKs with other strong cards like Thunder King, although he dies to cards like Effect Veiler and Imperm.  Maju also requires a normal summon, and that tends to conflict with Aleister. So when using both of them, be careful and make sure you choose wisely on which one to normal summon. Or do neither and discard both for your Dangers!. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Bigfoot- Bigfoot serves as a big 3k beater on the field, helping to enable and finish OTks alongside cards like Maju and Thunder King. On discard, he gets a pop on any card, similar to Pankratops, which can easily remove problem cards.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Thunderbird- Thunderbird serves as a okay 28k beater, helping to finish off the opponent. On discard, he pops a set card, heavily countering decks like Altergeists; just be wary of Waking the Dragon.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Nessie- The first of the limited Dangers!. Nessie is an okay-ish 28k wall on the field, although it serves nothing to the OTKs. Although, it’s discard effect is much better, and the reason why it’s limited. Nessie can add a Danger to hand on discard, serving to help the (probably struggling)  hand you have. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Mothman- Mothman isn’t very notable on field, just serving to chip away a little at the opponent if in attack position. If discarded, though, he allows both players to draw one and discard one, which can easily help you draw still even though he’s dead (what a reliable guy) and trigger other Danger! Effects. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Chupacabra- Chupacabra is, while on the field, not very notable, similar to Mothman. On discard, though, he can revive a Danger!, serving to revive some of the ones you’ve discarded but want on the field like Bigfoot.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Jackalope- Jackalope is worthless on the field but still very adorable. On discard, though, he special summons a Danger! From deck, which helps generate advantage even when he’s gone. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Tschukinoko- Tschukinoko is also worthless on the field but adorable. And, on discard, he special summons himself from grave, still staying there. What a good guy.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Ash- The deck’s only hand trap. Most, if not all decks nowadays search and special and send a lot. Ash cripples a lot of that, and if used at the correct time, can stop an entire combo. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Interrupted- One of the deck’s key cards, Interrupted dark holes the field (which can basically be a raigeki as long as you’re using it as the first thing you’re doing), and then specials two kaijus from deck to each field. Interrupted is fantastic, destroying the opponent’s board and giving you Thunder King instantly. You can also banish it to search a Kaiju, one of the deck’s rare searches.  For Interrupted, you’ll want to give yourself Thunder King and your opponent Gamaciel. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Invocation- Invocation is another one of the deck’s key cards. Invocation allows you to go into many of the fusions and remove the opponent’s cards at the same time, as long as you have Aleister. Technically, you can use an opponent’s Aleister if you’re playing against an opponent using Invoked’s, so keep that in mind. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Desires-  Desires does a host of things for the deck. Everything it does actually generates advantage, as the banish 10 provides mass fodder to get Gren to 4000. And the draw 2 is basically a nice bonus on top of that. The “cost” is the main effect you want, so I don’t care if the draw is negated; the draw is just a nice bonus.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Stromberg- Stromberg also does a host of things for the deck. It banishes 10, providing more fodder for Gren. And, it also has the final effect nobody reads. As long as your opponent is a dumbass, they damage themselves seriously if they try attacking you. And if they do actually bother to read it and realize the final effect, they have to wait until they get a Twin Twisters or something so they can actually attack. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Instant Fusion- The final main deck card. Instant Fusion allows you to easily get out Raidjin and Caliga, two nice monsters to have on the field. The 1000 cost is very light compared to other cards, and Raidjin easily cripples problem cards by flipping them face down, and Caliga is a fantastic, archetypal floodgate.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>The Extra Deck</span><span> </span><span>2x Elysium- Elysium serves to be a big boss monster for the Invokeds late game. As long as you have a fusion and the opponent is playing some extra deck stuff, you can use Invocation to get out Elysium. Elysium, on field, is basically a really big beater with monster removal. It also looks like a biblically accurate angel.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Mechaba- one of the key Invokeds, Mechaba provides great negates as long as you have a large hand, which is possible with things like Desires and the Dangers!. You  can easily negate things and the such, also banishing cards, the only downside being that Mechaba isn’t a very strong attacker. He can still put work in for an OTK though.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Magellanica- Magellanica is basically a big 3k beater that is actually a vanilla, unlike Thunder King. Magell isn’t super good but still fairly useful against earth heavy decks. I wish Aleister would’ve turned into a cat girl instead of this though.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Augodies-  Dunno how to spell it’s name, but it’s a cool card. Augodies serves to grow to high attack stat levels late game, as long as you have a good amount of fusions in the grave. It also has a destruction effect to discourage the opponent from special summoning, which is a very important thing in many decks.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Purgatrio- Purgatrio is the last key Invoked. Purgatrio heavily punishes swarm decks like Dragonlink, by growing to huge numbers and beating over all of them. He also has really cool art. He’s also easy to get out by using an opponent’s Ash or something like it, due to how heavily used Ash Blossom is.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Cocytus- Cocytus is a 28k wall, similar to Nessie, that can attack in defense postion, which basically enables it to whittle down at the opponent slowly. Not a huge fan of Cocytus but eh, he’s there </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Raidjin- a fantastic instant fusion target, Raidjin can flip a problem card face down to avoid it, and if it has low defense, easily beat over it. Raidjin can also flip itself  face down to avoid Instant Fusion’s negative effects, although he’ll probably just be ran over by the opponent at that point. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Caliga- Caliga serves as a strong floodgate to heavily counter many decks. A lot of our monsters, like Thunder King, rarely activate or just don’t activate their effects, so Caliga doesn’t hurt them very much. Caliga can heavily damage the opponent though.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>Playing guide</span><span> </span><span>The deck’s strategy isn’t very complex or anything. Before doing much, you want to activate Interrupted and blow up the field to ss if you have it. If you don’t have it, you want to tribute the opponent’s problem monster with something like a Gamaciel. If you have a Thunder King in hand as you tribute, you can use Thunder King’s in hand eff to SS. Afterwards, you want to either banish some cards for Gren and normal him for a beeg (at least) 4000 beater, if you don’t have Aleister, or normal Aleister and fuse away him and opponent’s cards into whichever Invoked fits the situation.

If you've no normal monsters in your hand, he is a good target for his own discard. <strong>Impcantaion Inception </strong>can create some excessively resource-recycling plays by sending a 'spent' <strong>Impcantation</strong> from your field (or even your hand) to the GY and essentially copying <strong>Challislime's</strong> effect AND returning itself; all in one turn. Finally, as if anything else was required, <strong>Preperation of Rites</strong> is not only a costless, instant and unrestricted searcher of <strong>Challislime</strong>, but it also optionally allows you to retrieve a Ritual Spell from your GY.

Ritual Monsters/Spells</li>  	<li>Up to three <strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong> to destroy up to 3(!!) of your opponent's cards</li>  	<li><strong>Fossil Warrior Skull Knight </strong>to destroy a monster, but this can be banked unlike,<strong> N'tss</strong></li>  	<li><strong>PSY-Framelord Omega</strong> to recycle a Normal Monster, a non-ritual <strong>Impcantation</strong> or a Ritual Monster/Spell.</li>  	<li><strong>Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</strong> to Draw 1, Shuffle 1.</li> </ul> Finally, mill <em>EIGHT</em> <em>CHOSEN CARDS</em> from your opponent's Extra Deck.

They still feel a little alien to me, but the power of UTC is undeniable. I like combo decks, so this deck is halfway to a combo deck. The idea is to have the option to push over the top, or just to push out a UTC with Dolkka or Laggia or Abyss Dweller or Tornado Dragon, or just push out an emergency UTC. Basically UTC.deck. You can push out 6 interactions on top of UTC with the right hands, or you can play low, depending on what threatens you. Going first btw, but built to have a going second plan.  I've changed my mind on Lost World. The card is worth running going first, particularly in combination with Token Collector as an alternative way to pop dinos. Having your hand trap (a useful one at that) be your best combo piece is pure upside - the downside is in a lot of matchups the card really isn't useful as a hand trap. However, Linkross is everywhere and Auroradon is still broken, so in most matchups the card should at least be live, and it is too good as a combo piece to pass up. The most explosive hands involve seeing the right combinations of 2 dinos, lost world and Token Collector. Obviously, we run 3 Fossil dig, to find those combinations of dinos. Lost World is still good enough going first to run when you're siding for going first against a matchup where you want to take out Token Collector, like Prank-Kids or most Dogmatika builds. Token Collector is also worth running just as a combo piece a lot of the time, and can be insane if timed correctly. For example, if you summon a Dino on your opponent's turn, Lost World will create a token, which in turn lets you pop a baby in the deck with Lost World and Token Collector (out of the GY, after using it once) either searching a follow-up with Oviraptor or getting a free SS2 Pankratops with protection, ETC. Brutal card in this deck.  Numbers are pretty standard for a dino deck. Archosaur is a good enough normal summon to be worth running 3 - in my estimate One For One is a great budget option but is slightly sub-optimal. You want to see Misc and Oviraptor - those are your main starters. 5 babies total helps start and extend combos, and contribute greatly to the deck's grind game. Giant Rex helps make Dolkka and Laggia, and is important in those Token Collector + Oviraptor + Lost World hands. Insane combination that sees you filling the field with a lot of interruptions if you play it right, and gets much better if you see any 1 Dinosaur in your hand.  I feel like Nibiru and Impermanence are pretty good right now, so they're the main deck hand traps. I'm still on one Dogoran, Kaijus seem good right now, and you can search is really easily. Pankratops is kind of a hand trap, but is also a SS2 interruption out of the deck for a lot of hands where you see Petiteranadon.  Gnomaterial seems essential with Zoo in the format performing. Skull Meister splits the difference between D.D. Crow and Artifact Lancea, performing a pale imitation of either in matchups where 1 or the other are good, important with Dinos still performing. Effect Veiler is another good generic hand trap - I want cards that will help me answer True King or Dragoon while adding to my interruptions in matchups where I pull Token Collector for more effective hand traps. (However, as stated above, don't always do this. Token Collector is a stupid combo piece in the deck.) I wanted options that might shut a turn down in the right place, but could also be enough to turn the tide in other matchups I was less prepared for, and this suite seems good for the moment. The rest is a pretty standard suite of backrow removal. I see a lot of people going down to 3 cards, but I still feel more comfortable having a whole 6, just to diversify my options and have good odds of finding that ever essential mine answer. Lightning Storm is run at 3 because it also helps to break boards when going second, but since we're a going first deck I'm not maining them.  The extra deck is just pure gas. You might be able to burn up a lot of your opponent's hand traps early by spamming the field with negates in the right situation (IE when Nibiru isn't showing), and you can go over the top setting up 4 negate Apollos with multiple spell negates and UTCs and maybe even Pankratops or IP into a Knightmare. More commonly you'll be making Apollo/Dollka/Laggia + UTC, or you'll just decide to end on UTC, but being able to stack the field with enough Interruptions to make Dragon Link blush is no mean feat. The other cool thing is Linkuriboh and Secure Gardna, which just give you easy ways to trigger pill after normaling Archosaur, and thus increases the number of UTC plays you can make, since now Archosaur makes UTC with even the lowliest of dinos."

Needs to be cleaned up and thinned down a bit but it's just a fun deck either,"Edit: Made a slight mistake, when I took the level 3 Charmers out Arcanite Magician became unusable. So I spent a little bit of time working with it. It's now 40 cards, still slow but but fun.  Just a fun deck that I threw together so I could play with my favorite set of cards ever. The Charmers are amazing but they're slow, they're sadly not in the deck anymore. It's not perfect but the invoked engine really helps it out. There are three Synchro monsters in there that you can get out pretty easily, well except Xianxian. This deck can even drop Gustav, it used to have Libre but since it's post Battle Phase and Libre has no protection I cut him out. There is another person on here who I pulled inspiration from, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/tactician-musician/"">Tactician Musician.</a>  The Dogmatika and Tuners were from playing some of Tactician's deck. Fairy Tail Luna was just a though and it works okay, maybe need to throw a couple extra ones in or thin the deck a bit as it does sit at 50 cards.  The Extra deck is a variety of Invoked fusions as well as a couple Xyz techs and Link techs to help support the deck. It is by no means a perfect line up and it could be better but I like it.

The Photon Lord combo is super easy, we need 2 lv4 + Astral Force, it means Ascend Sage + lv4 is game. But before that, pay attention to Change Tactics, as you need to ss Ascend Sage first before activating it. Summon Utopia Double, use Utopia Double (Ascend Sage eff) add Astral Force, remember to chainblock with Change Tactics if you have it, use Utopia Double eff add Double or Nothing ss Utopia Beyond, use Astral Force ss Photon Lord.  The combo is Nibiru immune as Photon Lord is our 5th summon. If we used Aleister as our lv4, make sure to have the proper material for Mechaba in hand/GY. On opponent's turn, we can use Photon Lord either to add Photon Thrasher as follow-up or attach it as protection. If we use Trick Clown as xyz material, we gotta manage its eff (dont detach/ss it if we cant extend, cus it turns on opponent's Nibiru). In conclusion, we will have follow-up from Invoked, Thrasher, and Trick Clown, making this Utopia build less glass cannon-ish.  Pros: Great going first or second with big toolbox choice and staples.  Cons: Weak first turn board and to play blind second is super hard against meta (for every Utopia build in general), 45% cant break board, 45% lose on grind, and only 10% OTK."

Best scenario would be to get small Genghis and Lamia on the field, to climb up to small Alexander, and finally Crystal Wing, on the 5th summon at the latest, so we can avoid getting tributed by our opponent's Nibiru. If you can go on, if you used Slime to fusion summon, you might be able to summon something from your hand. If you have Ragnarok in hand, you might be able to bring out Alexander or Genghis from your grave, to then go into Gilgamesh, and bring out any combination of some strong pendulums:  High end:  Newton - Scale 10 is really useful for recycling your pendulum monsters. If you can bounce it off the field, or retrieve it from the extra deck, you can use it to recover useful monsters from your graveyard, probably a slime.  Mid:  Ragnarok - Has a fairly low scale, but there are many extenders you can pendulum with it. A resurrect on a special summon will be really useful but be careful you don't miss out on an OTK just because your damage is halved  Thomas - You'll want D/D cards in your hand more than your extra deck. You can use it to pick up pendulum materials for extra deck monsters, then pendulum them. It's also very useful on the field as a monster, since you can easily go into Kali Yuga while getting rid of one of your pendulum zones.

Digging 6 cards deeper enables a pure Dogmatika deck to see Ecclesia significantly more often, which is important if we're going to play Ecclesia stun. We also run Summoner Monk, as 3 more copies of Ecclesia.  Dogma lineup is 3 Nadir Servant, 3 Ecclesia, 3 Dogmatika Punishment, and 2 Fleurdelis. Servant and Ecclesia are the deck's main starters, and Servant is an insane card, so I wanted to maximize seeing these. Punishment is the deck's best form of interaction, so I wanted to run 3. Fleurdelis is fine, and I think you need to run 2, but I wouldn't run a third, since it is dead without Ecclesia. I didn't want to bother with Maximus, since the card is hard to summon and kind of weak.  I think Dimension Shifter is good right now, it's just a hand trap that covers a lot of bases, and interrupts most decks-quite handily while completely locking out some matchups, and I wanted to maximize running it. Ash is essential with Virtual World as the new deck to beat, and is better in generic matchups than Droll anyways. Effect Veiler is run over Impermanence partially for True King of All Calamities, and partially for Needlefibre shenanigans.  Grand Spiritual Art Ichirin is the field spell for the deck. This card is pretty busted actually, it's searchable by virtue of being a field spell, and it works offensively and defensively - provided you can meet its one requirement. This, however, is met by Ecclesia. We need another field spell for Set Rotation, and Secret Village is a personal favourite of mine in spellcaster decks. Blanket stopping Cosmic Cyclone, Feather Duster, ETC until my opponent removes Ecclesia or summons a spellcaster is very good at face value, and the card interrupts a lot of starters and combos as well. In the same vein are the Right Hand and Left Hand. The deck uses Foolish Burial Goods (or Summoner Monk) to send Magician's Restage to the GY and find the correct hand for the matchup. Left Hand also protects you from Imperm once you have a spellcaster hit the table, which is pretty solid. The last card is Triple Tactics Talent - this deck eats hand traps for breakfast, while setting an obnoxious series of interactions. It still suffers from some inconsistency issues, and it's much weaker without the Pots of Disparity, though Extravagence is (mostly) an admirable substitute in the meantime."

Shell Knight,"OK, so the other day we got quite the spoiler bomb for the Fossil archetype: Shell Knight. We don't have it on the database yet so I'm using Cannonball Spear Shellfish as the substitute in this list.  We're only running 1 copy of this little guy, but boy does his presence affect the look of our deck even at such a low number! I've completely retooled the deck to include Gaia-Plate the Earth Giant as a target for him (as well as being an easy SS if he ends up in hand), as well as adding in Trade-In to further increase our graveyard dump and churn power. This then led to the inclusion of extra Kaijus as Trade-In fodder, and even the addition of Interrupted Kaiju Slumber.  Shell Knight increases the Fossil archetype's OTK power by magnitudes, and the deck was already really good at it! If it wasn't obvious yet, this deck really wants to go 2nd if possible. <p class=""engine-dark-box"">Gameciel is an obvious choice of Kaiju since it's the easiest to run over, but our choice for our 2nd Kaiju being Gadarla has a few reasons behind it: 1) It's an 8-star for Trade-In, and 2) It sports a large attack for when we summon it to our field, while still being small enough to be taken out my Skull King in combat.</p> Keystone is an exceptionally good playmaker in this deck. It has too many uses to name. Making easy link summon turns, recycling our pieces, giving us a free card to pitch to Skull King, the list goes on. This little rock that could is the real deal.  This leaves the rest of the monsters. Revival Golem might look a little funny, but he's extremely useful for setting up link summons off of any of our graveyard dumps (especially Mathematician.) Speaking of, Mathematician is also an insane card here. He sets up all sorts of nonsense and makes our deck run buttery smooth. Rounding out the monster line-up we have our Psy-Frame Gear Gamma. Gamma is our hand trap of choice for both setting up our Fossil Fusion nicely by putting the opponents card in the bin, as well as being good to protect our own plays like Miracle Rupture and Trade-In.  All the spells are fairly self-explanatory, either setting up our graveyard or making big plays for us. Do note that Kaiju Slumber will proc your Fossil Fusion in the graveyard if you have a Fossil in play already; there are some very tricky and cool lines that you can set up to take advantage of this!  Skull King is our #1 summon target since, unlike Skullgios, he doesn't require our opponent to set-up and our own deck is ripe with 8-stars to feed him. He can even sometimes do more damage to your opponent that Skullgios, plus his graveyard-yoink effect card come in clutch against many archetypes. Because of these issues, we only play 1 Skullgios. He is still pretty easy to access, though, especially with so many Dragoons running around these days.  Skull Knight is really just a branch for Time Breach, and the other 2 Fossils in the extra deck are also pretty self-explanatory.  Cross-Sheep is absolutely stellar here. Fossil Fusion is one of the easiest enablers I've ever encountered for this guy, and he bridges so very easily into Accesscode Talker; make sure to also link I:P first for the indestructible! You can also easily make Missus Radiant with him. So many lines offered by this card that there's too many to list; you've just gotta keep an eye out for them.  Missus Radiant ups our OTK potential. Even Mathematician is a respectable beater with her out! Skull King and Skullgios will also bring the hammer down on our opponents LP very quickly using her bonus, the latter of which can deal 8000 damage in one shot to an opponent through a 0 attack or defense monster. Absolutely stunning link monster for the deck.  Rounding out the extra deck we have I:P, who is mainly used for the aforementioned Accesscode lines. However, she also pairs quite well with Knightmare Unicorn in a pinch. Unicorn is just a great universal out to have access to. Finally, Linkuriboh is the GOAT in any deck that can easily summon him (thanks, Nemeses Keystone!)"
