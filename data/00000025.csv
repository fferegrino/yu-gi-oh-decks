Great summons and searching. Generally what you want in a good deck.,"Hello people, this is my first deck and personally my fav, but you don't care about that and no one reads these anyway.  The strategy for this deck is to either overwhelm your opponent with Eldlich, or just OTK the living Christ out of them with Numeron. You generally want to go second with this deck for the OTK and you have plenty of hand traps to deal with pretty much anything. If you get <a data-name=""Cursed Eldland"">Cursed Eldland</a> along with a spell/ trap in your hand, you can get an Eldlich on the board, pop one of your opponents cards or destroy Eldland and set Scarlet Sanguine to try and set up for next turn.  The Numeron part of this deck is pretty braindead, so I'm sure even someone who relies on Dragoon for the entire match (You know the people I'm talking about) could figure it out.  Anyway, I'm always happy to take <span>CONSTRUCTIVE</span> criticism, and have a good day."

A neat control deck revolving around the new vampire support from Battle of Chaos,Vampires gives eldlich more options and can be used to OTK and steal your opponents cards. Ghost + either bat or dog gets you beatrice which is a zombieworld + doomking setup.  Theres a few neat tricks like using vampire ghost + sucker to tribute summon a vampire on your opponent's turn but its very difficult to have that scenario setup without adding more bricky high level vampires.

I got to Platinum 1 in 2 nights with a roughly 80% win rate.,"The recipe I used to get Plat 1. It's built more for best average results against the widest array of master duel decks, rather than peak power output from comboing. I've seen some builds that can end with more negates on board but get interrupted harder or sacrifice versatility against certain decks. Why yes, I have indeed cut a Maxx ""C"". I don't really believe in the card, as the opponent is likely to have 5-8 cards (3 ash, 2 called by, 3 crossout) that out Maxx""C"" than you are to have Maxx ""C"", and so the real use for Maxx ""C"" is to bait out the opposing ash blossom when going second. Other than that it's more of a ""win more"" card for decks that get to combo off but then also have Maxx ""C"" in hand to punish the opponent for trying to break their board.  The Cherubini &gt; Bardiche &gt;Rhongo + Gossip shadow line is really only here for going first against 0 hand traps. The instant you get interrupted it's best to simply bail out into Requiem + Fog blade or Requiem + Wing to protect it from raigeki/lightning storms.  This recipe is also somewhat old, and the reason for 2 Droplet is that I simply didn't have a third at the time. Looking at this list now I'd likely cut the Nibiru for the 3rd copy of Droplet.  I can't really say anything other than it's a competent archetype with decent tools. The most important thing for climbing ranks in master duel is and always will be to simply be patient and actually read cards; both yours and your opponent's.

A Normal Trap that requires you to pay half your LP...in a control deck all about paying half your LP to activate Normal Traps.  &nbsp;  And if your opponent activates a Spell, you can banish Supreme King's Soul from your GY and ZAR-C from your field to summon Crystal Wing or Crystal Clear Wing from your Extra Deck! Crystal Wing and Crystal Clear Wing are both negates that can work during either player's turn, so they are by far the best targets for Supreme King's Soul that you can put in this Deck!  &nbsp;  And since Jurassic World: Dominion was trending on Twitter days ago...Well, you know why I named this deck ""Dinomorphia Dominion."""

The overall strategy is to swarm the field with warriors in order to link or overlay into more powerful monsters until you draw into Polymerization and can summon Amazoness Empress. It's easy enough to get the materials needed, so summoning multiple Empresses creates a difficult-to-break lock. The deck also plays Dimension Guardian to grant a single Empress the same protection, or to serve as a possible alternative win condition by equiping Amazoness Swords Woman, who can then crash multiple times into your opponent's monsters with impunity."

Do everything you can to mill all your archetype-specific cards, along with Mezuki to build a powerful graveyard that buffs your King of the Skull Servants to ridiculous levels. Prioritize milling Wightbaking when you can, but remember its sent-to-grave effect is once per turn. Wightmare makes King of the Skull Servants a perfect target for Allure of Darkness. And Wightprincess makes a surprisingly effective hand trap when not being used as a combo piece. Further, almost every card in the deck is live from turn one, because even if you don't draw your mill cards, even the lowly Skull Servant itself can be used to link into a Linkuriboh or Relinquished Anima, which can get you started or buy you time. The deck does also have some tech options, but generally the most thinking you'll have to do is basic athematic, as the solution to most of your problems will generally be ""bigger skeletons."""

Anyways, this is Timelord Burn with Kaijus! Timelords are an archetype of Level 10 Fairy monsters that most of them share the effects of being able to be normal summoned without tribute if you control no monsters, have 0 ATK and DEF, can't be special summoned from the Main Deck without the help of a certain card, they can't be destroyed by battle or card effect, they shuffle themselves back into the main deck on your Standby Phase, and they all have activated effects if they do battle. With these abilities, Timelords are built innately as a Control or Stall deck, waiting for certain cards to finish the game. Let's talk about how we're doin' this.  We're running only 3 of the Timelords and a Timelord support in Time Maiden. Our 3 Timelords are Metaion, Michion, and Raphion. Metaion bounces every monster on the field back to the hand (or Extra Deck) except itself and deals 300 burn damage for each monster bounced. While the burn on this is mediocre at best, it excels in removing Extra Deck monsters with certain protections. Michion, our second Timelord, straight up HALVES the opponent's LP after combat. This makes Michion the single best Timelord to open as it basically reads ""Deal 4000 Damage to your opponent's LP on your first turn if this card makes it past the Battle Phase."" While he's weaker later, this strong start can be enough for our burn traps and our last Timelord to finish the job. A neat little interaction with this is that Michion's effect IS NOT effect damage, so it gets around cards that negate effect damage, like Destiny Hero Decider. That's likely because it doesn't say something like ""Your opponent takes effect damage equal to half their LP."" Now, our last Timelord, Raphion, burns the opponent for an amount of LP equal to the ATK of a monster it battled, so what you wanna do with Raphion is attack your opponent's biggest monster for huge damage. And we'll finish off with our Timelord support, and probably the single best card in this deck, Time Maiden. She's a Level 1 Fairy with 0 ATK and DEF who can special summon herself if you control no monsters. She's treated as 2 materials for a tribute summon of a Timelord, can tribute herself to search for a Timelord from your deck, and can banish herself from the GY to special summon a Timelord from your deck and ignoring its summon condition of not being able to do so. She does the most important thing this deck needs to do that doesn't rhyme with ""ramage"" (not a real word but I digress) and that is cycling your Timelords and being sure you always have one on the ready! Basically she's a 2-for-1 and that's why she's the most vital card in this deck. You can probably get away with running 1 or 2, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you do so. ""Why not run the trap cards for the archetype?"" Don't get me wrong, Infinite Light is a GOOD card for the archetype, but the thing is: the archetype is what we call BAD, and we kinda wanna run more damage style traps to close games than play a control game.  Kaijus, why? Well, this deck has legs when it goes First, but with Kaijus, its Going Second game is on another level. Its just generically good to use 'em to get rid of certain pesky boss monsters your opponent might spew out turn 1, so we're running 9. 3 Gadarla, 3 Thunder King, and 3 Jizukiru. These are all Rare Quality and that's why we're running them. I'm not crafting 3 Gameciel when we have 4 unique Kaijus that do the same god damn thing. Plus, sometimes bigger is better if we wanna use Raphion to attack into one. A pleasant thing I figured out is that Gadarla is Wind attribute, so you can tribute off a pesky Wind Barrier Statue if your opponent is playing Simorgh. Its not like you special summon that much, but GOD DAMN Time Maiden is so good.  Now our Spell/Trap lineup, and we'll start with the Spells. The only other SR in this deck that isn't Time Maiden is Pot of Extravagance, which is a generically good card that you can use in a lot of different decks. It allows you to banish 3 or 6 cards from the Extra Deck for you to draw 1 card for each. Honestly, this is basically Pot of Greed because this deck does not give a single shit about the Extra Deck. 2 and a half copies of Pot of Greed seems pretty good to me. Our only other Spell is Book of Moon, which we run at 2. Its a Quick-Play that flip's a monster face-down. It can be used to get rid of nasty effects on your opponent's field, or with good timing, it can even be used to keep a Timelord from shuffling itself back into the Main Deck, allowing you to use its effect again. Its versatility is almost unmatched.  Our Traps, which allow us to close games out or to stall them for a better chance to win. Waboku prevents battle damage from being taken and prevents your monsters from being destroyed by battle. This honestly came up a lot more than you'd think. It can really bail you out if your opponent negates a Timelord's effects. Dimension Wall is one of the most underrated cards in this deck. Its ability to to possibly negate lethal damage and reflecting it to your opponent is unmatched and I learned that very soon after I reached Gold with the deck. Bad Luck Blast is basically baby Ring of Destruction. It deals half the ATK of a monster and doesn't destroy it, but at least it deals 1000 burn damage if its destroyed by an opponent's card. ""Why not run Ring of Destruction then?"" Because by the time Ring of Destruction comes into play, you can't use it. Ring of Destruction forces you to target an opponent's minion that has equal to or less ATK than their LP, so it can't close game out without having exact lethal. Plus it can only be used during your opponent's turn. Bad Luck Blast can be used during your turn too and can choose ANY of your opponent's monsters, making it a more flexible tool to close the game. Secret Barrel is here to do a bit of burn damage too. I wanted to run Just Desserts, but there's 2 things with that: 1: Its an SR, so its not really worth crafting. And 2: if your opponent bothers to read your cards, they're probably gonna play VERY passive so they won't summon monsters. I've gone against Sky Strikers who use Afterburner on their own link monsters so Raphion couldn't hit it for game. Now for spot removal: 2 Compulsory Evacuation Device and a Dogmatika Punishment. Honestly, you can replace Punishment for a 3rd CED, it might not do what you want and its possible you turn off your final Fake Pot of Greed. I had 3 in a previous build with Extra Deck monsters with way too many ATK so it'll break nearly anything, but its not worth it.  Now the extra deck, and this is the magic of it. In short, sweet, and simple words: The Extra Deck doesn't matter. You can put quite LITERALLY ANYTHING IN. Hell, this could be good for that Xyz Festival Event, just throw in 15 Xyz monsters and you'll banish 'em anyway. The only Extra Deck monsters you can care for are the Cannons, Rank 10 Xyz monsters and that's only because every Timelord is Level 10 and Zeus, which is a Quick Effect board wipe on a giant body, but don't be sad if you banish 'em all in 1 go.  And that's really it for the deck! It's a very consistent deck that can catch a lot of players off guard. It plays exceptionally well against Maxx ""C"" because you don't really care to special summon, but Ash Blossom will freakin' hurt your turn, especially if it hits your Time Maiden's effect. As a note to anyone reading that wants to know how to go against Timelords: don't attack them without a reason. They get their effects whenever they do battle, and if you couldn't read the card, it applies to both turns. You don't wanna give Raphion 2 activations of burn in 1 life cycle of him. Also, while they do have formidable protections, they are still INCREDIBLY fragile. Negating their effects (I.E. with Dark Ruler No More) allows them to be destroyed and they will take battle damage, they can be easily be bounced back (I.E. with Compulsory Evacuation Device or Knightmare Unicorn), and you can flip them face down (I.E. Book of Moon) so they can be destroyed by card effects then. I hope this explains a lot about what the deck is capable of and how you can avoid screwing yourself with effect damage, and thank you for taking the time to read this!"

First we get the Dinomorphia fusion, then the terrible Icejade support, and now this piece of garbage deck.  Before reading further, I will strongly warn everyone intent on reading this miserable guide that <em>Mysterune as of right now is terrible.</em> I'm not innovative enough to actually come up with anything interesting with this deck; Sky Striker Mysterune has anti-synergy, but Musket Rune seems decently playable at the very least. I'm sure somebody else has made a list on that though. <strong>If you're looking for a fun, interactive deck, you're looking in the wrong place. If you want to make your opponents mald, then you've come to the right place.</strong>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>How to play Mysterune</strong></span>  I don't even know what to say. This miserable deck actively encourages you to deck your Opponent out, especially with that battle-phase skip. Without even reading any of the cards, <strong><a data-name=""Lord of the Heavenly Prison"">Lord of the Heavenly Prison</a></strong> and <strong><a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a></strong> being in the same deck should be plenty giveaway to the gameplan. You flip Skill Drain, and stall your opponent to death. What are they going to do? <em>Summon a beatstick with more than 3k ATK while Skill Drain is up?</em>  If you fancy decking your opponent out a little faster, <strong>Munnin, Wings of the Mysterune</strong> can search <strong>Deceit of the Mysterune</strong>, which is why we play it at 1 copy. The dog can recycle the continuous and the field spell too ig.  tldr: flip skill drain, then you deck them out.  I really don't know what to say about the gameplan, and I have no clue who would find this sort of gameplay fun, so I guess I'll go over some interactions and potential (and highly questionable) tech options.  <strong>Lord of the Heavenly Prison</strong>: I'm pretty sure anyone who's run into Eldlich in competitive knows what this thing does already. I'll just mention that this thing also searches spells. <strong>You have access to your whole ass deck with this card</strong><strong>.</strong> If you want to search either <strong>Spring of the Mysterune</strong> or the other field spell in here whose name I will not utter, set <strong>Metaverse</strong> or <strong>Terraforming</strong>. I have accidentally set the actual field spell and paid dearly for it on multiple occasion.  <strong><a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a></strong>: This deck is already a war crime, may as well go the full mile. Mysterune plays pretty much fine under Mine, and I'd argue you can deck them out even better since Skill Drain shuts down <strong><a data-name=""Mysterune of the Freezing Curse"">Mysterune of the Freezing Curse</a></strong>.  <strong><a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a></strong>: Flex spots, I just slapped Solemn in here because I couldn't think of anything else.  <strong>Handtrap Pile</strong>: This deck can't play going-second for shit. Handtrap brigade is here to alleviate this deck's terrible performance when playing second to a degree. Technically flex spots, you can also play whatever the hell you want in here. I prefer handtraps over going-second options for game 1 as handtraps do still add more interruptions for you if you win the dieroll.  <strong>Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell</strong>: <strong>Infinite Impermanence </strong>and <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> both go offline when Skill Drain is up. If you know for a fact you're going first, feel free to replace some handtraps with more potent going-first options during siding.  Other than that, the side deck is entirely up to personal preference. I'd say to play what works for you instead of netdecking this horrid thing and assuming its playable.  <span><strong>Terrible Tech</strong></span>:  <strong>Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries</strong>: The Extra Deck hardly matters. Only the six Mysterune fusions come up mostly. If you're expecting to fight various decks, or just have certain cards/archetypes you just hate with all your soul, feel free to play this in either the main or the side.  <strong><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong>: Ditto.  <strong><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a></strong>: This could totally go into Effect Veiler or Imperm's slot, but this deck has a grand total of like 1 way to deal with a giant-ass Nibiru Token. I wouldn't count on your chances of having that immediately available. Also, Nib is a level 10 so there is potential Xyz play potential with Sky Prison.  <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Liebe&lt;/strong&gt;: ""><strong></strong></a><a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Liebe"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Liebe</a>: This also includes Gustav Max. I don't know when this will ever come in handy since you can't even enter Battle Phase, but idk I'm not your dad play whatever the hell you want.  <strong><a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a></strong>: All I'm saying is that this thing is searchable from Sky Prison which you can use to make a Rank 10. Also another body you can hide behind with Skill Drain up since it's a fat body.  <strong><a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a></strong>: If you're playing the above, you may as well for the fun of it. There is close to zero actual practicality since Skill Drain is just going to turn it into a fat body anyway, but whatever.  <strong>More Mysterune Cards</strong>: I mean, if you adamantly refuse to play Mine and Skill Drain, you can just play the other Mysterune cards. They're pretty bad but hey, do what you like.  <strong>More War Crimes</strong>: If you want to go the <strong>extra </strong>mile, you can totally play a larger Mystic Mine engine in here, and literally ONLY use the Mysterune cards as a way to deck your opponent out a bit faster (or make it so they deck out first). I haven't tried this, but it's out there.  &nbsp;  Yeah this deck is terrible to play, and to play against. I have yet to not be called a slur whilst playing this deck on EDOPro. The games last upwards of 40-50 turns, with minimal gameplay. You kind of just sit there and watch your opponent cope under Skill Drain...

This was 1 of the 2 beatdown decks during this era and this format was here until March. Just for yall' to remember there was not a banlist nor limited list during this time. Silver Fang beatdown was much better 'cuz this was also the 1st deck that could brick like Monarchs today. So going a card by card expleining why those are in here:  3x Dark Magician-2500 beatstick which is hard to get off the field if not Trap Holed 'cuz no matter you have 6 removal cards, still if it hits the field you could easily just start summoning monsters and go for more and more damage every single turn killing your opponent if he does not have some kind of luck to get Dark Hole, since Fissure if you have Dark Magician and Silver Fang on the field for example cannot destroy Dark Magician and can only destroy Silver Fang.  3x Gaia the Fierce Knight-same reason as with Dark Magician  3x Silver Fang-this card is best 1200 ATK monster 'cuz it is the only low level monster with the higher stats that can be boosted by an equip spell which would be Beast Fangs  3x Hitotsu-Me Giant-has highest stats for a low level monster and cannot be taken down by a level 4 or below monster if there was no equip spell on that monster if it had 1200 ATK, or if there weren't 2 equip spells if it had 800 ATK.  3x Mammoth Graveyard-same reasons as Hitotsu-Me Giant  3x Kagemusha of the Blue Flame-second higher stats for a low level monster being 800 ATK and it can also be boosted with Legendary Sword. Also since Gaia is also a warrior it makes us to use less space on equip spells so we can play our 9 staple pack  3x Nemuriko-same reasons like with Kagemusha of the Blue Flame, but instead of Legendary Sword here is for her Book of Secret Arts  1x Dark Gray-same reasons like with Kagemusha of the Blue Flame, but instead of Legendary Sword here is Beast Fangs  3x Legendary Sword-this boosts Gaia and Kagemusha, and it can boost Gaia to be even stronger then Dark Magician  3x Book of Secret Arts-boosts Dark Magician and Nemuriko, also it makes Dark Magician being an unstopable force if your opponent doesn't have Dark Hole or Fissure if you just summoned Magician  3x Beast Fangs-boosts Silver Fang making it strongest low level monster and also boosts Dark Gray  3x Dark Hole-perfect board wipe to get rid of your opponent's monsters and can also take down both Gaia and Dark Magician  3x Fissure-destroying a monster is pretty good if it has high stats like Dark Magician, only downside is that it destroys monster with lowest ATK which can be and doesn't have to be a problem.  3x Trap Hole-if our opponent summons Gaia, Dark Magician, Fang, Hitotsu or Mammoth we can just automaticaly get rid of it and that is awesome 'cuz it leaves our opponent open and it can help in push making sometimes.  Just to ask, did you know that Blue-Eyes White Dragon was supposed to be in this set, but was removed after and was added to the game later?"

Let's go through the deck card by card explaining why those cards are in this deck.  1x Dark Magician-2500 beatstick which is hard to get off the field if not Trap Holed 'cuz no matter you have 6 removal cards, still if it hits the field you could easily just start summoning monsters and go for more and more damage every single turn killing your opponent if he does not have some kind of luck to get Dark Hole, since Fissure if you have Dark Magician and Silver Fang on the field for example cannot destroy Dark Magician and can only destroy Silver Fang.  1x Gaia the Fierce Knight-same reason as with Dark Magician  3x Silver Fang-this card is best 1200 ATK monster 'cuz it is the only low level monster with the higher stats that can be boosted by an equip spell which would be Beast Fangs  3x Hitotsu-Me Giant-has highest stats for a low level monster and cannot be taken down by a level 4 or below monster if there was no equip spell on that monster if it had 1200 ATK, or if there weren't 2 equip spells if it had 800 ATK.  3x Mammoth Graveyard-same reasons as Hitotsu-Me Giant  3x Kagemusha of the Blue Flame-second higher stats for a low level monster being 800 ATK and it can also be boosted with Legendary Sword. Also since Gaia is also a warrior it makes us to use less space on equip spells so we can play our 9 staple pack  3x Nemuriko-same reasons like with Kagemusha of the Blue Flame, but instead of Legendary Sword here is for her Book of Secret Arts  3x Dark Gray-same reasons like with Kagemusha of the Blue Flame, but instead of Legendary Sword here is Beast Fangs  2x Kurama-I think this is last 800 ATK monster in the Vol. 1 set which was only avaible set back then so it mades it the last best monster in the set. It has no equip spell supports but if your opponent uses a monster with lower ATK and doesn't have equip spell in hand he cannot get over it unless he gets Silver Fang, Hitotsu or Mammoth or 800 ATK monster+equip spell that supports that monsters type.  Until tomorow and a Booster 1.  3x Legendary Sword-this boosts Gaia and Kagemusha, and it can boost Gaia to be even stronger then Dark Magician  3x Book of Secret Arts-boosts Dark Magician and Nemuriko, also it makes Dark Magician being an unstopable force if your opponent doesn't have Dark Hole or Fissure if you just summoned Magician  3x Beast Fangs-boosts Silver Fang making it strongest low level monster and also boosts Dark Gray  3x Dark Hole-perfect board wipe to get rid of your opponent's monsters and can also take down both Gaia and Dark Magician  3x Fissure-destroying a monster is pretty good if it has high stats like Dark Magician, only downside is that it destroys monster with lowest ATK which can be and doesn't have to be a problem.  3x Trap Hole-if our opponent summons Gaia, Dark Magician, Fang, Hitotsu or Mammoth we can just automaticaly get rid of it and that is awesome 'cuz it leaves our opponent open and it can help in push making sometimes."

Personally I find the skill drain to be successful with this deck since its all special summons from hand up until you need monster effects. Play the card for last resort if you cannot find your way into the combo. It will save you occasionally but you need to keep in mind that you're going to need chuche to pop it if you need to have shenshen banish or just mill it for qinglong,etc. Either way fun deck to bust down your opponents card effects"

Learning to play with this deck will give you a solid foundation on how to play Xyz decks. As an Anime protagonist archetype that introduced the Xyz mechanic to the game, <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a> is one of the most iconic cards in all of Yu-Gi-Oh! and Utopia has received and will continue to receive support over the years and last year the OCG released a Structure Deck that made the deck viable and competent at what it does. Master Duel has a Utopia Structure Deck available from the beginning of the game and it's about it and its improved version that we're going to talk about next.  ////////////////////////////////////////// Budget version of the deck (3 Structure Decks): Only with the Structure Deck cards the deck's gameplay is limited and is based on making the <a data-name=""Ultimate LEO Utopia Ray"">Ultimate LEO Utopia Ray</a> equipped with several ""ZW -"" monsters that give attack to the equipped monster in addition to an extra protection effect against destruction or target of cards or even interaction with the opponent with the ""<a data-name=""ZW - Pegasus"">ZW - Pegasus</a>"" which is the main ""ZW -"" monster available and that you always want to equip in <strong>LEO Utopia</strong>. That way you equip LEO Utopia with several ""ZW -"" monsters so that it becomes a respectable Boss Monster with high attack, protection effects and negation of opponent's monsters becoming the deck's win condition. These are the possible combos to do with just the Structure Deck: /////////////////////////////////////////////// Combo 1: Ascended + Armed = Ascended + Zexal Construct + Random Card  SS <a data-name=""Ascended Sage"">Ascended Sage</a> and SS <a data-name=""Armed Sage"">Armed Sage</a> RANK-4 Utopia and cl1 Ascended cl2 Sage Add <a data-name=""ZW - Tornado"">ZW - Tornado</a> and Add <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</a> Activate Rank-Up Zexal XYZ Summon <a data-name=""LEO Utopia"">LEO Utopia</a> and put 1 ""ZW -"" on TOP of Deck LEO eff detach 1 and Equip <a data-name=""ZW - Lightning Blade"">ZW - Lightning Blade</a> from Deck Tornado eff Equip to LEO  Gamestate: LEO + (Equip Blade + Tornado) /in GY: Rank-Up Zexal  Next Turn: LEO eff detach 1 and Equip Pegasus from Deck  /////////////////////////////////////////////// Combo 2: (Ascended + Dododo + Zubaba) + Astraltopia  ***SS Ascended and NS <a data-name=""Dodododo"">Dodododo</a> and eff SS <a data-name=""Zubababa"">Zubababa</a> from Hand RANK-4 Utopia and Ascended eff Add Rank-Up Zexal Activate Rank-Up Zexal XYZ Summon LEO and put 1 ""ZW -"" on TOP of Deck LEO eff detach (Dododo) and Equip Blade from Deck  Zubaba eff Reborn Dododo <a data-name=""Astraltopia"">Astraltopia</a> eff SS from Hand and eff send Zubaba Add COUNTER Trap <a data-name=""Numbers Protection"">Numbers Protection</a> RANK-4 Utopia and Set COUNTER  Gamestate: LEO + Utopia + COUNTER + (Equip Blade) /in GY: Rank-Up Zexal Next Turn: LEO eff detach 1 and Equip Tornado from Deck  ***In Grind Game you can use <a data-name=""Ascended Sage"">Ascended Sage</a> to add <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal</a> and make <a data-name=""ZW - Halberd"">ZW - Halberd</a> Or with the <a data-name=""Zexal Entrust"">Zexal Entrust</a> spell, give Reborn from Utopia and if you have the Zexal RANK-Up in your hand, use it to make the ZW - Halberd  ZW - Halberd eff Add <a data-name=""Zexal Construction"">Zexal Construction</a> and use Construction to Add <a data-name=""ZW - Asura"">ZW - Asura</a> ZW - Halberd eff Equip to LEO  Gamestate: LEO + (Equip Blade + Tornado + Asura + Halberd) Halberd eff Special the Equipped Monsters to ATK for Game  /////////////////////////////////////////////// Combo 3: (Dododo + Zubaba) + Astraltopia  NS <a data-name=""Dodododo"">Dodododo</a> and <a data-name=""Zubababa"">Zubababa</a> eff SS from Hand RANK-4 Utopia and Astraltopia eff SS from Hand <a data-name=""Astraltopia"">Astraltopia</a> eff Send 1 card from Hand Add <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal</a> (this card adds pretty much any of the deck's spells/traps to the hand so it's always good to understand when you add plays and when you opt for defense/interaction)  Activate Rank-Up Zexal XYZ Summon LEO and put 1 ""ZW -"" on TOP of Deck LEO eff detach (Dododo) and Equip Blade/Tornado from Deck  Gamestate: LEO + Astraltopia + (Equip Tornado/Blade) /in GY: <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal</a> (Remember that LEO also equips from the Extra Deck if you already equipped everything possible from the main deck)  /////////////////////////////////////////////// Competitive version of the Utopia deck: In this version we focused on comboing through the <strong>""Onomat"" engine</strong> which consists of adding high rarity cards such as <a data-name=""Onomatopickup"">Onomatopickup</a>, <a data-name=""Onomatopaira"">Onomatopaira</a> and <a data-name=""Utopic Onomatopoeia"">Utopic Onomatopoeia</a> to the deck. This engine spams the level 4 monsters needed to access the Xyz RANK-4 Utopia from the Extra Deck and start making Utopia moves. A benefit of this version is the decrease in ""ZW -"" monsters used in the deck by opting for more consistency cards. We also reduced the number of copies of cards that are not as necessary for the deck to work as <a data-name=""ZS - Armed Sage"">ZS - Armed Sage</a>. But the main difference between this Competitive version and the Budget version is in the use of <a data-name=""Number 99: Utopia Dragonar"">Number 99: Utopia Dragonar</a> that we make with <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce"">Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce</a> and it by itself already gives us access to <a data-name=""Ultimate LEO Utopia Ray"">Ultimate LEO Utopia Ray</a> without having to use Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force. That way you can make a very oppressive <strong>end board with several interactions</strong> with the opponent via the engine, which is a quality of this deck. For this you usually end up with the Extra Deck very quickly, being this a deck that goes to All or Nothing where if the field is broken you won't have good follow ups to play on the back but if the opponent can't break that field you win very fast.

(It doesn't specify that you have to have an Xyz Monster to Special Summon it onto the field, so if only your opponent controls an Xyz Monster you can still Summon it.) If you searched it with the <a data-name=""Primathmech Alembertian"">Primathmech Alembertian</a> and it doesn't have Follow Up you can use it to add the <a data-name=""Onomatopickup"">Onomatopickup</a>/<a data-name=""Onomatopaira"">Onomatopaira</a> from the deck to the hand to have Follow Up.  If you don't know what deck you're up against, the best thing to do is leave <a data-name=""Gigantes"">Gigantes</a> in your hand because if you take several Floodgates like <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, Gigantes is an potential out of those cards.  ""ZW -"" monsters can be equipped to Utopia monsters to give extra effects like not being destroyed by effects or being targeted by cards and some have interaction effect like Pegasus that negates monster effect not to mention the equipped monster gains attack equal to the attack of the equipment itself like Pegasus that has 1000atk. The 3 main ones are: <a data-name=""ZW - Pegasus"">ZW - Pegasus</a>, <a data-name=""ZW - Lightning Blade"">ZW - Lightning Blade</a> and <a data-name=""ZW - Tornado Bringer"">ZW - Tornado Bringer</a>. As I'm getting ready to play the Xyz event I prefer to just use Pegasus and Tornado because it's no use using the Blade that protects from destruction and you take <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> that doesn't care about these protections. Playing Ranked Master Duel I would consider using one of them and the chosen one would be ZW - Tornado because the deck already has a way to protect against destruction by effects that is <a data-name=""ZS - Utopic Sage"">ZS - Utopic Sage</a> that no one remembers but it can banish itself so much from field and gy to <strong>protect all Utopia monsters</strong> from cards like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> and <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>.  Onomatopoeia Engine: ***<a data-name=""Onomatopoeia"">Onomatopoeia</a> can be Searchable by <a data-name=""Onomatopickup"">Onomatopickup</a>/<a data-name=""Onomatopaira"">Onomatopaira</a> and basically he is the Normal Summon of Gagaga's engine and brings the other monsters Special Summon from Hand at the same time you can Reborn him in the GY with <a data-name=""Zubababa"">Zubababa</a> or just his fact <strong>being in the field</strong> allows you to activate the <a data-name=""Dodododo"">Dodododo</a> eff in GY to return to the field. A card that interacts excellently with Dodododo and Zubababa. (Remember that <a data-name=""Onomatopoeia"">Onomatopoeia</a> brings monsters by Special from the hand in <strong>DEFENSE Position</strong> and you are LOCK on doing <strong>XYZ</strong>). <a data-name=""Dodododo"">Dodododo</a> basically you want to Special Summon it from the Hand or the GY to the field. To bring him from the hand we only have the option of the <a data-name=""Onomatopoeia"">Onomatopoeia</a> but he can be your Normal Summon also to Special Summon <a data-name=""Zubababa"">Zubababa</a> from the hand if you don't open with the <a data-name=""Onomatopoeia"">Onomatopoeia</a> and he comes back from the GY by its own effect if you control the <strong>correct name</strong> which is quite simple to do (but Banish it when leaves the field). <a data-name=""Zubababa"">Zubababa</a> is excellent, it's a <strong>double extender</strong> because it Special Summons from the hand by its own effect and reborn another monster from the gy to the field. (Another card that locks you in only making <strong>XYZ</strong> Monsters from the Extra Deck) The combination of these 3 cards is enough to have the <strong>level 4 spam needed to access Xyz moves</strong> from the Extra Deck with you being able to make two to three Xyz RANK-4 just with them and with other Extenders this number easily reaches 4 or 5 Xyz in a single turn. Both <a data-name=""Onomatopoeia"">Onomatopoeia</a> and a <a data-name=""Dodododo"">Dodododo</a> are excellent discards to resolve <a data-name=""Onomatopaira"">Onomatopaira</a>, only <a data-name=""Zubababa"">Zubababa</a> you don't want to discard to GY.  The advantage of <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</a> to <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce"">Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce</a> is that it can target any RANK-4 Xyz to bring <a data-name=""LEO Utopia"">LEO Utopia</a> from Extra Deck not needing to be a Utopia monster so you can use <a data-name=""ZS - Utopic Sage"">ZS - Utopic Sage</a> as a material from LEO Utopia for example which brings a lot of versatility. Also don't forget that Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force puts a ""ZW -"" or ""ZS -"" monster on top of the deck and that it can banish itself from the GY to give 1 Draw if your opponent has <strong>2k or more LP than you</strong>. Using both Rank-Up-Magic also brings a good versatility in deck moves, going according to how to make <strong>Utopia Double + LEO Utopia OTK</strong> but of course the priority is to make <a data-name=""99: Utopia Dragonar"">99: Utopia Dragonar</a> and for that the <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce"">Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce</a> is the only mandatory Rank-Up-Magic in the deck.  <a data-name=""Xyz Change Tactics"">Xyz Change Tactics</a> does something that I value a lot in any deck and that bothers me in decks that don't have that ability: draw cards and is searchable by <a data-name=""Astraltopia"">Astraltopia</a>. It also <strong>Chain Blocks the effects</strong> you activate when Summoning Xyz Monsters like <a data-name=""ZS - Ascended Sage"">ZS - Ascended Sage</a>. Even knowing that the deck engine is very big and you will hardly draw defenses in the form of hand traps, just the fact of seeing new cards greatly increases the chance of you winning. Not to mention that <strong>paying 500LP is useful</strong> in this deck because several Utopia cards gain additional effects when your opponent has at least <strong>2000LP more than you</strong> like the <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</a> of giving you one more Draw for free in the turn or the <a data-name=""ZW - Pegasus"">ZW - Pegasus</a> that is summoned from the hand and then equipped with <a data-name=""LEO Utopia"">LEO Utopia</a> (this is the only way to equip Pegasus on your monster if it comes in your starting hand because unlike <a data-name=""ZW - Tornado"">ZW - Tornado</a> for example it <strong>only equips by activating the effect on the field</strong>, it is a brick in the hand that can only be equipped if it Specials first when its LP is 2k less than the opponent). Speaking of synergy with the <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</a> you <strong>stack the top</strong> of the deck with a ""ZW -"" like Blade/Tornado is an <strong>indirect way to add them to the hand</strong> with the purchase of Xyz Change Tactics. Not to mention that the Xyz Change Tactics draws can make it better for you to hold the <a data-name=""Onomatopoeia"">Onomatopoeia</a>/<a data-name=""Dodododo"">Dodododo</a> effect if you would summon <a data-name=""Zubababa"">Zubababa</a> to the field which is unnecessary since he can enter by his own effect and after several draws you use to be able to bring a lot of free extenders for powerful plays.  <a data-name=""Zexal Construct"">Zexal Construct</a> is for sure a cuttable card in the deck because you already have the <a data-name=""ZS - Utopic Sage"">ZS - Utopic Sage</a> to play its role much better. So consider exchanging it for any other card since it is a minus 1 for you when resolving what you always want to avoid having in your deck. A card that I'm not using in the deck but that is a great budget option is the <a data-name=""Zexal Entrust"">Zexal Entrust</a> which is basically a Monster Reborn that also has the gy effect of banishing itself and adding a <strong>""Zexal"" Spell/Trap</strong> to the hand (Follow Up ).  As you use a lot of Continuous Spell and Equip Spell <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> it becomes excellent in the deck because the <strong>activation cost is very simple to pay</strong>. Another synergy of Forbidden Droplet is with <a data-name=""F0: Utopic Draco Future"">F0: Utopic Draco Future</a> negating and <strong>taking control of an opponent's monster</strong> because you use it as a Droplet activation cost avoiding using your cards.  <a data-name=""Gameciel"">Gameciel</a> I thought about using it to face Shark Xyz Deck that can lock your field with <a data-name=""Number 4: Stealth Kragen"">Number 4: Stealth Kragen</a> + <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> or someone who plays with a troll deck of making <a data-name=""59: Crooked Cook"">59: Crooked Cook</a> Turbo made with <a data-name=""Astral Kuriboh"">Astral Kuriboh</a> or <a data-name=""Right-Hand Shark"">Right-Hand Shark</a>.  ////////////////////////////////// Technoplay Extra Deck Cards:  <a data-name=""Utopia Double"">Utopia Double</a> despite having to use a brick which is the ""<a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a>"" he Summons any ""Number 39: Utopia"" XYZ from the extra deck bringing it with DOUBLE ATK, that means that even if you take <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> when activating the effect of <a data-name=""99: Utopia Dragonar"">99: Utopia Dragonar</a>, you just have to put two level 4 Monsters on the field to be able to do Utopia Double and right after bring the <a data-name=""Ultimate LEO Utopia Ray"">Ultimate LEO Utopia Ray</a> from the Extra Deck without having to use the <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</a> which would be the only option to bring it to the field without using 99: Utopia Dragonar. So even if 99: Dragonar is negated or takes Nibiru you can still summon LEO Utopia and pass with <strong>two monster negates</strong>. The funny thing about Utopia Double is that if the opponent uses <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> and cut the LP to 4000, just use its effect and bring any Utopia with double attack that will usually come with 5k atk and hit straight to end the game without even having to use Double or Nothing! A cool interaction of <a data-name=""Utopia Double"">Utopia Double</a> is with <a data-name=""LEO Utopia"">LEO Utopia</a> because you negate the effect of an opponent's monster and <strong>halv the monster's atk</strong> so most likely it will have 2k atk or less which means Utopia Double's OTK will happen.  The XYZ RANK-5 <a data-name=""Ultimate Utopia"">Ultimate Utopia</a> and <a data-name=""Ultimate LEO Utopia"">Ultimate LEO Utopia</a> are always treated as ""<a data-name=""Number C39: Utopia Ray"">Number C39: Utopia Ray</a>"" which means you cannot have the Original <a data-name=""C39: Utopia Ray"">C39: Utopia Ray</a> and these two Xyz in the same Utopia deck unless you choose to use 1 copy of Ultimate LEO and 1 copy of Ultimate Utopia and that way you already have 3 slots in use. In this case as it is not a budget version of Master Duel decklist you can simply use 1 <a data-name=""Ultimate LEO Utopia"">Ultimate LEO Utopia</a> and 1 <a data-name=""C39: Utopia Ray"">C39: Utopia Ray</a> Original. ***The <a data-name=""Ultimate LEO Utopia"">Ultimate LEO Utopia</a> says: <strong>This Effect's Activation and Effect Cannot be Negated</strong> so this makes it a more spectacular card than it already is.  <a data-name=""S39: Utopia the Lightning"">S39: Utopia the Lightning</a> is Utopia's boss monster capable of taking out any monster with <strong>5k atk or less</strong> from the field in the battle phase and very useful to have to take any Boss Monster from the opponent especially if your Utopia monster received interaction and is doing nothing in the field.  Remember that both <a data-name=""99: Utopia Dragonar"">99: Utopia Dragonar</a> and <a data-name=""38: Harbinger"">38: Harbinger</a> have battle phase effects, and Harbinger's effect is not even Hard Once per Turn so if he has 2 Spells attached to him he can use it twice for example.  <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> being able to add <a data-name=""Gigantes"">Gigantes</a> to the hand is great for having an out to backrow in the search engine against Floodgate Turbo decks like Eldlich, True Draco and Monarch which are very popular in Master Duel. No wonder I also use <a data-name=""Exciton Knight"">Exciton Knight</a> and <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> to make sure my matchup against these decks is satisfactory.  <a data-name=""Bagooska"">Bagooska</a> is one of my favorite Rank-4 Xyz and it works in Master Duel as a contingency plan against <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> because by giving 2 draws to the opponent you can pass with an excellent floodgate that stops the turn of most decks and he <strong>stays on the field for up to 3 Standby Phase</strong> so you can draw the cards you need to play again. Not to mention that he's the best way to threaten <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> because he in attack position can't be targeted by cards or destroyed by card effects so it's almost guaranteed to make AA-Zeus.  ***A card that I consider one of the best Xyz in the game is <a data-name=""Primathmech Alembertian"">Primathmech Alembertian</a> and this deck can use it to search for the best extender of the deck that is <a data-name=""Astraltopia"">Astraltopia</a>.  ***Extra Deck monster restrictions you should be aware of: The monster <a data-name=""Utopia Double"">Utopia Double</a> brings on top of it has doubled ATK but cannot Direct Attack. Another card that is restricted to the player in the Battle Phase is <a data-name=""99: Utopia Dragonar"">99: Utopia Dragonar</a> that doesn't let you <strong>attack directly</strong> with other monsters (except itself) in the turn that used the effect and <a data-name=""ZS - Utopic Sage"">ZS - Utopic Sage</a> only allows you to attack with <strong>""Number"" monsters</strong>. Both 99: Utopia Dragonar and ZS - Utopic Sage lock you into making <strong>Xyz</strong> from an Extra Deck for the rest of the turn.  ////////////////////////////////// Disregard the Side Deck, these are just ideas of cards possible to use in the deck that I will discuss their use next:  <a data-name=""Gagagaga Magician"">Gagagaga Magician</a> is an option to make <a data-name=""F0: Utopic Draco Future"">F0: Utopic Draco Future</a> by reviving an XYZ from the GY for this. Because it has Gagagaga in the name, it also synergizes with some of the monsters in the Onomat engine but is not very relevant to the point of using it in the deck.  <a data-name=""97: Draglubrion"">97: Draglubrion</a> and <a data-name=""92: Heart-Earth"">92: Heart-Earth</a> are Free to Play options in the RANK-8 and RANK-9 Xyz Master Duel that you can bring with <a data-name=""99: Utopia Dragonar"">99: Utopia Dragonar</a> but of course the best option is <a data-name=""38: Harbinger"">38: Harbinger</a>.  <a data-name=""Xyz Universe"">Xyz Universe</a> is an Anti-Xyz trap searchable by <a data-name=""Astraltopia"">Astraltopia</a> that basically gets rid of two Xyz monsters from the opponent and brings in case you send two RANK-4 to the GY you bring <a data-name=""38: Harbinger"">38: Harbinger</a> to the field with this trap and he will have the negate of Spell Cards because you don't need to detach material to use it. <a data-name=""Xyz Encore"">Xyz Encore</a> and <a data-name=""Xyz Import"">Xyz Import</a> are also searchable cards in the deck but I consider Xyz Universe to be the best option to use in the <strong>Xyz Event</strong> (if you want to use it of course).  <a data-name=""S39: Utopia Prime"">S39: Utopia Prime</a> as well as <a data-name=""C39: Utopia Ray"">C39: Utopia Ray</a> are only used in the deck for you to put on top of <a data-name=""39: Utopia"">39: Utopia</a> or <a data-name=""39: Utopia Double"">39: Utopia Double</a> and activate <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce"">Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce</a> to make <a data-name=""99: Utopia Dragonar"">99: Utopia Dragonar</a> and that way it comes with 4 materials and can use the effect twice. You can also use them like Zoodiac does to make an <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> with various materials. You only use one of the two in the deck so in Master Duel if you have one of them you just need to know that it already works for the deck to work and you <strong>don't need to craft the other</strong>.  By using <a data-name=""F0: Utopic Future Slash"">F0: Utopic Future Slash</a> you can make <a data-name=""F0: Utopic Draco Future"">F0: Utopic Draco Future</a> much easier than just having two Xyz other than Number. Because you just do Utopic Future Slash on top of ""Utopia"" XYZ and Draco Future on top of Future Slash. But I prefer to keep using <a data-name=""F0: Utopic Future"">F0: Utopic Future</a> Original which has better battle phase effect, protection from destruction by effects and can be used in any xyz deck other than Slash which is only useful in that deck.  <a data-name=""ZW - Dragonic Halberd"">ZW - Dragonic Halberd</a> is another equipment option to use in the deck but it is only used in more budget versions of the deck in Master Duel and not in this one that is more geared towards the competitive.  <a data-name=""Downerd"">Downerd</a> can be used in the deck because all Utopic Future monsters are <strong>always considered RANK-1</strong> so you can do it on top and then <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> but the deck already has Xyz monsters that come on top of Utopia like <a data-name=""C39: Utopia Ray"">C39: Utopia Ray</a> or <a data-name=""S39: Utopia Prime"">S39: Utopia Prime</a> that are only used for this purpose.  <a data-name=""Exciton Knight"">Exciton Knight</a> is a card that almost no one expects to take and is surprised by a card that clears the entire field. If the opponent negates its effect he will have to destroy it too because if not you go to the battle phase and threaten <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> in Main Phase 2.  <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> is the most used XYZ RANK-4 in the history of the game, it was certainly ahead of its time for having a Quick Effect of being a <strong>GY Floodgate</strong> and this is very good against several Master Duel decks like Eldlich and Drytron and these decks should be quite popular in the <strong>Xyz Event</strong> so if you want to use the Abyss Dweller as a Generic RANK-4 Xyz option, here's the tip. This card is so good that I have no doubt if one day it will be banned (about 10 years from now).  <a data-name=""Anti-Magic Arrows"">Anti-Magic Arrows</a> is a way to make <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> pass because if the opponent doesn't interact in the Xyz Summon in the Main Phase and you go to the Battle Phase when you activate this card, you prevent it from activating Spells/Traps for the rest of the turn ensuring AA-Zeus on M2.  &nbsp;"

However, the PC version of Master Duel with one of its achievements ""Burn it All"" ticked my interest in using Warlock as a way to net burn damage. Are there faster ways to net bigger burn damage? Of course there are. But me being a sucker for Spellcaster-type monsters decided to take the long way around. 100k burn damage means 100 Normal Spells to activate, or 50 if I'm lucky and I manage to get both Warlock(s) out and keep them that way.  Strategy here is pretty simple. Your primary objective is to get Warlock to the field ASAP. Having ""<a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>"" in its card text means Warlock can be top-decked with <a data-name=""Soul Servant"">Soul Servant</a>, which can be searched out using <a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a><a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">.</a>  Once you get him out, burn away. While the Dark Magician archetype has tons of useful spells, almost half of them are Quick-Play while Warlock burns on Normal Spells only. Among them, I count nine Normal Spells, most of which are useless; which is where Spellbooks come into play. Pair that with the other general-purpose Normal Spells and you'll burn through 8000 LP in no time."

Jizukiru can be used to get over an opponents boss monster, jizukiru can then be tributed into fortress dragon from your opponents side of the field (easy boss monster elimination) or you can go the full on OTK route and bring in limiter removal and gold sarcophagus to OTK with cyber end dragon/cyber twin dragon etc  Overall not the best deck but first deck ive ever properly made myself, any suggestions let me know"

Those two were Ryu-Kishin and Wattkid known as Oscilo Hero #2 in that time. So let's go card by card so you can see why something was played instead of something else.  1x Dark Magician-it still is 2500 ATK beatstick but it needs 2 tributes while everyone was playing 6 1000 ATK monsters and 9 1200 ATK monsters which means nearly everything was a Trap Hole target and that made it even harder to get Dark Magician out on the field, but that card was still pretty powerful and was worth playing.  1x Gaia the Fierce Knight-same reason as with Dark Magician, except this thing had 200 ATK less then Magician  3x Hitotsu-Me Giant-still a powerful 1200 ATK beatter that can go over most low level monsters  3x Mammoth Graveyard-same reason as with Hitotsu  3x Silver Fang-except it was as strong as Hitotsu and Mammoth it could be equiped with Beast Fangs making it even stronger and it was the only 1200 ATK monster that could be boosted up at this time  3x Ryu-Kishin-1000 ATK was a powercreep for 800 ATK monsters  3x Wattkid-same reason as with Ryu-Kishin  3x Dark Gray-there weren't so many 1000 ATK monsters so cards like this that could be equiped and boosted were still seing play  2x Nemuriko-same reason as with Dark Gray  2x Kagemusha of the Blue Flame-same reason as with Dark Gray  3x Dark Hole-overpowered clean up card  3x Fissure-still destroys a monster for no cost and can help you to get with weaker monster through stronger monster by just destroying it  3x Beast Fangs-we still play Dark Gray and Silver Fang so we want them to be even stronger  2x Legendary Sword-boosts Gaia and Kagemusha  2x Book of Secret Arts-boosts Dark Magician and Nemuriko  3x Trap Hole-right now it is auto destruction for 17 of 24 monsters that everyone plays, so it is in this format something like Solemn Judgment is today, it was like a summon negate  Why Sword and Book instead of more monsters? To boost up 800 ATK monsters to get over 1000 ATK monsters and they also are unafected by Trap Hole still, which means that they can be a really big problem for your opponent if he doesn't find a clean up card or a stronger monster, or a clean up card if you boosted something to a 1400 ATK for example.  Dark Magician Gaia beatdown stoped seing play 'cuz now there was much more removal for most monsters and there is no posibility that 800 monster would last more than a turn it is summoned, so those were mostly unable to be placed on the field."

It does suck Jet Synchron is banned because it enables a lot of summons for the Synchro Tuners but Doppel Warrior with Brotaur should suffice enough.  You could change up the Side Deck a bit. I put general cards that could be used depending on what your opponent plays. I'm n0t great at side decking so it might not make much sense for what I have there.

Here's how to win in 1 turn with them.,"You need Urnight, Iron Core, a level 4 monster in hand OR any monster in the graveyard (to not use Bujinki Ahashima).  Or Summoner Monk, any spell card, Iron Core, a level 4 monster in hand OR any monster in the graveyard.  Simplest combo: Normal summon <strong>Urnight</strong>, Urnight reveals <strong>Iron Core</strong>, special summon <strong>Supplier</strong>, Supplier searches for <strong>Maximus</strong>, Link <strong>Bujinki Ahashima</strong>, Bujinki makes <strong>Number 60</strong>, Number 60 summons <strong>Urnight</strong>, Urnight summons <strong>Guardian</strong> or Supplier, XYZ <strong>Dark Rebellion</strong>, <strong>Vespenate</strong> on top of Number 60, summon <strong>Maximus</strong>, activate Dark Rebellion, destroy a card with Maximus, attack for game.  It may sound like a lot of setup at first but it's incredibly consistent to pull off.  <strong>Summoner Monk</strong> works as a second Urnight and only needs 1 extra spell card for the same combo to happen just in a different order, plus he can leave you with Guardian on the field as well to negate a monster effect (Nibiru?).  <strong>Tin Goldfish</strong> makes use of Supplier to search for the missing piece for when you happen to draw into both or even 3 Supplier.  <strong>Small World</strong> can set you up into ANY of these hands.  <strong>Kaijus</strong> are there to get rid of omni-negates, <strong>Pankratops</strong> puts a monster in the grave (no longer need for Bujinki Ahashima) and gets rid of a card + is also bait, and <strong>Adventurer Token</strong> engine is there to create an omni-negate before you start your combo.  That's it really.  The fact that you only need 2 or 3 cards (at worst) means you can also run all these other defensive options to make sure your combo goes through. You could also run Ash Blossom, Crossout Designator, Instant Fusion, Millennium Eyes Restrict, Mudragon of the Swamp, and Cross Sheep for more protection + a different setup similar to Bujinki Ahashima using Cross Sheep and Instant Fusion."

Grayewick the Fusionist here, I took a bit of a break from Master Duel and dueling in general, to an extent, just to get myself cleaned off of the tilt and salt that's been building up within me due to the terrible format that is the OCG but hey, I'm back with a deck that I've been using in the Xyz Festival right now, pure Mekk-Knights. As per usual, the cards in the side would be the ""nice to haves"" or the tech choices I personally would use.  <strong>""Why play this over Scars turbo?""</strong>  <span>Well first of all, <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> is at 1 (for some reason), so it's not gonna be as consistent, and second is I do not have the other cards to make it work and I can't fill any good fillers for the strategy because a lot has to go right to pull it off.</span>  <strong>The Strategy:</strong>  <span>So, as per usual, the strategy is simple. You build a standard Mekk-Knight list, you stun them with <a data-name=""World Legacy's Secrets"">World Legacy's Secrets</a>, <a data-name=""World Legacy Whispers"">World Legacy Whispers</a>, and <a data-name=""World Legacy Key"">World Legacy Key</a>, and you beat them down with your Mekk-Knights since they're all just bigger Cyber Dragons. A lot of decks in the event right now are anti-meta Barrier Statue stun or Phantasm Spirals, and this is where this deck shines. ALSO, thank God and everything in creation that Eldlich the Golden Lord is banned, I am so sick and tired of seeing that monki flip deck (even though to a small extent I am partially responsible for it because I've shared some of my list about it but I digress), it's just a deck that could be argued as ""maybe fun"" to use, but definitely not fun to play against.</span>  <strong>Discussing the list changes:</strong>  <span>The only difference between this deck and the usual Mekk-Knight build is that we don't have access to <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star"">Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star</a>, <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a>, or <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a>, which makes the zone management a bit more challenging. But the good thing is, since it's an Xyz centered event, a lot of decks are playing the nasty floodgates such as <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> or <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, both of which we can comfortably play around and through since we play a lot of high-impact going second cards.</span>  • x3 <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Avram"">Mekk-Knight Avram</a> - <span>Since we also do not have access to the Invoked package, our dedicated Normal Summon will be filled by him. He's a 2000 ATK Normal Monster, which means he can get over the Barrier Statues or <a data-name=""Banisher of the Radiance"">Banisher of the Radiance</a>/<a data-name=""Banisher of the Light"">Banisher of the Light</a>. If you wanna go really budget, that's also fantastic since you can turbo him out of the deck with the freely obtainable <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>s, but the most important thing is he's a Mekk-Knight, which means your Continuous Spells/Traps work with him.</span>  • x1 <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Orange Sunset"">Mekk-Knight Orange Sunset</a> - <span>This card is usually not being played in most, if not all, Mekk-Knight lists, but since we have space, we could play it just for the name, and it's a 3000 DEF wall. It's effect to Special Summon from the hand doesn't always come up, but it's always nice to have than nothing (I think).</span>  • x3 <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> - <span>The remaining 9 slots of your deck could be any combination of these four cards. I only chose Lightning Storm, Evenly Matched, and Ice Dragon's Prison because it deals better with the anti-meta stuff than Forbidden Droplet, even though clearing our opponent's board seems counter intuitive.</span>  • x3 <a data-name=""World Legacy's Memory"">World Legacy's Memory</a> - <span>In pure Mekk-Knight variants, this deck is usually just played as either a 1 or 2 of since it's searchable, but since we do not have access to Lib the World Key Blademaster, it's safe to play it to 3, plus, it's an archetypal Emergency Teleport.</span>  • Extra Deck - <span>These are just filler cards. If you have <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>, or both <a data-name=""Number 97: Draglubion"">Number 97: Draglubion</a> and <a data-name=""Number 100: Numeron Dragon"">Number 100: Numeron Dragon</a>, or any generic Rank 8 monsters that are generally good, play them.</span>  So yeah, that's pretty much it. There's really nothing much else to discuss about this deck but have fun, I guess. Until next time."

Kozmo already works really well in MD  since they really don't need to dig into the extra deck to kill, they do have lots of good options with a proper rank 5 engine, though. The XYZ Fest banlist hit a lot of popular decks with non-targeting destruction, making it easier to just throw down a destroy mid-combo on your opponent and watching them struggle to get over it.... just always make sure you SS into defense mode against Utopia if you don't want to eat a game-ending swing.  Galaxy Soldier can overlay with Sliperider to go into Nova and then Infinity for an omni-negate.  Soartroopers can grab another copy of themselves or Farmgirl from grave to overlay into either a Leviair or Nightmare Shark, the latter of which can go into Zeus."

This deck seeks to set up a board of negates with Borreload Savage Dragon, Joruri-P.U.N.K. Nashiwari Surprise/Joruri-P.U.N.K. Dangerous Gabu, and a synchro summon on the opponent's turn into Ukiyoe P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon.  &nbsp;  How does this deck work? Well, the Adventurer Engine and Halqifibrax lines are both self explanatory, but there are some interactions that I want to point out. When using Rite of Aramesir, it locks you out of activating the abilities of normal summoned monsters for the rest of the turn. Most P.U.N.K.s have an ability you will most definitely want to use on their summon, so consider special summoning the ones you want to activate. A few ways to do this:  -Emergency Teleport, search and summon a P.U.N.K. (Ze Amin if you need monsters, Sharakusai if you have the other P.U.N.K. in hand to fusion summon with, or Wagon/Madame Spider depending if you need Spells or Traps)  -Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune can discard themselves and one card from hand to special a P.U.N.K. from deck  -Noh-P.U.N.K. Dia Note can send themselves from hand to grave to special a P.U.N.K. from hand  -When Noh-P.U.N.K. Dia Note is sent to the grave, you can special a P.U.N.K. from grave  -Lastly,  you can tribute the P.U.N.K. fusion monster (Carp Rising) to special two P.U.N.K.s from deck  &nbsp;  Keep these in mind, because we almost always want to activate Rite of Aramesir and set up the Wandering Gryphon Rider as a negate. On most of our starting turns, whether we go first or second, we want to move through the Halq line to get to Borreload Savage Dragon. That isn't hard for this deck; the tricky part is figuring out what we make alongside it.  &nbsp;  For now, I'm uploading a list in progress. I'm going to update this description and decklist over time, and any suggestions or comments you have I'm happy to incorporate. Thanks for taking the time to read this!"

As per usual, cards on the main will be my personal choices based on what cards I currently have, and the cards on the side will be the tech options for you to consider.  <strong>A few questions:</strong>  • <strong>""Why Dogmatika? That seems counter intuitive since they're all about the GY set up?""</strong> - <span>This deck doesn't really care about how fast it wants to win. All it needs is to control the tempo of the game within its reach and be comfortable with that pace. If you can manage to keep that, everything else will follow. But I do admit that often times I find myself lacking necessary pressure, and the Dogmatika cards are just generally great as a supplementary engine for anything that needs that but isn't really concerned about sacrificing their Special Summons from the Extra Deck. I also did some tests with the <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, and it could be fine, I guess? But for you to be able to access that, you'd need to turn your Necrovalley off first, which isn't good so I've cut it. But what I did consider is putting x3 <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a>s in the Extra Deck as <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> targets and including one copy of each <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a>, <a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon"">Shaddoll Dragon</a>, and <a data-name=""Shaddoll Beast"">Shaddoll Beast</a> for added utility.</span>  <strong>The game plan, and the list:</strong>  It's pretty simple.  • <strong>x3 <a data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a></strong> - <span>Your boss card, not even a monster, which deals with the GY. If this card properly resolves, you pretty much win the game against most decks. I do not recall any top tier deck that doesn't make great use of the graveyard as of now, but I am damn sure they all do.</span>  • <strong>x3 <a data-name=""Royal Tribute"">Royal Tribute</a></strong> - <span>This card is what truly seals the deal, since it deals with the hand. There's a reason why <a data-name=""Confiscation"">Confiscation</a>, <a data-name=""Delinquent Duo"">Delinquent Duo</a>, and <a data-name=""The Forceful Sentry"">The Forceful Sentry</a> are all banned. If I could make a room for Monarchs, I'd even put <a data-name=""Thestalos the Mega Monarch"">Thestalos the Mega Monarch</a> in here, but maybe that's a list for another day to test. Phantom Knights need to banish themselves to gain effects from the GY. Drytrons activate from the GY, but tributes for cost and cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. Eldlich also activates from the GY and also sends for cost. It doesn't matter.</span>  • <strong>x1 <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a></strong> - <span>The one card dedicated to deal with the Extra Deck. This is probably the only list of Dogmatika that I'll use Maximus with, at least as of now, because this list isn't really concerned too much with being able to summon Extra Deck monsters.</span>  • <strong>x3 <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, <a data-name=""Royal Decree"">Royal Decree</a>, <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a></strong> - <span>Any of these three will do, but personally I would choose Skill Drain to deal with on field monster effects. I just want that extra consistency that Pot of Prosperity provides. The latter two for trap heavy floodgates even though we do not really care about that, except probably for <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a>., also it turns off our Dogmatika Punishments and Solemn Judgments, which is bad because we need protection for <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>.</span>  • <strong>x2 <a data-name=""Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist"">Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist</a></strong> - <span>This card is more of a win more card, which also provides itself and your Necrovalley some neat destruction protection. He's a decent beat stick, and he also searches your <a data-name=""Hidden Temples of the Necrovalley"">Hidden Temples of the Necrovalley</a>, which also is in here to deal with Special Summons in general.</span>  • <strong>x3 <a data-name=""Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley"">Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley</a></strong> - <span>It's an archetypal <a data-name=""Infernity Barrier"">Infernity Barrier</a>, despite it being a hard once per turn, it's still good to have as an added protection to be considered, although it's an SR so if you're on a budget, I don't really recommend it.</span>  Despite winning most of the time without actually needing to Fusion Summon, this still technically is a Fusion strategy so I figured I might want to share it because I love Fusion strategies in general (with a select few exceptions). So yeah, enjoy ruining Eldlich and Drytron players' lists."

So in spite of all the constant barrage of ideas of decks for this archetypes, Phantom Knights can indeed run this engine. While not the best in the world, it doesn't take much for it to get what it needs done for the sake of self doubt. In short, just play Phantom Knights how it should be played  However the only problem I haven't added for the sake of this being a demonstration deck is the addition of <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> targets. Other than than, the notion of adding the Libromancer engine is to extend the link plays (if taking the Agent/Doombroker route) or going the XYZ route excluding Raider's Knight (if taking the Geek-Boy/ Firestarter Route). Destroy Phoenix Enforcer also helps in a time of need for he does things (especially Celestial for Draw 2 and Dasher for Special Summoning if you draw into a monster during the draw phase, while in the GY). As for Raider's Knight, he is there for Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon (indestructible beefcake that could DRNM all monsters on the field the turn it used it's XYZ effect)."

That's what this is.,"First deck! ...There's not much to it, I think.  There's a few routes it could take. First step is to deal direct spell damage/healing wherever possible. Then it branches:  (1) Sack a bunch of monsters to beef up the Shadow Ghoul (Unhappy Maiden. etc.), which pairs well with the Castle of Dark Illusions/Pumpking combo (the zombie deck that could've been :&lt; ).  (2) Get the Battleguard squad growing (using Sangan and Black Forest Witch to get them to your hand if needed). If you can get the Sogen field out there, all the better.  (3) There's also a few defensive/direct damage options (Catapult Turtle, Cannon Soldier, Suijin to some extent). Pair Suijin with Ring of Magnetism for... something, idk.

Crealtar also helps with giving your impcantation cards some damage if you didn't summon them in defense AND unlocks your extra deck by negating the impcantation cards but not the ritual ones.  I would say the 5 most replaceable cards in this deck would probably have to be Raigeki, Harpie's, Solemn, Skill drain, and Return of the Dragon lords. They're really only there because of my experience with specific players, I encourage you to swap these out with stuff that suits your playstyle and or builds upon the chaos archetype.  Biggest weakness would definitely have to be the inability to clear the board or negate stuff in general, I used to have ash blossom but I think I can get away with skill drain more with more effect. I found that with most problematic cards, regular chaos dragon would just flip it and the problem was solved.  I see too many chaos max dragon profiles exclude Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon (the 3000 one) and I don't get why, its so easy to summon both and guarantee you OTK on 2nd turn if the opponent can't negate you and they have at minimum 2 monsters on the field."

Clear New World is situated perfectly for ABC due to the fact destroying your own A,B, or C just plusses you, and with tuner access now allows you to make Baronne along with your normal end board.  The idea is to use the Clear New World with 2 or more ABC monsters on field to grab an Ash Blossom, make Burei to grab Ninishi, then make Baronne.  The side board shows some of my side board and other ideas, like just making Dawn Dragster, or for a budget option using Burei to grab Gama to make Crystal Wing.

But seriously this works better than it should. I know I could have cheesed with a LOT more annoying trap cards, but I've been using this in Mater duel against some friends and it's the perfect balance between shitass annoying and creative.  Anyway, quick strategy description; You want wightprince in the graveyard by any means. The most basic way of doing this is playing wightprincess and using her effect. Uni zombie also helps by discarding Wightbaking, which allows you to add wightprince and then discard him. Uni zombie ties both archetypes extremely well tbh since he can send Eldlich and any skull servant/ wight card to the graveyard pretty easily.  Anyway, you eventually use wightprince in the GY to special summon King of the skull servants and just deal a fuckton of damage.  THERE ARE REALLY EASY WAYS TO BACKFIRE. Wightprincess's 2nd effect should generally be used BEFORE you summon Eldlich otherwise you drown your attack points for no benefit.  Also, skill drain does kill King of the Skull Servants' effect so really only use it to stall while you have a Eldlich in your GY so you can get rid of skill drain manually.  Burial from a different dimension is the only thing saving yourself from getting locked when your opponent banishes your monsters, you can play around with the ratios but keeping it at 2 is safe enough for me.  The things this deck can do is insanely fun. There's a lot of cheese you can do to save yourself in the extra deck, especially if you a super unlucky hand of 3 regular skull servants and two wight princes, you can link summon and send them to the graveyard and unbrick yourself. Knightmare works really well for this.  This deck just has so many basic things going for it that's easy to understand and hard to mess up WHILE still having the adjustability of any viable deck.  You have a deck that's really hard to brick yourself, A ton of sustain through your trap cards, ways to thin out your deck to your benefit, and cards with really high attack potential (king of the skull servant)."

Other combo decks could do what it did, but better: Infernoble, Drytron, Dragonlink, Virtual World. They were more consistent, not requiring the bricky rocks that built the bulk of your deck should you want to build large combo boards.  However, Adamancipator has an unexplored, and exceptionally powerful synchro: Adamancipator Risen - Leonite. This monster allows you to excavate 5 and add any Adamancipator card (monster, spell, or trap) to your hand, and, if you can get a fire into the GY, can revive a monster on your opponent's turn. Koa'ki Meiru Guardian is the obvious choice, but less obvious option is Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite, who will trigger and let you draw a card.  Add in that their field spell, Adamancipator Laputite, can stack your deck once per turn, and you can fate-seal yourself into two starters and a guaranteed excavation on your following turn, making this strategy incredibly sticky.  This deck is streamlined to do one thing: make Halq and a live Leonite, and start plusing. Handtraps form the backbone of your interactions, and we play a whopping 11 of them. Including the three Forbidden Droplets, and you have a robust package to give you a chance when going second.  If you're tired of being blown out by Dark Ruler no More, and still want to play rocks, this may be right up your alley."

Hey kid... I hear you like drawing cards....,"If you want to spam, you have come to the right place.  Karakuri recieved some new support some time ago, and I wanted to play it. But it bricked; it bricked hard. Its lines were short, except that occasional golden opportunity that would dump your entire extra deck onto the field, half your deck into your GY, and the other half into your hand. Why yes, every synchro is a Halqifibrax, but what good is that if you can't make them?  And now, we have received a gift, the extenders we not only needed, but deserved: Ready Fusion and Emergency Teleport (to 3).  These two cards solve most problems, offering a variety of ways to manipulate the levels of monsters available to unlock even the rustiest of hands."

It's a trap-based strategy that functionally turns into a combo-deck by the end of turn 4. But time has not been kind to the archetype. Control decks like Eldlich and Dogmatika simply outpace it in a few key areas. Recoverability, pressure, compactness, there are a lot of reasons the deck can't stand up to its modern counterparts.  However, for a brief stint, I found the deck rather playable. The frog engine pairs very well with the Numeron engine. Numeron gives frogs a first turn Apollousa or Avramax to pair with your traps. It can also provide an OTK to unsuspecting opponents. Swap Frog's bounce for cost effect lets you clear the field of your normal summon, meaning you can dump a Ronintoadin and resolve a Numeron Network on the same turn. Pair that with arguably the best boss monster in Yu-Gi-Oh, the aptly named Toadally Awesome, and you have a pretty solid deck.  With ZEXAL's ban, I have had to make a few updates, but I am overall still pleased with the deck."

Although non-meta, this deck has a lot of power. It's focused on control and resummoning your boss monster  - the ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Dragon</em>"". The strategy goes like this: <ul>  	<li><strong>searching out</strong> and/or playing your field spell - ""<em>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</em>"";</li>  	<li><strong>searching out</strong> and/or playing ""<em>Megalosmasher X</em>"" with ""<em>Unexpected Dai</em>"" and/or using a token from ""<em>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</em>"";</li>  	<li><strong>searching out</strong> your Phantasm Spiral spells and/or traps with ""<em>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</em>"" (when you normal summon), based on the appropriate situation: - traps and ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Wave</em>"", when you're cornered; - spells (excluding ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Wave</em>"") to destroy monsters and/or do damage and to summon ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Dragon</em>"";</li>  	<li><strong>negating effects</strong> (including <strong>negating effects</strong> that <strong>negate and/or destroy your spells and/or traps</strong>) using: - ""<em>Soul Drain</em>""; - ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Power</em>""; - ""<em>Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</em>""; - ""Sea Stealth Attack"" (1st effect); - ""<em>Called by the Grave</em>"";</li>  	<li><strong>negating attacks</strong> and <strong>destroying/returning</strong><em> to the hand</em> monsters using: - ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Battle</em>""; - ""<em>Raigeki</em>""; - ""<em>Storming Mirror Force</em>""; - ""<em>Sea Stealth Attack</em>"" (2nd effect);</li>  	<li> and <strong>getting the needed cards</strong> with ""<em>Pot of Duality</em>"".</li> </ul> If your opponent tries to destroy your ""<em>Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</em>"" do NOT stop him because if the aforementioned card is destroyed WHILE set, you can special summon from your Extra Deck ""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"" which is <strong>the strongest monster</strong> (in terms of ATK and DEF) <strong>in the deck</strong>. Also, you should rarely use the Extra Deck except if there's a <strong>problematic spell and/or trap card/s on your opponent's field</strong> and you don't think that you aren't going to draw cards to negate these effects, THEN you should summon ""<em>Knightmare Phoenix</em>"" (if you don't have the needed amount of monsters with different names on your field use ""<em>Link Spider</em>"") and if you've run out of those - ""<em>Decode Talker</em>"" (if you don't have the needed amount of monsters on your field use ""<em>Link Spider</em>""). And if it's your turn, your opponent has a problematic monster, you have 3 monsters on your field (you can also use the effect of Link Spider if you don't have a total of 3 monsters on your field in which case you'll need AT LEAST 1 on your field), turn 2 of them into ""<em>Link Spiders</em>"", then play ""<em>Geonator Transverser</em>"" so that it points to one of your monsters which you don't care about AND the problematic monster your opponent has. Use the effect of ""<em>Geonator Transverser</em>"" AND destroy the monster you gave to your opponent. If you think that ""<em>Geonator Transverser</em>"" won't point to one of your monsters that you don't care about AND the problematic monster your opponent has, THEN DO NOT summon it.  *This deck is heavily inspired by Yuri who won locals 1st place using a deck like this.*  An upgraded (more competitive) version of the deck is coming soon. ;)"

This singular version is optimized to play against Maxx C and Ash Blossom. (2 Gamma's. 2 Called and 3 Ash) and maintaining the light attribute spots for Chaos Ruler.  Gamma works well even playing 1st due to Crimson Resonator and Inca package (Dawnwalker and Duskwalker) being a hand trigger effect. If your opp triggers maxx c to crimson resonator and you gamma it you will gain a free chaos ruler + light monsters on grave as extenders.  &nbsp;  A particular add on this deck was Red familiar. I used to play Witch of black forest, she's good, but only works on field. Red familiar can work as a discard, you can tribute it from field sometimes to get a synchro used from grave and the main reason: from grave you can banish it and module your synchro levels to start your plays from bottom again. One of this deck issues was the fact that it will have follow up from grave, but if you don't draw a non-tuner top deck you can't use de rest of your lvl 6's from extra deck properly.  &nbsp;  that's it. hope you guys enjoy :)  &nbsp;  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/gfIjF7pwFvc"">https://youtu.be/gfIjF7pwFvc</a>"

Although non-meta, this deck has a lot of power. It's focused on control and resummoning your boss monster  - the ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Dragon</em>"". The strategy goes like this: <ul>  	<li><strong>searching out</strong> and/or playing your field spell - ""<em>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</em>"";</li>  	<li><strong>searching out</strong> and/or playing ""<em>Megalosmasher X</em>"" with ""<em>Fossil Dig</em>"" and/or using a token from ""<em>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</em>"";</li>  	<li><strong>searching out</strong> your Phantasm Spiral spells and/or traps with ""<em>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</em>"" (when you normal summon), based on the appropriate situation: - traps and ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Wave</em>"", when you're cornered; - spells (excluding ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Wave</em>"") to destroy monsters and/or do damage and to summon ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Dragon</em>"";</li>  	<li><strong>negating effects</strong> (including <strong>negating effects</strong> that <strong>negate and/or destroy your spells and/or traps</strong>) using: - ""<em>Skill Drain</em>""; - ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Power</em>""; - ""<em>Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</em>""; - ""Sea Stealth Attack"" (1st effect); - ""<em>Called by the Grave</em>"" (side deck); - ""<em>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</em>"";</li>  	<li><strong>negating attacks</strong> and <strong>destroying/returning</strong><em> to the hand</em> monsters using: - ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Battle</em>""; - ""<em>Raigeki</em>""; - ""<em>Storming Mirror Force</em>""; - ""<em>Sea Stealth Attack</em>"" (2nd effect);</li>  	<li> and <strong>getting the needed cards</strong> with: - ""<em>Pot of Duality</em>"" - ""<em>Pot of Extravagance</em>"".</li> </ul> If your opponent tries to destroy your ""<em>Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</em>"" do NOT stop him because if its card is destroyed WHILE set, you can special summon from your Extra Deck ""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"" which is <strong>the strongest monster</strong> (in terms of ATK and DEF) <strong>in the deck</strong>. Also, you should rarely use the Extra Deck except if there's a <strong>problematic spell and/or trap card/s on your opponent's field</strong> and you don't think that you aren't going to draw cards to negate these effects, THEN you should summon ""<em>Knightmare Phoenix</em>"" (if you don't have the needed amount of monsters with different names on your field use ""<em>Link Spider</em>"") and if you've run out of those - ""<em>Decode Talker</em>"" (if you don't have the needed amount of monsters on your field use ""<em>Link Spider</em>""). And if it's your turn, your opponent has a problematic monster, you have 3 monsters on your field (you can also use the effect of Link Spider if you don't have a total of 3 monsters on your field in which case you'll need AT LEAST 1 on your field), turn 2 of them into ""<em>Link Spiders</em>"", then play ""<em>Geonator Transverser</em>"" so that it points to one of your monsters which you don't care about AND the problematic monster your opponent has. Use the effect of ""<em>Geonator Transverser</em>"" AND destroy the monster you gave to your opponent. If you think that ""<em>Geonator Transverser</em>"" won't point to one of your monsters that you don't care about AND the problematic monster your opponent has, THEN DO NOT summon it.  *This deck is heavily inspired by Yuri who won locals 1st place using a deck like this.*"

I think I'd have to go with Sister Mary Phoenix Enforcer,"<strong><em><span>Missionary Brief</span></em></strong>  <span>This is a fun, mid-range, rogue deck that pivots between the Exosister Xyz monsters to build advantage and search on your turn and create adaptable and powerful disruption on your opponent's. The DPE package is used to wear down opponents' resources and provide added disruption. Standard turn 1 involves going into one or two Xyz to search for Exosister spell and traps, protected by Lord of the Heavenly Sky Prison. </span>  <span><i>The Sisters </i></span>  <span>The Exosister main deck monsters are devoted to a life of chastity and modesty by which I mean they don't do very much. Bar their quick-Xyz effects they each have either mild swarming abilities or even milder card advantage effects. Elis is by far the most versatile, Sophia is the best to have on board for the free draw and Stella is useful enough, essential three ofs, if just for the names. I'm sure Irene's a lovely gal but her cycle effect is by far the least useful since usually you want to be seeing the Exosister cards in hand, still an important one of for Vadis and Pax.</span>  <span>The Exosister extra deck monsters are really where the deck gets to shine providing a wide range of highly useful and relevant effects to stop each of your opponents plays. When Exosister Magnifica arrives with Dimension Force it will be a welcome addition for its high impact and OTK enabling ability. Arment, Pax and Vadis are all fantastic suporting cards to help you build resources on your turn and enable Xyz plays. Carpedivem is a really interesting and versatile support spell that can be used to play around cards like Ash and Nibiru but also turn off floodgates like Skill Drain and Mystic Mine.</span>  <span><strong><em>Rank 4 Extenders</em></strong></span>  <span> I've come to learn that rank 4 extenders in Yugioh are pretty much a game of pick your poison. Dynatherium is close enough the only completely ""free"" extender for the deck providing at worst a free body and at best providing some quick xyz upgrades for your nuns to punish any opponents on the side of the player base that don't value reading. </span>  <span>The deck is built with as few bricks as possible to try and offset the fact the deck struggles to built up card advantage on turn one. The risk of opening double Parallel eXceed however is easily offset by the amount of advantage it can get you (extending from the deck is really good, who knew?!) All your sisters are potencial Almiraj material to get into eXceed plays and even if it gets ashed, you're left with all you need to Anaconda into DPE on exactly your 5th summon. </span>  <span>Shade Brigandine is always live turn one and that's when you'll need it most. Even if you have to set it, it at least often has LOTHP protection. </span>  <span><strong><em>Friends of the Convent</em></strong> </span>  <span>Lord Of The Heavenly Prison really is an MVP of the deck. He lets you set multiple backrow turn 1 without worrying about falling foul of a feather duster and allows you to search powerful follow traps for your next, often Vadis or Judgment. He's easily searchable by Gallant Granite who can then be used to make Utopic Draco Future with one of your Sisters or linked off for Anaconda.</span>  <span>Called by the Grave and Triple Tac help you play through hand traps and Xyz Reborn gives some recovery otherwise lacking from the deck. Triple Imperm because it's great going first or second and IMO the best hand trap in the game at the moment.</span>  <span>F0 and Zeus because they're F0 and Zeus and Gagaga Magician to help facilitate some F0 plays.</span>  <em><strong><span>STRENGTHS</span></strong></em> <ul>  	<li><span>It's fun, unique and like any decent rogue option puts an opponent who doesn't know how it plays on the back foot.</span></li>  	<li><span>In the right hands it is incredibly versatile and able to adjust and target disruption on the fly.</span></li>  	<li><span>Good, new support on its way.</span></li>  	<li><span>While it doesn't synergise enough to warrant playing, its generally quite comfortable playing through banish cards like Macro Cosmos</span></li> </ul> <span><em><strong>WEAKNESSES + PROBLEM CARDS</strong></em></span> <ul>  	<li><span>It's a difficult deck to play. While the cards for the most part function pretty simply there's very few easy wins with this one, one wrong move can lose you a game. Knowing how your opponent's deck and cards work is vitally important in order to target your disruption.</span></li>  	<li><span>The recovery for the deck is really low. If you burn through all your main or extra deck Exosisters you'll be lying high and dry.</span></li>  	<li><span>Going second</span></li>  	<li><span>It's expensive. These days you can build some pretty meta-competant decks on a budget, this is neither.</span></li>  	<li><span>Ash Blossom, Nibiru, There Can Be Only One and Cosmic Cyclone all have the potencial to throw your game plan off big time. Unless you side in Ice Dragon's Prison, it really struggles to get over Dragoon too.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Constructive feedback and good side deck options always appreciated!</span>"

Not optimized yet.,"This deck is based around using Princess Cologne combined with either Grandpa Demetto or Doll House to get XYZ monsters out.  Soul Tiger and Phantom Gryphon could be swapped for other Normal monsters, but you should use level 4 Normal monsters with either 0 Atk or 0 Def.  The 6 Doll Monster cards are required for Doll Happiness to work.  Box of Friends is basically required before you can Princess Cologne on the field in an effective way.  This is easiest with Doll Happiness, but setting Box and letting it be destroyed works otherwise.  Grandpa Demetto, if you already have one Normal monster in the GY and Princess Cologne has at least one material, allows you to SS any rank 8 XYZ from the Extra deck, depending on what you need at the time.  Fortune Fairy Hikari is an additional way to get Demetto out.  There may be a better replacement that doesn't clog your hand if drawn as a starting card.  Doll House allows you to get out rank 6 XYZs, but with the requirement of having 2 Normal monsters in the GY that also have a copy still in the deck.  Use Pot/Jar of Avarice if there are too many in the GY and none in the deck to make this happen.  Nefarious Archfiend Eater of Nefariousness can be special summoned when Grandpa Demetto is on the field, and once it goes to the GY can destroy your other monsters to come back from the GY, proccing Supply Squad, proccing Box of Friends, or just getting rid of a monster you don't need anymore, such as certain XYZ monsters that are out of materials.  Supply Squad and Piercing the Darkness provide additional card draws, and Piercing the Darkness additionally buffs any XYZ monster that used Normal monsters as materials for summoning.  Pairs very nicely with Kachi Kochi Dragon.  Solemn and Ash Blossom probably shouldn't need explained.  Number 97: Draglubion could be easily swapped for a different XYZ but I highly recommend the others, especially Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis, which combos with Grandpa Demetto (who will usually be on the field if Hieratic is out, since you need Demetto to create the level 8 materials)."

You lose to dark ruler, and forbidden droplet but deck is fun, I l","Spyrals have been my favorite deck for as long as its been around. I have tried to keep it viable and this is my 2022 list.  Few glaring issues....  &nbsp;  46 card deck and 2 absolute dead cards, 5 undesirable starting cards:  Spyral sleeper, Last Resort, Scrap Golem, Crystron Rosenix, and Codebreaker.  &nbsp;  First off the deck is categorized according to Patrick Hoban's Road of the King card categories. So we start with the....Starters. Spyrals lose to handtraps, hard so scrap package is the best way to either bait out hand traps or establish apollousa before double helix hits the field. This also helps get around nibiru. 6 copies split among fossil dig, raptor and scrap recycler. I prefer to dig so having fossil dig helps bait ash, raptor baits imperm and effect veiler and then recycler starts the combo. Raptor also getting its effects negated keeps it on the field to help establish naturia beast with quik fix. Drones is other starter in the deck, its the other normal summon and gets you information.  Extenders are the spyral agent as recycler gets you apollousa and a spyral on field so spyral agent gets you to double helix, but rescue or assault as the spell/trap to pop off scrap package is probably the best start.  Worst part of this deck is the bricking. its a going first so for defense I want to run dragged down to the grave to rip hand traps but also draw cards off it (crossout or called by doesnt get you there). Instant fusion gives you a monster negate and a level one for where arf thou, and called by is called by. Triple tactics can be draw off sylvan xyz later in combo and if you baited out a hand trap its a free draw two or steal a body to combo with.  &nbsp;  Ultimate goal is spyral sleeper, tri-gate, apollousa as your points of interaction. You lose to dark ruler, and forbidden droplet but deck is fun, I love the archetype and probably wont ever stop playing going first spyrals.  &nbsp;  Try it out!"

His deck was insanely cheap, and I was happy to see a list to use that is extremely easy to build in cardboard, but I did imagine the $12 price tag was really strong, but the deck could be stronger. So using a comment under the video, I implemented Naturia Beast, Fabled Unicore, Rescue Cat, and a Hop Ear Squadron Engine. With that, I thought that with how many tuners and synchro monsters that were already in the deck, I decided that leaning more into it with being able to Synchro on your opponent's turn and disrupt their turn using Crystron Quandax, Desert Locusts, and a choice between Psy-Framelord Omega or Draco Berserker of the Tenyi. With this, you still get all the interruption of the Melffys, with the pops from Kalantosa, and potentially some bounces and negates using Melffy Time and Melffy of the Forests. Not only that, when your board can get clogged with spare monsters, you can pull out the Plasma and lock down your opponent, and send them packing.  &nbsp;  Even with all this, the deck increased in price so much compared to the starting canvas i was provided, but I believe it's still entirely budget, gives people a fun deck, and stays cute, making it a great entry into Yu-Gi-Oh! for many."

The deck is based off of the Exodia deck that Dzeef has on his channel and an old reversal quiz ftk that I can't find anymore. The goal is to get down to 2000 or 1000 lp through chicken game, map, and popperup, then reversal quiz with set shurikens.  I've tested a few builds and this seems to be the most consistent but you still brick occasionally.  You lose to an ash vs a bad hand, veiler, imperm, and going second vs most decks. You deserve this. Thankfully these aren't really problems in the Xyz Event since everyone is playing self-ftk and numeron otk.  Please don't take this to ranked, just play the Exodia version."

From play testing almost any hand can immediately give you the edge to start chaining effects that will cripple your opponent and dominate the field. There are plenty of ways to gain life point from Spells/Traps and monster effects. Once you've gained a high enough advantage you can, if able to, synchro into Ancient Sacred Wyvern and attack for an immense amount of damage."

The Extra Deck is comprised mostly of fusion monsters, taking advantage of all different ways to fuse these monsters of Chaos. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The boss-monster, </span><em><strong><span class=""s3"">Guardian Chimera</span></strong></em><span class=""s1"">, can be fused with three monsters that have different attributes so it becomes very versatile for any problem you may face. When summoned with a Spell or effect, Chimera has a special ability that lets you destroy your opponents’ cards while simultaneously allowing you to draw a card(s). Be careful, however, because Necro Fusion cannot be used to Fusion Summon this great beast; the only valid way is for monsters to be released from the hand or the field. Plus, while Polymerization is in the GY, Chimera cannot be targeted with card effects by your opponent. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The other fusions also feature easy ways to be summoned with the Small Engines available in this deck. </span><em><strong><span class=""s3"">Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon</span></strong></em><span class=""s1""> can be summoned by either fusing BEWD with another dragon, or can be Special Summoned by tributing a BEWD equipped with a Fusion monster. While it is more difficult to fusion summon, its special ability makes it unaffected by Trap Cards or effects and once it battles, during the end of the Damage Step, the player can target 1 Trap in their graveyard and Set it to the field. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><em><strong><span class=""s3"">Centaur Mina</span></strong></em><span class=""s1""> (1 LIGHT Warrior + 1 Beast) can quickly negate an opponent’s Trap Card during the player’s turn and Set it right back down. Mina can be really easily fusion summoned, especially using her Noble Knight’s effects, and can also Special Summon Level 2 or lower monsters during the Main Phase allowing for Synchro Summoning and more. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s3"">Dinomorphia Stealthbergia</span></strong><span class=""s1""> (which requires 2 different Dinomorphia monsters) utilities the Dinomorphia LP effects to the player’s advantage, allowing for the player to activate Trap Cards or Dinomorphia effects without paying LP. As long as your LP is 2000 or less, you are free to activate all the Trap Cards that halve LP. Plus, if your opponent activates a monster effect, Stealthbergia can inflict damage equal to that monster’s Original Attack. When this fusion dino-machine is destroyed, it brings back one of your Dinomorphia monsters from the GY. This deck provides many ways to Fusion Summon but lacks the endurance for longer encounters so players must be wise about using Dinomorphia cards and effects because of the LP-draining constraints.</span></p>"

It's a really basic strategy. All the cards in the deck are based around getting these cards in the hand. Once you have all of these cards on the field, every time your opponent summons a monster it's attack is halved and you get a token with 3800 attack that can't be destroyed by battle. Scapegoat is also helpful if you can't get black garden. If you find it turning into a stall game you can always use final countdown."

Conveniently, the Rose Dragons are ALSO level 3. So, this deck does most of what Kitchen Synch ( or Rose Brave Tenyi Swordsoul) does, but can also make use of Utopic Draco Future.  &nbsp;  I will briefly explain some of the combo lines that are possible: <ol>  	<li>2 level 3 extenders: very simple but also quite low ceiling, get the 2 level 3 bodies on field, make Ghostrick Alucard, overlay again for Angel of mischief, detach Alucard to search for shot, use shot to revive Alucard, rank up the Alucard into another mischief, make Draco Future.</li>  	<li>Brave Engine plus Red Rose Dragon: Full combo, do brave stuff to get gryphon and the token online, summon either the Rose dragon, make Baronne with Red Rose and Gryphon, use Red Rose to summon Roxrose, search for Basal Rose Shoot, make Halq with rox and the brave token, special Deskbot 001, make Auroradon with Halq and 001, get tokens and 001 back, make Cupid Pitch with token and 001, increase Pitch level, make Borreload with cupid and token. Now you have a choice with what to search off Cupid Pitch, either search Psychic Tracker and use that plus the basal rose shoot to go through combo line 1, or search hop eared squadron so you can make satellite warrior on your opponent's turn.</li>  	<li>Interrrupted line/ brick: pray they dont have nib, and try to make halq at all costs, then continue like in line 2</li> </ol> This list is still very work in progress, i am currently considering Ghostrick Shot at 1, but it's a hard garnet, and obviously the handtrap lineup can change to suit your preferences. I hope you give this deck a spin, and let me know if you have any questions :D"

Due to the change in the format and lacking enough URs, I had to go with what worked, but given Dinos often use the main deck instead, they can still do their thing, but they need to have a bigger emphasis on going 2nd as a result, thus requiring the use of more board breaker cards.  The deck definitely thrives in a format where negation isn't as rampant, but still watch out for Ash Blossom and Artifact Lancea (if it somehow crops up) since those on the Misc in the GY can shut this deck down hard."

The main play is usually 2nd turn otk.  A lot of plays are just about drawing cards and summoning Rainbow Neos to clear the board and Vortex and Naturia Beast to negate. Thats about it, everything else is just so you can run over any card. You can also go into Apollousa to negate monster effects since this deck is not running the staple hand traps. Utopia, Accesscode Talker,.. Feral Imps is there to extend the play either for drawing or Pendulum summon, you can put Jigabyte instead of Nefarious it can expand your board a little for that otk. Raigeki is there for I don't know what u can put what ever you want keep in mind that Rainbow Neos is the last monster to enter the field since you cannot summon after using Neos Fusion. If u feel like pendulum Rising is bad bcs there are not enough targets in the deck just put another duelist alliance. Thats all. This is my first deck list that I ever made myself and I got to plat with it in Master Duel in a week. Maybe that's not good enough but i returned to this game now after 6 years so i had a lot of catching up to do! Have fun!"

As per usual, cards on the side will be those that are nice to have but are not necessarily mandatory, if you have them.  Before anything else, I wanna preface this first with a bit of story and a disclaimer that this isn't exactly a budget list due to for some strange reason, all Duelist Alliance archetypes are expensive as shit to build in MD, especially Shaddolls. I actually once loved Rituals, I like building Ritual good stuff decks like Impcantation Relinquished or Impcantation Nekroz, even though most of them looks incredibly similar to each other... until the day Drytrons came. At that time, I was already focused on building more Fusion strategies but it pissed me off how they abused the hell out of both Herald of Ultimateness and Herald of Perfection, and it's just as bad as the days of the formats where those two are being turbo'd or arguably even worse. But that scar eventually got slowly remedied by Konami's decision on suddenly making Dogmatika a Ritual focused archetype (which to an extent makes sense considering all the Extra Deck hate), and I've received an epiphany. Impcantation Dogmatika. (Here's the list for those that are interested, although it's a bit outdated: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/impcantation-dogmatika/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/impcantation-dogmatika/</a>)  <strong>The list:</strong>  <strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Zaborg the Mega Monarch"">Zaborg the Mega Monarch</a></strong> - <span>Upon successfully Tribute summoning with a Dogmatika monster, destroy itself (or another Level 8 or higher LIGHT monster on the field that can be destroyed) to send 8+ cards from your opponent's Extra Deck and all three copies of your <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a>, up to two copies of your <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a>, <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>, <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</a>, and <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> to the GY for a triple Ritual monster/spell search, a pop or two with N'tss, a <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a> and Dogmatika monster search or Special Summon during the End Phase.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Nekroz Kaleidoscope"">Nekroz Kaleidoscope</a>, <a data-name=""Nekroz Mirror"">Nekroz Mirror</a>, and <a data-name=""Nekroz Cycle"">Nekroz Cycle</a></strong> - <span>Some people only really play 2 Kaleidoscope and 1 of each Mirror and Cycle since they're searchable and they also play Pot of Prosperity, but I'd much rather open with those cards than searching for them, plus more copies means more grind.</span>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Nekroz of Areadbhair"">Nekroz of Areadbhair</a></strong> - <span>For some reason, he's legal in MD. You're almost never gonna be using his discard effect. He's here because he's a monster negate that banishes, and Tributes for cost, which could lead to some neat interactions with Cyber Angels and Hieratics (the latter which I may or may not test any time soon, probably).</span>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a></strong> - <span>A funny card against Drytron match ups alongside <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>.</span>  <strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Soul Exchange"">Soul Exchange</a></strong> - <span>Stormforth for Ritual decks, though it sucks that it targets.</span>  Anything else in the Extra Deck are just either Kaleidoscope or <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> fodders. If you're worried about running out of resources, that's why both <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> and <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> is mandatory. As soon as we get access to the newer Dogmatika support, <a data-name=""White Relic of Dogmatika"">White Relic of Dogmatika</a> and <a data-name=""Dogmatikamacabre"">Dogmatikamacabre</a> in particular, this deck and Impcantation decks in general will get even stronger. So yeah, that's pretty much it for the list."

Deck aims to OTK turn 2 or 4 at worst, aim to go second always because you need the extra card and can't afford to give your opponent the chance to break your board. Should be good enough to reach plat V assuming you don't get too unlucky with matchups breaking your win streak. Dies a gruesome death against Heralds and Utopias, most other things can give you a rough game if you don't get a good opening hand with handtraps or misplay them. Not the perfect Madolche deck by any means and quite expensive as far as Master Duel decks go.  Combo is usually:  Magileine normal -&gt; search for Petingcess -&gt; Special Petingcess -&gt; Special Anjelly -&gt; Tribute Anjelly to special Hootcake -&gt; Special Messengelato -&gt; add Chateau/Salon or Ticket depending to game state. -&gt; XYZ summon Tiaramisu and Link summon Fresh Sistart -&gt; Use Tiaramisu's effect to send back the cards used to link summon Fresh Sistart to shuffle back to the deck the opponent's most dangerous cards.

Generaiders are a suite of boss battle-themed monsters that have quick effects that tribute other Generaider cards to activate them, apart from Mardel. These monsters (except for Loptr) are all Level 9 and can be summoned onto the field with ease with the most important card in the deck, Generaider Boss Stage.  We'll go over Generaider Boss Stage as its own card first. This card allows you to special summon any Generaider from your deck if your opponent draws a card, even in their draw phase, which means its Ash Blossom this effect or suffer. And when a Generaider is special summoned on our opponent's turn, Boss Stage fills our board up with Generaider Tokens, which are basically fodder for your powerful Generaider effects.  Now we'll go over the Generaiders, the monsters of the hour. We are running most of them, because Frodi and Dovelgus are about as good as a dumpster fire. We're running 3 Loptr, 3 Mardel, 1 Naglfar, 1 Nidhogg, 1 Hela, 1 Utgarda, and 2 Harr. Loptr is the only Level 4 Generaider, so he's one of the most important cards to get our metaphorical train rolling. He can tribute a Generaider (including himself) to special summon a Level 9 Generaider from our deck, which is most usually going to be Mardel. Mardel is the first of our Generaiders, and the only one that has an effect when its summoned instead of a quick effect. Mardel allows you to add a Generaider card (not just monster) from your deck to your hand, so this is a consistent way to get our Boss Stage out on field by our opponent's turn. The next is Naglfar, which prevents the destruction of a card(s) by tributing a Generaider monster to be able to keep the card(s) alive. A funny thing can happen with this is if the Generaider Tokens live until the end phase, you can tribute Naglfar to keep the tokens on your board until your next turn, which can come up like once every 50 games. Next is Nidhogg, who tributes a Generaider to negate the special summon of a monster and destroy it, which is by far extremely useful compared to Naglfar. Its a piece of negation without too steep of a cost. Hela can tribute a Generaider to special summon a unique Generaider from your GY, so we can use her to gain access to a Generaider we need in the GY. Utgarda can tribute 2 Generaiders to banish any card on the field. While it is a steeper cost, its non-destruction banish can prove useful against many other decks. And we have Harr, which by far is the most useful main deck Generaider, tributes 2 Generaiders to negate the activation of a card and destroy it. Omni negates are fun :) Harr also has another effect where if your opponent adds a card from their deck to their hand when its not draw phase, you can force your opponent to send a monster from their hand or field to the GY. He can get really oppressive with our funny pet snake when we explain the Extra Deck.  Next our Generaider Spell/Traps. While there's not too many, they are powerful enough to unbrick a hand, bait an Ash Blossom, or straight up gain advantage. 3 Boss Quest, 1 Boss Fight, and 1 Boss Room. Boss Quest reveals a Generaider monster to be able to add 2 Generaider Spell/Traps from your deck to your hand, and you put the Generaider you revealed on the bottom of the deck. You usually don't want to draw or open Generaiders except for Loptr, so you can put the monster back in your deck to special summon it on your opponent's turn. Boss Fight is literally Metaverse for the archetype and your opponent draws a card after, so you can use Harr's effect, Droll and Lock Bird your opponent, etc. Boss Room allows you to discard a card when your opponent responds to a Generaider's active effect to literally change the effect of that card to ""both players draw one card"" which is nuts. You get to draw a card, Harr can do Harr things, Droll and Lock bird can screw up everything. Good shit.  Now onto our generic cards. The good 'ol staples. We got 1 Droll and Lock Bird, 3 Maxx ""C"", 1 Ash Blossom, 3 Lonefire Blossom, Raigeki, Harpie's Feather Duster, 1 Lightning Storm, Terraforming, Called by the Grave, 3 World Legacy Monstrosity, 1 Solemn Judgement, and 2 Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi. Yeah yeah, I know Lonefire Blossom, Monstrosity, and Fists aren't generic, but they're REALLY good in this deck. Lonefire Blossom can tribute itself to summon a Plant monster from your deck... Mardel is a Plant monster. Its basically Loptr, but for exclusively Mardel. World Legacy Monstrosity can special summon a Level 9 monster from your hand, or you can select a Level 9 monster you control to special summon 2 more from your deck with different attributes and types. Hmm... its almost like most of the Generaiders are Level 9. That's handy! Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi is a Counter Trap that's active only while you control a non-effect monster. The Generaider Tokens are non-effect monsters. Its basically Harr but without the tribute, spell speed 4, and not once per turn. I shouldn't have to explain what the rest of the cards do...  Now the Extra Deck! These cards are a rather good reason to play this deck. We got the 'ol reliable duo of Utopic Future and Utopic Draco Future, True King of All Calamities, 2 Number 92's, Infinitrack Earth Slicer, Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity, 3 Nine-Lives Cat, Sacred Tree Beast, The Spider Duo of Pain Gainer and Seven Sins, and Zeus. UF and UDF takes 2 level 9 Xyz monsters that don't have ""Number"" in their name and makes a big 'ol boy that'll negate monster effects and permanently take control of them. Cool! I shouldn't have to explain Calamities. Best Rank 9 Xyz in the game that'll make anyone on the opposite side of the board from him sad. Number 92: Heart-Earth dragon wipes your opponent's board of whatever monsters they summoned during the End Phase. Its amazing in the situations it can come up in, nearly unmatched in what it can do. Earth Slicer takes opponent's monsters destroyed by battle with it and can use them as material for its effect, which is to pop cards on the field equal to the materials used. Its other effect doesn't matter in this deck. Jormungandr is the pet snake I mentioned earlier. It can use 1 material for both players to draw cards, then both players must give one card in their possession from their field or hand to Jormungandr as material. This combined with Harr is nuts. You basically get to rip 2 cards from your opponent for free basically. Very cool! It can get oppressive if your opponent has exhausted all their resources and has almost nothing to work with. Nine-Lives Cat can reborn a Level 9 monster from any GY and it gives it protection. Its very handy, just like Number 92! Sacred Tree Beast is a weird version of Invoked Mechaba. You activate a card or effect during your turn and it can attach a card of the same type to it as material. And when your opponent activates a card, you give up a material of the same card type to negate it. Unfortunately, both of these effects are once per turn and can only be used on their respective turns. The Spiders; Number 84 and Number 77 are not that useful, but more useful than most. Number 84 gain DEF equal to the amount of Xyz ranks on your field x200, and can detach a material to destroy all opponent's monsters with DEF less than its own. Oh, and I guess it deals 600 damage for each Spell/Trap card they activate. Number 77 can detach 2 material to banish all special summoned monsters your opponent controls and you get to take one of those monsters as material for Number 77. It can also detach a material to prevent its destruction. Honestly, if I had 2 more Jorms, I'd use them over these spiders. This answers the age-old debate that nobody asked: ""Which is cooler? Snakes or spiders?"" And finally, Zeus. I shouldn't have to explain it, but I will: attack with an Xyz monster, get a non-destruction board wipe with a 3000 ATK/DEF body.  And that's it for Generaiders! It may be behind VW when it comes to making Calamities, but its such a cool archetype with a unique style of play and it'll be Number 1 in my heart. Its got a ton of plays and starters, but when it bricks... yeesh... Its pretty nuts in the Xyz Festival Event, and can take over the game over a decent bit of the decks, like Numeron who wants to go 2nd and Timelords who do the same, except worse and without an OTK. Also I'd probably run 3 Droll and Lock Bird for Drytrons. Hope y'all learned something about how to play Funny Level 9 Monster Deck :)"

However when it gets going, it can be a real force.  The main idea of the deck is to generally just use the S-Force to build up a level of control and then use the engines available to round out the game.  If you start with Rappa, it's best to just do the usual Gravitino, Platina board with chase set and hopefully and imperm or an ash in hand. Usually, this is enough to disrupt your opponent turn 1.  If you end up with two s force on board with no chase set, you're best off linking into Verte. You then have the option of going into a chaos monster (Daedalus with a field spell up is ideal as it gives you a level of protection) and then making DPE.  Small World is brilliant in this deck too, as it's extremely easy to get whatever S-Force monster you need, due to the LIGHT/DARK attributes and the variety of types.  As for the Chaos monsters themselves, it would probably be more ideal to use the Dragon chaos monsters. I only run BLS and CED because I have them in CR lmao.  I don't run TCBOO as Rappa and DPE clash far too much for my liking. With all the backrow hate in the format, it tends to get wiped pretty quickly too. However, it is an option should you think it is needed.  Let me know what you think of my absolutely jank profile lol"

 &nbsp;  <em><strong>COMBOS</strong></em>  <strong><span><em>Bloqueo de invocaciones</em></span></strong> Cartas necesarias : Zombie world + Rivalry Of Warlords  El propósito de este combo es controlar las invocaciones enemigas, por ejemplo: <ul>  	<li>Tienes Zombie World activado</li>  	<li>El oponente invoca Aleister the Invoker (Spellcaster) pero es cambiado a zombie por el efecto de Zombie World</li>  	<li>El oponente usa Invocation para invocar por fusión a Invoked Mechaba(Spellcaster)</li>  	<li>Encadenas Rivalry of Warlords, entonces el oponente no puede invocar a Invoked Mechaba porque ahora sólo puede invocar monstruos zombies, el bloqueo está completo!</li> </ul> <ol>  	<li>Usa Zombie world en tu turno, si no tienes una en mano búscala con Necroworld Banshee, Terraforming or Metaverse (Estás últimas 2 cartas no están en la lista pero puedes incluirlas)</li>  	<li>Coloca Rivalry Of Warlords  y usala en el turno del oponente cuando invoque cualquier monsttruo</li> </ol> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Limitar la cantidad de invocaciones</i></b></span> Cartas necesarias : Summon limit  Este es el combo más sencillo, en tu turno invoca la mayor cantidad de monstruos posibles y si puedes dejar a los boss monsters es mejor, por ejemplo: <ul>  	<li>Doomking balerdroch, Eldlich The Golden Lord y Vampire Sucker fueron invocados</li>  	<li>En tu Main Phase 2 coloca Summon Limit</li>  	<li>Activa Summon Limit, ahora tu oponente sólo podrá invocar dos monstruos en su turno</li> </ul> Si usaste Summon Limit para controlar las invocaciones del oponente pero nopudiste invocar uno o más monstruos puedes enviar al cementerio Summon Limit con el efecto de  Eldlich the Golden Lord así no te afectará a ti el límite de invocaciones, si no tienes a eldlich en cementerio se paciente  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <strong><span><em>Remueve monstruos oponentes + Convierte en cero el ataque de un monstruo oponente</em></span></strong> Cartas necesarias : Doomking Balerdroch + Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi  Cada vez que un monstruo zombie active un efecto puedes encadenar el efecto de Doomking para negar ese efecto o para remover un monstruo del campo o cementerio  El efecto de Doomking puede ser activado incluso si el monstruo activado es un zombie del oponente <ol>  	<li>Invoca a Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi (Puedes hacer link summon usando 3 monstruos pero uno de ellos forzosamente debe ser un link 2 por ejemplo Vampire sucker o Avendread Savior)</li>  	<li>Si Doomking Balerdroch está en cementerio: invocalo usando el efecto de mezuki (En tu turno) o espera la Standby Phase para invocarlo por su propio efecto</li>  	<li>Cuando Doomking es invocado encadena el efecto de  Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi para cambiar el ataque de un monstruo oponente a 0 y enseguida encadena el efecto de  Doomking para remover una carta del campo o cementerio oponente</li> </ol> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <strong><span><em>Efectos de mosntruo negados</em></span></strong> Cartas necesarias : Skill Drain + Eldlich the Golden Lord  Otro combo simple, sólo necesitas colocar Skill Drain y usarla en turno oponente si puedes jugar sin tus efectos de monstruos consérvala en campo pero si no usa el efecto de  Eldlich the Golden Lord para mandar Skill Drain al cementerio ahora podrás usar tus monstruos    &nbsp;

I just figured that I might want to test it out since I just discovered that Icejades aren't really bad so without further intros I present to you, Invoked Dogmatika Shaddoll Icejades.  That's a mouthful, but I wanna preface this first with the thoughts that #1. This will not be my final iteration of the deck, I most definitely will be testing more of this in the future since I can see a lot of potential from it but I cannot promise that this will be a top tier deck or at least not immediately, #2. This does run 5-6 Field Spells on it, but they are not necessarily bricks, and #3. My side deck was initially designed with <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> in mind, until I remembered that <a data-name=""Bridge of Salvation"">Bridge of Salvation</a> was a card (or at least going to be a card, which I will discuss in a bit) and this is a deck that plays two different Field Spells that can both be starters.  <strong>Addressing the weirdos in the deck list first:</strong>  • x1 <a data-name=""Icejade Kosmochlor"">Icejade Kosmochlor</a> - <span>This card is the reason why I decided to play Icejades. She's a 3000 DEF body on board that's a delayed Skill Drain, and we all know what that card does, provided that their archetypal Field Spell <a data-name=""Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle"">Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle</a> is on the field.</span>  • x1 <a data-name=""Icejade Creation Kingfisher"">Icejade Creation Kingfisher</a> - <span>I really wanna play more of this card because it's so good with Kosmochlor, but <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> and <a data-name=""Bridge of Salvation"">Bridge of Salvation</a> is just too good for the consistency of this deck. I might cut <a data-name=""Icejade Tinola"">Icejade Tinola</a> for an extra copy for insurance but sacrificing utility.</span>  • x1 <a data-name=""Bridge of Salvation"">Bridge of Salvation</a> and x1 <a data-name=""Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast"">Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast</a> - <span>This is where the funny comes, with Bridge of Salvation in particular, because it searches <a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a>, which I am actually considering on cutting down to only 2 copies because of it, and <a data-name=""Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast"">Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast</a> acting as a bridge and a LIGHT target or discard fodder for <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>.</span>  • x1 <a data-name=""Icejade Erosion"">Icejade Erosion</a> - <span>This card is one of your interruptions on the Icejade portion of the deck. Sure, it does target, but it's still a negate for a face-up CARD, not just monsters or spell/trap, and it's searchable.</span>  <strong>Some initial testing thoughts:</strong>  <span>1. <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> and the Dogmatika package conflicts against each other, unsurprisingly, but it does leave you vulnerable to being hand trapped, that's why I decided to cut the <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>, and its main deck package for either more defensive cards like <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> or some ratio of hand traps and <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator </a>or more Icejade cards for utility. I'm still on the fence with playing <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> and <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</a>, but it's always an option but then again, this is still a pretty early phase for me testing this deck.</span>  <span>2. I'm surprised that <a data-name=""Icejade Cradle"">Icejade Cradle</a> is not a once per turn, which actually makes the deck pretty fast at digging through the deck for combo pieces, alongside <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>. I definitely am not playing less than three of both cards and Metalfoes Fusion since it's not really a hard brick because it can be used as a discard fodder for <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> against spells.</span>  <span>3. It technically is a smokescreen strategy, because you can go through your initial Icejade stuff without worrying about getting xeno locked in any way, shape, or form and without spending your Normal Summon.</span>  <span>4. The deck can easily swarm, but the extra deck is exceptionally tight. The only reason I play Invoked Cocytus over an extra copy of Invoked Mechaba is that it actually can be a combo piece to maximize the use of your <a data-name=""Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle"">Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle</a>, and is also a 2900 DEF wall that can't be targeted or destroyed by your opponent's card effects which can be further boosted by <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>.</span>  <span>5. As per usual for an Invoked variant, this deck can play extremely well under <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a>, which is always a bonus.</span>  <strong>Closing thoughts:</strong> I am still undecided on whether to make a new list for the succeeding updates or just straight up do the updates on this list and make the changes here directly, we'll see, but I'll definitely be testing more of this deck since I just love Fusion summoning in general.

The strategy involves discarding (with ""trade-in"", ""twin twisters"" or ""dragon knight of creation"" effects) or sending to the graveyard (with ""dragon shrine"") level 7 or 8 dragon monsters and reviving then using spell cards (sucha as ""return of the dragon lords"") or monster effects (such as ""arkbrave dragon or white stone of ancients""); You can also use nebula dragon to summon two level 8 dragon monsters to  XYZ summon powerfull allies. You can also use the tuner monsters eventually to syncro summon, but you will be better of using them as hand traps or special summoning effects. I also put two ""W.D.R. Sphere mode"" just in case...  Not a Meta Deck, but i won a fair amount of duels using this deck on Master Duel. If you have any suggestions, please leave a comment (I could really use some tips, because I really would like to use more of those synchro monsters). Have fun with this nostalgic, yet adapted, deck, and behold the beautiful dance of the dragons!!!"

I've updated it after testing it out a few times.,"Control the field by having Eldlich and Doomking Balerdroch join forces. You can also take control of the opponents monsters and expand your zombie army.  Some neat techs:  Use Lava Golem to get rid of problem monsters, even if Zombie World up, this doesn't count as a Tribute Summon, you can use this as a back up plan if Rivalry of the Warlords isn't up. Eldlich's 2nd effect will allow you to easily beat over it, with either itself or Balerdroch. Also if you have Zombie Necronize in hand, take control of Lava Golem, get your opponent to 1000 or less life points &amp; let the burn damage finish them off next turn.  Use Vampire Sucker to get extra draws, either summon a non link monster from your opponent's graveyard, or summon a monster from your graveyard. You can also get free draws everytime Balerdroch revives itself which will also allow you to activate it's effect and banish one of your opponent's monsters.  If you manage to send a strong monster to your opponent's grave, use Red-eyes Zombie Necro Dragon's effect or Vampire Fraulein to steal them. If you manage to summon Shark Fortress, and you have the lifepoints to spare, used it's effect on Fraulein to let it attack twice and steal 2 monsters.  As long as you're not interrupted, Yuki-Onna the Absolute Zero Mayakashi can be easily summoned by using Uni-Zombie or Ash Blossom &amp; another monster to summon Crystron Halqifibrax, use it's effect to summon Glow-up Bloom, then use both to summon Shiranui Skillsaga Supremecy. Afterwords use Glow-up Bloom's effect to summon a high leveled Zombie with Zombie World on the field. Then use both to summon Yuki-Onna. Don't attempt to do this on turn 1 just to be safe, a single Ash will ruin the combo.  Use Psy-framelord Omega to recycle banished cards including Mezuki, Necroworld Banshee, the Eldlixer &amp; Golden Land S/T,  Zombie Necronize. You can also use it to recover Eldlich &amp; Balerdroch incase your opponent banishes them."

Stay tuned for updates if any. Thank you :),"Desk is pretty simple to use.  Main objective is to get 2 monsters on the field (such as Rod and Souls) or the sky striker 1 card combo to make Predaplant Verte Anaconda then pay 2000 LP summon Dragoon, win the game. *Eagle Booster is to make them unable to negate Verte.*  The True Name is easy to use if you combo it with Circle or Servant then free Obelisk for a turn. Link him off after battle phase.  If you have Illusion of Chaos and rites in your hand then search Sauravis for a hand negate.  If all else fails just Skill Drain Torrential and recurring beat with DM. EZ.  Game 2: Side in whatever you need to to hard counter them"

I've been playing Skull Servants since 2014 on and off, and started bringing it to locals over the past year, so I'm very familiar with the core engine. This deck is made to be pure Skulls, and I'm sure a variant on this deck that runs Zombie World, Balerdoch, and Necroworld Banshee is probably more consistent, this is a more off-meta version. With that being said, let's break it down the cards, and look at some combos:  <strong><span>Skull Servant Core:</span></strong>  3x <strong>Wightbaking:</strong> This is the most important card in our deck, it must be at 3, and we want to be opening it in our hand at all times. Its only down-side is that the effect is once-per-turn, so we want to try and play around some negates before we commit to sending this to graveyard. Depending on our opening hand, typically we can summon Baking and link it off to send it to grave, and complete our full combo by adding Wightprince and Wightmare, then discarding Wightmare. Keep in mind that this card specifies that you add 2 cards to hand then discard 1 - you do not have to discard one of the cards added (though most time we do), we can discard any 1 from hand. We can also discard this from hand with Uni-Zombie, and if this gets negated, we'll be able to discard it on our opponents turn when he attempts to destroy Uni-Zombie. The protection effect this card also offers to all our level 3 or lower zombies is a huge bonus, as it can keep our King + Lady boards safe. In an ideal world, we can discard 1 from the deck and keep another in our hand to protect our King on board. This is the easy MVP of the deck.  2x <strong>Wightprince: </strong>The second most important card to this combo. Sending this to grave is our priority on turn 1, as it sends two Garnets from our deck and lets us special summon King. This is a good opener in hand as well: we can play the game when we open Baking, Prince, or Uni-Zombie. By opening either Prince or Baking in hand in addition to Uni-Zombie, it allows to send both, which gives us our best opening line. I run this, the vanilla Skull Servant and Lady each at 2 because they're too cloggy at 3 and sending all 3 I think is just win-more. You could put this at 3 and leave the garnets at 2 but the 3rd becomes a brick pretty quickly, so I think that's suboptimal. Wightprince's second effect is two banish itself + two skull servants to special summon King from the deck. If you've sent two princes on the same turn, I reccomend banishing two Lady in Wights for this effect, as we can special summon them with Wightprince, but we can't special summon the vanilla unfortunately. Being able to special summon the Lady's is nice for our extended combos.  <b>3x Wightmare: </b>The third most important card to the combo. The ability to summon a banished King or Lady is integral to our combos. The King is simply a beater without his Lady next to him, and the only way we’re putting Lady on the board face up is with Wightmare’s effect. I think this should be run at 3 because we can resolve 3 fairly easily, but because we add it to hand with baking, I can see an argument for putting it to two.  <span>2</span>x <strong>King of the Skull Servants</strong>: Our boss monster. We run him at 2 because we don't want to draw it, we always want to special it off of Prince's effect. We can't special summon him with Prince's effect if he is in the hand, as Prince's effect only summons from deck, so its typically not a very good draw. Getting King + Lady on the field protects him from destruction from battle, and the effects of spells and traps, so he is surprisingly difficult to out, which is the fun of playing this deck. If you full combo turn 1, King can hit 7,000 attack turn 1 pretty easily.  2x <strong>Lady in Wight</strong> is another important combo piece. Lady protects all our level 3 or lower zombies from the effects of spells and traps, and we can special summon her from the banished zone with the effect of Wightprince, making her a valuable piece to any board we set up. We don't want to draw into this though, so we keep it at 2.  2x <strong>Skull Servant</strong>: The boy himself. Absolutely never want to draw him, so we keep it at 2 to resolve Wightprince's effect twice. That's all we need him for.  <strong>Other Zombie Support:</strong>  3x <strong>Jack-o-Bolan: </strong>I love this card, I've been playing around with the ratios for a while now. Opening this card with a prince or baking lets us dump them without committing our summon, and this deck really needs that: in my experience playing, getting negated after our normal summon really holds us back. His effect to special a zombie to our field on our opponents main phase is a useful way to tag into Lady when necessary if we don't have her on our end board. His 7 levels make him an option for level 10 synchros as well: I haven't added one to this build yet, but I recommend looking into what level 10 synchros you could add to this deck (I'm thinking Baronne de Fleur). Additionally, this card is also a good target for Avendread Saviour, which we'll touch on later. I think 2x is the minimum for this, 3 could be a bit bricky so you can adjust as you see fit.  3x <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong> is a must at 3 as well. It's the third card in here we're happy to open. I prefer to have baking or prince because one Veiler and our turn is over, but that is the pit-fall of this deck as a whole. Getting to send from the deck is exactly what this deck wants, and he sets it up easily, and we can full combo from there. I previously ran an additional 3 copies of <strong>Shiranui Solitaire</strong> as a way to special summon Uni-Zombie, but I don't like being left with a completely empty board when Solitaire is negated, so I cut them. As noted above, if Uni-Zombie does get negated, our turn is basically done but if we have a Baking in hand, it gives us at least something on our opponents turn.  1x <strong>Mezuki: </strong>Mezuki is a great extender - if we don't need to dump a combo piece from deck with Uni-Zombie, we can dump this instead to bring a card back for extending our combos. It's very nice to be able to dump, but we only need 1 copy in my opinion, we aren't recycling cards that often, plus Wightmare allows to do the same from the Banish pile.  <strong><span>Extras:</span></strong>  1x <strong>Destrudo: </strong>Fresh off the banlist, this card is cracked, very much worth running. We can get in grave easily, and search it off Halq too. Worth trying out.  1x <strong>Pankertops: </strong>We're happy going second, and this is a nice piece going 2nd as well. Our end-board is typically just 2 monsters so there's plenty opportunity to summon this vs meta decks.  <strong><span>Hand-Traps</span></strong>  3x <strong>Ash Blossom: </strong>needs no introduction, pretty much mandatory. All the ghost girls have nice utility as level 3 zombies in here as well, so its good to keep in mind.  3x <strong>Nibiru: </strong>this deck gets killed by combo players that can set up huge boards with negates and such, so I think we have to run 3 Nibiru in main to shut that down.  3x <strong>Impermanence: </strong>like Ash, needs no introduction. A nice piece of interruption, we don't want to let our opponents get set up.  Like always with hand traps, it depends what you're playing into. If you'd rather run Belle, Ghost Ogre, DD Crow, Droll, Veiler, etc that's your call. I previously ran Veiler in this build as a searchable level 1 tuner with Halqifibrax with the ability to synchro with Jack-o-Bolan but it didn't come up super often.  <strong><span>Spells and Traps</span></strong>  1x <strong>Foolish Burial: </strong>Best card in our deck, wish we could have more than 1. Starts our combos.  1x <strong>One for One: </strong>Another great starter piece for us, also limited to 1. Also starts our combos.  1x <strong>Monster Reborn: </strong>great extender if we send 1 Wightprince, we can reborn it and link it back to the grave and get the effect again as its not once per turn. Allows us to re-start combos with our grave if we top-deck it too. Would love more than 1 of this too.  1x <strong>Called by the Grave: </strong>Also limited to 1, great interruption, always feels like a game-winner to pull this  3x <strong>Where arf thou: </strong>Very nice extender. After sending Prince and special summoning King, we can activate this and normal summon to avoid the cost if we want. We're mostly fine with paying the cost if necessary though. Alternatively, if we can make our regular board already, use this to add Wightbaking at the end of turn to protect your King and Lady on your opponents turn – its well worth the 2000 life points.  1x <strong>Burial From a Different Dimension: </strong>We banish 3 to Special King. This returns 3 to the grave. Self explanatory I think. I've run this at 2 and 3, but its bricky at 3. You could run this at 2, but I'm happy with 1. Don’t forget to special summon Lady with Wightmare before activating this if you haven’t got her on board.  <b><span>Extra Deck:</span></b>  1x <b>Linkuriboh </b>and <b>Salamangreat Almiraj </b>serve the same purpose as link fodder to send a baking or prince off our board to open a combo. Use Linkuriboh in your King + Lady lines for one added line of protection. Use Almiraj if you’re planning to make Accesscode so you’ll have the fire attribute for his effect and you’re not making Phoenix, as Unicorn will give you the Dark attribute already.  1x <b>Avendread Saviour </b>gives us another way to discard from the deck, so we can make this reasonably often. Having 3 level 7 zombies in the deck gives us a little more utility to this effect too for clearing boards.  1x <b>Vampire Sucker</b>: we can make this along a combo chain to draw a card as we’re summoning. The second effect of summoning from our opponents grave to their field is an underrated tool to bust up potential combos our opponents is setting up later than turn 1.  1x <b>Knightmare Phoenix and Unicorn – </b>need no introduction I think, they can go in any extra deck, and are basically mandatory for going into Accesscode.  1x <b>Masquerena </b>– Interruption for our opponents turn to go into Unicorn.  1x <b>Halqifibrax </b>– Great extender that we make with Uni-zombie fairly often, opens us up to Link 4s easily.  1x <b>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess </b>– the best interruption we can make. Great end board card for our turn 1s, but we should look to make 4 negates where we can.  <strong><span>How to play Skull Servants:</span></strong>  This deck is very simple to play, we don't vary off of our main line too often. Our end board can typically be Apollusa and Omega if we want, or finish on King/Lady and other pieces.  <strong>The basic line:</strong>  Our basic combo is as follows: Send Wightbaking to grave (the two ways we commonly accomplish this is 1) normal Baking and Link-1, or 2) effect of Uni-Zombie, but foolish burial and one for one can get us there too). We then add Wightprince and Wightmare to hand, and discard Prince. -&gt; Prince effect to send a skull servant and Lady in Wight -&gt; Prince 2nd effect to Special Summon <strong>King of the Skull Servants</strong>. -&gt; Send Wightmare from hand to Special Summon Lady in Wight. Now we have King at 2k and protected by Lady.  <strong>extended line:</strong>  our extended line is any line that pitches both Wightprinces. We can do this pretty easily by opening Prince or Baking in hand, and anything that lets us send it from the hand: One for One, Uni-Zombie, Jack-o-Bolan all give us this. Where Are Thou also lets us add one if we didn't open one in hand. In this line, we usually want to <em>send Wightprince first, and Baking second</em><strong><i> </i></strong>to scout Ash, as we prefer Baking to resolve. We also want to send both Princes before Special Summoning King if we can. If we do so, it allows to banish both Lady's from grave and special them both if we opened with a Wightmare (in addition to adding one with Baking effect). Always keep in mind that Wightbaking is a once-per-turn effect, but Wightprince is not – if Baking is negated by Ash, we can’t send a second copy that same turn.  <strong>full combo (god-hand opening):</strong>  In terms of full combo, the biggest board we can finish on turn 1 is a King at 4k, an Apollusa with 4 negates and Psy Framelord Omega. A line that lets us do this requires Prince/Baking in hand with Jack-o-Bolan, Uni-Zombie as our normal summon, another way to send a prince, and Reborn or Foolish. We can make this board by pitching Baking to Special Jack-o-Bolan, complete our basic combo with Baking effect, and send our 2nd Prince. Special Lady with Wightmare, and you have a board of Jack, King, and Lady with no summon committed yet. We can normal Uni-Zombie and use effect to pitch Mezuki, Reborn Mezuki, synchro into Omega with Uni-Zombie and Mezuki. Use Mezuki to bring back a Lady and link-4 the remaining monsters to make Apollusa. Finally, you can activate your 2nd prince in grave and pitch both Ladys to finish with a King on board as well. In my experience, this is the biggest board we can make going first with the cards in this deck list. Depending on what you’re playing into, this kind of hand gives you endless options for what to do with your turn.  <b>King and Lady on board vs Extra deck monsters?</b>  One scenario you’ll face pretty often with this deck is you’ll have King + Lady on board as special summons, and likely one other piece (a linkuriboh or a Uni-Zombie that started your combo). With Uni-Zombie and Lady you’ll have the option to go into a Synchro 8 if you used both Uni effects, or link 2 into Halqifibrax and go into Apollusa from there. I’ve gone back and forth on what I think is better, but at the moment I think I prefer setting up King/ Lady and pass than making Omega or Apo with 3 negates. A big plus to finishing on King/Lady is if we can keep a Wightbaking in hand with this board – it gives full protection to an attempt to pop King or Lady from the board, and lets us resolve baking’s effect again on our opponents turn. In this scenario, they’ll have to commit further resources to removing King, and if we aren’t OTK’d, we’ll be able to make another King/Lady board on our next turn.  <strong><span>Shorter/Alternative</span></strong><span> <strong>lines:</strong></span>  In my opinion, these going-first boards are fine, and we're happy to make them into combo decks, but we need a good opening hand. My feeling is that we're better off going second if we're not playing into an opponent setting up negates. A lot of our lines on turn 2 lead us into making Abyss Dweller (and into Zeus from there if we want).  If we’re going 2nd and we have a weak hand but we can muster 2 summons, we can make Avendread Savior and attack into our opponent to dump a prince or baking. Avendread is a good utility summon for this reason, and he’s also good because we can dump Jack-O-Bolan to decrease an opponents attack by 1400. This line doesn’t feel great but if we dump Baking from Avendread, we can set up our King + Lady in Main Phase 2 at least.  With <b>Destrudo,</b> I haven’t gotten a physical copy to test out combos with this, but it definitely adds a lot of options to our turns.  <b><span>Upgrades and Changes to this deck</span></b>  <b><span>Main Deck:</span></b>  <b>Shiranui Solitaire: </b>I previously ran this at 3. It’s 3 more chances to draw into Uni-Zombie and begin your combo, but I took it out simply because if this effect is negated after tributing itself for cost, you are left with an empty board. If you wanted to run this, I’d suggest running a heavier hand trap/trap ratio in the deck, and particularly adding Gamma and Driver into main as an option on your opponents turn to prevent an OTK. I could see this at 1 copy in the deck as a small consistency boost, but I don’t like to rely on it.  <b>Wightprincess: </b>The one monster from the archtype we’re not running: the effect of spending our normal summon to pitch Wightprince was nice at the time it was released, but its way too slow of a card to run now, and is functionally a weaker version of Baking. Being level 3 and 1600 attack, we can’t make a link-1 with this either. You could run this at 1, as the hand-trap effect to reduce the attack of all monsters is good in niche scenarios, but I don’t think that’s enough to warrant putting it into the main. Another reason to run this is that its another “Skull Servant” name that can be searched off Baking, so you get some utility from that. I don’t see room for it, but you can give consideration to adding 1.  <b>Mathematician: </b>This was a core card in the deck once upon a time, but we don’t run it now. You could certainly run 1 copy as a potential opener, but its completely dead to a hand trap at the cost of your normal summon, and the draw effect is unlikely to resolve too.  <b>Allure of Darkness: </b>I just recently cut this, but you could find room for 1 or 2 copies for the draw power. My issue is that after we do our opening combo, there aren’t a lot of good DARK targets left to discard in the deck. We run 15 DARKs, but a Uni-Zombie opening combo will use up 7 of them at least, so we’ll discarding our hand pretty often.  <b>Crush Card, Deck Devastator, Eradicator Epidemic Virus: </b>All the virus cards are live with this deck thanks to King. They’re an interesting tech option for certain matchups: the added “look at your opponents hand” is a huge plus and you can discard a lot of cards off this. However, running them in main is a crap shoot, and if you’re playing a deck that wants to be discarding cards like we do, you’re in big trouble.  <b><span>Extra Deck:</span></b>  1x <b>Baronne De Fleur </b>is a very pricey card, but would undoubtedly be incredibly strong in this deck, as he is in many others. This deck would love a level 10 Synchro and Baronne is the best of the bunch. The reason we love a level 10 is because we have Jack-o-Bolan at level 7, and we have six tuners (3 Ash and 3 Uni-Zombie) that are level 3 to make Baronne easily. If you have the cash, put this in, and take Scarlight out.  1x <b>Relinquished Anima</b> is a good alternative at link 1, its your preference in that category.  1x <b>Coral Dragon</b> is a level 6 synchro I used to run in this deck, its very good, I only cut it for space. Lady in Wight + either tuner in the deck make this easily, and its ability to discard 1 is always something we like in the deck to start combos. If there’s card in this extra deck you don’t like, this is something you can sub in with ease.  1x <b>Trishula </b>has been cut from this deck for space too, but it’s a nice option going second. If you alter this build to be more oriented to going second, consider adding it back in. At level 9 + 3 materials required, it’s a little steep, but its easily made with Uni-Zombie (after resolving both his effects), Lady + King as materials.  1x <b>Clear Wing Synchro Dragon </b>is a great generic level 7 synchro, we make it easily with Uni-Zombie + Lady, and the effect is very good. When I ran it, I almost never made it though, so I cut it for that reason.  <b>Rank 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 XYZs: </b>Uni-Zombie’s ability to boost its own level plus Lady’s level means the door is open to any Rank 3 or 4s: if you summon two level 1 monsters, Uni-Zombie could boost them both to level 2 for rank 2s as well, though this is a much less likely occurrence. There’s a huge selection of XYZ monsters to select from, so its worth your time having a look, particularly Rank 4s. I settled on Dweller and Nightingale as my 2 XYZs for getting to Zeus, but other XYZ monsters I’ve rotated in and out include:  1x <b>Break Sword</b>: A 2k beater that can pop a card from your opponents field if necessary, it’s a nice card for transitioning into Zeus with added utility from its effect. This could easily fit right in this deck.  1x <b>Leviair the Sea Dragon: </b>used to feature in this deck. Really good, but when I want to make an XYZ, I lean to a preference to Dweller, but Leviair is a great fit too.  1x <b>Castel the Skyblaster: </b>I love Castel so much, I put him back in every so often, he’s the 16th extra deck monster of this deck for me. 2k attack makes him a great Zeus buffer, and his effect to book-of-moon something so you can essentially attack for free makes him a great option.  1x <b>Downerd Magician: </b>No explanation needed really, one extra material for Zeus. I don’t see room for this but if you want to play more towards Zeus turbo, slide it in.  1x <b>Sylvan Princessprite: </b>A good option for a rank 1 – detaching a material is a good way to put 1 card in the graveyard, and the effect of excavating one benefits us a lot of the time, whether we add a spell or send a monster to the grave. I have run this, but I prefer Nightingale for making Zeus.  <b><span>Strengths and Weaknesses:</span></b>  <b>Strength – Big Number go brrr: </b>Even against meta decks, you’ll be surprised with how often 5,000 attack and cannot be destroyed by battle becomes a difficult obstacle, especially with Lady on the field, and a Baking in hand. Additionally, our King can push 10k off of full combo, so an OTK is in our reach as well, so we can upset meta decks if they brick an opening hand  <b>Strength – low summon count: </b>Unless we want to make the full Apollusa combo, our standard King + Lady summon combo will cost us 4 summons, so we dodge Nibiru quite comfortably.  <b>Weakness – consistency: </b>the Lady in Wight’s and Skull Servant’s are basically 4 garnets in this deck, and the Wightmares are only extenders, not openers, so we brick quite a lot. Running up to 15 hand traps may be a better alternative approach to this deck to help survive, because there aren’t more engine cards to include, except maybe a 3rd copy of Wightprince, which itself becomes a brick if we combo successfully.  <b>Weakness – Negates: </b>We can’t play through negates, that’s all there is to say. If we get Ashed or Impermed or Veilered on our opening move, we’re toast pretty often. If our opponent sets up Apollusa or anything that negates effects on their turn, we’re not getting off the ground.  <b>Weakness – Negates of our own: </b>Baronne would help with this, but we equally don’t set up enough negates of our own. I added Apollusa to help this, but it takes a big combo to make 4 negates with her. Consider adding more interruption to this deck to overcome this. Combo decks can really play through us with relative ease in my experience.  <b><span>Conclusion</span></b>  Skull Servants are a super fun deck, and I absolutely love them. They’re not tier 1 by any means, but I have fun with them at locals for the most part. I feel like a smarter player than me could find ways to make this more consistent: in particular, we’re really craving more ways to special summon or send from the deck, so our opening turn doesn’t get shut out by negates so easily. That said, if you can make a board, you’ll win plenty of games.  So that’s it! If you have any thoughts or suggestions for the deck, I’d love to hear, as I’m always looking for improvements to make. For starters I’ll need to experiment with Zombie World in here, but I’d love to hear more builds for a pure Skull Servant deck.  If you read this all the way to the end, thank you so much for reading!"

Deck is based on: cards which greatly devastate the opponent's deck, discard (even all cards in opponent hand) and disturbing the opponent at every turn HF ;)  Mysterune archetyp IMO will quickly join to Meta decks  (combined, of course, with other archetypes). As long as he doesn't get hurt too much through the next banlists. I've already tested him well and it definitely has a lot of potential. That's why I decided to do a short Mysterune decks series.  So far I have created one more foolproof Mysterune deck, <strong>which I will present on Friday, February 25</strong>. There is more negates in the next deck and more use of monsters from the Extra deck. If people like it I'll make more decks with this archetyp.  I saw that initially this archetype was very popular in Edo (right after the premiere), but perhaps the unsuccessful attempts to create something unfailing discouraged people. I will be happy if I can show you new ways to make meaningful use of the Mysterune archetype.  &nbsp;  Ok, now let's move on to the description of the deck (because not everything is as obvious as it seems). <ol>  	<li>The first words on each Mysterune card  ""Activate 1 of these effects; skip your next Battle Phase after this card resolves."" It's obvious we won't be attacking too much in this deck ( in next we will attack more and even we will possess OTK) . Therefore, it is very important to start Battle Phase, then is considered to be skip, this is very important if we want to attack later.</li>  	<li>""Spring of the Mysterune"" it is the most important card in this archetype, And I assure you that we will not run out of this card in my decks ( without Planet Pathfinder, Demise of the Land and without other unnecessary things). But that's not the most important thing here. It is most important to use this card with moderation. Not try to draw three cards over and over again, by throwing cards that will surely be useful in the next round (for example ""Mysterune of the Freezing Curse""). Usually, the optimal number of cards to be draw is two. Let's not be too greedy and remember that: in the next round we will also draw cards. <strong>One more important thing here</strong>. if we have in hand ""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" we should make sure that we draws cards faster, before your opponent start adds hiss cards, so as not to be stopped by your own effect.</li>  	<li>""Nibiru, the Primal Being"" this card will not be useful against some decks, but I decided to use it because the biggest threat to Mysterune are combo decks. At worst, we can use Nibiru with effect ""Muninn, Wings of the Mysterune"".</li>  	<li>""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" What can I say, this card has stopped many decks and sometimes completely paralyzed the opponent.  Especially useful when  opponent starts the game.  But in this case it has a  second special meaning. Because we can use him in a combo with one or two other cards to banish all cards in opponent hand. <strong>And in most cases it means almost instant win.</strong></li>  	<li>""Mysterune of Dispel"" remember that this card can only be used immediately after ""add"" effect resolves.</li>  	<li>This deck will require skillful juggling of the Field cards, and sometimes also use ""Mysterune of Destruction"". The deck takes a bit of practice but then gives a lot.</li> </ol> <strong>Tips and tricks:</strong>  Use ""Mysterune of the Golden Droplets"" in a combo with ""Mysterune of Dispel"" and, if possible with ""Deceit of the Mysterune"" (but not at any cost) to maximize damage to your opponent's deck.  To draw more cards with an effect ""Spring of the Mysterune"" use Mysterune Quick-Play Spell, special summon ""Muninn, Wings of the Mysterune"" and discard 1 Mysterune Quick-Play Spell in chain link 1, chain link 2 use ""Spring of the Mysterune"", then you will draw one additional card (attention, use common sense - same as above in the second point).  And probably the most anticipated - <strong>discard  all cards in opponent hand combo. </strong>  For this we can use basically 2 cards ""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" and ""Trickstar Reincarnation"". With this setting, we wait for the opponent to add a card from the deck by himself  (we are waiting for the effect resolves) and then we use ""Trickstar Reincarnation"" in chain link 1 and ""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" in chain link 2 - that's all ;)  <strong>Ok, but if  opponent will not add anything ?</strong> No problem here, we can use 3 card combo. For this we can use ""Droll &amp; Lock Bird""  and 2 copie ""Trickstar Reincarnation"" or ""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" and 1 ""Mysterune of the Golden Droplets"" and 1 ""Trickstar Reincarnation"".  We are using ""Mysterune of the Golden Droplets"" or first copie ""Trickstar Reincarnation"" (we are waiting for the effect resolves) and then we use ""Trickstar Reincarnation"" in chain link 1 and ""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" in chain link 2 - simple.  <strong>One important thing, combo will not work during Draw Phase, and you must remember about this HF.</strong>  &nbsp;  My other decks 2022:  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/drytron-perfection-2022/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/drytron-perfection-2022/</a>  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/abc-dragon-buster-deck-2022/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/abc-dragon-buster-deck-2022/</a>  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-dogmatika-control-deck-2022/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-dogmatika-control-deck-2022/</a>  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/cyber-dragon-2022-2/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/cyber-dragon-2022-2/</a>"

This deck basically works by summoning 2 level 8 Geminis with catalyst field to go into rank 8 plays (Mostly some mix of Draglubion, Hope Harbringer, and Numeron Dragon) and supporting those rank 8s with trap cards.  If you have to go second then you have a full side deck full of board breakers that can just replace all of your traps.  This deck is bad btw.  Edit 1: I replaces Called by The Grave with an extra copy of Lost Wind because it turns that this deck actually dodges most hand traps except probably Ghost Belle and PSY-framegear Gamma (which dodges Called by anyway) and Lost Wind seems to be a slightly more valuable set in my opinion.  Also if you want to play this in Master Duel, most of the gem cost is in the Extra Deck and there are a lot of useless cards in there.  The necessary Extra Deck cards are at least 1 Draglubion, 1 Hope Harbringer, 1 Numeron Dragon, and at least 2 more Dragon Number Monsters that aren't Draglubion (as long as both aren't Hope or Numeron)."

There are 3 main basic combos:  - pa/ma and solar: normal summon pa/ma, activate its effects to normal summon solar, activate solars effects to send rai-oh to the gy, link pa/ma and solar into summoner and pass. During your opponent turn, activate summoner effect to special summon rai-oh from gy.  - pa/ma and bro: normal summon pa/ma, activate its effect to normal summon Bro, activate Bro effect to search rai-oh, link pa/ma and bro into summoner and pass. During your opponent turn, activate summoner effect by discarding rai-oh from your hand and special summon it from gy (this Works because you Will have thunder monsters previously in your gy by the time you discard rai-oh).  - Photo sanctuary and rai-oh: activate photon sanctuary to special summon 2 tokens, link the tokens into summoner, normal summon rai-oh. You Will already have rai-oh onvthe field, but If you use its Second effect, you can revive him with summoner by discard a card, during your opponent turn.  &nbsp;  This deck is a midrange deck that can both go first and second, his going First can be strange against a deck that are ficcused on breaking boards and its going second can be akward against decks that have multiples negates like 4+ negates. Overral its a balanced deck. Also the ratio of the quantitiesbof monsters, spells and traps being like that was made on purpose, só If the opponent Lock onde type of card, ill have other 2 to Work with. And each type of card have a main function: monsters are the main engine, spells are utility (extenders, draw and recycle), and traps are defenses (going First and going second defenses). The extradeck se have summoner, super Poly targets and some toolbox options that do have any major conflict with the other cards in the deck."

Yes, I am playing the boring ass Adventurer Token engine just because I can and it does not necessarily conflict with the deck, but hey. These slots could be for anything like hand traps or floodgates, or control tools like the Solemn traps, really. As per usual, the side will be the side deck of my preference, but it realistically could be for anything of your liking.  <strong>Addressing the list:</strong>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Icejade Kosmochlor"">Icejade Kosmochlor</a></strong> - <span>This is your boss monster of the deck. Her, alongside your Field Spell Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle and Icejade Curse effectively locks your opponent out of using monster effects on the field, essentially providing you a one-sided Skill Drain. With the help of Icejade Cradle, this three card combo setup is not really as hard as you might think to pull off.</span>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Icejade Creation Kingfisher"">Icejade Creation Kingfisher</a></strong> - <span>One of your ways to interrupt your opponent, sadly it's not a Quick Effect, but it enables Icejade Kosmochlor to attack safely in Defense Position.</span>  <strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Bridge of Salvation"">Bridge of Salvation</a>, <a data-name=""Metalfoes Fusion"">Metalfoes Fusion</a>, and <a data-name=""Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast"">Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast</a></strong> - <span>As I have discussed in my previous Invoked Dogmatika Shaddoll Icejades list (here's the link for those that are interested: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-dogmatika-shaddoll-icejades/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-dogmatika-shaddoll-icejades/</a>), it's a one card combo that essentially lets you search your Field Spell instead of spending <a data-name=""Icejade Aegirine"">Icejade Aegirine</a>'s effect to do so, with <a data-name=""Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast"">Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast</a> as a bridge and also a discard fodder for your <a data-name=""Fateful Adventure"">Fateful Adventure</a>. <a data-name=""Metalfoes Fusion"">Metalfoes Fusion</a> is just a free draw card off of <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>.</span>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Icejade Erosion"">Icejade Erosion</a></strong> - <span>One of your primary forms of interruption. Is searchable, which is nice.</span>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Fossil Warrior Skull Knight"">Fossil Warrior Skull Knight</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Fossil Machine Skull Wagon"">Fossil Machine Skull Wagon</a></strong> - <span>Targeting Monster and Spell/Trap removal, respectively.</span>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a></strong> - <span>Could be used either as just <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a> fodder or a way to recycle Icejade monsters from your GY to your hand.</span>  In conclusion, I think Icejades now have a game plan albeit slow and control/stun focused, although I still believe that they should receive a dedicated summoning mechanic support (hopefully through Fusion summoning, for obvious reasons) in the future, but as of now, I wouldn't say that they're in a bad place, nor are they unplayable. If I were to describe their play style, it's just not for everybody. There are some few quirks to it, but it's not flashy. They can comfortably play under floodgates like <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a>, <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a>, <a data-name=""Rivalry of Warlords"">Rivalry of Warlords</a>, and to an extent even <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>. Overall, I think it's a deck that performs relative to what the pilot desires it to do, be it just as a complementary engine or as the center piece, or be it as a tool to help you Link climb due to the free bodies you can bring out to the board or to assist you in making a more control/stun focused game plan. I am excited to build this deck in real life and to see how well it fares against the other decks be it in or out of the ladder. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can."

Generally focuses around getting the knights out so you can summon a god of your choice. Slifer is the most obvious choice because of Thunderspeed Summon, but Ra can also work. Obelisk is a bit tricky if you don't already have him in your hand, but Arcana Triumph Joker is a decent search of Thunderspeed as well. I also recommend running the supporting God Card spells so you can get the most out of them.  Extra Deck has the Arcana knights to go with the Poker Knights, along with the usual Knightmare link support. I decided to run Utopic Draco future here as well just because I pulled one a while back and wanted to see if I could make him work here as an alternate win option. Using tornado dragons to go into Utopic Future, then from there into Utopic Draco should be fairly easy to do with this deck. Even with negates the amount of cycling that you can do with the Poker Knights now gives them a lot of potential options.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to improve this deck feel free to comment."

If you're able to, you usually want to go second, so you can lightning storm anything the opponent might play (assuming you draw it turn 1), and also because this deck can have a hard time dealing with turn one removal from the opponent. You will usually want to get either Live☆Twin Ki-sikil or Live☆Twin Lil-la out on the field turn one with your normal summon if you draw them or get them to your hand with Live☆Twin Sunny's Snitch, then activate their effect to special summon the other one to the field from your deck. From there, you want to get out both Evil★Twin Ki-sikil and Evil★Twin Lil-la by link summoning one, then activating the effect to bring back one link material, link summon the other one with the material you brought back and the other link monster, then use their effect to bring back the other Evil★Twin from the graveyard. Depending on what you need right then and there, you have a few options. If you have Evil★Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la, you can special summon it there for a 4400 Atk beatstick that can cut your opponents board to size, or you can summon unchained abomination or knightmare gryphon depending on your immediate needs.

Double Summon lets you use two Royal Magical Library during this FTK","The idea of this deck is simple. Get all Forbidden One pieces in your hand during your first turn.  Royal Magical Library is a great help in that, and this deck focuses more than most other Exodia decks on making sure we have it on the field on your first turn. Piri Reis Map does exactly that. It does get negated by Ash Blossom, but as long as the opponent doesn't have that, it's another way to get Royal Magical Library on your field as soon as possible, to help with drawing cards.  Another thing that isn't common in decks like this is the use of Double Summon. Why use one Royal Magical Library when you can use two? If you can get both out, it can bring out so much advantage. This deck can have hands you cannot play with sometimes, but if you can manage to get two Royal Magical Library on the field, it's nearly always possible to have multiple cards you can play.  Foolish Burial Goods is in the deck to send Cursed Bamboo Sword to the GY. Doing so allows you to activate Cursed Bamboo Sword's final effect, usually to add Golden Bamboo Sword to your hand.

I'm disappointed, but experimenting with other cards like <a data-name=""Spell Reproduction"">Spell Reproduction</a>...  I just built this deck, still playtesting. What sparked my interest in building the deck is the challenge in Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel to ""Take control of X opponent monsters"". I also pulled <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a>, so I thought it would be cool to summon him. I've experimented with <a data-name=""Darklord Nurse Reficule"">Darklord Nurse Reficule</a> deck, and wanted to build another Darklord deck, though I don't have much experience at all playing Fusion monsters.  So far, I have found that <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> + <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a> is a great starting hand. Target <a data-name=""Darklord Ukoback"">Darklord Ukoback</a> with Diviner, and then Dark Contact Ukoback to get <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> out fast.  <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a> and <a data-name=""Darklord Amdusc"">Darklord Amdusc</a> are great for playing Spell/Trap cards from the GY, like <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a> or <a data-name=""Greater Polymerization"">Greater Polymerization</a>. Sending the Spell/Trap cards you need in GY with <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Grounds"">Foolish Burial Grounds</a>. I'm thinking that <a data-name=""Banishment of the Darklords"">Banishment of the Darklords</a> should usually fetch <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a>, as Contact is what gets you Ixchel or Amdusc on the field to start targeting Spell/Traps in the GY. Can also send <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> to the GY with <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Grounds"">Foolish Burial Grounds</a>, to prep counters to hand traps or monster effects, depending on your matchup.  Don't forget to take advantage of that card draw with <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a>!  Can use the link Code monsters from the extra deck if you get bricked on your starting hand/draws. <a data-name=""Halqifribrax"">Halqifribrax</a> --&gt; <a data-name=""Phonon Pulse Dragon"">Phonon Pulse Dragon</a> --&gt; <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> might work, though I have not needed to go that route in playtesting just yet.  <a data-name=""Darklord Enchantment"">Darklord Enchantment</a> and <a data-name=""Grinning Grave Virus"">Grinning Grave Virus</a> are mostly for fun and can be replaced by better cards.  I'm only Gold Rank in Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel, so I'm still learning! This is my first attempt at building a deck from scratch. Any help/tips, strats I have missed, or card suggestions, would be much appreciated. &#x1f64f;"

Play this deck if you","Introduction To Pengu Frog-  Hello! My name is DapperCalf, and today Ill be explaining to you all why you should play the hottest new deck on the market: Pengu frog. Pengu frog is a board spam link/synchro centric water deck built around four seperate and powerful engines : The frog engine, the penguin engine, halqifibrax synchro summon chains, and the undine/crystron engine. Why invest your funds into pengu frog instead of playing, I dont know, a good deck? Good question! Let me answer that question with a better one; do you like toad puns? does the idea of playing a deck that contains penguin soldier excite you? Do the names TOADally awesome, roninTOADin, NOPEnguin, and MISTAR(mister and star its a whole thing idk google star boy) boy intrigue you? Is my third question the same as my first? Idk what else to put as an intro so Im just gonna go straight into the magic of explaining combos.  Genex undine opening: Summon genex undine(making sure to leave the space under your link zone open! dont make the same mistakes I do.) using his effect to send crystron rosenix to the grave, adding a genex controller to hand. banish rosenix from graveyard to create a token, use the token to make a link spider. use the link spider to special summon controller from your hand, use controller and link spider to make haliqfibrax, use haliqfibrax to special gluttonous reptolphion greethys, use greethys and undine to make penguin brave, using penguine brave to make penguin soldier. on your opponents next turn, you then have the option to use brave to flip soldier and then use haliqfibrax to make shooting star riser dragon, sending treeborn frog and using riser and soldier to make a borreload, attaching link spider for a negate. you can also just use formula syncron and brave, but then you lose a 4k~ atk beater and that makes me sad. if youve used any of the frog combos to get a frog in play, you can also opt to make trishula here(summoning treeborn frog with toadally awesome and using haliq for formula synchron and then using treeborn + brave + synchron)  Basic Frog Combo Opening: all this requires is swap frog + a water monster in your hand. discard a water monster and then send a ronin toadin from your deck to grave. then if you didnt send a frog from your graveyard, normal summon any water monster. use the water monster + swap frog to make a coral anemone. then use anemone to special summon swap frog from grave, sending another frog to use for ronintoadins effect. special ronin from grave with his effect, and make toadally awesome.  Advanced Frog Combo Opening: If you open with a ronin toadin or another frog in your hand, + a swap frog, you can do the above combo but end on mistar boy, coral anemone, AND toadally awesome. follow the above steps but when you special the swap frog from your grave, send another ronin toadin from deck to grave. then use swap frog and ronin to make a mistar boy, and then follow the rest of the steps as normal, banishing swap frog + your other frog to summon two ronins and make a toadally awesome using them.  Other cool things you can do: you can summon many water type links/appoulousa or access code hilariously easily using frogs + the genex undine combo. you can also do it withou an undine, using rosenix and swap frog as materials, linking them together for a halq, using halq to get a monster from deck, banishing swap frog to make ronin and then linking into an apo or ACT. all of that without even using your normal summon!  IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE: Ronin toadin makes amazing link material, due to it lacking even a soft once per turn on its effect, but cant be used as a synchro summon.  If you use anemone as a combo extender, it restricts you to summoning anything but water types for the rest of the turn.  Nopepenguin can be used as synchro material to summon brave, and then immediately resummoned using its effect when brave pulls out a penguin soldier from the deck and then linked away into something powerful  There are ALOT of very very strong synergies and combo lines and it would be crazy to sit here and list all of them, and I dont have the patience to do it, but this guide doesnt even scratch the surface of the crazy turns you can do. Ive completed the ""maxx C challenge"" twice with this deck.  the deck doesnt play maxx c because of how resilient it is and how much card advantage it can create, but it loses to it. very very badly. because of that, we run 3 ash blossoms and two called by the grave.  gameciel is the kaiju we play because of the typing, and being able to summon him in m2 to deal with tribrigade stuff after locking yourself out of summons with anemone has won me at least a few games.  Gluttonous reptolphins recursion effect actually comes into play suprisingly often and is a really powerful card in his own right.  This is my first time ever writing a guide for literally anything so I apologize for any typos that may exist. I couldnt find a guide or a decklist for anything remotely close to what ive come up with here, so I figured I might as well make one myself. if you have any questions, feel free to bother me on discord with them at DapperCalf#3203."

Many URs in this deck can be found in spacial packs. Others, except for Traptrix-specific cards, are staples that you'll have to craft anyway.  This deck can get you through lower ranks very easily. You might have to upgrade it around Gold rank tho, (upgrade path provided below and is shown in side deck)  The upgraded version of this deck, which I am using, is also doing not-so-bad in Platinum.  I mean, let's be real, this is by no mean anywhere close to being meta but it is extremely fun to play :) <h3>Upgrade Path</h3> I really only added Utopia Double Engine for end-game purpose. Without them it is very hard to clear out monster with high ATK/DEF. But they are somewhat inconsistent IMO, because I draw Double or Nothing all the time (kekw). So The first thing I would consider is to replace them with something else. (though if you don't mine playing potentially brick card then they are totally fine to play.

Currently having a blast with this list in Plat 1, maintaining a fairly chunky win streak with Blind Second Pure Ancient Warrior. You can definitely play a small Main Deck zoodiac package if you wish. Only 2 Lu Feng since I'm short on UR CP. It's a good idea to play Forbidden Droplet as well since it synergizes excellently with the Sagas.  Feel free to follow me and check out some of the replays in my profile!

The deck was used from Silver to high Gold with a good win rate against rouge decks.,"This deck is based off of a basic Swordsoul-Tenyi deck, but since there is no Swordsoul cards in Master Duel, there are no Swordsouls. Opening any 2 Tenyi monsters is enough to go for a <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a> or higher depending on the hand. Changing the synchros is not recommended except for <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a> and <a data-name=""Crimson Blader"">Crimson Blader</a> unless you are experienced. The deck wants to summon <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara"">Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara</a> and any synchro or effect link monster. If you have a <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> on the field, you need to either use it for a higher link or summon a level 8 synchro to make <a data-name=""Ruddy Rose Dragon"">Ruddy Rose Dragon</a> during the opponents turn. The deck is weak to <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> and <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, but it can play around Tri-Brigade with an optimal hand and foresight. <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a> is a pain to deal with for both you and the opponent, do not use it unless you are not planning on summoning a non-Tenyi from the extra deck for the rest of the turn. Do not use the graveyard effect of <a data-name=""Virtual World Oto-Hime - Toutou"">Virtual World Oto-Hime - Toutou</a> without planning ahead since it locks you out of summoning <a data-name=""Mare Mare"">Mare Mare</a> tokens and <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Adhara"">Tenyi Spirit - Adhara</a> for the rest of the turn. It is better to use its normal summon effect  at the beginning of the turn after summoning your Tenyi cards since there is no drawback. Definitely do not be afraid of normal summoning <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> if you need a level 3 tuner.  &nbsp;  Replay can be seen at: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/p4W-0yoLWdg"">https://youtu.be/p4W-0yoLWdg</a>"

Link down below:  ( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=AGG-NBOueCs&amp;feature=y"">https://youtube.com/watch?v=AGG-NBOueCs&amp;feature=y</a>)  Karakuri has had an in and out running since it's inception in the 5Ds era and beyond in all forms, and hasn't stopped being Yu-Gi-Oh's LolCow ever since then (even since the new support dropped for it). While it isn't a bad archetype nor the ability to conjure effects based on how changing their On field position does anything (except for their Level 9 Synchro Monster anyways); the fact that cards like ""Mecha Phantom Beast Enterblathnir"" and the usual Auroradon shenanigans *(that every Machine Syncho deck fetishes over)* exist right now seems to help them slightly in the uphill battle. However while they can get these things, doesn't mean that they truly seek the nourishment that other machine synchro decks that outperform them in every compacity can (including the appromentioned Mecha Phantom Beast and even the numerous variants of Synchrons). One apparent weakness Karakuri does come across very often is the usual effect negators like Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermanence; and the common trope of ""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring"". While I do attend to use Crossout Designator to do a variable amout of handling against these examples, Karakuri's still have too many disruptions, and not enough room in their arsenal for me to fit in all at once. On other other hand, what I do know is that Droll &amp; Lock Bird and Artifact Lancea are also key players this format (alongside Artifact Scythe).  Triple Tactics Talent is another piece for Karakuri to use as another backbone to allow them to force cards out of your opponents hands; force  monster confiscation from your opponents' side of the field; or allow you to draw 2 with no cost. Also included is the use of Solemn Strike if I want to make a pave way to focus on more of my side deck utilities, or for some reason the monster effects that are being dished against me become a little too ""personal"".  Honestly I still have hope Karakuri can get the right tools it needs to become the truly functional deck it needs to be. Sure it doesn't have to stray out of it's out of the already memeish mechanic of ""Cause and effect""; but the least we can see is more cards that allow effects that can benefits from the change of battle positions at any given moment; or maybe even a way to protect their non synchro Karakuri monsters from negations and field destruction. Also not to mention a Karakuri monster that could act as a vacuum that could return Karakuri effect monsters to the deck at the End Phase.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The deck is a bit bulky at 45 cards (its getting harder and harder to figure out what to cut) but despite that it is fairly consistant because of the amount of draw and search power the deck has access to. There are some choices in here that could be changed, the deck doesn't need halq nearly as much as vanilla striker because of souls and the endymion line making it much easier to get into selene so that and possibly the veiler could be cut for another extra deck slot. You could potentially cut the second selene as well, but it is very good in the deck and two feels a little more comfortable to me."

There are multiple ways to go for the OTK: <ol>  	<li>Via Chimeratech Rampage Dragon. Make it with Power Bond, destroy the backrow and send 2 LIGHT Machines to the GY to have 3 Attacks with 4200. Can go to 6300 with Cyber Dragon Sieger or 8400 with Limiter Removal</li>  	<li>Make Nova via Cyber Dragon and Galaxy Soldier, Galaxy Soldier send Cyber Dragon Herz or Machine Duplication on Herz, Core or Nächster. Summon back 1 Cyber Dragon with Nova. From there you can go for Sieger to boost Nova to 4200 and then Nova can boost itself to 6300 by banishing Sieger. Or you just banish the CyDra with Nova and double it with Limiter Removal for 8400. Then in MP2 summon Infinity with it so it doesn't die. Or if you have another level 5 on the field you can make a 2nd Nova and summon back another CyDra from the GY.</li>  	<li>If your opponent has left a 0 DEF Monster/Token on the field you can just try to get 3 CyDras via Machine Duplication or Normal Summon Core, add Emergency, add Nächster or CyDra, send CyDra with Nächster, special summon CyDra from Grave via Nächster; then use Power Bond</li>  	<li>Swarm the field with CyDras via Machine Duplication, Nächster or Nova and then run over your opponent with Limiter Removal</li>  	<li>Use Overload Fusion or Cyberload Fusion to go for Chimeratech Overdragon with a lot of materials and then run over all your opponents monsters (works best if your opponent has a lot of Face-up attack position monsters or 1 face-up attack position monster that can't be destroyed by battle. Works even better if you have Power Bond or Limiter Removal</li> </ol> Those are the 5 ways I mostly use for OTKs. I decimate my opponents board usually with either Chimeratech Megafleet or Chimeratech Fortress, if they have applicable targets; or with Forbidden Droplet. Infinity is mostly there to either protect your OTK or to have at least something when you have to go first.  You could also play Instant Fusion and Panzer Dragon for more level 5 material.  TL;DR: Use Machine Duplication/Cyber Dragon Nova/Cyber Dragon Nächster to put CyDras on the field, cut the opponents field down to size with Imperm/Droplet or the Chimeratechs, get high damage on board with Nova/Power Bond/Limiter Removal/Sieger, pick the right bossmonster for the job (Overdragon for a full field, End Dragon for a weak defender or Crooked Cook, Rampage and Twin Dragon for a semifull field with 1-2 Monsters, Nova and Sieger or a CyDra Swarm for a nearly empty field) if you have to go first/can't OTK use Infinity and or Cyber Dragon Enternal(if you get a machine-fusion in the grave) for some protection and pray"

My locals isn't hyper competitive and I'm not expecting the Brave Engine to be represented in any meaningful capacity so I'm choosing to side deck the Ogres and main deck the Nibirus.  DPE isn't as consistent as he was when FD was at 3, but he's still a good option for most match ups and I'm choosing not to run Verte due to how tight the Extra Deck is, and how devastating it is to have him get negated and have no follow up.  I'm also choosing to use the Charmer Climb instead of the Halq Climb due to it being the more resilient to interruption and out of fear that Halq is finally on the verge of being banned. Hiita also allows the teching of Underworld Goddess, who can win games that Accesscode might not be able to."

It follows the same characteristics of other anime Cyberse decks like Code Talker, Salamangreat and @Ignister of being able to make a decent <strong>game volume</strong> to establish an end board and have very satisfactory <strong>recursion in the grind game</strong>. Like Salamangreat, <strong>deck interactions are based on activating Traps</strong>, but so far Archetype has no way to add them to the hand on turn 1 (there is an OCG support that solves this problem but it will take a long time to get to the TCG and a lot even longer to get to the Master Duel). One thing I want to say about the Archetype card design is that in Anime the same character that played as Marincess was the one who played as <strong>Trickstar</strong> so several of the Archetype cards have burn effects, especially Traps have this feature that 90% of Traps are unusable in the deck because they are not actually interaction. The deck's gameplay is based just like @Ignister on making <strong>Towers unaffected by card effects</strong>. For this you need to have the <a data-name=""Battle Ocean"">Battle Ocean</a> field activated and have made your Archetype LINK-3 or LINK-4 in the Extra Monster Zone using <a data-name=""Crystal Heart"">Crystal Heart</a> as material. What is most impressive about archetype is the <strong>card economy</strong> while setting up your field, for example if you made 1 combo card among your 11 ways to achieve this you will in the end have your Boss Monster with high ATK thanks to the FIeld Spell plus a Follow Up in hand guaranteed. That said below I will show you all the possible combos to do with the deck and discuss archetype cards and generic Cyberse support and Water generic support possible to use in the deck.

its effect)  /////////////////////////////////////////Explanation of some Archetype cards and generic support. <strong>Marincess Cards</strong>  <a data-name=""Marincess Pascalus"">Marincess Pascalus</a> for being level 4 helps to make <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a>. And its effect on the GY of adding the Spells/Traps back to the hand is very good for recycling the <a data-name=""Marincess Wave"">Marincess Wave</a> which is the best interaction the deck has at its disposal. The problem with Pascalus is that it doesn't converse very well with the Extender Water you might be using on the deck and many builds even cut it out of the Main Deck. <a data-name=""Marincess Sea Horse"">Marincess Sea Horse</a> is the best card in the deck because it is Starter and Extender and makes 1 Card Combo LINK-4 <a data-name=""Bubble Reef"">Bubble Reef</a>. The other main deck cards only fit as a Starter or Extender. <a data-name=""Marincess Blue Tang"">Marincess Blue Tang</a> can be said to be the best card in the Archetype also because even though it is not an Extender it makes the deck spin and you access the Extenders to continue playing being the best consistency card in the deck.  <a data-name=""Marincess Mandarine"">Marincess Mandarine</a> is easily Recycle from Banished Zone with LINK-4 <a data-name=""Bubble Reef"">Bubble Reef</a> so you just need 1 copy. <a data-name=""Battle Ocean"">Battle Ocean</a> can force an opponent's negate if their main monster has an ATK that can be overcome by equipping GY's Marincess to your <a data-name=""Coral Anemone"">Coral Anemone</a> for example. A great interaction bait to get your play through. <a data-name=""Marincess Wave"">Marincess Wave</a> isn't hard once per turn, so it's definitely an improved <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and the best interaction the deck has available. In addition to being able to be activated directly from the hand, it <strong>protects all monsters you control</strong> with the best possible effect: ""Unaffected by Opponent's Card Effects"" for the rest of the turn.  LINK-1 <a data-name=""Sea Angel"">Sea Angel</a> is the best way to make <a data-name=""Marincess Mandarin"">Marincess Mandarin</a> come alive and being able to enter the field as extend by the Link arrow is excellent. LINK-2 <a data-name=""Crystal Heart"">Crystal Heart</a> in the Extra Monster Zone helps you to play around <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> a bit during your combos as it is Unnafected by MONSTER Effects, always remember this detail when using Crystal Heart as material from <a data-name=""Coral Anemone"">Coral Anemone</a> or Boss Monster <a data-name=""Bubble Reef"">Bubble Reef</a> he also gains protection. Monsters made in Extra Monster Zone using Crystal Heart as material are only ""Unaffected by Opponent's CARD Effects"" while you control Field Spell <a data-name=""Battle Ocean"">Battle Ocean</a> so if you take <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> for example you lose your Boss Monster along with the rest of your field. If your unsuspecting opponent destroys the <a data-name=""Coral Anemone"">Coral Anemone</a> in the Spell&amp;Trap Zone and you have the <a data-name=""Marincess Wave"">Marincess Wave</a> in the GY you can add it back to your hand to have one more interaction with the opponent this turn. LINK-4 <a data-name=""Wonder Heart"">Wonder Heart</a> eff in Battle Phase its not Hard Once Per Turn, so you can always protect from destruction in Battle Phase while you have an Equip Marincess Monster. Don't forget its excellent Floating effect of Special Summoning a Marincess LINK-3 or less. LINK-4 <a data-name=""Bubble Reef"">Bubble Reef</a> has a <strong>mandatory effect of gaining 600ATK for each banished monster</strong> until end of turn, so against decks like <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade"">Tri-Brigade</a> and <a data-name=""Invoked"">Invoked</a> that need to banish monsters to play it becomes a Boss Monster Unaffected by Card Effects with absurd ATK being practically impossible to take it out of the field in the Battle Phase ensuring it survives for the next turn. If you use a reduced Marincess engine in the Extra Deck like for example 2 <a data-name=""Blue Slug"">Blue Slug</a> and 1 <a data-name=""Sea Angel"">Sea Angel</a> you can do some of the different combos in the details than equipping the Field Spell back on the field because for example if you make the End Board of <a data-name=""Marbled Rock"">Marbled Rock</a> you have <strong>two Deck Resource Recovery</strong>, 1 with <a data-name=""Marbled Rock"">Marbled Rock</a> itself and another with <a data-name=""Coral Anemone"">Coral Anemone</a> so you can choose to equip only two Link monsters in Marbled Rock and leave one in the gy like <a data-name=""Sea Angel"">Sea Angel</a> for example and return it to the Extra Deck with the Anemone eff and leave it to add a Marincess to Hand with the Marbled Rock to have an excellent grind game with the <strong>correct Resource Management</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Generic Cyberse Support</strong>  <a data-name=""Armored Bitron"">Armored Bitron</a> is a generic support of Cyberse that works in this deck like a <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a>, and locks you into Cyberse for the rest of the turn. With him you always bring the <a data-name=""Sea Horse"">Sea Horse</a> from the Deck and with that you make 1 Card Combo normally. Plus it has an interesting GY effect on the deck that you shouldn't forget about. <a data-name=""Shootingcode Talker"">Shootingcode Talker</a> is a great Generic Cyberse Monster option for Marincess' deck because it gives a 2 draw potential which is all the deck wants because keeping cards advantage over the opponent makes the gamestate controlled by the amount of tech cards that fits in the deck and the ability to recycle resources every turn making it one of the best grind games among Cyberse decks.  Remember that <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> locks you into Special Summoning Cyberse Monsters. If you use <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> eff Reborn <a data-name=""Crytal Heart"">Crytal Heart</a> you can make <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>(in the Extra Monster Zone) Unaffected by Opponent Card Effects.  <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> and <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> is the best generic extra deck package out there for Cyberse decks. It's very hard to see a Cyberse deck that doesn't use them. In this deck you should be careful with the <strong>restrictions of some engine cards</strong> that don't allow you to use these two monsters but overall it's an excellent addition to the deck, but you don't necessarily need them to play Marincess. Another generic support of Cyberse that can be used in this deck is <a data-name=""Tri-gate Wyzard"">Tri-gate Wyzard</a> instead of Transcode Talker and its main effect for this deck is not the negation eff, but the effect of inflicting <strong>Double Battle Damage and the effect of banishing a card</strong> that the opponent controls .  In general, the Cyberse Archetypes Extra Deck is very restricted and has little room to make changes, this Extra Deck from the decklist below can be assembled a little differently from the one presented, leaving at your discretion the changes you want to make such as placing the Transcode Talker and Accesscode Talker.  /////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Budget Options</strong> Paleozoic Traps: <a data-name=""Dinomischus"">Dinomischus</a>, <a data-name=""Canadia"">Canadia</a>, <a data-name=""Olenoides"">Olenoides</a>, <a data-name=""Marrella"">Marrella</a> to send the Marincess Wave to the GY.  <a data-name=""Dinomischus"">Dinomischus</a> is one of the best trap cards in the game = can handle with monsters and floodgates and also have sinergy with Wave to return to field from GY as an extender.  If you use a high amount of Paleozoic Traps it is also very good to use <a data-name=""Paleozoic Opabinia"">Paleozoic Opabinia</a>. The deck doesn't have a lot of removal cards so traps like <a data-name=""Compulsory Evacuation"">Compulsory Evacuation</a> are very good options to overcome this deficiency. Other interesting cards: <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> or <a data-name=""Rivalry of Warlords"">Rivalry of Warlords</a>, <a data-name=""Mistar Boy"">Mistar Boy</a>, <a data-name=""Aria the &lt;a data-name=&quot;Water Charmer&quot;&gt;Water Charmer&lt;/a&gt;"">Aria the </a><a data-name=""Water Charmer"">Water Charmer</a> which is interesting because it can use monsters that are not Water or Cyberse as material, for example <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>.  ///////////////////////////////////////  <strong>Disregard the Side Deck, they are just card options that can be used in the deck</strong> or that I'm not specifically using in my Marincess extra deck in Master Duel but that are very common and I can even say what standards to be used in Marincess decklists . Just understand that this profile deck is more to explain theory than the standard way to play Marincess, so various changes can be made to your liking.  <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> and <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> is as well as the <a data-name=""Trancode Talker"">Trancode Talker</a> and <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> package indispensable for Water and Cyberse monster decks and needs no introduction. But if I'm talking so well about the Code Talker package and the Bahamut Shark package then why don't I use it in the deck? Simply because this is the purest possible version of Marincess, but for sure most decklists use at least half of the generic extra deck cards mentioned above.  Frog Engine: <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> + <a data-name=""Ronintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a> + <a data-name=""Dupe Frog"">Dupe Frog</a> - helps play around <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>. And there's a good combo involving <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> and <a data-name=""Blue Tang"">Blue Tang</a>. <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> is not hard once per turn so whenever you give him Reborn he activates the effect as in the case of using the <a data-name=""Coral Anemone"">Coral Anemone</a> eff. Frog's engine was used a lot in the launch of the deck where few useful cards existed and you needed something that generated pressure on the field. Over time, excellent supports came along to make the deck what it is today, and there are even more supports that were released in the OCG last year to improve Marincess' Archetype a bit more. That said, what happened was that with the arrival of new supports, the use of the Frog Engine became unnecessary and playing in the purest possible version is what gives Marincess more results. <a data-name=""Silent Sea Nettle"">Silent Sea Nettle</a> is the best Extender Water option to use on deck. <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a> is another good tech card option in the deck. <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> to send specially the effs of <a data-name=""Pascalus"">Pascalus</a> and <a data-name=""Sea Angel"">Sea Angel</a> in the GY. <a data-name=""One For One"">One For One</a> makes <a data-name=""Mandarin"">Mandarin</a> 1 Combo card, so it's a good card to try out in your deck.  Like any deck that makes use of equipment during its playthroughs, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> becomes a very good card to use in that deck because its activation cost is almost free when sending Equip Monsters to the GY.  ///////////////////////////////////////  <strong>Final deck details:</strong>  Floodgate monsters that stop Marincess' turn completely: <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a> and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>. Of course <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> stop every archetype in the game but several decks manage to have at least 1 out for the card within the engine itself and Marincess doesn't have that out at all. <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a> as well as any <a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos</a>-type effects are enough for you not to be able to play Marincess either. That's why it's quite common to use anti-Combo Decks cards in Marincess like <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> to deal with these cards. Blind Second cards like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> and <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> hurt you a lot by losing a lot of engine cards in the process despite keeping the Boss Monster and having Follow Ups in hand. That's why I don't think it's wrong to use 3 <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> from Main Deck. The deck lacks reliance against Hand Traps especially against <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> and <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> and also suffers a lot if the Normal Summon is disrupted or taken out of the field or flipped face-down.  Interaction between <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> + <a data-name=""Marincess Wave"">Marincess Wave</a> + <a data-name=""Marbled Rock"">Marbled Rock</a>: after activating Wave all your monsters become unaffected by card effects so the only way for your opponent to take Bahamut Shark out of the field is through the Battle Phase but <strong>Marbled Rock protects him from harm</strong> destroyed by battle and that way you guarantee you can activate Bahamut Shark on your next turn and bring another <a data-name=""Toadally Awsome"">Toadally Awsome</a> onto the field.  <a data-name=""Great Bubble Reef"">Great Bubble Reef</a> is an excellent card, don't underestimate the power of having a version of <a data-name=""Code Talker Heatsoul"">Code Talker Heatsoul</a> in the deck's own engine. Decks that don't draw bother me because seeing new cards is always the difference between having chances in the game or not. That's why cards like <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> and <a data-name=""Sekka's Light"">Sekka's Light</a> are absurd to the point of being limited.  I think the Tecnoplay you should be looking to improve the most when playing Marincess is <a data-name=""game 3 of the deck on how to play as efficiently as possible"">game 3 of the deck on how to play as efficiently as possible</a> because this is a Salamangreat-style Cyberse deck that <strong>beats the opponent in fatigue with you remaking your entire field with low resources every turn</strong> keeping pressure on the opponent throughout the duel.  &nbsp;"

Ultimate Master: World Championship Tournament 2006, fiz um pequeno ajuste, sou fã de monstros aquáticos, a principal estratégia que eu faço é colocar a carta 'A Legendary Ocean' como carta para alterar o campo de batalha para dar vantagem aos meus monstros tanto no ataque como na defesa, e uso o 'Tornado Wall' para não levar dano nos meus pontos de vida, como o ' A Legendary Ocean' reduz 1 nivel dos monstros aquáticos posso colocar meu 'Giga Gagagigo' sem precisar sacrificar monstros, esse deck tem monstros com ótima defesa, outra estratégia também, é destruir cartas mágicas e armadilhas do meu adversário assim anulando suas estratégias também, esse deck é simples mas tenho um grande carinho por ele.

Less of a build guide but more of a deck profile addressing staple choices and my thought processes whe,"<span>Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, and I'm back with my favorite deck, fresh from just reaching P1 because I've sped run the ladder today because I've got nothing else better to do. As the title suggests, presenting Invoked Dogmatika Shaddolls, again. As per usual, the side deck are cards that I have either ""sided out"" (aka interchangeable cards per game solely depending on the feel of my draws and nothing else because there's no way to accurately predict which deck you're gonna be up against in a BO1 format) throughout my run in the ladder and I'll explain my ""siding patterns"" (kinda) because MD format sucks for not having a BO3 but I digress.</span>  <strong><span>The list:</span></strong>  <span>So first of all, I think I want to go with addressing the ""side deck"" alongside the main.</span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a></strong> - <span>This slot shares with <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, one being a great board wipe and the other, a great hand trap. I haven't really encountered any trap heavy decks as of late, or even Eldlich in particular, so I decided to use <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> for the mean time. Seems like everyone got bored of playing that deck finally, thank God.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong> - <span>These cards' slots share with <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>, a more defensive tool in contrast to the more aggressive combination of the two. The thing with Invoked Dogmatika Shaddolls is that, you can play the deck however you want, be it going 1st or going 2nd, but you'd have to adjust both your side and extra deck for it. For going 1st builds, I'd personally pick <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> but <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> is also a good follow up card. It's just that I've noticed that the higher I climb the ladder, the more ubiquitous back row removal cards become. People aren't even using their <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> against monsters even if they're in face-up Attack Position, also I've had a couple of mirrors with this deck and Crossout can mess up your opponent on such scenarios.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a></strong> - <span>This card, I'm a bit scared to use it honestly, because of mainly the previously stated presence of heavy back row removal and it's best going first, which is unlikely to be guaranteed for you because everyone's mostly gonna go first if they had the chance to choose, but it's strong nonetheless especially against mono-type strategies that like to swarm, like Phantom Knights, Lyrilusc Tri-Brigade, or Drytrons even.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a>, <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a></strong> - <span>Yes, I know I said I'm never gonna be using <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> because of how much I hate this card but I pulled one, okay? Might as well craft two more... but anyway. These three are a bit weird. Often there are times where <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> just feels like a brick, because it's an EARTH Attributed monster, same thing goes to Ash and Droll. Ash is generally useful, but that also means it's targeted by pretty much everyone, no doubt. Droll sometimes takes people by surprise, but is pretty useless against decks that play in the graveyard anyway. 2/2/2 ratio of each seems fine, but I'd probably only do that when I'm going first and I have Crossout.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a></strong> - <span>This slot is the most contentious one of all because this slot is a flex spot for your generic <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> target. I've had more trouble deciding which card to place here than interchanging hand traps and staples in the main. This also used to be <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a>, but when I changed it, there aren't any Prank-Kids or Thunder Dragon players anywhere to be seen. <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a> also took this slot before but I've seen less Lyrilusc Tri-Brigades after I mained it. Even <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a> used to be here, but then I can't make use of her outside Adamancipator, Traptrix, or EARTH Machines match ups. So this one's really up to you. Other options include <a data-name=""World Chalice Guardragon Almarduke"">World Chalice Guardragon Almarduke</a>, <a data-name=""Diplexer Chimera"">Diplexer Chimera</a>, and <a data-name=""Earth Golem @Ignister"">Earth Golem @Ignister</a>, all of which are great more specifically against Code Talkers.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a></strong> - <span>Absolutely mandatory. I'd rather have a 16th Extra Deck slot than give up this one, especially because this is the Extra Deck killer variant which plays <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>. I also am not playing the <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> + <a data-name=""Secure Gardna"">Secure Gardna</a> package and <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a> because it takes way too much space for an Extra Deck that is already tight enough and costs 1 extra Special Summon as opposed to just using <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a>, which can also be made by Normal Summoning either <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> or any of your Level 4 or lower DARK Attributed Shaddoll monsters since they're all Spellcasters.</span></span>  <span>• <span>I actually am debating on cutting down <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> for <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> (as soon as I'm able to craft or pull a copy) or even a second copy of <a data-name=""Resh Shaddoll Incarnation"">Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</a> for insurance. I also am not playing <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> because Fusion decks already costs a lot of resources to make plays, although it's playable, so long as you know what to do about it properly. I also have cut down <a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a> and <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a>, because those two are much better on just Invoked Shaddolls list, where you could play more Shaddoll cards.</span></span>  <span>What I have also noticed when climbing the ladder that might be helpful for you, if you're still reading this, is that people tend to be more complacent and slack off when the season's about to end even back then in S1 but especially now that Platinum 1 players can't get demoted anymore, so if you want to catch the ""easier"" wins, try grinding a week or two before the season ends like I did, because people will always instantly try hard with their meta decks either as soon as the new season starts or during the last week of the season where everyone suddenly tries to catch up for the rankings. This pattern has always been present throughout all games that have seasonal rankings, so yeah. Just something for you to keep in mind to consider. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can, especially regarding the current text font because I chose this one in particular because it's not as straining to the eyes, unlike the others so, yeah.</span>"

If you are new to the Dragonmaid deck here are some tips for each card: <ul>  	<li>All low level Dragonmaid monsters summon at the start of the Battle Phase their ""counterparts"" from the hand or graveyard, returning that card to the hand (level 3 monsters summon level 8 monsters, level 2 monsters summon level 7 monsters; Chamber Dragonmaid can summon any high level Dragonmaid, including fusion monsters). You can use their effects during your opponent's turn if that turn you returned them to your hand to summon high-level Dragonmaid, summoning them from your hand by the effect of the previously summoned cards.</li> </ul> <strong>Kitchen Dragonmaid: </strong>When summoned, you can add the card you need to your hand and then discard a high level Dragonmaid monster which you can summon during the Battle Phase and return to your hand at the end of the same phase to pay the cost again next turn.  <strong>Parlor Dragonmaid: </strong>When summoned, you can either: send a - high level Dragonmaid monster which you can summon during the Battle Phase and return to your hand at the end of the same phase. - low level Dragonmaid monster and then summon it by the effect of Nurse Dragonmaid / Dragonmaid Hospitality.  <strong>Nurse Dragonmaid: </strong>When summoned, revive a low level Dragonmaid monster from the graveyard, you can activate the effect of the revived monster.  <strong>Laundry Dragonmaid: </strong>When summoned, send the top three cards of your deck to the graveyard, it's not very advisable if you don't consider that you have good luck, you may end up sending key cards to the graveyard, if you send Dragonmaid cards you can recover them to your hand with the help of the Dragonmaid Welcome effect.  <strong>Chamber Dragonmaid: </strong>When summoned, add a Spell/Trap Dragonmaid to your hand from the deck. <ul>  	<li>All high level Dragonmaid monsters have activatable effects from the hand, which you can use without fear since you can recover the card by summoning it with the effects of the low level monsters, and then at the end of the Battle Phase, you can return it to hand or perform an XYZ summon during your Main Phase 2.</li> </ul> <strong>Dragonmaid Lorpar: </strong>Negate the effect of a monster in the opponent's field this turn, it is not a quick effect so you must use it during your Main Phase.  <strong>Dragonmaid Tinkhec: </strong>Increases by 2000 the attack of a Dragonmaid monster, it's a quick effect so you can use it if necessary during the Battle Phase; but you can use it during your Main Phase on a card that you are not going to return to the hand (a fusion Dragonmaid monster) and then summon it from the graveyard for the effect of a low level Dragonmaid monster.  <strong>Dragonmaid Ernus: </strong>Special summon a Dragonmaid monster of level 4 or lower from the graveyard which will activate its effect and then summon this card at the beginning of the Battle Phase, as it's a quick effect you can use it during your opponent's turn.  <strong>Dragonmaid Nudyarl: </strong>returns a monster in any graveyard to the deck, it can cause disruption in the opponent's strategy by returning key cards that he/she can use or recover, it's not a quick effect sadly. <ul>  	<li>Fusion Monsters</li> </ul> <strong>House Dragonmaid: </strong>Its first effect allows you to summon during any Standby Phase from your hand or Graveyard a Dragonmaid monster one level lower/higher than another you control, you must target another Dragonmaid monster to activate this effect, so if you only control this card you won't be able to use it; its second effect destroys an opponent's monster every time a dragon returns to the hand, making this a key card to clear the opponent's field.  <strong>Dragonmaid Sheou: </strong>Its first effect is an upgraded version of House Dragonmaid's effect, it summons a Level 9 or lower Dragonmaid monster from the hand or Graveyard without any requirements; Its second effect negates any activated opponent's effects, destroys the activated card, then returns this card to the Extra Deck and Summons House Dragonmaid from the Extra Deck. <ul>  	<li>Spell Cards</li> </ul> <strong>Dragonmaid Welcome: </strong>Slightly increases the atk of your monsters depending on the amount of Dragonmaid you control, the important thing is its second effect, which allows you to recover Dragonmaid cards from the graveyard but you must control two Dragonmaid monsters to use this effect.  <strong>Dragonmaid Changeover: </strong>To summon by fusion, you can retrieve it from the graveyard by returning a Dragonmaid monster you control to your hand.  <strong>Dragonmaid Hospitality: </strong>Usually used to summon a low level monster and send its high level counterpart to the graveyard, so you can summon it in the Battle Phase.  <strong>Dragonmaid Send-Off:  </strong>To activate effects in the opponent's turn, it can also save you a turn if you do not have a good hand, since the summoned card is not destroyed by battle or effects until the end of the next turn. <ul>  	<li>Trap Cards</li> </ul> <strong>Dragonmaid Downtime: </strong>Return an opponent's backrow card at the end of his turn so that he/she cannot activate it on your turn, use it on your turn to add any Dragonmaid card you may need.  <strong>Dragonmaid Tidying: </strong>Disrupt your opponent's field/graveyard, then you can use its effect from the graveyard to summon a low level monster, trigger its effect, summon a high level monster at the beginning of the Battle Phase and summon it again from the hand if necessary, that way you don't have to return the summoned monster to the hand; you can only use one effect per turn. <ul>  	<li>Other Cards</li> </ul> <strong>Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver:</strong> Use it as a Continuous Spell Card to Fusion Summon once per turn. <p class=""LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md""><strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring: </strong>Hand trap.</p> <strong>Maxx ""C"": </strong>Free draw every time the opponent special summons.  <strong>Return of the Dragon Lords:</strong> Revive a level 7 or 8 dragon from the graveyard, protect a dragon monster from destruction by banishing it.  <strong>Guardragon Cataclysm: </strong>Destruction of the opponent's field.  <strong>Number 29: Mannequin Cat: </strong>Special Summon a monster from your hand, Graveyard, or Deck with the same Type or Attribute as one Special Summoned by your opponent, it's a great XYZ card for multi-Attribute Decks. <p class=""LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md""><strong>Number 76: Harmonizer Gradielle:</strong> Gains the attributes of all monsters it has as XYZ material and is not destroyed by battle or by effect of a monster with the same attribute as this card, once per turn you can select an opponent's monster in the Graveyard and set it to this card as a XYZ material, which makes it great for opponent's graveyard disruption.</p> <p class=""LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md""><strong>Número 97 Draglubión: </strong>The reason why the deck has monsters XYZ Dragon Numbers.</p> <p class=""LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md""><strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder &amp;

Where attacking your opponent to reduce their life points to 0 is made out of the question by almost all of the cards in the new and upcoming archetype, the interesting field spell that allows you to draw 3 multiple times in one turn (and not just on your turn) still seems more than alluring. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>The deck focuses around banishing the top card(s) of your opponent's deck by activating a series of quick-play spell cards with considerably powerful effects including searching any <em>Mysterune</em> card; negating an opponent's monster's effects; discarding a random card from the opponent's hand when they add a card from their deck to their hand, and destroying a monster or spell/trap. Additionally, these effects all include an effect to banish a number of cards (ranging from 1-4) from the top of the opponent's deck. Each of these quick-play spell cards also has the option to instead summon a <em>Mysterune</em> monster from the extra deck to the extra monster zone. More on this later.</span>  <span>To facilitate the continued activation of these quick-play spell cards, their field spell, <em><a data-name=""Spring of the Mysterune"">Spring of the Mysterune</a></em>, allows you to activate <em>Mysterune</em> quick-play spell cards <strong>from your hand during your opponent's turn</strong>. Furthermore, the field spell has a soft once-per-turn effect if you activate a <em>Mysterune</em> quick-play spell card that targets 3 <em>Mysterune</em> quick-play spell cards, puts them on the bottom of the deck, then <strong>lets you draw 3 cards</strong>. This is most useful during your opponent's turn as you can draw more quick-play spell cards to use in that same turn and disrupt your opponent even further. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>As for the monsters you can summon, <i><a data-name=""Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune"">Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune</a></i> allows you to add any non-quick-play <em>Mysterune</em> spell card from your GY to your hand, which can <strong>enable multiple activations of the draw effect</strong> of <em><a data-name=""Spring of the Mysterune"">Spring of the Mysterune</a></em> in one turn. <a data-name=""&lt;em&gt;Muninn, Wings of the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mysterune&lt;/em&gt;""><em>Muninn, Wings of the</em> <em>Mysterune</em></a>, the other monster you can summon, allows you to search any <em>Mysterune</em> continuous spell card from your deck to your hand by discarding one card – however, there is only one card that meets these conditions. <em><a data-name=""Deceit of the Mysterune"">Deceit of the Mysterune</a></em>, the card in question, will <strong>banish a card from the top of an opponent's deck each time any quick-play spell card is activated</strong>, even if it doesn't resolve (but not if the activation is negated). </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Other engines to facilitate the strategy are the <em><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></em> engine, which can provide turn-after-turn advantage off of used spell cards such as <em><a data-name=""Spring of the Mysterune"">Spring of the Mysterune</a></em> after using its draw effect or duplicate copies of quick-play spell cards to send back to the deck for more draws. <a data-name=""&lt;em&gt;Magicians' Souls&lt;/em&gt;""><em>Magicians' Souls</em></a> can also be used to summon <em><a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></em> for battle protection or <em><a data-name=""Relinquished Anima"">Relinquished Anima</a></em> for monster removal (including your own <em><a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></em> to clear the extra monster zone for a <em>Mysterune</em> monster) via equipping as a spell that can then be used with another copy of <em><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></em> to draw more cards. Lastly, since both <em><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></em> and <em><a data-name=""Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune"">Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune</a></em> are DARK monsters, they can be used to summon <em><a data-name=""Beat Cop from the Underworld"">Beat Cop from the Underworld</a></em>, which can then tribute itself to <strong>clear the extra monster zone</strong> for another <em>Mysterune</em> monster – with the <strong>added bonus of protecting another card on the field</strong>. </span>  <span>To utilise your normal summon, <em><a data-name=""Royal Magical Library"">Royal Magical Library</a></em> and <em><a data-name=""Planet Pathfinder"">Planet Pathfinder</a></em> also bolster the strategy by <strong>providing card advantage and consistency respectively</strong> all while enabling the summon of rank 4 XYZ monsters such as <em><a data-name=""Daigusto Emeral"">Daigusto Emeral</a></em> with <em><a data-name=""Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune"">Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune</a></em> to clear the extra monster zone for more summons, recycle used <em>Mysterune</em> monsters, and provide card advantage. <em><a data-name=""Soul Absorption"">Soul Absorption</a></em> might seem like a gimmicky, 'win more' card, however, in this strategy you rely on drawing cards you can use immediately or during your opponent's turn, which doesn't always happen. If you have a single copy of <em><a data-name=""Soul Absorption"">Soul Absorption</a></em> on your side of the field, you can <strong>gain over 10,000 LP in a single turn</strong>, ensuring that if you run out of 'juice' you know that you are <strong>very unlikely to run out of LP for at least a couple of turns</strong>. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Other tech options include:</span> <ul>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Instant fusion"">Instant fusion</a></strong> – This allows you to summon any of your <em>Mysteune</em> monsters to a normal monster zone virtually for free. If you summon <em><a data-name=""Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune"">Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune</a></em>, the monster will not be destroyed in the end phase due to its on-field effect.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Upstart&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Goblin&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Upstart</strong> <strong>Goblin</strong></a><strong> </strong>– In this deck, consistency is everything. Besides, you don't care about your opponent's LP.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""One Day of Peace"">One Day of Peace</a> </strong>– This kind of ticks 3 boxes in one go: You have more consistency, you are guaranteed another turn (everything in this deck), and your opponent is one card closer to decking out. If you're lucky, you can use this card to trigger <em><a data-name=""Mysterune of Dispel"">Mysterune of Dispel</a></em> and discard a random card from your opponent's hand.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a> </strong>– As mentioned before, sometimes you run out of 'juice' and don't have any more cards you could play. This card can come in handy when you're in a tight spot and of course, it furthers your journey to decking out your opponent.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>This strategy does suffer from consistency issues of course. <strong>Even if you are playing 10 copies</strong> of <em><a data-name=""Spring of the Mysterune"">Spring of the Mysterune</a></em> (3x the field spell, 3x <em><a data-name=""Point of the Mysterune"">Point of the Mysterune</a></em>, 3x <em><a data-name=""Planet Pathfinder"">Planet Pathfinder</a></em>, and 1x <em><a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a></em>), you will not always have access to it, in which case you very quickly run out of things you can do and become a sitting duck. The fact that all of the quick-play spell cards in the strategy are hard once-per-turn effects regardless of which effect you choose (their monster summoning effect or their deck banishing effect) means that drawing multiple copies of some cards (or of cards you have already used that turn) <strong>could result in dead cards</strong>, giving your opponent the opportunity to shut down your strategy. </span>  <span>Once you get your engine going, however, not much can really stop you. You can go a few turns and then run out of things to do, but when you pass to your opponent, <strong>they can have two-thirds of their deck banished</strong> that often include crucial cards for their strategy, preventing them from breaking your 'board'. Sometimes I forget to check how many cards are left in my opponent's deck and I realise that I've <strong>accidentally won while trying to set up for the next turn</strong>. You will consistently draw into whatever other tech cards &amp; engines you add to this strategy since the <em>Mysterune</em> quick-play spells cards are always sent to the bottom of the deck; I feel that there are a few ways to take advantage of this – I even tried splashing the <em>Invoked</em> engine in with this deck but I am not good at that strategy so I couldn't make it work.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>I hope that Konami releases more support for this new archetype in the future as it has huge potential – maybe a <em>Mysterune</em> quick-play spell version of <em><a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a></em>. I also hope that you enjoy testing out this deck and experimenting with different styles of play. </span>  &nbsp;  This post was made on 25/02/2022, some TCG card names may be outdated."

Going second just break the board with droplets and power spells, and then try to go for game.  The duels shouldn't go past turn 3 but the deck can grind but against a meta deck you will lose if you do not play optimally.  Droll in the main i think is a good card to throw your opponent off guard, no one plays around droll game 1 , also if you open droll , try to prioritize summoning dark law. Most decks lose to dark law + droll, and if you can set up a plasma or DPE as well, it is a hard time for the opponent. Also it can be swapped with ashe if you don't want to main droll, and move droll to the side.  I cut down on playing the extra destiny heros bc FD is at 2 and there is no point to open more bricks, since this deck already plays so many.

Master duel banlist. Huge rant. Much wow.  41-9 (82,"I know the list is nothing revolutionnary, but I feel like the couple changes I made actually have a pretty great impact. While not a pure personal tech as well, the three cards zombie world ""engine"", even though only three cards, really changes the whole dynamic of the deck. They may be only three cards, but everything in the deck tutors for them, making them omnipresent and actually play in every game - which kinda matters a lot in a single game format.  I'dd add in a gameplay section but let's face it, this is still eldlich, deck is pretty self explanatory and easy to pilot. Go hard on zombie world though.  <strong>Summary</strong>  -Record / going first vs going second -Why the zombie world focus ? <span>(the crazy impact just three cards have)</span> -Techs and choices <span>(introduction/follow-up to the zombie world focus ft rivalry of warlords + <span><span>small rant on</span> <span><strong>building for a single game format</strong></span></span></span> <span> gozen match - summon limit - foolish burial goods - necroface)</span> -Footnotes / short thoughts on extravagance vs prosperity  <strong>Record</strong>  17-3 record from gold 5 to platinum (85% winrate) 24-6 from platinum 5 to platinum 1 (80% winrate) Overall season 2 record end tally : 41-9 (82% winrate) 1st vs 2nd split : 19-2 going first (90.4% winrate) 22-7 going second (75.8% winrate)  I would like to point out that the deck, while aimed at going first and much stronger in that position, deals very well with going second.  The list is a pretty conventionnal eldlich list, however with still a couple techs and personal choices which have actually won me some games and I don't think have cost me any (granted, of course, my sample size is pretty small) and centered around zombie world.  <strong>Why the zombie world focus ?</strong> - the crazy impact just three cards have  <span>Useless story you really don't need to read</span>  I didn't start with a zombie world version of the deck, instead starting with a very usual pure stun list and learning the ins and outs of the archetype (I am a returning player, quit a bit before links arrived, about six years ago and came back with master duel). While I mostly enjoyed the playstyle of the deck, I felt that it was missing something, a spark, a power play on top of the pure floodgate based stun (which is also a bit passive to my taste - do not read bad, just, I usually enjoy playing a bit more actively) and some protection.  As well as some combo feeling I usually enjoy having in my decks on a more personal level.  What really caught my eye with the eldlich cards isn't the great consistency, the mighty disruptive power meshed with the ability to play with so many strong floodgates, the oh so annoying resilience of the deck (though, oh my, what flavor, exactly what you should feel from a zombie deck) or even how well every card flows into the others (beautiful sight though, great design), but the fact that they have the ability to support all zombie archetypes. I heavily enjoy archetypes that can serve as generic support to a broad range of decks. I get my fun from building decks. I don't mind playing duels, just, I don't really care about it most of the time beyond seeing my ideas coming to life on the board, which is very fulfilling to me though.  After playing just a couple of duels, I was already crafting decks in my head, from the obvious shiranui/mayakashi and more out there ideas such as skull servants (<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/wightmare-skull-servant-eldlich/"">right here</a>) or even just good old awesome zombie monster mash. Honestly, the ideas flowing in my head and trying to figure out how to make it all work made me excited about yugioh again.  At that time however, and with the limited ressources master duel allows you to have, I wanted to focus on eldlich cards themselves and wanted to give them a little bit of umpf. And - I know this isn't really inventive or anything - it struck me : this world, IT'S A ZOMBEH WORLD ! I had all these zombie decks ideas all of a sudden, and it just felt like the natural step to take.  <span>The zombie world trifecta and how it actually changes the deck</span>  I did a little research and found out about balerdroch and banshee, and well, that's just what the deck needed. Balerdroch and banshee add a lot, and I mean a lot of power to the deck.  <span>Necroworld banshee</span> alone makes it very, very, very (did I mention very ?) consistent to get zombie world out first turn (well, opponent's draw phase, which to be fair, is kind of the continuation of your first turn), which in turn makes rivalry of warlord that much stronger than it already is. That lock alone has won me a great deal of games. So much so that I will go out of my way to get zombie world out, no matter how minus I go (and, well, this is still eldlich we are talking about, you can never go that minus - just, can't go as plus as I could if I didn't force banshee that badly). I rarely set up multiple eldlich in board + grave, I usually only have the one actually, with two of them sitting patiently in the deck - waiting for the next game after I win the current one. I rarely ever have even just two golden lords in play (counting the grave). I do not try to slow roll it, or set up a potential otk, I go hard on zombie world most of my games, and always if I open rivalry. Again, the generic aspect of the eldlich cards is simply beautiful.  <span>Doomking balerdroch</span>. And there he is, the almighty doomking himself, in all of his glory, the one and only<span> balerdroch.</span> Oh my, such a beautiful oppressive beast. Your opponents will scratch their heads over how to deal with the terror. The recurring non targeting banish and negate it grants you just gives you the weapons you needed to reach the next level. It gives you disruption and protection. One of the first cards that come to mind is ariel. Oh my, such a terrifying card, and I mean it. With balerdroch however, you can easily deal with her and protect your eldlich in the grave. And just like his cousin eldlich, he just comes back and back and back, and that's if they can even touch your board in the first place with balerdroch guarding it.  <span>He also makes the mirror a joke</span>, which I like a lot. Makes it so much more comfortable. I have encountered eldlichs quite a couple times and have only lost the mirror once, where I went second and they just opened ice dragon's prison and solemn judgment, which both together shut me down (lost the 50/50 snipe as well) and I got otk'd on turn 3. Died to my own golden lord. Sad times.  As a bonus he can negate an ash at all times regardless of zombie world. Beautiful. If ash herself doesn't prevent his summon in the first place... Not beautiful.  <span>Zombie world</span> is really what ties it all together. Boosts rivalry of warlords to ridiculous levels. Lets balerdroch be the terror that he is supposed to be. And banshee just puts it on the field extra consistently. It also messes a lot with some decks, namely tri-brigade, which need specific types on the field/graveyard.  <span>Ending thoughts on the zombie world trio</span>  These three cards alone make the deck that much stronger in my opinion, especially in a no side deck best of 1 format - and by sheer virtue of simply existing. They prepare you to face any situation and remove bricks from the deck (more on that in the next section). Their presence alone elevates the deck and brings it a step further. If they are in the deck you easily tutor them with all the eldlich cards and if you draw them, well, great, you drew them and can use them, they don't sit dead in your hand like a coltwing would. They give you power, disruption, protection and resilience, at the cost of no consistency. If anything, it makes the deck more consistent.  <strong>Techs and choices</strong>  <span>Useless and obvious rant <span>(does pave the way for the rest and gives it more meaning...)</span></span>  There are two kinds of card I despise and try to avoid or minimize at all cost when building a deck : anything that's an inherent minus and potential bricks. Duh, I know.  Don't get me wrong, I loove the halqifibrax auroradon line of play. The sheer combo nature of the line and what you can build from just one card amazes me and makes me feel things inside. I've tried myself to go as far as I could with a one card opening hand, and went with that combo to end up with auroradon and dracossack (aka accesscode talker the following turn), double hot red dragon archfiend abyss, yup, double, true king of all calamities, as you do, and even an d.d. crow in hand for good measures. It was slightly (heavily - read ""I had a 16 cards deck which let me mostly control the mills"") set up and still took some tries, but man, was it beautiful. However, as grand as the combo is, I hate having to run coltwing. It makes the whole line much stronger, but if you draw it, it just sits dead in your hand and it kinda ruins your play, kills a lot of possibilities. At the same time, you don't want to put more, as it is more potential bricks, you do really want it in the deck however, and, and, and, well, it is just pain and I try to avoid this kind of card as much as possible or mitigate them as well as I can.  As for inherently minus card, unless they have specific synergy with your cards or happen to be unfortunately core to what you're trying to play, I don't even ever consider them. Seeing them in a list makes me unreasonably angry. When I see an exodia list with either mallet or reload I close the video or replay on the spot.  <span>Building for a single game format</span>  Especially in a single game format like we have on master duel, as much as possible, you want to cut bricks or minimize them, even more than usual, and really make your deck have an all around purpose instead of catering to niche situations/countering one specific strategy. Each game being 100% of its value, you cannot, in my humble opinion, afford niche techs (unless they adress your one weakness or something, but then again, is it even niche or a tech then ?). You also do not have the comfort of a side, making each card you actually put in your deck have that much more weight, both in what it brings to the deck but also in its drawbacks. It's all magnified tenfold. Each card's impact is greatly increased. It is actually very interesting how much building for a single game format steers away from catering to a Bo3 format, it has its own separate meta rankings both in playable decks overall and what cards are good or bad.  <span>Rivalry of warlords</span>  Anyways. One of the things I like a lot about banshee/zombie world, is that it actually minimizes that aspect of one of your best card, as well as trasncending it : rivalry of warlords. Which is what I meant by them making the deck less bricky and more consistent (as well as more powerful). It makes it an all purpose card, great against all decks besides the couple zombie decks you'll encounter, in which case, well, you have balerdroch... (the three card ""engine"" fixes its own weakness, uncanny.) and just locks most decks with next to no drawback anymore.  <span>Gozen match</span>  You'll actually notice I have dropped the usual gozen match from the deck. While I wouldn't mind it in a Bo3 format with side decking, for a single match format, well, for all the reasons stated above I have come to despise the card. How many games have I lost, before changing the deck for this current zombie world version, just from drawing two or more copies of gozen match and/or rivalry of warlords and them just not bothering the opponent whatsoever. Gozen match even more so (which is more so a current meta thing than it being inherently worst than rivalry - though it is after zombie world). I have thus come to cut it from the list (even before going with the zombie world trifecta) and my winrate did go a bit up from just that. And after the zombie world shift, winrate really soared (though it was always comfortably positive, you obviously do not need my changes nor my rant to get results from eldlich haha).  <span>Summon limit</span>  I have instead replaced it with an all purpose summon limit. Again, minimizing potential bricks. Summon limit has actually been great and I am really happy with it. I also love that it applies retroactively (acting as a one time negate sometimes, on top of the floodgate, say on a fusion or ritual spell activated after two monsters have already been summoned) and still counts monsters summoned to your side of the board (kaijus I'm looking at you...). Really screws up a lot of decks. While genuinely happy with it, it would however be the first card I cut to add more solemn judgment when/if I open more.  <span>Foolish burial goods</span>  I don't know why I haven't seen foolish burial goods in any of the eldlich lists I have checked, including tournaments topping lists. I'm genuinely surprised. It basically lets you tutor any of your traps and play with the ones you have already drawn without making them redundant, as it becomes any of the ones you didn't draw. It has made opening that much easier. I only run one for that same recurring idea, minimizing bricks, as you can only activate one a turn, and also, once you start cycling, you don't need to launch the engine anymore, the momentum of the eldlich cards is too great. It also baits ash blossom very nicely. All around a choice I have never once come to regret.  <span>Necroface</span>  Now a more out there tech : necroface. While foolish burial goods just makes too much sense to me, necroface is admittedly a bit iffy. I didn't start with necroface at all. More so with the pure stun list, I have had my fair share of games going the long run, and nearly, or some times even actually, running me out of ressource. Some of the games I've had that come to mind were against virtual world or prank-kids, that just kept on coming and coming and getting to the board, no matter how many times I dealt with it. Necroface was the best solution I've found. I have looked into a couple other choices such as magna dragon zirnitron or gizmek makami, however none have the impact necroface can have on a game. While it has sit in my hand standing idly by and taking up a draw for no result some amount of time, when it did, I've usually felt at ease nontheless. A necroface going through really, and I mean really rejuvenates the deck, letting you steamroll the traps some more, and essentially doubling your stamina, letting you for a whole second game... in the very same one. Also recycles golden lord if all three get banished as a bonus or your banished extra deck cards which sometimes comes into play, usually to go for a zeus. It is there primarily to shuffle your spells and traps back however, in order to give you that sometimes needed second wind (which is a proactive play that can always occur and thus not making necroface a straight brick whereas having your golden lord banished, all three at that, is not something you should hardly cater to as it does not commonly happen - don't plan for fringe scenarios if it costs too much consistency or doesn't add anything besides adressing that one scenario). As such, drawing into it isn't such a big deal, even only one or two turns into the game, as you'll already get value from it, and getting that one or two extra conquistadors can really change the face of some games. It also has the potential to screw with some decks, namely virtual world and also the eater of millions/gizmek orochi/gren maju da eiza deck that is actually decently popular and some others. Even besides those decks, on multiple occasions, has my opponent just surrendered on a necroface summon. They jusy couldn't run me out of ressources anymore. I may edit with some of the replays I have to showcase necroface's potential impact if I ever record them. All in all, a bit out there and nothing crucial, also, sadly, no way to tutor for it, but I have been happy with it, and have actually literally won games on its back, where I would have lost otherwise, against those aforementionned decks and a couple times off the extra conquistador(s). 10/10 would recommend.  <strong>Footnotes</strong>  <span>The deck is not fully optimized I am working with the cards I actually have</span>  A couple of footnotes. The extra deck is comprised of what I actually own on master duel.  I also have only the one <span>solemn judgment</span>, I'd add a second one, if not even a third one - cards to cut first should probably be summon limits (one or two), maybe one huaquero (I am a partisan of the triple huaquero however), maybe even an eldlich the golden lord honestly or even one extravagance - mayybe necroface but it really gets closer to any other eldlich list at this point. Try the creepy doll, I promise you won't regret it.  <span>Glow-up bloom</span> adds consistency as well, not needed, but definitely improves the deck. I would definitely run it if I had it, especially with an avendread savior. I don't recommend crafting it however, unless you are bathing in crafting points. Where I would probably cut the third eldlich the golden lord in order to add more solemn judgments, I probably wouldn't if you have glow-up bulb.  If you have <span>pleiades</span>, please add it to the deck instead of tiras and adreus. Also, add <span>avendread savior</span> if you own any copy. It can replace any of the links really (or those same rank 5s), the least important ones being cerberus and even borrelsword honestly. To be fair though, the extra deck really doesn't matter much, I seldom use it. Which is actually part of the reason why you run extravagance over prosperity in the deck.  <span>Extravagance vs prosperity</span>  When your extra deck matters and your plays revolve around a couple key cards in said extra deck, extravagance is obviously never a consideration. However, when a deck does not rely on the extra deck, that is where the discussion becomes interesting. Here is my take on it.  The way to look at it is very simple really : extragavance generates card advantage where prosperity adds (a lot of) consistency. If you really need to dig for that one card to unlock your plays, prosperity is the choice. If your deck is greatly consistent, extravagance will give you more of an edge. That's really all it is, card advantage vs consistency.  In a vacuum I usually like prosperity way better than extravagance. It essentially gives you a scry mulligan, which is just insane to think about even if it is only for one card. However, eldlich is so greatly consistent already that it makes much better use of the card advantage extravagance provides, and really doesn't need the consistency boost you gain with prosperity.  <span>Do NOT prioritize building the extra deck if you are low on ressources</span>  When I even use the extra deck in the first place, what really matters usually is mostly being able to send conquistador and huaquero to the grave proactively to trigger them during the end phase, be it with linking them away or detaching them for an xyz effect. As such, any generic rank 5 or link 1/2 are fine. If you can actually get a good effect on top, sure, of course, but it is not <em>needed.</em>  Small note however, as I went over it earlier, the deck really consistently gets zombie world on the field, as such vampire bram and avendread savior are pretty ""key"" in that regard as they bypass the rivalry lock, being zombie monsters. Of course, if you have a golden lord in the grave, the issue is non existent in the first place.  <span>Thank you for checking my list !</span>  And that's pretty much it.

Meant to compete at a decent level,"Actual description incoming (maybe)  <span>Meant to actually compete decently</span>  <strong>Couple bullet points I will expand on (non exhaustive) when I have the time/motivation :</strong>  -Almost cut the nekroz part, but does make the deck flow better, easier to start dumping the extra deck to the grave and get all of the plusses - really important to start going off with dogmatika maximus (also also, areadbhair does add a nice power boost)  -Despite being a 60 cards list without a huge mill aspect to it, deck is very consistent  -Also, rather resilient against hand traps. Actually have a non impcantation nekroz dogmatika list (with the usual 40 cards / without herald of perfection - which also cuts eva and lee) which is mostly stronger technically (?) but weaker to interruption as a counterpart. Neither list feel less consistent than the other one. The straight nekroz dogmatika does have a better turn 1 usually though (bar too much disruption, again, weaker to interruption than the impcantation list which really lets you bounce back and back). Still debating which list I like best  -Despite having baronne de fleur, this list is meant to follow master duel's banlist. Read ""one nadir's servant, two benten and two called by the grave""  -Herald of perfection is usually summoned the following turn, first turn usually sets up for it while trying to build as disruptive a board as possible. You do get it out first turn sometimes. Technically you mostly always can, but without fairies in hand. First turn sets that up, herald seals the deal the following turn  -Lee the world chalice fairy is there as an extra monster you get search with eva, as well as being a recurring fairy monster that you can add back to your hand from the grave, as you barely run any fairies for herald (you tutor for them easily though). She can also get rid of an impcantation monster on the field to let you use the extra deck if need be, if you want to go for a fusion play with verte anaconda/super poly/fallen of albaz or even a level 10 synchro play (which is pretty easy to get out - the deck <em>is</em> a bit weaker on master duel due to the lack of baronne de fleur for that reason)  -If you didn't need to use your normal summon, vanity's ruler is rather easy to get out turn 1, sometimes at the cost of a negate though  -Still working on some techs/cuts/ratio, so far feels pretty nice though. Able to compete with the likes of swordsoul somewhat convincingly (haven't tested on master duel itself yet, don't have all the cards, list is built with master duel's banlist however - I know technically baronne de fleur isn't out on master duel yet). I have mostly tested against swordsoul tenyi outside of master duel, as I wanted a tough competitor, and really go to war against something a minimum meta. Against them, nearly always win going first which makes me hopeful for the idea. Mostly lose going second though which makes me worries. Have had going second wins however, but you do have to put up some kind of fight. Against weaker (read non meta decks), the list has been wrecking nicely. Overall, happy with how it's turning out so far"

The paleo cards add tons of chain links for more burn and easily triggered accumulated fortune, they give draw power themselves through pikaia and opabinia, and it gives protection with their own bodies and dinomischus or canadia, even hallucigenia. And to top all that, they also give power plays with (pretty darn easy) access to zeus and toadally awesome which is no joke ! It is no meta deck of course, but it flows very nicely and feels great to play. I do mostly mean that paleo burn doesn't even show up when you look for burn decks. Again, nothing meta, but boy is it fun !  -You could add another dinomischus or even a third one, but after some testing, I do mostly care about the name (all being different so as not to interfere with chain strike and accumulated fortune), which is why you have one of each, in order to get all of the chain links while not preventing the activation of accumulated fortune and chain strike, which are still the core of the deck. I do still have two of marrella and pikaia, as the former really sets everything up and the draw from the latter is a bit too good. Usually one dinomischus has been more than fine, especially as you can search for it (and activate it from hand after you tutor it !) with opabinia.  -Other than that pretty usual list, but the paleozoics really make the deck what it is. Toadally awesome is, of course, awesome. And again, zeus is really easy to get out with the deck, and you don't even have any drawback from it as you can always chain all your spells/traps, because, you know, this is chain burn we are talking about, so you can still set everything and the 3000 atk against an empty board, in a heavy burn deck, is very spooky. Just cleaning the board lalone ets you get many more turns, hopefully enough to burn them down ! Overall, very happy with how it turned out, which is why I am sharing  <span>Couple advice/ideas :</span>  -As much as possible, avoid setting multiple of waboku and threatening roar, each one being a whole extra turn. Do it however if it lets you summon two paleos from the graveyard, which opens up a zeus/opabinia/toadally awesome. Also, remember that the paleozoic traps as monsters are unffacted by monster effects, making them pretty darn resilient and hard to get rid of when under the protection of waboku or threatening roar, so no stress and easy xyz plays on your turn !  -Don't forget that you cannot burn after card of demise for the rest of the turn and cannot special summon the turn you want to use it (even previously in the turn), be wary !  -Don't forget either that accumulated fortune and chain strike cannot be activated if multiple cards with the same name have been activated earlier in the chain - which is why you run all the paleozoic traps. Basically, if you have both marrellas and/both pikaias in the grave, don't activate both before using accumulated fortune/chain strike. Remember as well that you <em><span>can</span> </em>activate two chain strikes or two accumulated fortunes in the same chain, as the second one only sees one activated, thus no two same names  -Lava golem could be an interesting option, but usually you don't care about the opponent's board, most of the time they can't even attack you and negates aren't too annoying, if anything giving you more chain links. It could get rid of some annoying cards all the while burning though. Still debating - while it does admitedly add power and the potential extra burn to finish the opponent off - whether it is fluff that you don't really need at the cost of consistency  Happy burning ! You'll love them hating you  <em>~ paleo fitness, burn all of that fat !</em> (read ""your opponent's thick layer of hp they really don't need"" be a good friend, help them get rid of it !)"

Surpringly consistent. Really really wants to go first though. Not very resilient if they get their special summons or a raigeki or something. That is, however, if they even get to play in the first place :)  -You have pretty powerful board set ups for what the deck is about. Ties of the brethren really makes the deck (and moon mirror shield puts the nail in the coffin), it's all built around that card. Brothers in arms making the enemy cry, but that's fine, we're (nearly) all aqua, we'll thrive with their tears and feed on them :)  -Nothing meta of course, very weak to interruption (read ash blossom) and destruction of any kind (besides battle), and way weaker going second. You will make people miserable pretty consistently when going first however, if that's the way you have fun, this deck is pure pain for the opponent :)  -You can still special summon so as to make your opponent hate you even more. Dweller (your best friend - cheats the 1800 atk limit letting you attack over everything all the while boosting your board's attack power and offering you protection) and abyssalacia both notably are always available for you to summon no matter which lock you have up. Make them feel pain as you do what they wish they could :)  -Don't be afraid to normal summon testudo erat numen (or barrier statue) if that is your only play, always if you have aquarium stage/ties of the brethren/moon mirror shield/mirror force of course, but you should also consider it without any of them. It can still mess the opponent up a little bit and can buy you a whole turn. Let them feel the wrath of the turtle ! :)  (still working out some ratios, namely the left arm offerings and the level 4s, should also consider called by the grave)  (I have a most likely more powerful and more consistent version of the deck in the works with the same idea, with icejades as your level 4 aqua monsters, however I am not done with it for one, and icejades aren't out on master duel yet, may post it anyway ! Worst comes to worst, on a content update for the game where icejades would be added)  (I also have a list which tries to make transmodify work on top of ties of the brethren and thus have more ways to get out a summon lock either through the barrier statue or the other testudo and also both testudo monsters are mostly a perfect special summon lock together. However, while cute on paper, it really just makes the deck less consistent and more convoluted. Also, the other testudo is awkward against 1800 beatsticks - which are legion - as he dies to them in battle even though it is mutual destruction whereas our cute tiny one doesn't bat an eye if in defense mode. The ""perfect lock"" also messes you up a little bit as you can't special summon either if you pull it off - read ""can't get dweller out"". If I ever make it work I'll post it/edit this deck)  <em>~tortoise was god</em>  &nbsp;"

This is my Magnum Opus. ,"I'm Plat 3 on Master Duel with a similar build. I've been playing Koa'ki Meiru for 10 years.  Basic combo: Summon Urnight, reveal Iron Core to summon Supplier, search Maximus (Urnight if Maximus is already in hand), (if monster in grave) XYZ Number 60, (if not) Link Bujin and then make Number 60, summon Urnight from GY with Number 60, reveal Iron Core to summon Tornado (save your Suppliers just in case), XYZ Dark Rebellion, put Vesp on top of Number 60, summon Maximus from hand.  Combo 2: Special summon Alpha, summon Urnight, reveal Iron Core to summon Tornado, Alpha returns Urnight to hand to return opponent's monster, Link Tri-Brigade girl, summon Urnight from hand with Tri-Brigade, summon Supplier with Urnight, XYZ Number 60, summon Urnight from GY with Number 60, reveal Iron Core to summon Supplier, search Maximus, XYZ Dark Rebellion, Vesp on top of Number 60, summon Maximus from hand.  There are many different ways to go about this combo with Summoner Monk or Tin Goldfish + Supplier in hand. The main idea is to spam Urnight 2 or even 3 times if possible. You won't always be able to end up with that exact field on the board but you will still be able to OTK. You at times can end up with Vesp, Rebellion, Bujin, and Tornado on field which is exactly 8000 while Tornado destroys ALL their special summoned monsters.  I recently was also able to create Lambda while my opponent had a monster on field ready to activate an effect, negated it with Gamma, made level 8 Synchro, summoned Maximus from hand, pop card, Link Bujin, XYZ Number 60, and comboed my way to an OTK field (1500 + 2500 + 2500 + 1700).  Left Arm Offering opens the door to adding Leviair and 2 level 3 monsters to banish your Urnight and search for Iron Core and then make the OTK combo but Left Arm Offering is just a test card for now. You can definitely remove it.  You can also add 3 or 2 Parallel Exceed and add 2 or 3 Trade-In for more combo potential + draw power."

The main game plan is to get to your Wind-Up magician, Wind-Up shark combo as fast as possible; hence all the draw cards.  From there, you'll be able to loop magician and shark, along with rat and the link 2 Wind-Up monster.  After that it's up to the rest of your hand, the rank 3's are surprisingly useful for your endboard and you should usually finish on a 2 negate apollosa, cicada king, and toad. You can also do a small hand loop with hunter but it isn't too crazy.  The crusadia engine is merely for extension and in other cases where you brick. It ensures that you can at least end on an Equimax negate which is better than nothing.  Anyways, I hope you guys enjoy the deck!"

Enjoy a 1 card combo = 8 disruptions,"Orcust is one of my most favorite Deck of all time, seeing Harp at 1 in Master Duel really made me excited and immediately build Orcust Striker as my 1st Deck in Master Duel. However, after discovering the power of Normal Summon Scrap Recycler, I immediately scrap those Striker cards and put some scrap cards instead. After some testing, I found that the best end board I could make with just Normal Summon Scrap Recycler 0 extenders is: 3 materials Apollousa, Bardiche, 2 Fog Blades, I:P Masquerena, and Babel with Dingirsu on GY. In total those are 8 disruptions <h2>Combo</h2> <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Recycler -&gt; Send Rosenix/O-lion for a token</li>  	<li>Link into Scrap Wyvern -&gt; Set 1 card</li>  	<li>Scrap Wyvern Summon back Recycler and pop it -&gt; Triggers to summon Golem from Deck, then pop the Set card</li>  	<li>Golem Summon back Recycler -&gt; Send World Wand</li>  	<li>Link into Lib with Recycler and Golem -&gt; Set World Legacy Succession -&gt; Bring back Golem -&gt; Bring back Recycler -&gt; Send Harp</li>  	<li>Link into 3 materials Apollousa using Scrap Wyvern and any other 2 monsters (which monsters don't matter)</li>  	<li>Banish Harp to Summon Orcustrated Knightmare</li>  	<li>Link Orcustrated Knightmare and 1 monster into Galatea -&gt; Shuffle Harp to Set Babel</li>  	<li>Banish Orcustrated Knightmare to Send Skeleton</li>  	<li>Banish World Wand to Summon back Orcustrated Knightmare</li>  	<li>Link Galatea and Orcustrated Knightmare into Bardiche -&gt; Send Cloak to Set Fog Blade</li>  	<li>Banish Cloak to add Boots -&gt; Summon Boots</li>  	<li>Banish Skeleton to Summon back Galatea -&gt; Xyz into Dingirsu -&gt; Attach Skeleton (send to GY if you go 2nd)</li>  	<li>Link Dingirsu and Boots into Masquerena (<span>DON'T SUMMON ON THE ZONE BARDICHE POINTS TO</span>)</li>  	<li>Banish Boots to add Fog Blade</li> </ol> During your opponent's turn, you can: <ol>  	<li>Banish Skeleton to Summon back Dingirsu (to a zone Bardiche points to) -&gt; Dingirsu cl1 Bardiche cl2 -&gt; pop + send to GY</li>  	<li>Link Masquerena and Dingirsu into Unicorn (you can co-link it with Bardiche pog) to shuffle 1 card</li>  	<li>Banish Orcustrated Knightmare to send World Wand, Apollousa can gain 800 ATK for 1 more negate (and yes this is a Damage Step card)</li>  	<li>Banish Orcustrated Knightmare to send Harp -&gt; End Phase Harp Summon Orcustrated Knightmare for Accesscode next turn + Orcustrated Knightmare can send Skeleton to bring back Dingirsu</li> </ol> <h2>Deck Breakdown (Outside Combo)</h2> <strong>Main Deck:</strong> <ol>  	<li>3x Scrap Raptor: Search Recycler (add + Extra Normal Summon)</li>  	<li>3x Fossil Dig: Search Scrap Raptor</li>  	<li>3x Scrapyard: Search Scrap Raptor</li>  	<li>2x Scrap Lube: Revive Recycler</li>  	<li>2x Overdone Burial: Revive Recycler</li>  	<li>3x Shade Brigandine: Extender. If recycler got negated, just Brigandine into Scrap Wyvern and do your combo normally</li>  	<li>1x Orcust Crescendo: Omni-negate, a bit hard to use since you won't control Galatea most of the time</li>  	<li>10x Other Staples you already know about</li> </ol> <strong>Extra Deck:</strong> <ol>  	<li>1x Al'miraj: This boi is important. If Recycler got ashed, veilered, impermed, or whatever; you can Link into Al'miraj and revive back your Recycler using cards like Monster Reborn, Scrap Lube, or Overdone Burial. It doesn't matter if it's negated, the first send is only to set up 2 monsters on the field for Scrap Wyvern. If you happened to Monster Reborn it, you can make 4 materials Apollousa instead</li>  	<li>1x Longirsu: Quick Effect potential non-targeting send 2 monsters to GY. It's an Orcust Link Monster, which enables Crescendo</li>  	<li>1x Trisbaena: Link Masquerena and Apollousa to banish all backrow (including your Fog Blades). You can trigger its effect by using Harp or Skeleton. Only do this against backrow Decks. Since most backrow Deck barely have a monster on the field, you can sacrifice Apollousa and your Fog Blades to banish up to 5 backrow</li>  	<li>1x Barricadeborg: Protect your Babel. You can Link this instead of Masquerena if you're afraid of Lightning Storm/Twin Twister wiping your Babel</li>  	<li>1x Link Spider: Rosenix and O-lion Summon a token, in case you ever need to turn them into effect monsters to do some Link plays</li> </ol> <h2>Conclusions</h2> How consistent is the Deck? 12 Starters in 48 card Deck, so around 78% chance to open your Starter. Playing 2 ofs most of the combo pieces to avoid drawing garnet = can't combo, also it's an Orcust Deck, you can't just play 1 of. Playing more backrow staples over hand traps because Scrap Wyvern fodder is important to make Apollousa. Don't ever, not even once, think on playing Maxx ""C"" on this Deck, it will hurt you more than gaining advantage  The Deck biggest weakness is pretty much Nibiru, since you go into Apollousa at your 10th Summon. This Deck can dodge Ash, Veiler/Imperm, or even Droll. Unless your opponent is smart enough to negate Scrap Wyvern instead of just YEP BUTTONS and negate Recycler, you're fine if you have an Extender. If your Scrap Wyvern got negated, you're screwed. You can still make some play if you have a way to send Harp to GY. The funny part is that Droll only affect Bardiche engine alone. Where does it say ""Add"" on an Orcust card? Even the Scrap engine doesn't add, except for the RotA I guess. Even Lib doesn't add, she SETS. Actually you're screwed if you got Drolled on Fossil Dig/Scrapyard. But who plays Droll on Bo1 anyways (I guess Drytron hater does)  This Deck also suffers from not having an Omni-Negate, meaning that Raigeki/Lightning Storm alone may break the board. Unless you decided to just say NOPE to Babel and Set Crescendo instead, which mean you're gonna miss a lot of advantage just for an Omni-Negate. No Masquerena, no Dingirsu, no Harp during your opponent's turn. No worries tho, Raigeki alone can't break the board. You still have 2 Fog Blades (which can revive Bardiche BTW) and Dingirsu. On the other hand, this Deck doesn't instantly lose to Droplet/Dark Ruler like that Tier 1 Machine Deck that everyone hates  Overall, this Deck is kinda decent. Unlike most Combo Deck that sets up like 7 Negates and loses to Droplet, this Deck sets up a different type of disruptions. An interactive one, that is. Playing with Masquerena and Dingirsu is much more fun than just negating everything your opponent does (tho the Deck still sets up 5 monster negates). Kinda balanced when it comes to monsters and backrow.  My build is obviously not the best one out there, I don't even put Ash in it, which is kinda questionable. Maybe because I prefer board breakers over hand traps? The satisfaction is just not the same. You can always swap out cards in any way you like it, don't just copy paste Deck from the internet raw, you insolent fools!"

While I can't claim anything too impressive, I regularly placed well with them at my locals until tiger got yeeted out of existence. I've seen a few Lunalight lists on here and they are regularly pretty disappointing. Probably the best way to play the deck is Lunalight Tri-Brigade, but I haven't done all too much experimenting with that. </span> <h2><span>Overview</span></h2> <span>Lunalights (if you're not familiar) are a powerful fusion OTK deck released during the pendulum era. This deck uses an infinite negate combo with Mist Valley Apex Avian to go first and hopefully completely lock your opponent out of playing the game, with your incredible OTK power ensuring a kill on the clapback.</span> <h2><span>Card by Card</span></h2> <span><strong>Main Deck</strong></span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Fraktall"">Tri-Brigade Fraktall</a> - Honestly just filler. You could definitely replace this with something else if you wanted. A <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>, third <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, a <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, or a backup copy of <a data-name=""Lunalight Wolf"">Lunalight Wolf</a> would be my suggestions.</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Lunalight Wolf"">Lunalight Wolf</a> - Miracle Fusion! Who doesn't love miracle fusion? I know I do, especially in a deck that can dump materials as easy as this one</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Lunalight Kaleido Chick"">Lunalight Kaleido Chick</a> - One of the two biggest cards in this deck. On the field, can send ANY Lunalight monster from your deck OR extra deck to the GY as COST. The actual effect of being able to use that monster's name if used for a fusion summon honestly rarely comes up, so just laugh at your opponent whenever they use a negate on this effect. It also turns off your opponent's ability to interact in the BP of the turn that it's banished in. She really just does everything.</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Lunalight Emerald Bird"">Lunalight Emerald Bird</a> - One of the more eh cards in the deck, but I still think it's worth having at one, especially if you play Foolish Burial. At worst, she's another monster you can send off of Kaleido Chick to use for a fusion summon. </span>  <span>2x <a data-name=""Lunalight Yellow Martin"">Lunalight Yellow Martin</a> - Another fantastic card. Bounces a Lunalight card you control to special summon itself from hand or GY. It banishes itself when it leaves the field then, but you can avoid this by using it as XYZ material.</span>  <span>3x my literal actual child <a data-name=""Lunalight Tiger"">Lunalight Tiger</a> - Along with Kaleido Chick, one of the best 2 cards in the deck. Her pendulum effect special summons a Lunalight monster from your gy but negates their effects. Reminder that Kaleido Chick foolishes a monster for cost, and not as an effect. Lunalight Tiger's pendulum effect also isn't a hard OPT, so if you bounce her, (<em>cough cough martin cough cough)</em> you can use the effect again.</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Lunalight Black Sheep"">Lunalight Black Sheep</a> - Not a very good card, but useful for a combo to get Lunalight Wolf into your hand</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Fire Formation – Tenki"">Fire Formation – Tenki</a> - Beast-warrior ROTA. 'nough said</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> - Draw Power. 'nough said.</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Lunalight Fusion"">Lunalight Fusion</a> - a fusion spell that lets you use one material from your deck or extra deck if your opponent has a monster special summoned from the extra deck. comes up sometimes, but it's mainly just searchable off of Yellow Martin</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> - used to send the next 2 cards to the gy</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Luna Light Perfume"">Luna Light Perfume</a> - Monster reborn in the streets hand, archetypal search in the sheets gy. (note Luna (SPACE) Light)</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Lunalight Serenade Dance"">Lunalight Serenade Dance</a> - Perfume gy eff, but the card in hand is sent as an effect and it special summons a monster instead of adding it to hand</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Blackwing – Zephyros the Elite"">Blackwing – Zephyros the Elite</a> - martin, but once per duel, and you get to it differently</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Raidraptor – Singing Lanius"">Raidraptor – Singing Lanius</a> - special summons itself from hand if you have an xyz monster</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Mist Valley Thunderbird"">Mist Valley Thunderbird</a> - the ""infinite"" in ""infinite negates""</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a> - the ""negates"" in ""infinite negates""</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> -</span>  <span>2x <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> -</span>  <span>2x <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> -</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> - You could probably lean into this harder by playing a larger variety of staples to negate or cut it entirely. Player preference</span>  <span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span>  <span>2x <a data-name=""Lunalight Leo Dancer"">Lunalight Leo Dancer</a> - It's ya girl, the big cat, the dommy mommy, thunder thighs the thunder cat, kill your opponent real good. Untargetable, indestructible, 3500 double attacker that nukes your opponent's special summoned monsters after her first attack</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Lunalight Sabre Dancer"">Lunalight Sabre Dancer</a> - Untargetable big number, but doesn't matter all that much for that. the REAL reason you play this is because you can send it off of chick turn one and then banish it from your gy turn 3 to give Lunalight Leo Dancer a huge 3k boost to make sure they die</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Lunalight Panther Dancer"">Lunalight Panther Dancer</a> - the material for Lunalight Leo Dancer. send it off of kaleido chick and then use wolf to miracle fusion. you can also use kaleido's effect to take its name or just use the effect of Lunalight Fusion to send it, but most frequently you will just be sending it with kaleido and then using wolf to miracle.</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS – Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS – Sky Thunder</a> - Zeus is good, but I haven't summoned it much in this deck, so you could take it out if you wanted and replace it with something like <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> or a second Panther Dancer. <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a> is also not that bad of a choice. <a data-name=""Fire Fighting Daruma Doll"">Fire Fighting Daruma Doll</a> is another good card.</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist – Tiger King"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist – Tiger King</a> - mainly useful because it searches tenki if you didn't start with it. also useful because it negates the effects of all monsters on the field except beast warriors</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Primathmech Laplacian"">Primathmech Laplacian</a> - This card is filler. I think I've summoned it once? It was cool when I did, but should probably be replaced.</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"">Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</a> - Amazing utility card. Useful as a generic xyz monster and all of the effects are great in this deck. I've used all of them at some point. Just probably don't want to use the the special summon effect on turn one.</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Raidraptor – Force Strix"">Raidraptor – Force Strix</a> - generic xyz monster that searches singing lanius or zephyros (usually singing). used in the deck's main combo</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> - Big dragon big number big beatstick go brrrr. you could probably play <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> instead if you wanted, but I play Borrelsword in all of my decks almost because I'm salty about buying it when it was $90.</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> - It's a pretty common and Clear sight to see her bow on your opponent's board with 24-32k attack. It's just a good card and if you're worried about your opponent disrupting you with monster effects, it's great to make, though you usually can't afford to on turn one. It's a card that you could cut, but it's far from bad.</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a> - The deck's namesake. For 3 points of link material, only one of which has to be a winged beast, this powerful boss monster will let you special summon Apex Avian from your deck while giving both of them targeting protection. Just make sure that you don't have more than 3 spell/trap zones in use or you won't be able to summon Apex Avian.</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Raidraptor – Wise Strix"">Raidraptor – Wise Strix</a> - Great for link climbing and used in the deck's main combo. special summons zephyros from deck to extend combos</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a> - equips Mist Valley Thunderbird from your deck for the infinite negates</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom"">Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</a> - good for link climbing, but could be replaced if you wanted to. </span>  <span><strong>Notes</strong></span>  <span><a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Firefist - Eagle"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist – Eagle</a> and <a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Firefist - Boar"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist – Buffalo</a> are a strong and quick link climbing package. I don't think that this deck needs them, and it does take up space in the main deck, but if you want a more pure build of Lunalights, they're fantastic for climbing into Apollusa or other link 4s</span>  <span><a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a> is a personal favorite for this deck because of its weakness to called by. I just didn't think I had the room with the other hand staples I wanted to run (aka Maxx ""C"" and ways to turn off Maxx ""C"").</span> <h2><span>Main Combo + Synergies</span></h2> <span>The main combo starts with Lunalight Tiger and Lunalight Kaleido Chick in hand. Normal summon Kaleido Chick and use its effect to send Lunalight Yellow Martin from your deck to the GY. Activate Lunalight Tiger in your pendulum zone and use its effect to bring back Yellow Martin. Overlay Yellow Martin and Kaleido Chick into Raidraptor - Force Strix and detach Yellow Martin to activate the effect of Force Strix, searching Raidraptor - Singing Lanius. Special summon Singing Lanius from your hand and link Force Strix and Singing Lanius into Raidraptor - Wise Strix. Wise Strix's effect should special summon Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite from your deck. It can't be used as link material, so we have to use it for an xyz first. Activate the effect of Yellow Martin in grave, bouncing Lunalight Tiger to special summon itself. Overlay Zephyros and Martin into Number 60: Dugares the Timeless (although any xyz monster with an effect you can activate to detach a material should work). Activate the effect of your xyz monster, detaching Zephyros. Activate the Lunalight Tiger you bounced with Martin and use it to special summon Kaleido chick. Use Kaleido Chick to dump Lunalight Sabre Dancer for next turn. Then use the effect of Zephyros to once again bounce Tiger, special summoning Zephyros. Use Wise Strix and Dugares (or whatever xyz monster you made) to go link into Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty and use Kaleido Chick and Zephyros to link into Union Carrier. Use Union Carrier's effect targeting Simorgh to equip Mist Valley Thunderbird from deck. During your end phase, special summon Mist Valley Apex Avian with Simorgh's effect. Make sure to summon it to a zone Simorgh points to so that it gains targeting protection. Now whenever your opponent activates a card effect, activate Apex Avian, targeting your Thunderbird, which will special summon itself whenever it returns to your hand.</span>  <span>This is far from failproof. Apex Avian is only once per chain, so if your opponent has any quick effects, they can chain them after Apex Avian without you being able to stop them. There's also the ever-present <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> and <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, which you won't be able to respond to.</span>  <span>If you need to get Lunalight Wolf into your hand, send it off of Kaleido Chick, then make Tiger King to search tenki, tenki to search black sheep, and use black sheep's effect to return wolf to your hand.</span>  <span>Other synergies in the deck are that you can chain your Serenade Dance/Luna Light Perfumes if you have several in your hand. Simply activate one graveyard effect and discard/send the next card you want to use. You can also use this to put Martin or Zephyros in your GY if you have them. You can also search Zephyros off of Force Strix if you need to. Dugares is of course another way you can get things from your hand to your gy, and Dugares actually discards as part of the effect, rather than the cost, so if you send yellow martin or emerald bird, you will be sending them to the gy by a card effect.</span> <h2><span>Closing Thoughts</span></h2> <span>In closing, I love this deck a lot, and while it definitely has its weaknesses, being able to full combo off of two very searchable cards is incredibly fun and the deck has a lot more tools to extend than that. It's also an incredibly strong deck when it comes to playing through negates, and on the ranked latter it feels like no one actually knows where you're supposed to hit this deck.</span>"

Most of the time you need your opponent to have at least 1 monster with 2000+ atk on board to OTK, which your kaijus can help you with. It is possible to OTK on an empty board, just a little tougher, you have to hard draw Limiter Removal, which Memories of Hope can help with. If not you can attack for 4k with your gates, then MP2 make Sunya to burn for 3k in next standby then either attack for game or style on them with a Lava Golem for the last 1000.  Handtrap line-up is a little tricky. Ash is an auto-include in basically any deck these days. Imperm's versatility of being able to slow down an opponent's combo or be set as a line of defense when forced to go first or in instances where you can't OTK is invaluable. The Gammas should ideally be used defensively to protect a search with Planet Pathfinder or Terraforming, getting to make Omega and rip a card is just a cheeky bonus. Nibiru is crazy but the fact that it summons itself conflicts with the Numeron combo since you need an empty field for it to resolve so it can't be recommended here. If you're on Master Duel I don't have to tell you to jam 3 Maxx C in here.  The deck has some niche interactions that can be game winning or game losing if you don't play around them. Lava Golem (and Sphere Mode) both take your normal summon, this can sometimes leave you having to choose whether to tribute off your opponent's board or get your field spell with Planet Pathfinder, sad times.  Numeron Wall is the MVP of this deck. It flat-out ignores Ash Blossom by activating Network from deck. It also has a <a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a> style effect, which does require you to take at least 1 attack, so it can't save you from one-shot situations but it can punish people sequencing attacks in the traditional ""lowest attack first"" way (thank you Gorz). If it's your only monster on the field you can also tribute it from the field to activate a Network from deck. If your opponent pops your Network on their turn to avoid getting burned by Sunya, you can also use Wall to get it back before your turn so that Sunya can resolve properly.  Extra deck is pretty self-explanatory. You got yer gates and a tool box of big generic links to make in MP2 if you haven't won the game already.  Sidedeck is where things get spicy. This board aims to do what the Gren Maju decks tried to do when forced to go first, just a little bit better. You have your 1-for-1 swaps of solid generic going 2nd cards in things like Red Reboot, and Sphere Mode. The rest of the sidedeck are floodgates that are purely 1-sided. Summon Limit seems bad considering the main combo requires summoning 4 monsters, but the effect of Numeron Calling is treated as only 1 summon. You can even use your second summon for Sunya or one of your big link monsters. Slifer seems like an insane include, but it had previously seen some success mained in earlier versions of this deck. It's a walking floodgate that gets huge courtesy of Memories of Hope and it can be summoned by tributing off 3 of your gates provided you haven't normal summoned yet. Torrential Tribute is Torrential Tribute. If you go on the Sunya line, you're ending on an empty board already, otherwise you're most likely sitting on 1 monster, having this up your sleeve for when your opponent over-extends is more often than not worth losing that 1 monster. Don't literally put Torrential Tribute up your sleeve, that's cheating.  The deck is really straightforward and a ton of fun to play. I've been laddering on Master Duel with a slightly different version and the only match-ups I've had any trouble with are Drytron and some of the Tri-Brigade variants, but that's to be expected when facing tier-1 decks."

Enjoy,"Springans while one of my favorite Albaz story decks are kind of booty but I still enjoy playing them a lot.  &nbsp;  The goal of the deck is to have merrymaker out alongside a Sargas that way you have a free pop and if you have at least two materials on Merrymaker and you use the cards ability to banish you send off either sprind or Titaniklad to get their ability off.  Sprind- Add or special summon a Springans or Albaz monster from your deck  Titaniklad- Add or Special summon a Dogmatika or Albaz from your deck.  &nbsp;  The best way to get sargas out aside from Sprind is to use the grave ability of Brothers when you send it off for a cost of say Gold Golganda or Merrymaker.  With Sanga ability you can banish him and one other springan monster you re add a springan to your hand. So you pretty much if you re add brothers can loop him (though it is a hard once per turn)  Another funny thing you can do with the deck is to loop Brothers using Rocky (though like I said it is a hard once per turn so if you can pull off the loop it is super mega haha funny)  Another thing. All springans have the ability that (hard) once per turn you can attach itself to a Springans XYZ monster on the field which is good to help fuel the banish ability of Merrymaker and of course their big finisher boss monster EXBLOWER which by detaching ANY number of materials from it can just blow up your opponents field, columns, etc. It is super mega ultra HAHAHA funny. If you attach a sargas to any of the XYZ monsters you give them an extra 1000 atk.  In conclusion, Springans are fun but they need a LOT of help and I hope Konami does that soon (maybe after dimension force) but I doubt it will happen because it seems like Konami wants to just keep making branded cards and new Albaz forms. I do have hope that in the final fight of the story they just give every deck in that story new stuff (maybe even a corrupted Despia version of ecclesia) but only time will tell. Thank you and have a nice day, morning or night."

For most it would be a card like Neos, Celestial, Dasher, etc. If I asked what do you think about when I mention OG Heroes/Iconic Heroes most modern players would probably say Neos, Dark Law (Not an OG hero but still an iconic Hero Boss monster), etc. Well when I think of an iconic Hero Boss monster I think of the Elemental Hero branch and instantly think about Flame Wingman who imo is THE Elemental Hero Boss Monster and THE most iconic Hero boss card and monster right alongside Stratos.  &nbsp;  This build is meant to shit out the different Hero fusions while looking cool as hell doing so. I hope you enjoy the deck and maybe even build your own Hero deck using your favorite Hero monster(s) in there no matter how hard or easy it is to bring out.  Yes, I do use Skyscraper in the deck because it is meant to be a season 1 Jaden/Judai Yuki deck because I love the og Elemental Hero monsters and skyscraper can be a busted card and I just fell in love with the deck when it was used on me by a friend when I was at his house a few months ago and just knew I wanted to build the deck BECAUSE it is season 1 Elemental Heroes.  The later version of the deck uses the new Neos/Wingman fusion but since it is not on here it will have to wait."

As per usual, the side deck will be filled with cards that you might want to consider but are not necessarily mandatory for the build.</span>  <span>Okay so, I wanna preface this ""guide"" with, of all the Yu-Gi-Oh! deuteragonists (aka the ""Seto Kaiba"" of each series) out there, Jack Atlas is probably one of my favorites, only bested by Reiji Akaba of Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V and followed by Ryoken Kogami of Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS, and Red Nova Dragon is my favorite Synchro Monster of all time just in terms of the art work. Okay, enough fanboying, let's actually proceed to the list.</span>  <span>The Main Deck:</span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Ascator, Dawnwalker"">Ascator, Dawnwalker</a> &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Fire Ant Ascator"">Fire Ant Ascator</a></strong> - <span>This is just a free generic Level 8 Synchro enabler without spending your Normal Summon, much like how <a data-name=""Supay, Duskwalker"">Supay, Duskwalker</a> is for the Level 6 Synchros which is another way to access <a data-name=""Red Rising Dragon"">Red Rising Dragon</a>, but we already have something for that and I'm not really a fan of overlaps. I have seen some lists that runs x2 <a data-name=""Fire Ant Ascator"">Fire Ant Ascator</a> instead, just to make the other copy of <a data-name=""Ascator, Dawnwalker"">Ascator, Dawnwalker</a> live but that's only because they also run <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a>, in case they mill it off of its effect, which I personally don't think is the best way to approach this.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Psi-Reflector&lt;/span&gt;""><span>Psi-Reflector</span></a>, x2 <a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a> &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Assault Mode Activate"">Assault Mode Activate</a></strong> - <span>This one's just a more compact version of an Assault Mode engine. <a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a> used to be at 3 but I decided to cut it down because I'm already playing x2 <a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a>, and often I find myself bricking with the extra copy of it, and it's searchable anyway.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Resonator Command"">Resonator Command</a></strong> - <span>This one I rarely see on some Resonator lists. It's not mandatory, but more of an additional consistency piece. You could play your blow out staples here if you want, like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> or <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> to help you go second, Kaijus, or even <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>. I just chose it because I hate being Ashed.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a></strong> - <span>If only this card was searchable, oh boy. This card is really great against decks that swarm a lot. It's non-targeting, non-destruction removal, it also provides protection, it recycles itself, it's so good in tandem with your main boss monster <a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a>.</span></span>  <span>The Extra Deck:</span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a></strong> - <span>This one is just a filler slot, really, but if I were to place something here I would definitely wanna try out adding one more copy of <a data-name=""Assault Mode Activate"">Assault Mode Activate</a> in the main and use <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a> (if I have it) for <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode"">Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</a> since it's just a free omni negate.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Red Rising Dragon"">Red Rising Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Your go-to Level 6 Synchro. You'll usually make this with <a data-name=""Crimson Resonator"">Crimson Resonator</a> and <a data-name=""Wandering King Wildwind"">Wandering King Wildwind</a>. Very rarely do you often use <a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a> or <a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a> for this, but it does come up.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend"">Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Red Dragon Archfiend"">Red Dragon Archfiend</a></strong> - <span>This slot could be for any DARK Dragon Synchro monsters you want/could use, or just any ratio of the said cards you wanna play. If I were to cut something it'd probably be either <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend</a> because it sucks for not treating itself as ""<a data-name=""Red Dragon Archfiend"">Red Dragon Archfiend</a>"" or the original Red Dragon Archfiend because it could sometimes mess up your own cards if you're not mindful especially when going 1st, most likely the former.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Your main boss monster, also your largest beat stick. You would usually end up with it having 6000 ATK. It has a good destruction effect protection, a non-targeting, non-destruction mass removal. It's your main response to activated removal or just monster effect in general. You'll rarely use its effect during the Battle Phase, but it's nice to have.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Red Nova Dragon"">Red Nova Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Your secondary boss monster, also your second largest beat stick. Also has a good enough destruction effect protection, and it's your main response to your opponent's beat sticks, in case they happen to be able to summon a monster with an ATK higher than 6000.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity</a> and x1 <a data-name=""Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend"">Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend</a></strong> - <span>These two are sort of tied, but are used for different purposes. <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity</a> is a more aggressive pick and something you'd wanna go with going second due to its effect similar to <a data-name=""D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga"">D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga</a>, and <a data-name=""Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend"">Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend</a> is the more defensive one, with its weird but useful Battle Phase exclusive Spell/Trap card negation. It's almost like a very budget version of <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> without the immunity effects,</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane</a></strong> - <span>One of your avenues to Synchro climbing, albeit requiring battling much like the next one. Regardless, it's a 3500 ATK beater, which is not a joke, especially when it can revive any of your ""<a data-name=""Red Dragon Archfiend"">Red Dragon Archfiend</a>"" monsters, including King Calamity.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a></strong> - <span>Your walking 3200 ATK <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>. People used to abuse this with <a data-name=""Guardragon Agarpain"">Guardragon Agarpain</a> by cheesing it out of the Extra Deck.</span></span>  <span><strong>Testing and Closing Thoughts</strong></span>  <span><span>It definitely is consistent. You have a lot of 1-2 card combos in the deck that does not xeno lock you into anything that will hinder your game plan in any way, which means your choke points only vary based on your starting hand. If not for the presence of <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a>, I would definitely just swap it out for <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>s and <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>s instead to add a layer of protection. It has a simple and straightforward game plan and does not really need any sort of finesse or messing around with mind games unlike most meta decks that requires you to think steps ahead of your opposition. It knows what it does, and it does it very well. I'm actually convinced that this archetype's already complete.

Use Danger! and Dark World effects to destroy opponent's cards and summon as many high level monsters as you can. You can use Galaxy Wizard to Normal Summon level 8 or get Galaxy Queen's Light to change all your monsters to the same level. You can use Astral Kuriboh to give your XYZ Number monster protection from destruction. With Astral Kuriboh and Galaxy Queen's Light you can even summon Number 92, so you could Special Summon it from GY if it gets destroyed (negated on the field and then destroyed)  Just summon Number 97 and use it to summon 92 or 38.  If you go 1st, it's good to summon 92. If you play against Eldlich, you won, as you will just banish everything they set and on your turn summon Number 100 for 18k damage.

Most ED cards are Staples too!,"Note regarding UR's: ● The Main Deck is very cheap aside from staples which are cuttable. ● The Extra Deck contains lot of Stapes too and is Flexible.  Caution: Even though floodgates are run, you need brainpower to play this deck!  The Deck aims to end on Vanity's Ruler or Barrier Statue of the Drought (Only possible if you do not have to Normal Summon a Manju/Senju to combo) and plans to OTK turn 3. Sadly <span class=""name_txt selectable"">Magician of Black Chaos MAX</span> does not exist in Master Duel, so this can't be used as backup strat in case you have to Normal Summon a Manju/Senju. Instead you end on either:  ● Number 41 (against most decks) ● Dweller + Herald of Mirage Lights (slaughters drytron) ● Nephthys, the sacred flame (slaughters Sky Striker and other decks that cannot out a dragoon-like monster)  Plus lots of followup.  Good points about the Deck: ● Extreme Followup and grind (Ritual Spell in the GY gives you insane plus turn 3+) ● Can search Nibiru or Blockdragon if needed ● Can OTK with any Level 4's (Accesscode line) ● Can get High ATK with Phaleg (for unaffected bossmonsters) ● Toolbox Extradeck ● Ends on Floodgates (Yep fun) but can win without them.  Bad Points: ● Dies to skilldrain in most cases. ● Engine alone is over 40, so with HT's and going second cards its 60 cards. Still very consistent but you see non-engine cards less ● Feather duster/LS hurt pretty bad, Portal is an important card. ● Can play around Maxx C only a little bit (Number 41 Turbo - still draw 2 or more.) ● In a best of one you kind of don't know what to make for the endboard. Against drytron you lose if you end on Number 41 for example. ● Appolousa is a scary card for rocks"

If you want to play a more consistent route, remove dpe and play more spells (mystic mine, another area zero etc). Siding needs to be changed a little, summon limit and crossout can be changed to some going first cards like solemn judgement or tcboo (I play for the memes). Eagle booster is definitely necessary in this build because it's too fragile (verte/halq/selene etc.)  Another suggestion for a consistent route is removing halq and selene for unicorn and another shizuku/fire charmer and definitely another zeke if you want to remove dpe package."

Some of you may recognize me as the guy who wrote the OTHER massive and incredibly in depth Kozmo guide back a month ago that wound up labeled as a High Quality Deck. Now, knowing that information, your question now may be ""Why make another one?"" Simple! Because despite that deck being labeled as a ""High Quality Deck"", it kinda sucks! It can definitely get you to Plat 5 cheaply and easily, and if thats your goal then great! Go out and make that one, I have the link for it <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/kozmo-beginner-budget-master-duel/"">right here</a>. But I got bored with losing, and so taking inspiration from 이주호's Kozmo Kaiju deck on Master Duel Meta I made this. Please <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/a/Yt9HsxT"">check their deck out</a> as well and take bits and pieces from both to best fit your wants, as taking multiple options into account when deck building is always important. This is much stronger than the last, purer version, as evidenced by making Plat 1 after being hardstuck in Plat 5 before. I will start off defining the roles of each card in this deck. I know this is very long, and I do think its worth it to read all of it, but I will be putting tl:dr's for everything right below them so you don't have to do excessive reading if you don't want to. Without further ado, here is Kozmo Breakdown 2: Its Better This Time.  <strong>MONSTERS</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver"">Psy-Frame Driver</a> x1</strong>: Driver is a level 6 normal monster with 2500/0. It is only here because Gamma needs it to work. Despite that, if you can get it on your turn its hardly useless, as due to this deck's lack of reliance on the extra deck we can load it up with a few cards based around Gamma and Driver special summoning themselves. A 2500 beatstick on player phase is nice, and you can also take it and Gamma and go into any of the 3 level 8 synchro's or I:P based on the situation. If at all possible you want Driver to end up in the graveyard before the end of the turn its summoned, as your 2nd Gamma can use him from there but not the banish zone, so ramming it, sacrificing it, or using it as material should always be the priority if you proc it on player phase. Overall a garnet, but as far as garnets go its not the worst. Some people run 2 of this to make sure both their Gamma's will go off, but games don't last that long so I think thats foolish. Run at 1.  Driver tl,dr: Your Gamma's powercell, try and get it in the grave.  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Tincan"">Kozmo Tincan</a> x3:</strong> Tincan is a level 1 monster with 0/0 that in the endphase, can pay 500 lifepoints to search 3 Kozmo cards from your deck w different names and your opponent blindly picks one for you to add to your hand, and like all pilots you can banish them at basically any point into a higher leveled Kozmo from your hand (Im not gonna mention this effect from now on unless theres smth dif about it for the monster). Tincan is going to generally be your best turn 1 option due to being able search without needing to attack unlike Farm Girl, with its only competition for that title being Wickedwitch. Luckily if you draw both thats not a dilemma in the slightest, as you can just play Tincan and then go into Wickedwitch on enemy phase for the best of both worlds. This getting Ashed if you dont already have a ship or Wickedwitch in your hand can be disastrous in predictable ways, but even with the risk of that I'd rather go with this over Farmgirl and Goodwitch even if I'm feeling very cautious because the reward is so high. Theres only a ~33% chance of your opponent having Ash in their opening hand  if they're running it at 3 in a 40 card deck, so while it can be anxiety inducing statistically you're probably gonna be fine. Being able to get an untargetable 2800 atk+ beatstick guaranteed with this things effect is really really strong so the preferred search trio used to be Forerunner/Destroyer/Eclipser, but with the recent proliferation of Numeron as the most common going 2nd deck the current best trio for a turn 1 search when you have no ship, no Wicked, and no Gamma in your hand is Wicked/Forerunner/Destroyer, as if you get Eclipser against Numeron without another ship or Wicked in hand you will get otk'd.  Given that we only run each of them at 1 its not recommended to try and fetch Sliprider or Dark Lady with this unless you are going to lose the game if you don't get them now, as once theyre gone theyre gone in this deck. His 0 attack doesn't lend itself to ladder combos nearly as well as Farm Girl's 1500+search does, but being the lowest level pilot means that he will always have something to combo into if you have another Kozmo in your hand which is nice. Can be searched by E Tele, but he shouldn't be the main target unless you just need to emergency E Tele to prevent swinging for game or you're going into it after your opponents battle phase. Overall a very strong card that can open up the game for you.  Tincan tl,dr: Top tier option for turn 1, usually wanna search Forerunner/Destroyer/Eclipse  <strong><a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> x2:</strong> C is a level 2 with 500/200 that has the effect that you can send it from your hand to the graveyard during either players turn to draw 1 card every time your opponent special summons for the rest of the turn. This effect will be ashed 1000% of the time if you have luck like mine, and when it isn't its because you're playing against an Eldlich. With that crying out of the way, this card is awesome! It only requires 1 special summon from your opponent to go card neutral with this, and Upstart Goblin shows us how powerful that can be. Usually this will go much higher than that or completely end your opponents turn, and in the absolute worst case scenario it eats an Ash that would be stopping your plays. Newer players have a tendency to underestimate this card, but believe me when I say its everything its hyped up to be. Overall theres a reason that stuff like VFD and Rhongo are legal in the OCG, and that reason is because of this card's incredible power to keep combo decks in check. Can run it at 2 or 3, I run it at 2 cuz while I wanna see it in my hand I def don't want to see 2 of them in my hand, but if you're fine with that risk you can go with 3 of them and maybe swap out Goodwitch or something.  C tl,dr: Puts the fear of god in combo decks like nothing else.  <strong><a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> x2:</strong> Gamma is a level 2 tuner 1000/0 that can't be normal summoned or set, and has the effect that when your opponent activates a monster effect while you control no monsters, you can negate and destroy that and special summon Gamma and Driver to the field, and then at the end of the turn banish them. This should be Kozmo's hand trap of choice. As an enemy phase card this is straight up better than Ash, as trading the ability to hit spell/traps for the ability to negate any effect and destroy the monster while also fortifying your own board is a trade I am extremely comfortable with making. Because this deck combos vertically instead of horizontally, this card is usually better than Ash on player phase too, as our cards get themselves off the field before their effects, which means if your ship gets popped and you're banishing for a search if it gets Ashed you can continue the search with 3500 damage extra now on the board, usually enough to go for game. This card is semi Ash proof as its effect can be negated by Ash but you don't lose any resources and its not a once per turn, so you can just use it again on the next monster effect your opponent procs. Whether its better to use Gamma on enemy phase or player phase is very matchup dependent, as if theyre ending on something like Apollo then thats free advantage for you on your turn, but if theyre something like tri then popping their normal when it goes to use its link effect can be a huge momentum shift. Since this is a going 2nd deck we have the advantage of knowing the situation better than our opponent, so make sure you're really putting thought as to when best to use this given your hand, your opponents deck, and the current situation.  Overall this is an incredible card that feels like it was made for this deck (it can even be searched by E Tele!), def run it at as many copies as are legal.  Gamma tl,dr: Stop plays, get advantage, win games  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Farmgirl"">Kozmo Farmgirl</a> x3:</strong> Farmgirl is a level 3 1500/1000 that if it inflicts battle damage, you can pay 500 life points to add any Kozmo card to your hand. This was the beating heart of the last deck, and is still pretty darn awesome here. Making clear front rows for her to get a potshot in and start the comboing is always going to be the best case scenario. Her being level 3 is an absolute blessing, because that means that its eligible for E Tele, and she will usually be the best target for it in this deck. 1500 atk isn't nothing, but you're usually going to have to rely on something else to open a hole for her to proc her effect or your opponent being sloppy with their comboing and leaving something small on the table. Being able to search for ANY Kozmo card from your deck means that it can be easily tailored to fit your current situation, but the most common cards you'll go for are Dark Destroyer for its beefy attack, sometimes its monster removal and recycling effect (that Eclipser doesn't have), Sliprider for when you need a backrow card sniped, Dark Lady for when you already have a beefy ship in the hand and want to ladder, and Kozmojo for Eldlich. Now, most combos with this card are very self apparent, since there's really only so much you can do with a single fetch in this deck, but there is one slightly less obvious combo that I wanted to highlight due to its power. The prerequisites for this combo are that you have both Farmgirl and either Tincan on the field, no ship in the hand, and a way to get damage with Farmgirl (obviously). This situation can be quite easily set up by either fetching one of these (usually Tincan) with a dying ship's effect on enemy phase and then summoning the other, or just E Tele one and summon the other. After getting the damage with Farmgirl, fetch another Farmgirl and swap her in on top of Straw/Tin, and then potshot with the new Farmgirl and fetch a new ship to go on top of one of the Farmgirls. The strengths of this combo are numerous. First off, its the most damaging combo you can get off of this situation, where you get a minimum of 5100 damage (FG 1 getting over whatever it kills by 100 into making a clear board into 2nd FG 1500 into Destroyer 3000) vs 3600 without the extra step. The other very strong result is that you end turn with a Farmgirl on your field. More monsters is always good, and having potential access to her ability again next turn is always good. However there are also 2 things to be weary of with this combo, and those are that you can't activate Farmgirls swapout effect multiple times in one turn, even if there are multiple copies. and also that if you have a ship in the hand just going for a ship search is better. Double ships will be more damaging and leave you with guaranteed swaps on death, which is generally better than what Farmgirl can offer on enemy phase. She's not super amazing for turn 1 since she'll usually be off the board before she has a chance to activate her effect, but she doesn't do it particularly worse than Good Witch. If you're really ballsy and the only no trib you draw turn 1 is Farm Girl you could go for the no monster play on t1 to give her the best chance of procing her ability t3 since it absolutely is strong enough to consider, but generally thats not advised for obvious reasons, as if you're going 1st its because your opponent is probably trying to kill you turn 2. Overall a very very good card and one of the main ways you will start combos with this deck.  Farmgirl tl,dr: Make an opening for her and she will lead you to victory  <strong><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> x1:</strong> Ash is a level 3 0/1800 tuner that you can discard to stop a card effect that would add to hand from deck, special summon from deck, or send a card from the deck to the graveyard. This card does not have the standard upgrade effect of the other pilots in this deck and can't be fetched by E Tele. Im running this card at 1 because Im running Gamma at 2, and I find 3 hand trap stoppers generally works fine. One of the best cards in the game and one of player 2's best defenses against the unchecked tyranny of player 1.  Ash tl,dr: It stops plays from your hand  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Goodwitch"">Kozmo Goodwitch</a> x1:</strong> Goodwitch is a level 4 1800/1000 that you can pay 500 lp to change one face up monster your opponent controls to face down defense. In theory Goodwitch's effect should be pretty good. Being able to interupt a continuous monster effect that may be giving you problems or get over a beatstick with bad defenses obviously give it usecases, but in practice its pretty rare that I want this instead of either of my other 3 not tribs. A lot of things that have continuous effects that you'd like to interupt can't be targeted or have negates, and the beefy beatsticks usually either also cant be targeted or have good enough defenses that it wouldn't help a lot in the first place to swap them. This would obviously be much stronger as a quick effect, but it isnt, so theres no use complaining. Can't be fetched by E Tele (nothing from here on can), but you almost never would even if you could. The 1800 atk is nice enough so you can get over stuff if your opponent bricked or smth, but its not really doing much otherwise. Its best argument for its existence is to make the ladder combo otk sliiiiightly more consistent, since it and Wickedwitch are interchangeable for it. Its the worst no trib Kozmo I run which is why its at 1, but this deck has a lot of stuff that clear front rows so 1800 damage into tag out is pretty alright even if its effect isnt super great.  Goodwitch tl,dr: Effect is mid, but 1800 atk from a level 4 is nothing to scoff at ig.  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmoll Wickedwitch"">Kozmoll Wickedwitch</a> x3:</strong> Wickedwitch is a level 4 1900/300 that you can pay 1000 lp during either players turn to make it so this card cant be destroyed by battle or card effects for the rest of the turn. I really like this card. Its the deck's 2nd best turn 1 no trib behind Tincan because its effect will almost guarantee it lives to see turn 2 while dampening whatever damage you'd take by 1900 per attack, which isn't an insignificant amount at all. Even beyond turn 1 it provides good damage and can get over some stuff. When a ship dies on enemy phase youre gonna wanna go into this in defense mode if they have other big beaters, as guaranteeing a board and no more damage beyond the 1000 is really really good. Its effect isn't super team focused or synergistic, but who can say no to a good old fashioned lv 4 beat stick in a deck about beatsticking your opponent to death. You CANNOT use this things effect to tank its way through Kaiju Slumber if there are no other monsters that can be destroyed on the field, as slumber needs at least 1 destruction to proc its floating effect. I think common consensus on this monster is generally mixed to negative, but I love it a lot and am never annoyed when it shows up in my hand.  Wickedwitch tl,dr: Use its effect to tank stuff and make sure your front row is never empty, strong as a turn 1 play  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Sliprider"">Kozmo Sliprider</a> x1:</strong> Sliprider is a level 5 2300/800 that can destroy 1 spell/trap when it's summoned, and has the first of our ship abilities where when it is destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect it can banish itself to summon a lower leveled Kozmo from the deck. Sliprider is pretty good and has a clear usecase: there is an annoying backrow card and you want to get rid of it or you want to preemptively get rid of one. This deck is kinda light on backrow removal so this serves a valuable niche. Its also supremely summonable, being able to be fetched by all the ships (outside Eclipse) and summoned by all the pilots (outside Dark Lady), and if you're in a situation where your effects are being limited it only requires 1 tribute as disgusting as that is to even consider in this deck. The tradeoff for its summonability is that its comboability is gerneally weaker than most other stuff in the deck, but even w that said compared to a lot of stuff outside of the deck fetching a free level 4 or lower on death is very comboable. On its destruction effect for both player phase and enemy phase Wickedwitch is generally going to be your best bet due to its beefiness and survivability, but as always context is king so don't treat that as a hard rule and the other no tribs also all have situations where they should be fetched instead. 2300 atk is nice if you need to attack with this, but generally this card isn't gonna be used for laddering since its the weakest of the 3 ships in this deck by a good margin. This is a good card with common usecases, but there are other cards in the deck that can do the same thing  so its best to keep this at 1 and go into it via search when its really needed.  Sliprider tl,dr: Backrow removal that goes into other stuff on death  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmoll Dark Lady"">Kozmoll Dark Lady</a> x1:</strong> Dark Lady is a level 5 2200/1800 that as a quick effect once per turn you can pay 1000 lifepoints to negate the activation of a monster's effect and destroy that monster. Despite being level 5, Dark Lady has the pilot's banish effect rather than the ships. This card is generally pretty niche in its uses, but its very strong in its niches. By default it being level 5 makes it less flexible, but it has the same high amount of summonability as Sliprider so it gets around that quite nicely. Its effect is pretty darn good, obviously being able to neg anything active without a protection effect is very strong, but the problem with this is that most of the effects that give this deck problems are either effect negaters, which are usually either passive or on cards bigger than this. This card has to be used as a an predictive play rather than a reactionary play, because if something that negates effects is going to happen it will be able to negate the pilot's effects that would bring this out, but a 2200 with no protection vs backrow effects doesn't have the greatest shelf life. Despite this bellyaching the effect is still very good, but the main draw for this card to me is as the biggest pilot in a ladder combo. Level 5 is a bit of an awkward level to be searching up or down in this deck, but I do think searching up is better for it as it can combo into your untargetable bosses and off itself as the situation demands. As I said before a full ladder of farm-lv 4-lady-destroyer will kill from full, and the shorter farm-lady-bigship combo is incredibly easy and deals a fat 6500 minimum. I only run this at 1 because its easier for this to become a bit of a brick than most other monsters in this deck, but being the difference between a ladder killing from full vs not is worth making a spot for still. If I were making cuts I would look elsewhere first.  Dark Lady tl,dr: Good for ladder combos and interrupting combos  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Forerunner"">Kozmo Forerunner</a> x2:</strong> Forerunner is a level 7 2800/1400 that is untargetable by opponents card effects and heals you 1000 lp during your standby phase. This card has the ship banish effect. This is the first of the boss monsters, and as such its usecase of ""I want a fat unmovable beatstick"" is pretty apparent. Can (and often will) be comboed into by Dark Destroyer's death effect which makes getting it out plenty easy. 2800 atk is good, but when the current most common bosses all match or exceed that on atk or def its not gonna be super useful a lot of the time. The 1000 lp healing is really not super useful unless you're in a crazy stalemate, the lp costs in this deck are very low and almost never come into play. On death I usually go into Dark Lady or Wickedwitch depending on whether it died on player phase or enemy phase. Honestly not a super complicated card, what you see is what you get. I've really been kinda digging into it here, but don't let that fool you into thinking that its not good, because it is. Its an essential part of the deck as a finisher for ladders, as a nearly omni searcher on death, and as a search target for Tincan. It just has the problem of being compared to the best card in the deck directly above it.  Forerunner tl,dr: Untargetable beatstick that can go into other stuff on death  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Dark Destroyer"">Kozmo Dark Destroyer</a> x3:</strong> Dark Destroyer is a level 8 3000/1800 that is untargetable by opponents card effects and can optionally target and destroy 1 monster on entry. This has the ship banish effect. This is the Big Boss of the deck, and is usually what you are going to try and go into. Beyond just being an untargetable 3000 beatstick, its on entry effect makes it one of the most versatile cards in the deck. You can pull interesting plays such as bringing it in during the battle phase and proccing its effect on a teammate ship that already attacked to get more damage out of the new monster summoned by the ships banish effect, you can proc its effect on itself and search out Sliprider if you really need a backrow card gone right now, or you could even destroy an opponents monster with it! Dark Destroyer also has the best banish effect of any monster in this deck, giving you the monster of your choice for free. I usually go with Forerunner since that has very similar board presence, but hopefully these writeups will have given you the situations where all the other cards would be useful so you don't just autopilot into Forerunner no matter the situation.  This ability doesn't just work on other monsters, but it can also proc on itself. ""But Schwa, why would you want to get rid of your own best monster?"" you may ask. And the answer to that is ""For sick plays."" There are two major scenarios where this can be great, beyond the obvious ""I need a backrow popped so lemme go into sliprider rq"".  The first doesn't really pop up in this deck since Strawman was dropped, but if you summon Dark Destroyer, pop itself, and go into Strawman which then revives Dark Destroyer. It's not a super crazy combo, but its free attack and free advantage, so if you're running Strawman keep that one in mind. The other one is much, much stronger. Say you're going second and open Raigeki, Driver, Goodwitch, Forerunner, and Dark Destroyer. A pretty meh hand right? Your first reaction might be to just go into Goodwitch and then straight shot into DD for 4800, but thats actually completely unnecessary, as if your Raigeki goes off you have a clear path to game. What you would do in this situation is start with Goodwitch and attack as usual, then go into Dark Destroyer as usual, but pop itself and then go into Farmgirl. From there you do the typical ladder combo. As long as you have a level 4, Dark Destroyer, and either a big ship or Dark Lady in your opening hand you can do the full combo. 3000 atk is usually enough to get the job done over most stuff, but if it isnt then thats why we have our xyz's. Endgame often results in multiple of these on the board, which is why the only xyz's I specifically looked for and that arent just ed filler are rank 8's. Zombiestein get you over basically everything with its 4500 atk and Teardrop's effect circumvents ""Cant be destroyed"" effects, but these cards also lose Destroyer's protection effect and you also lose Destroyer's banish effect so don't just go into those willy nilly. Overall this is your Big Boss monster, its incredibly easy to put out on the field, and its incredible effects make it incredibly versatile. If you're not running this at 3 its either because this got semi-limited again or because you're throwing.  Destroyer tl,dr: Your endgoal. Increidbly versatile untargetable beatstick that goes into basically anything else on death. Should prolly read this one imo.  <strong><a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a> x2:</strong> Turtle is a level 8 2200/3000 that you can tribute 1 monster on your opponent's side of the field to special summon it to their side, or if your opponent has a kaiju on their side of the field you can special summon it to your side for free. Up until this point, the cards in my deck have been identical to those in 이주호's, but this is the first deviation, as they have Radian (level 7 2800/2500) instead, so instead of explaining why tributing one of your opponents heavily fortified monsters for a monster that many of the cards in this deck can beat over and also has no effect or protection is good, I'll look at the pros and cons of each kaiju chosen by us. First off is Radian. Radian has 2 main pros going for it: its cost and its attack. Its cost is the more obvious and straightforward one, Radian is an R while Gameciel is an SR, which means it is exponentially easier to acquire. The other one requires a little bit of explaining, as generally lower kaiju attacks are better. However, 2800 also matches Forerunner's attack exactly, and this deck LOVES trades since we get to swap out into anything we want on death and they dont, meaning you could trade with Forerunner, go into Farmgirl, and potentially ladder for game from there, or go into sliprider and get rid of an extremely annoying spell/trap, or go into wickedwitch for some quick extra damage and prepare to turtle (heh) for next turn. The possibilities are endless. Now for the pros of Gameciel, which are level and attack. Level is the big reason why I chose it over Radian (or more specifically chose Gadarla, since I was gonna run Gameciel regardless), as the big boss of this deck is Dark Destroyer, which happens to be level 8. 이주호 didn't really do much with their extra deck, mainly stacking it with low rarity monsters and what I can only assume are solid enough random pulls that didnt get dusted, but since I also made a few decks that focus more on the extra deck I had some crazy strong boss monsters to make it worth investing a bit more in, specifically Teardrop and Zeus. If you give your opponent any Kaiju thats 1 monster down from their side, then you can go into DD and pop another, and then you can bring out a level 8 kaiju to your side and then go into Teardrop and tribute yet another monster from their side, and then attack over or directly and go into Zeus. That is an incredibly strong combo that results in a boss monster stronger than anything we have in our maindeck by miles, and something that may not be possible if you're running 2 copies of the level 7 Radian. The other reason is the same as Radian's, a good attack value for this deck. In 이주호's deck there are only 4 monsters who can beat over Radian cleanly, being the 3 copies of DD and Jizukiru, while in this deck we have 10 different cards that can beat over Gameciel and 1 other who can tie. This means even if our only ship in hand is Sliprider we can still beat over it, which is huge. Overall you should investigate all potential Kaiju's and come up with ones that you think will work best for you  <strong><a data-name=""Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju"">Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju</a> x2:</strong> Gadarla is a level 8 2700/1600 with the kaiju effect. This was also selected because of it's level and convenient attack for the deck, since at level 8 it can go into Teardrop w DD while also being beaten over by all our boss monsters. You can also beat over it with Goodwitch if you proc its effect first, which can be useful. Gadarla also fits as a nice inbetween, where its smaller than Thunder King and bigger than Gameciel so if you draw 2 Kaiju you can act accordingly. Not really much to say about Gadarla, since everything I said about Gameciel is also pretty applicable here as well.  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Dark Eclipse"">Kozmo Dark Eclipse</a> x1:</strong> Dark Eclipse is a level 9 3000/2600 that is untargetable by opponents card effects, and during either players turn you can banish 1 Kozmo monster from your graveyard to negate and destroy a trap card activation. This has a unique banish effect, where when its destroyed you can add a lower leveled Kozmo to your hand instead of special summoning it like the other ships. Ok so first off, its active effect sounds good! It isn't. You will very rarely have a Kozmo sitting in your graveyard since their effects are all activated by banishing themselves, and passing up opportunities to keep the tempo up just to have fodder for this generally isn't worth it. Its harder to get on the field than basically anything else in the deck, only having the no tribs as its entryway. Its banish effect is also pretty bad compared to everything else, since I don't have to tell you why just adding to hand is worse than special summoning here. Obviously being able to turn this into a free Dark Destroyer might be a bit much, but as is its not very good. Maybe they could have made it search upwards instead of downwards so you could have got a free Dark Planet off of it and that could have made Dark Planet not so awful, but I'm getting into hypotheticals when I should be sticking to the here and now. Anyways, if its active effect sucks, its banish effect sucks, and its comparatively hard to get on the field, whats even the point of this being in the deck? Well, for one its still a 3000 atk untargetable beatstick that can be swapped into by any no trib in the deck, which is pretty darn good, if not already covered by multiple other cards in this deck. The other, more interesting case to be made for it is in its interaction with Kozmo Tincan. As you will recall, Tincans effect lets you pick 3 Kozmo cards with different names from you deck and your opponent randomly chooses one of those for you to add to your hand, with the others getting discarded. Generally you will want to try and use this effect to bring out one of your untargetable boss monsters, but without Eclipse you only have 2 of those, making it a 33% chance you get stuck with Sliprider or Dark Lady or Kozmotown or whatever you chose as your third. Add on top the risk of just getting Ashed and you're not looking at a super incredible success rate. However, WITH Eclipse in the deck you have an 100% success rate in being given a boss monster, which is huge for consistency's sake. Even better for Eclipse, you will recall that these non-picked cards are sent to the graveyard, fixing its problem of very rarely having fodder with which to use for its effect. This effect moves those other boss monsters from the generally inaccessible graveyard to the much more easy to retrieve banish zone, making this a win win win situation. However, as I explained in Tincan's section the recent rise of Numeron makes going for Eclipse a bad idea in the current meta. So why not drop it? Because while this isn't the best card in the world, VFD might very well be, and we have it in this deck with a pretty easy time bringing it out because of this. If you have E Tele/Farmgirl in hand and Kaiju Slumber you can wipe your opponents board, give yourself Thunder King and them whatever, beat over their Kaiju and then potshot w Farm and call Eclipse, attack directly with that, and then in mainphase 2 you go into the very funnest of dragons. 5600 damage done and the True King Of All Calamities, if your opponent doesn't have removal in hand right then and there they might as well scoop. There are other combos into it too, but thats probably the most likely one, so I won't make this any longer than it needs to be. Overall, obviously I do have my issues with Eclipse, but its interaction with Tincan and its board presence make it worth running at 1 just for the added consistency it brings there, and True King Of All Calamities makes anything worth running if it can be brought out easy enough.  Eclipse tl,dr: Good off of tincan and an untargetable beatstick, plus True King material.  <strong><a data-name=""Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju"">Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju</a> x1:</strong> Thunder King is a level 9 3300/2100 with kaiju effect. 이주호 went with Jizukiru because of its interaction with Limiter Removal which I dont run, I'm running Thunder King because of its interaction with Dark Eclipse and True King Of All Calamities which they don't run, so choose whichever one works better for what you're running. For what its worth I think mine is more consistent cuz Eclipse is searchable while Limiter isnt. They're tied for the biggest kaiju so they're often gonna be what you plop onto your side of the field with Slumber if you're just looking for damage, and Thunder King over Gameciel goes for 1100 which is enough to get a kill if you do it alongside level 4 into Dark Lady into DD/DE or Wicked into Dark Lady into bigship. Its a bit spooky using this as a pure kaiju, since we have nothing in the maindeck which gets over it, but we do have a good number of monster removal options so as long as you come prepared you can use it in that way as well.  <strong>SPELLS</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> x1:</strong> Raigeki is a normal spell that destroys all monsters your opponent controls. Non targeting monster removal is always good and making a clear front row for Farmgirl to start comboing off of is always good. 이주호 runs Dark Hole here, which I get it we like to have our cards destroyed, but that can't be activated during the battle phase which is generally when we want that to happen, so its kinda pointless. Raigeki is also given out for free, so I think its definitely the better card for us. Overall this is a generic staple for a reason, and it fits in well here.  <strong><a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> x2:</strong> This card lets you destroy all attack position monsters your opponent controls or all trap and spells your opponent controls, but only if you control no face up cards. This is basically Raigeki and Harpies in one. Obvs v v good. We don't have any continuous traps or spells here, so if we get our front row wiped at any time this is good to go. If you decide to run Kozmotown for this deck I would swap out this for Twin Twisters or something else, since Kozmotown will block this from going off and obviously if your entire frontrow is gone past turn 2 you need to be able to resolve this. I've been thinking about maybe dropping this to 1 for another Ash or maybe even a Sliprider, but its up to you how you want to go about this.  <strong><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> x1:</strong> Feather Duster is a normal spell that destroys all spell and traps that your opponent controls. Destroying or forcing premature activations of spells and traps is always good, and being able to attack with a clear heart and mind is reason enough for this to be in the deck. Overall another generic staple that helped patch up a bit of a weak spot with this deck.  <strong><a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a> x2:</strong> Emergency Teleport (or E Tele as I've been calling it) is a quickplay spell card that special summons one level 3 or lower Psychic monster from your hand or deck and banishes it during this turn's end phase. This card is nuts, like actually insane. 95% of the time we get a level 3 or lower Psychic on the field it's going to be banished before the end of the turn anyways, so this is just a free either turn pilot to either shore up your defenses on enemy phase or lead to huge combos on player phase. Offensively the obvious play out of this card is Farmgirl on player phase into ladder combo, which is made much easier because you still have your normal summon for the turn which can then turn itself into a ship to blast a hole in the enemy front row, and from there just go to town. As for Tincan you do get the search effect, but the timing in this game is made so that it asks you whether you want to activate its banish effect before it asks you whether you want its search effect, and I don't know if that always like that or if its only like that if you already have another Kozmo in your hand, but you can't change the timing on these so you will always be left with an empty board and whatever you searched. Defensively you should avoid using this if at all possible, since its offensive potential is just so much bigger, but if theyre swinging for game or are doing something you can put a stop to by bringing out a pilot then there no getting around it I guess. The two things to be aware of with this card is that all the pilot effects are once per turn tied to the card name, so if you swap out one Farm Girl for a ship then you won't be able to do so with your other Farm Girl that you may have summoned with this, and also that with multiples of the same monster on the field it can become easy to lose track of which one you summoned with this card. I suggest putting the searched one in the far left monster zone or something. Overall this card is insane and you should run as many copies of it as are legal in the current format.  E Tele tl,dr: Go into Farmgirl and go nuts  <strong><a data-name=""Interrupted Kaiju Slumber"">Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</a> x3:</strong> This hard once per turn card lets you destroy every card on the field, and then if you destroyed at least 1 monster you can summon a kaiju of your choice to each side of the field. Then during your next main phase you can banish this card from the graveyard to add 1 kaiju of your choice to your hand. Ok so first things first: I find it hilarious that they clean powercrept Dark Hole after that card was so nuts for so long. Secondly: this card can be Ashed. Yes that really really sucks. If you have another way to try and bait Ash out first like PoE or E Tele its usually gonna be worth going for, since a total board wipe is really strong. Thirdly: do not just blindly default to Thunder King/Gameciel as your 2 kaijus, since as I explained in the kaiju sections Gadarla has uses for itself as well. Consider your matchup, your hand, and your resources before chosing between Thunder King and Gadarla.  Slumber tl,dr: Use your brain and pick your kaiju's  <strong><a data-name=""Pot Of Extravagance"">Pot Of Extravagance</a> x3:</strong> Pot of Extravagance is a normal spell card that at the beginning of your main phase 1, you can randomly banish 3 or 6 cards from your extra deck in order to draw 1 or 2 cards respectively, and you can't use any other draw effects the turn this card is used. In this deck the extra deck is a luxury, not a need. Yes it does suck losing 40% of our extra deck every time we want to use this, but for every time where I'm like ""Man I am going to lose if I don't get Zeus and I currently have the resources to do so"" there are dozens of times where I'm like ""Man I just need a kaiju and a pilot rn"". Pot of Prosperity is another potential option, but halving our damage for the turn usually hurts a lot and makes it entirely a comeback card or a main phase 2 card, so I like the +1 and no other real restrictions of PoE more.  PoE tl,dr: Suck it up your extra deck will be fine  <strong>TRAP</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmojo"">Kozmojo</a> x2:</strong> Kozmojo is a normal trap card that banishes one card your opponent controls or from the gy at the cost of destroying one of your Kozmo monsters. This is a really good card, as evidenced by being the only trap card in the entire deck. Non targeting banishment tends to just be a pretty decent trait for a card to have. The main purpose of this card is to make the Eldlich mu slightly more bearable for us, as this is all that we have to put down the golden asshole for good and it even hits him through his invincible phase. Beyond that though its really good in a lot of different places, since like I said non targeting banishment is a good trait for a card to have, and in addition to that its cost is usually more of another plus. Being able to pop ships on demand is incredible and lets you otk soooo much easier, to the point where even if it was just the self destruct effect I'd have to consider using it (not on a trap though, a quickplay spell might be worth it). Just like with Slumber you can't gimmick this's cost with Wickedwitch's ability, it needs to actually kill them to proc the banishment. Overall a card that gives you mobility off of ships and makes one of you hardest matchup easier is a card worth playing.  Kozmojo tl,dr: Use this to give yourself mobility out of ships that have already cleared their activation effect, and as a bonus you get a free removal.  <strong>EXTRA DECK</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Crimson Blader"">Crimson Blader</a> x1:</strong> Crimson Blader is a level 8 synchro with 2800/2600, where if it destroys and sends to the graveyard an opponents monster then your opponent can't normal or special summon monsters level 5 or above. This sounds like a great effect, but you have to consider our current meta. The majority of top decks don't rely very heavily on level 5 pluses, and instead go into ranks or links. The stuff that does run big stuff like Eldlich cant be got over by this, and with Eld the only monster you can Gamma just means they probably have no monster on the field so this card's effect is useless. With all that being said, our extra deck is supposed to be a toolbox filled with stuff that can be good in niche situations. We don't rely on it heavily at all, so a card like this that isn't going to be used a lot is fine because when it is used it could be game winning. Overall this is a very niche card, so don't be scared to replace it with something else niche that you like. Its only really here for me cuz I pulled it in a legacy pack.  Blader tl,dr: There has to be a good deck that ends on high level sub 2800 atk monsters right?  <strong><a data-name=""Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend"">Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</a> x1:</strong> Scarlight RDA is a level 8 synchro with 3000/2500 that can once per turn destroy as many special summoned effect monsters as possible with equal or less attack to this card (other than this card) and inflict 500 damage to your opponent for each. This card is pretty good and is going to usually be your default resting place for Gamma and Driver. It has a good statline, can non target gib most of the most common bosses in the game rn other than Ultimate Conductor, Thunder Dragon Titan, and Chaos Max, and its destruction effect can be great for us even if its not usable during the battle phase where it would be most useful. If its effect goes off with no hitches, even if only 1 monster gets gibbed you still kill from full with this and a Farm into DD combo, which can be set up incredibly easy if you normal pilot into ship before you proc its effect. Overall if you're just going to make 1 level 8 Synchro for this deck it should probably be this one, Borreload Savage not withstanding.  Scarlight tl,dr: Your default resting place, usually gonna be able to nuke everything into some nice damage for us.  <strong><a data-name=""Cyber Slash Harpie Lady"">Cyber Slash Harpie Lady</a> x1:</strong> Cyber Slash is a level 8 2600/1400 that as a hard once per turn quick effect, whenever your opponent activates a spell or trap you can target one monster on your opponents side of the field and return it to the hand. Another nice niche card. Usually you would like a bit more attack on smth like this, cuz generally the time your opponent is gonna use traps or spells is either when they don't have much on the field (which would be exacerbated by the fact that they recently went -1 cuz of Gamma) so you're unlikely to have a great target, or during the damage step where this card can't even react. Theres also plenty of decks that just don't really use many spells or traps to begin with. But all that said non destruction removal is really good, and it being a quick effect is even better. You're just gonna have to find and recognize decks that this would work well against on your own, as I haven't ran into any really. Overall a very niche card thats only really here cuz I pulled it. Another tool in the toolbox that could be swapped out for something else you like better.  Cyber Slash tl,dr: Idk what kinda deck this would even be good against  <strong><a data-name=""Number 82: Heartlandraco"">Number 82: Heartlandraco</a> x1:</strong> Draco is a generic rank 4 2000/1500 that when you control a face up spell can't be targeted for attacks (useless for us) and can remove 1 material to attack directly (very useful for us). This card is somehow only an N rarity, which means you can craft it for completely free. As you may know,  Zeus can summon itself on top of an XYZ if an XYZ battled this turn, and this card can GUARENTEE that you both did battle with an XYZ and have one on the field after the battle phase to proc its effect. We don't run a whole ton of level 4's, just 4 of them, but due to Wickedwitch's staying power its not super impossible to wind up with 2 of them on the board, and if you cant immediately swing for game and have a path to Zeus you should almost always take it. This card isn't super complicated and exists only as an easy way into Zeus, but an easy way into Zeus that is also somehow a N rarity is one of the most valuable things this deck can use. Def keep this specific card in.  Draco tl,dr: Go into Zeus baby  <strong><a data-name=""Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk"">Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk</a> x1:</strong> Number 80 is a generic rank 4 2 material 0/1200 that can attatch itself to a different XYZ for them to gain 1200 atk, and can twice per turn detach 1 material from itself to banish 1 card from your opponents graveyard. This is mostly here as an anti Eldlich card, since Zeus isn't super great in that mu. Being able to banish 2 cards from your opponents graveyard is really good against a lot of decks, but its almost certainly gonna die next turn. You can TECHNICALLY go into Zeus with this if you make a clear board or rub up against a 0/0 but good luck with that. Overall another niche card but its good in its niche, and since the whole point of this extra deck is to be a toolbox rather than a focus that as good as you can hope for.  Number 80 tl,dr: Use this against Eldlich, might have some even more niche uses elsewhere  <strong><a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a> x1:</strong> VFD is a generic rank 9 2 material 3000/3000 that can as a quick effect detach 1 material from itself and declare 1 attribue, for the rest of the turn opponents monsters of the declared attribute cannot use their effects or attack. This is one of the best one way floodgates in the game, and its attached to a 3000/3000 beater made from 2 searchable monsters in this deck. Fun fact, thats good. Really good. Unless you are playing against Eldlich this card is going to win you the duel 9 times out of 10 with the 1 true out being an opponents Kaiju or Droplet, since basically everything else can be reacted to with the stop doing stuff effect. This card's summoning requirement is normal unlike Zeus' so you can and should attack with the 3300 and 3000 beatsticks that make up this before summoning it in mainphase 2 unless you're that scared of one of them getting popped, which fair enough. You should usually summon this in defense, as its usually gonna be mainphase 2 and you also don't want to risk taking a Lightning Storm to the face. Overall a nutso card, and honestly great enough that a very good argument could be made to adjust your ratios of Eclipse and Thunder King to more efficiently bring it out.  VFD tl,dr: Floodgate your opponent and win  <strong><a data-name=""Number 22: Zombiestein"">Number 22: Zombiestein</a> x1:</strong> Zombieman is a 4500/1000 rank 8 xyz that needs 2 level 8 dark's to summon that can negate effects of monsters for 1 turn at the cost of 1 material, 1 discard, and changing this to defense position. This should be used to get over uberbeatsticks with immunity to being popped such as Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon. This obviously seems pretty tricky to get out while theres something like that out, but with E Tele and some luck anything is possible. This is another path into Zeus, and since this has no protection other than being really really big you should probably take that opportunity when its afforded to you.  Zombieman tl,dr: Use this to get over the biggest of the big  <strong><a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop the Rikka Queen</a> x1:</strong> Teardrop is a generic rank 8 2800/2800 with the effect that you can detach 1 material from and then target 1 monster on the field to tribute, and it gains 200 atk until the end of the turn for every tributed card. This thing's primary usecase is to deal with very annoying can't be destroyed by effects that are a bit too big atk wise to go over with Destroyer like the empowered Eldlich's, but as a generic rank 8 its also going to be your main path to Zeus.  Teardrop tl,dr: Use this to get rid of the sticky week old gum that just wont go away. Usually a free Zeus too.  <strong><a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a> x1:</strong> Zeus is a 3000/3000 rank 12 XYZ that can special summon itself on top of an XYZ that has attacked this turn, and has the quick effect to detach 2 materials and send everything else on the field to the graveyard and the effect to add a material to itself from hand/deck/gy if another card of yours is destroyed via battle and card effect. Holy crap is this card nuts. Non targeting, non destruction OMNI-REMOVAL as a quick effect is something I would have made up as a kid when I'm trying to bs my brother with my random Japanese card, and even then there's no way he'd buy that as its just too strong. If you can go into this you should unless you can attack for game immediately. The biggest issue with this card in this deck is that its only going to ever realistically have 2 materials, so its omni is only a one time, and at 3000 atk thats good but generally not going to be able to swing for game unless you got some other Kozmos in your hand. You should always summon this in defense, since its hard locked to mp2 and omni wiping while in attack is just begging to get Lightning Stormed. Overall this card is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.  Zeus tl,dr: Your opponent is in the corner now staring down a 3k beatstick with no field.  <strong><a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> x1:</strong> Linguini is a link 1 300 atk that requires 1 level 4 or lower cyberse as material, and has the quick effect of being able to tribute itself to negate and destroy an activated trap card. If you look closely at our deck, you will notice 1 slight problem with this card: its completely unsummonable. Not a single Cyberse with any level is in our deck, much less one level 4 or lower. So why is this card here then? Because Knightmare Corruptor Iblee exists. Its not super common, to the point where I've never even encountered one on the ladder, but it exists and as a card that prevents special summoning other than Links its obviously a card we don't want at all on our side of the field. Since we have the space in our extra deck we may as well stick in the one card that can get rid of it for free, and its quick effect is pretty good too for something that we get for free. Leaving a 300 atk monster on the field is pretty scary, especially against the Code Talker decks that run this card, but we're pretty reliant on our normal summon and given our vertical combo style it's usually unfortunately going to have to stay unless we also drew Kaiju Slumber. Overall an incredibly niche card and one I would like to not have to play, but auto losing vs Code Talker wouldn't be very fun either so its here to stay. You can replace this with Link Devotee which does basically the same thing at N rarity instead of SR, but its effect is useless so I just went with the better version.  Linguini tl,dr: Get owned Code Talker, you top meta threat you  <strong><a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> x1:</strong> Phoenix is a link 2 that requires 2 monsters with different names with 1900 attack with the hard once per turn effect that if its Link Summoned you can discard 1 card to target and destroy 1 enemy backrow then if this was co-linked when this effect was activated you can draw 1 card, and also co-linked monsters you control cannot be destroyed by battle. Another toolbox piece that I still have never once used, but its an option if your really need backrow removal asap. It being super generic is great cuz we can just go into it with basically whatever, but it won't likely stick around once it comes out. A replaceable card if you find another rank 8 you really like or something else that you just thinks provides more value.  Phoenix tl,dr: Pop a backrow bro  <strong><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> x1:</strong> Unicorn is a link 3 requiring 2+ monsters with different names and has 2200 attack, with the hard opt effect of if this card is Link Summoned you can discard 1 card to target 1 card on the field to shuffle back into the deck and then if this was co-linked when this effect was activated you can draw 1 card. While any co-linked ""Knightmare"" monsters are on the field, for your normal draw in your Draw Phase, draw 1 card for each different card name among those co-linked ""Knightmare"" monsters, instead of drawing just 1 card. Another toolbox-y card, but generally you're only going to be able to go into this if Gamma resolved, as getting 3 different cards on the field for us outside of that is generally really hard to the point where if the situation has gifted us that then we're also very unlikely to even need this things effect over whatever else we want do with our cards. Overall the vast majority of the time even if you do want to go into our other rank 3, but thats ok because the rare occasions where you can go into this and are able to are what a toolbox is all about.  Unicorn tl:dr: For when Gamma procs and you need something removed non destruction style  <strong><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> x1:</strong> Ip is a link 2 requiring 2 non link monsters and has 800 attack, with the effect that you can link summon with this card during your opponents main phase and also card that are link summoned w this cant be destroyed by opponents card effects. Usually gonna be made from Gamma + Driver and go into Borrelsword or Master Tenyi to make invincible dudes. Its important to remember that these monsters are only immune to destruction from your opponents card effects, and they will be gibbed if you proc Kaiju Slumber. You should always go into this before you link summon anything link 3 or higher, since we're 99.999% of the time only going to do 1 link summon of a link 3 or higher in the duel and the free protection is just added bonus while IP hereself doesn't make any of our high links harder to summon. If you could summon them without IP, you can also summon them with IP as one of the materials. Overall just a card that you use as a stop along the way to make a slightly more invincible monster.  Ip tl,dr: Go into this before you go into a link 3+  <strong><a data-name=""Draco Masters of the Tenyi"">Draco Masters of the Tenyi</a> x1:</strong> Draco is a link 3 that requires 2+ monsters including a link, and has 2600 atk. It cant be destroyed by battle with an effect monster (so basically invincible vs everything but Blue Eyes), and has the hard opt effect of being able to non target destroy opponents monsters up to the number of normal monsters you control + in your grave (so generally 1 cuz of Driver) if you don't control another effect monster. Along with Scarlight, this is going to be one of your most common ending spots for a Gamma+Driver that proced on player phase. Compared to Scarlight this requires a bit more resources to get out, as it'll also eat your normal summon for the turn, but in exchange for that you will get a card immune to backrow destruction and basically immune to frontrow destruction and also has non targeting destruction which is really nice. This card can be used to stall and disrupt very well vs a number of decks, but vs some of the top meta decks it runs into some issues like not being immune to Shurag's banishment and being smaller than and not able to circumvent Empowered Eld's destruction immunity, but even with those issues it creates a stalemate vs Drytron if it sees the field, usually beats over Apollo, circumvents Simorgh, and can outlast Borreload Savage. A really good card that is one of the most practical things we can go into given our limited swam ability.  Draco tl,dr: Our 2nd budget crooked cook, this time with actual field presence  <strong><a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> x1:</strong> Borrelsword is a link 4 that requires 3+ monsters with different names and has 3000 attack. It cannot be destroyed by battle, and has the once per turn quick effect that cant be responded to of you can target 1 Attack Position monster and change it to Defense Position and this card can make a second attack during each Battle Phase this turn. It also has the other once per turn effect of when this card declares an attack on a face-up monster: you can activate its effect to until the end of this turn gain ATK equal to half that monster's current ATK, and if it does, that monster's current ATK is halved. If we had an actual good way to turbo this card out onto the field we would probably win the Eldlich mu. This card is nuts, absolutely broken, and only gets infinitely stronger when its summoned with IP (which it always will be in this deck). The super relevant monsters it has a bad mu against off the top of my head are Shurag which can banish it on entry, Zeus which can send it to the graveyard, Draco Future which can neg and steal, and Kaiju which are a bad mu vs basically everything. Everything else it will beat over immediately or outlast, even obscenely broken cards like VFD or Rhongo. Its not THAT incredibly hard to get this out, as a player phase gamma, normal summon and either double kaiju or e tele gets it out, but its still pretty rough especially when you're going up against the problem mus that need it in the first place. If you can think of a good and easy way to get this out that wouldn't gut this deck then I say go for it! Let me know what you think up so I can steal it because this card is absolutely up there with VFD and Zeus as the best cards in this extra deck.  Borrelsword tl,dr: This legendary dragon is a powerful engine of destruction. Virtually invincible, very few have faced this awesome creature and lived to tell the tale."

Either go into kagari, then get hornet drones back and use it again to go into any of the knightmares or cross-sheep/reprodocus. If you have a dragonmaid along with engage/hornet drones then that's a plus  otherwise the worst you can draw is no dragonmaid monster  Ideally end board is Hieratic + anything to further card advantage on your first turn, endgame board is Sheou/House with a bunch of dragonmaids lined up to tag out into their dragon forms or be used for fusion summons/link plays  reprodocus is only there to make valid super poly targets"

Look, if only Yosenjus bestow you an Extra Normal Summon in general and not just exclusive to the Yosenjus, I would most definitely splash Invoked in this deck. Alright let's get into the list, also I will do my best to keep the cards in the main as F2P friendly as possible, because that's the point of this list. As per usual, the side deck will be filled with cards that you might want to consider but are not necessarily mandatory for the build.</span>  <strong><span>The Main Deck, and their respective alternative options, if any:</span></strong>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju"">Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju</a></strong> - <span>These are the reasons you want to go 2nd. You slap this thing on top of a problematic monster, you Normal Summon 3-4 Yosenju monsters, you bounce them back with Yosenju Kama 1, you slap this thing again on top of another monster, and if you have another Yosenju Kama 1, bounce it once again since its effect is not a hard once per turn. The alternatives or complementary cards you can have for these two are either <a data-name=""Alpha, the Master of Beasts"">Alpha, the Master of Beasts</a> or <a data-name=""Santa Claws"">Santa Claws</a>. <a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a> would be a better alternative for Jizukiru if you have it instead.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Yosenju Kama 1"">Yosenju Kama 1</a>, <a data-name=""Yosenju Kama 2"">Yosenju Kama 2</a>, and <a data-name=""Yosenju Kama 3"">Yosenju Kama 3</a></strong> - <span>The stars of the show, the namesake of this list, the 3 Idiots. The basic rundown of these three's effects are the all have the ability to Normal Summon a Yosenju monster with a different name, they all go back to your hand during the End Phase of the turn they were Normal Summoned, and in particular Yosenju Kama 1 can bounce a monster to the hand (albeit targeting, which is annoying), Yosenju Kama 2 can attack directly but deals half the damage, and Yosenju Kama 3 searches a Yosenju card. What's funny about this, is since these three or any of your Yosenju cards in general does not xeno lock you, you can easily make an <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> protected <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> or <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> with them. No alternatives, these are your main win conditions.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> (or any other hand trap, really)</strong> - <span>The best alternatives or complementary cards you can have for these two are either <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Yosenju Oyam"">Yosenju Oyam</a></strong> - <span>Your only defender in the main deck, except for <a data-name=""Alpha, the Master of Beasts"">Alpha, the Master of Beasts</a> if you play it.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a></strong> - <span>Consistency piece. The alternatives or complementary cards you can have for this are either <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a> or <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>. Always use this before using <a data-name=""Fire Formation - Tenki"">Fire Formation - Tenki</a>. Remember, always draw before you search.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a></strong> - <span>This is just here as a <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> bait. Set any number of these and walk straight into your opponent's back row removal and tada! free <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon</a>. If they so happen to decide to pop only one of the three, you could also use it as a negation with Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon on board since it's a non-effect monster. The alternatives or complementary cards you can have for this is <a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a>, although it would require you to modify your targets.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Yosen Training Grounds"">Yosen Training Grounds</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Yosenjus' Sword Sting"">Yosenjus' Sword Sting</a></strong> - <span>Yosen Training Grounds is how you gain control and tempo throughout the game. Yosenjus' Sword Sting is your main offensive tool and interaction. I used to play three copies of the Sword Sting but I think playing 2 is just fine since it's searchable and recyclable anyway. If anything, I'd much rather have 1 more copy of Yosen Training Grounds. I would love to have access to at least 1 copy of <a data-name=""Yosenjus' Secret Move"">Yosenjus' Secret Move</a>, but not now since I'm still building another deck, and if you have it, play it.</span></span>  <strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong>  <span>Nothing much else really to say about this one.</span>  <span><strong><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Scrap Archfiend"">Scrap Archfiend</a>, <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Pearl"">Gem-Knight Pearl</a>, or <a data-name=""Gaia Saber, the Lightning Shadow"">Gaia Saber, the Lightning Shadow</a></span></strong> - <span>These are just free bodies off of <a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a>. The alternatives or complementary cards you can have for this, if you're playing <a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a> instead, are <a data-name=""Last Warrior from Another Planet"">Last Warrior from Another Planet</a> which is a floodgate, <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon"">Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon</a>, just a Towers monster, or <a data-name=""Naturia Exterio"">Naturia Exterio</a>, a non-once per turn/once per chain Spell/Trap passive negate.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Downerd Magician"">Downerd Magician</a>/<a data-name=""Drill Driver Vespenato"">Drill Driver Vespenato</a> + <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</a></strong> - <span>Because I decided to play <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Pearl"">Gem-Knight Pearl</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Number F0: Utopic Future"">Number F0: Utopic Future</a> + <a data-name=""Number F0: Utopic Draco Future"">Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</a></strong> - <span>Because I decided to play 2 <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Pearl"">Gem-Knight Pearl</a>s. The alternatives or complementary cards you can have for these are <a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a>, with <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a> and <a data-name=""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"">Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</a> package, depends on how many materials you wanna give it.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> + <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></strong> - <span>Just another generic Towers boss monster that can solve your <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a> problems.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a></strong> - <span>Not mandatory, but just in case I run into <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a> along the way.</span></span>  <span>The ""side"" deck:</span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Drowning Mirror Force"">Drowning Mirror Force</a>, <a data-name=""Quaking Mirror Force"">Quaking Mirror Force</a>, <a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a></strong> - <span>A staple for a full power version of this deck because you're almost always left with no monsters on the field, I'd say Drowning Mirror Force and Quaking Mirror Force are the best out of three, but Storming Mirror Force is also good thematically. The only real alternative or complementary card I can recommend for/with these is <a data-name=""World Legacy Clash"">World Legacy Clash</a>. It requires a specific activation condition, but its ATK/DEF value modulation is permanent and can be activated during the Damage Step, which is always good.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> and/or <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a></strong> - <span>Just good defensive cards generally. No alternatives.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>, or <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a></strong> - <span>You NEED backrow removal. The worst among these three are probably Twin Twisters because of the discard, but one could argue that it being a Quick-Play Spell gives it an edge over Lightning Storm. Also, play <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> if you have it, you have no reason to. The alternatives or complementary cards you can have for these are <a data-name=""Galaxy Cyclone"">Galaxy Cyclone</a> (if you bought the Cipher SD) or <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a> (if you bought the Pendulum Magicians SD).</span></span>  <strong><span>Testing and Closing Thoughts</span></strong>  <span>The reason why I came up with this deck is because I really need to farm the ranked without numbing my brain with playing the same Eldlich, Lyrilusc, Tri-Brigade, or Zoodiac decks that I do not even want to use in Platinum I just to get wins. I needed a casual deck that I can build with only N and R rarity cards and can make use of whatever staples I already have, and here it is. It isn't flashy, it has an incredibly linear play, it actually has some good match ups with the meta decks (except Drytrons, because fuck that deck but I digress) like Tri-Brigades but it does not exhaust me mentally. Is it top tier? No. Is it playable? Yes. Does it do what it needs to do? Absolutely, which is just what I needed. Overall, I would recommend this to players who doesn't really know what to do with their gems as of now, or those who have only started playing the game but doesn't wanna commit to an archetype just yet.</span>"

A lot of this is based on a standard <strong>Toadally Awesome</strong> deck with some staple cards added, since I designed this for Master Duel, but I'll go over the strategy regardless as there are some cards I don't think I've seen in Frogs before. <ul>  	<li>The boss here is of course <strong>Toadally Awesome</strong>, which can be used to Special Summon monsters and steal your opponent's cards.</li>  	<li>If you have a Frog monster in your GY, <strong>Swap Frog</strong> can be used to get <strong>Ronintoadin </strong><em>and</em> another Frog monster from your hand on the field at once. If that monster is a <strong>Ronintoadin</strong>, <strong>Des Frog</strong> or <strong>Dupe Frog</strong>, then you're one step away from being able to play <strong>Des Croaking</strong> or Fusion Summon <strong>D.3.S. Frog</strong>.</li>  	<li>When Normal Summoned, <strong>Tradetoad </strong>can Tribute itself to get a Level 2 Frog on the field.</li>  	<li><strong>Wetlands</strong> is key to this deck, as it's one of the most powerful members of the ""Field Spells that add ATK"" family. Use <strong>Terraforming </strong>to search for it.</li>  	<li><strong>Solidarity </strong>gives your cards a further ATK boost, since every monster in this deck is Aqua.</li>  	<li>Because all of your monsters are WATER, <strong>Mastar Boy </strong>boosts them all by 500 ATK. I was considering whether <strong>Star Boy</strong> would be a better addition since he can benefit from <strong>Wetlands</strong>, but he doesn't have the ability to recover monsters when destroyed and I felt like he might be too inconsistent to run in a singles duel.</li>  	<li>A non-Frog monster that I did add to the Main Deck is <strong>Squirt Squid</strong>, since the tokens are free material for <strong>Toadally Awesome </strong>and can become bosses in their own right.</li>  	<li>The rest of the Monsters are <strong>Paleozoic </strong>Traps. These are so useful in a Frog deck because not only are they decent Traps in their own right, but they they can gain double attack with <strong>Wetlands</strong> <em>and </em>be used to summon <strong>Toadally Awesome</strong>.</li>  	<li><strong>Salvage </strong>can be used to recover Frog monsters, while <strong>Gravity Bind </strong>and <strong>Aquarium Stage </strong>can stop powerful monsters from destroying your board.</li>  	<li>The final card I want to talk about is <strong>Fury of Kairyu-Shin</strong>. If you haven't already pulled your <strong>Torrential Tribute</strong>, it allows you to negate an attack on any of your monsters.</li> </ul>"

You could go for the usual 1st turn 6000 ATK <strong>Arrival</strong> or 5000 ATK <strong>Arrival</strong> + <strong>Cyberse Quantum Dragon</strong> (<strong>Gatchiri</strong>-buffed) or 2nd turn <strong>Accesscode</strong> + <strong>Update Jammer</strong> OTK (preferably <strong>Gatchiri</strong>-buffed and/or backed by <strong>Cynet Optimization</strong>), but with the assistance of the searching power of Code Talker support.  To properly execute an @Ignister combo, one should be aware of the relevant functions of each card.  <strong>Achichi</strong>, the red blob - search out other @Ignister combo monsters (usually <strong>Pikari</strong>)  <strong>Pikari</strong>, the yellow blob - search out @Ignister spells (usually <strong>AI Meet You</strong>), change the level of another @Ignister monster to 4 (for Xyz Summoning <strong>Light Dragon</strong>)  <strong>Bururu</strong>, the green blob - send an essential monster to the GY (usually <strong>Gatchiri</strong>), Special Summon its fellow material after a Synchro Summon  <strong>Doyon</strong>, the violet blob - retrieve an essential monster from the GY (usually the <strong>Gatchiri</strong> sent by <strong>Bururu</strong>), retrieve an @Ignister spell from the GY after being used for a Cyberse Link Summon  <strong>Hiyari</strong>, the blue blob - free Special Summon from the hand if another @Ignister monster is on the field, tribute another Cyberse monster to search out high-level @Ignister monster (usually <strong>Gatchiri</strong>)  <strong>Gatchiri</strong>, the spiky one - Special Summon from the hand by negating a Cyberse monster's effects (use it on something that had already used its effects), protect all your Cyberse monsters from card destruction once (counted separately per monster), make one of your face-up monster unaffected by your opponent's card effects until the end of your opponent's turn if sent to the GY (<strong>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT EFFECT</strong>)  <strong>Danmari</strong>, the spooky violet one - negate attack while your @Ignister monster battles (handtrap), works as a targeted omni-negate if you control Arrival while this is in your GY  <strong>Micro Coder</strong>, the yellow-green one - search out Cynet spells (usually <strong>Cynet Codec</strong>)  <strong>Code Generator</strong>, the orange one - send an essential monster to the GY (usually <strong>Gatchiri</strong>)  &nbsp;  There are many combo routes (especially with the added Code Talker support), so I'm only gonna discuss the pure @Ignister way to 6000 ATK Arrival.  @Ignister monster (usually <strong>Achichi</strong> or <strong>Pikari</strong>) &gt;&gt; <strong>Dark Infant</strong> (search out <strong>Ignister AILand</strong>) &gt;&gt; @Ignister monster (usually <strong>Achichi</strong> or <strong>Pikari</strong>) &gt;&gt; <strong>Cyberse Wicckid</strong> (skip if you already have <strong>Bururu</strong> in hand) &gt;&gt; SPECIAL SUMMON @Ignister monster in <strong>Wicckid</strong>'s link arrow (don't use <strong>Doyon</strong> if possible) &gt;&gt; <strong>Splash Mage</strong> (don't use effect before summoning another @Ignister) &gt;&gt; <strong>Bururu</strong> (send <strong>Gatchiri</strong> or <strong>Danmari</strong> to the GY) &gt;&gt; <strong>Dark Templar</strong> (summon on the <strong>right</strong> Extra Monster zone) &gt;&gt; <strong>Doyon</strong> (summon on the zone below the other EMZ, retrieve <strong>Gatchiri</strong> from GY) &gt;&gt; <strong>Gatchiri</strong> (summon to the leftmost zone by negating <strong>Doyon</strong>) &gt;&gt; <strong>Dark Infant</strong> (summon to the leftmost link arrow of <strong>Dark Templar</strong> by using <strong>Doyon</strong>; choose DIVINE element; the following chain MUST be <strong>Doyon</strong> &gt; <strong>Dark Templar</strong> &gt; <strong>Dark Infant</strong>; make sure to retrieve different elements with <strong>Dark Templar</strong>'s effect) &gt;&gt; <strong>Wind Pegasus</strong> (this is to set up your GY with this card, <strong>Pikari</strong> will return to the field via <strong>Bururu</strong>'s effect) &gt;&gt; 6000 ATK <strong>Arrival</strong>  For 5000 ATK <strong>Arrival</strong> + <strong>Cyberse Quantum Dragon</strong> (<strong>Gatchiri</strong>-buffed), use Transcode Talker instead of Splash Mage, use Quantum instead of Pegasus, summon <strong>Splash Mage </strong>and the monster from its effect for Link-6 (2 link arrows from <strong>Splash Mage</strong>, 1 from every other monster except <strong>Quantum</strong>), and target <strong>Quantum</strong> with <strong>Gatchiri</strong>'s effect."

Place <a data-name=""Qliphort Scout"">Qliphort Scout</a> + <a data-name=""Qliphort Stealth"">Qliphort Stealth</a> or <a data-name=""Qliphort Carrier"">Qliphort Carrier</a> into Pendulum zone, get a free (800LP) monster from your deck every turn. Place one on battlefield (Preferably Stealth) and just beat your opponent with 2900-3400 attack monster while they are cannot do a single move, thanks to your floodgates.  If you couldn't block them out of play, your Qliphort Monsters have absurd Tribute effects: <ul>  	<li>If you tribute a Carrier - Bounce Monster into hand (you can bounce your own Scout, to activate it again this turn! NO ONCE PER TURN ON SCOUT LOL)</li>  	<li>If you tribute Helix - Destroy Spell or Trap on battlefield (sometimes you can destroy your own to open some space)</li>  	<li>If you tribute Summoned Stealth - Bounce any card on battlefield (again, you can bounce Scout!)</li> </ul> Basically all you do is disrupt your opponents plan as much as possible before you locked them out of the game, while your Normal Monster beat the crap out of them.  Also, Qliphort Monsters is good because you can summon any of them without Tributing, althought their stats will be lowered as well as level... except the fact that Skill Drain, negates stats loss and in same time, your monsters in Pendulum Zone gives free bonus ATK or decrease ATK of opponent monsters making a really huge difference!  &nbsp;  And you know whats funniest about this deck? You actually need only 2 cards in Extra deck: Dragon Master Knight for our Dogmatika Punishment, the rest of them is just a banish fodder for pot! Even Genius!"

PS: I did make some better versions of this deck so it's easier to get zeus off, will share soonTM  Strat is quite simple:  Main Deck:  3x Skull servant - here just as fodder, can be used for Wightprince effect or summoned with Unexpected dai to make a Xyz summon and get Zeus on the field.  3x Wightprincess - defensive option/combo starter, either summon her and use the effect to throw Wightprince to the graveyard and start the combo or keep her around to use her quick effect to throw sand at the eyes of anything with a high level.  3x The Lady in Wight - the shield of the deck, can protect the King against MOST stuff that would break him, can be easily put on the field with the effect of Wightmare after being banished with Wightprince effect in the graveyard.  3x Wightbaking - this one is the goat, either keep him around to save any of the cores with his quick effect or throw him to the graveyard for his other effect and grab Wightprince (to be discarded) and Wightprincess (to throw sand) or Wightmare to get Lady in Wight in the field.  3x Wightmare - the only thing he's here for is unbanishing a extra skull servant or sumonning a banished Lady in Wight or King of skull servants, or you just normal summon him as fodder for a link/xyz summon.  3x Wightprince - either use him as discard/link summon fodder, just throw him to the graveyard to use his effect.  3x King of the Skull Servants - he's the sword of the deck, can be easily normal summoned since it's a lvl 1, can also be summoned with Wightprince graveyard effect.  3x Maxx ""C"" - this is necessary against most tier 1-2 decks, plus getting the right cards with it can be a insta-win (unless they negate you to oblivion).  3x Ash Blossom - good combo, unfortunately, i don't want to see 10+ minutes of summoning and resummoning, L + negated + you get no cards.  2x  Mezuki - good to be used with Avendread Savior effect, good atk, and is also a way to get Lady in Wight in the field.  1x Raigeki - board control is important.  1x Harpie's Feather Duster - board control is important.  1x Monster Reborn - either used to unbrick or to get the King back in the field  1x Foolish Burial - use with Wightbaking to get Wightprince + Wightprincess and you're off to a great start  1x One for One - mostly a combo starter  2x Tri-Wight - let's you recicle some monsters to Link/Xyz summon, also a easy Zeus summon  2x Unexpected Dai - also a easy way to Zeus  1x  Lightning Storm - board control is important  2x Burial from a different dimension - use along with Wightprince grave effect to get the King without the -3k attack demerit from having banished the cards  2x Twin Twisters - another way of discarding a combo starter and dealing with Skill Drain/Imperial Order and other hard counters  1x Mirror Force - Classic one, still useful  1x Evenly Matched - you normally only need 1-3 cards on the field, so this is also a good way to deal with extensive combos and full boards  2x Infinite Impermenence - really useful, some effects can be a insta-lose  1x Dark Sacrifice - a way to save the cores, and throw Wightbaking to the grave at the same time  1x Solemn Judgement - omni-negate, can be a insta-win if they can't recover  2x Uni-Zombie - combo starter  Extra deck:  1x Zeus - he's just here for the board control  2x Linkuriboh - normal summoning Wightprince/Wightbaking into Linkuriboh is a decent first turn option most of the tim.  1x Slacker Magician - can be easily used to summon Zeus since she can attack anything and don't worry about being destroyed  1x Number 39: Utopia Roots - also a good option for a Zeus summon, it's also a good option for defense.  2x Number 48: Shadow Lich - good Offense/Defense option if you need to rely on classic beatdown.  1x LANphorhynchus - it only needs two monsters of any king/level so it's good to get rid of vulnerable monsters on the field.  1x Knightmare Phoenix - good ofense/utility and can discard something to the grave.  1x Knightmare Unicorn - same as Phoenix but works for any card instead.  2x Avendread Savior - his effect being able to discard a card from the deck to lower a enemy attack is useful for combos and for defense (wightbaking/mezuki as the main targets)  1x Accesscode Talker - good ofensive option if the opponent has ways of dealing with the king  1x Saryuja Skull Dread - one of the less used cards, but it's kinda useful in late game situations  1x Rasterliger - budget Accesscode Talker"

With all the cards in place, both Red-eyes and supporting cards (Vishuda, Nessie, Dogman, Dark Magician, Alternative Black Dragon, etc.) you can keep summoning monsters from both your hand and GY. Also, your spells and traps, give some base security when special summoning, especially Return of The Red-Eyes, or when you need to maintain your rhythm in summoning (Allure of Darkness). However, your main objective is to bring out mainly Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon and Dark Dragoon, as Flare Metal will burn your opponent per effect, and Dark Dragoon can break your opponent's board. Your Link Monsters can also support your deck by co-linking and thus drawing cards, but also destroying and negating your opponent's monsters and card effects. Usually aim for Verte Anaconda, as its effect can secure you Dark Dragoon and keep summoning cards (if you copy Red-Eyes Fusion's effect, which disregards its downside)."

Next I combined them with Rikkas, since their main gimmick is to tribute monsters, and for the most part, that worked out decently well (if anyone wants that version, I can upload it).  Firstly, what *is* a Lair of Darkness deck? It's a deck centered around it's field spell, a field spell that lets you tribute your opponent's monsters. Although that sounds amazing, the deck can brick, very hard, this deck aims to improve consistency and/or stall enough to where you can get your plays going. I'll touch up more down below the explanation of the monsters/spells/traps. Without further ado, let's go through what the deck consists of, and why they're there.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Monsters:</span></strong>  <strong>(I will NOT be covering Maxx ""C"", Monster Reborn, or Raigeki here)</strong>  <strong>Tour Guide From the Underworld</strong> - Tour Guide is a staple in virtually any fiend deck, as it allows you to special summon 1 level 3 or lower fiend monster from your deck when it's normal summoned. She's a great extender and an amazing combo starter for this deck, as the fiend monsters (every one of them, aside from Tour Guide herself) don't *need* their effects (I'll touch up more on this later). (3)  <strong>Lilith, Lady of Lament</strong> - Lilith is arguably the boss monster of this deck, although her stats aren't as good as 'Darkest Diabolos', her quick effect (she's the only one in this deck with one) allows you to tribute 1 dark monster (more on why this is good later). If her effects aren't negated, you can tribute 1 monster to reveal 3 normal traps and have your opponent choose one of them at random to set on your field (so keep in mind, if you want to add more Trap Trick in, that's totally fine).  <strong>Ahrima, the Wicked Warden</strong> - Ahrima is honestly what makes the deck a lot more bearable, you can discard him from your hand to search out 'Lair of Darkness', making him invaluable to have. When he's on field, you can also tribute 1 dark monster to search out your 'Darkest Diabolos', which you'll almost always want either in-hand or in your GY.  <strong>Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</strong> - Diabolos is the other boss monster of this deck, and you'll always want at least 1 copy of him in your deck list (you can add more, but he can be bricky at times). He can't be tributed and your opponent can't target him with card effects, both very good effects for the most part, but aside from that and being a beatstick with 3k attack, he's very easy to get on the field, as he special summons himself from the GY or hand when one of your monsters is tributed (yes, even getting Kaiju'd works). To top it off, when he tributes, your opponent has to put a card from their hand on either the top or bottom of their deck (their choice).  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Spells:</span></strong>  <strong>Foolish Burial</strong> - Mostly included here for 2 reasons: you can use it with Monster Reborn, and to send Diabolos to the GY.  <strong>Terraforming</strong> - A must-have for any field spell centric deck, it just searches out your field spell.  <strong>Pot of Extravagance</strong> - This deck can be very bricky at times, and you definitely don't want any of your main deck banished, so this and Pot of Prosperity are the next best thing. The only reason I included this instead of Prosperity is because of allowing you to draw 1 more card, you can swap these if you want, though.  <strong>Lair of Darkness</strong> - The main center piece of this deck and something you'll always want on the field, it's the field spell. When this card is on the field, all face-up monsters become DARK attribute monsters, making your life a lot easier. Once per turn, you can tribute 1 face-up DARK monster your enemy controls, which is great removal as it's not destructive, it doesn't target, and it allows you to potentially get some of your effects off. To add on to those 2 effects, it also creates tokens up to the amount of times the turn player tribute summoned. That means if you tributed 4 times, you get 4 tokens. Note that if you tribute on their turn, they get the tokens.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Traps:</span></strong>  <strong>Dimensional Prison </strong>- This trap allows you to target and banish an opponent's attacking monster, making it decent at stalling and helpful for situations where you need it.  <strong>Trickstar Reincarnation </strong>- Normally you'd use this with the other Lament sister, Malice, but I'll touch up on her down there. This trap card is limited to 1 (thankfully), because it allows you to banish your opponent's entire hand (they get to draw the same amount, so it's usually run with 'Droll &amp; Lock Bird', but they'd end up bricking us).  <strong>Metaverse</strong> - Another limited 1, kind of Terraforming's older brother, it allows you to take a field spell from your deck and either add it to your hand or activate it.  <strong>Waking the Dragon </strong>- In a deck with as many traps as this, and with how often people run things like 'Harpie's Feather Duster', this is a no-brainer. When your opponent removes (in any sense, banished, destroyed, or gently sent to the GY), you get to special summon 1 extra deck monster.  <strong>Grinning Grave Virus</strong> - GGV is something that can make your life worse or better, depending on what's sent to the GY. It allows you to tribute 1 DARK monster with 3k or less ATK, and then have your opponent destroy 1 card for every 500 ATK of that monster from their hand and/or deck (so if you tributed a monster with 1k ATK, they'd destroy 2 cards). If you, however, tributed a monster with 2k or more ATK, you get to look at all the cards your opponent draws until the end of their 3rd turn after you activated it. Not only that, but all monsters they draw are immediately destroyed, and they can't activate their effects in the GY the turn they were destroyed by that effect.  <strong>Trap Trick</strong> - Trap Trick is another must-have for this deck, as it allows you to banish 1 trap from your deck to set a copy of that trap (you have to have 2+ copies), which you can activate that turn.  <strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong> - It'd be weird if I didn't include this in the deck profile, it's a trap that allows you to target a monster in your opponent's GY, special summon it to your field (its effects are negated), and then banish a monster they control of the same type (ie. if you use this to target a Dragon in their GY, and they have Dragon on field, you can banish both of the cards.) So at worst it's a worse Monster Reborn.  <strong>Solemn Judgement</strong> - This deck doesn't have much of anything in terms of negation, so this is probably your best bet for that, highly advised to run with at least 2 copies.  <strong>Skill Drain </strong>- I know people hate Skill Drain and that's just another reason I put this in here, it's something that not only stops your opponent from using on-field monster effects, but it doesn't really affect this deck much at all (more on that).  <strong>Summon Limit</strong> - Pretty self-explanatory, neither player can summon more than 2 times per turn (negated summons still count), and it's not like we're summoning a bunch of monsters anyways, aside from tokens.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <strong>Naturia Exterio</strong> - Naturia Exterio is an amazing card to have on field since he's like a Drytron for activated spells/traps. You can banish 1 card from your GY, send the top of your deck to the GY, and then negate an activated trap/spell (doesn't work on already activated traps/spells). Best part? It's not a once per turn, as long as you have banish targets and a deck, you can negate.  <strong>Black Rose Moonlight Dragon</strong> - You don't necessarily need this, but it does help a lot in keeping your opponent in check, since it (on special summon as well) allows you to send 1 level 5 or higher special summoned monster your opponent controls to the hand. With summon limit, it becomes a lot more oppressive.  <strong>Geomathmech Final Sigma</strong> - Sigma is a win-con by himself a lot of the times, since he's unaffected by card effects outside of other Mathmechs (which, who runs?). Any battle damage this card inflicts is also doubled, which at 3k attack, is pretty decent. The catch being that this card *has* to be in the Extra Monster Zone for those effects.  <strong>Beat Cop from the Underworld</strong> - Beat Cop is a great addition here, since she not only can tribute a monster your opponent controls, but when you do tribute a monster with her (so long as you used 2 DARK monsters with different names), you can put a Patrol Counter on a card, allowing it to be safe from destruction, by the amount of counters on it (your main target for them would be Lair of Darkness).  <strong>Wee Witch's Apprentice</strong> - You can definitely take her out or substitute her for something else, but she's mainly just another way of getting back a monster from your GY, which you can also use tokens.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Extra Information:</span></strong>  This deck has a lot to it for the most part, a lot of it comes down to knowing your opponent's decks, since you'll want to make the most out of your 1 tribute summon. I'll add some 'I-think-you-should-know-this' info down below.  <strong>What happens if my monster effects are negated?</strong>  Outside of maybe 'Tour Guide' who special summons Lilith or Ahrima, you don't really need them, as you can still activate their effects and tribute monsters, they just don't get the benefits of them tributing (ex: you can tribute a monster with Lilith, but you don't get to excavate trap cards if her effects are negated).  <strong>Why do you run 'Waking the Dragon' in this deck?</strong>  Simple, it's a trap heavy deck and centered around a field spell, people are going to want to pop every trap and the field spell at any chance they can get, why not reap the benefits if you don't have an out to them like Solemn?  <strong>Why Skill Drain at 3? Isn't that a bit bricky?</strong>  Absolutely, it can be a brick, but like Solemn and Summon Limit, you can't search for them as you can with normal traps, so you'll want to increase your chance of having it in your starting hand.  <strong>No hand traps outside of Maxx ""C""? </strong>  The deck needs all the consistency it can get, putting Ash Blossom, Called by the Grave, or any other hand traps would just clutter it or make it harder to stall.  <strong>Why is the Extra Deck so small?</strong>  Mostly because I'm leaving it to you, so I can be lazy, as I'm not all that knowledgeable on the best targets for 'Waking the Dragon' (and no, I won't just Google ""best targets for Waking the Dragon').  <strong>No Sangan?!?!</strong>  Swap out Sangan for a Skill Drain if you want, but I just prefer stalling until I get that monster on field.  <strong>Where are the other cards, 'Alice, Lady of Lament' and 'Diabolos, King of the Abyss'?</strong>  They're probably hanging out with 'Trouble Sunny', who is also not in the game. Give us them, Konami.  <strong>Recurring Nightmare?</strong>  You can tech this in, but it's not searchable and for it to appear in your hand often you'd have to add 2 or 3, so it's not really worth it in my opinion.  <strong><span>Weaknesses:</span> </strong>  So we've covered the good, what's the bad? Well firstly, since it *is* based around its field spell, it can be vulnerable if you don't have negates or anything to stop the removal of it, which can stop your play dead in the tracks if you don't have that good of a hand. Although this deck can go second and still win, it'll have some trouble, as we rely heavily on our normal summon and not having our stuff, y'know, destroyed.  The deck also struggles with cards being sent to the GY and/or being banished, as there are hardly any ways to get them back, so that means if an enemy is about to banish your on-field Lilith, let her tribute herself and/or a monster that will be removed. Pot of Extravagance is both a blessing and a curse for this deck, as you can banish your main 'Waking the Dragon' targets, so be weary on using it. Backrow heavy decks are also an annoying matchup against this deck for the most part so keep that in mind.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Last thoughts:</span></strong>  This deck is an absolute blast to play for the most part, which if you didn't like playing Eldlich because it's just ""bring back goldie boy, activate trap monster"", you might like this. I have not done any playtesting in Platinum with this deck (I don't want to) so I can't say this is a Plat 1 deck, but it is very annoying when you have the right setup going. I hope I don't see this deck in Ranked, please keep it away from me, thank you."

Now here we are in 2022 and it is still doing the same thing, only yet it is a lot more fun to have around than Monarchs (no offense to <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtube.com/c/Lithium2300"">Lithium2300</a>). Now with the recent ""important"" competitive taking place, and with the winter 2021/2022 competitive dueling season wrapping up, the meta have went full circle to undergo a 180° to where the reliance on Extra Deck monsters is now more than ever *(including with the recent shortcomings for the Adventurer and D/D decks that got the deserved boost from it's players at YCS Las-Vegas).</span>  <span>   How does Nekroz play into the picture as an Anti-Meta contendor with the sudden dependency of the Extra Deck? Simply put it that it has the ritual monsters that can skelter your opponents ability to utilize their ED monsters to their fullest potential; such examples include ""<a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a>"" (which entirely locks their effects if special summoned from the Extra Deck) and ""<a data-name=""Nekroz of Areadbhair"">Nekroz of Areadbhair</a>"" (used to tribute unnecessary Garnets from your hand or unwanted monsters from your field to negate and banish monsters such as DPE). Besides the usual Unicore and Areadbhair, also in the lineup is ""<a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a>"" (TL;DR, Knightmare Unicorn, but without a discard cost and can target 2 monsters that were Special summoned from the Extra Deck), and ""<a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a>"" (Banish 3 cards, but 1 each from your opponents hand, field, and Graveyard), ""<a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a>"" (Negates Effects of monster Special Summoned ftom ED and reduces attack to 0). Besides those, ""<a data-name=""Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz"">Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz</a>"" (once having very significant importance) still maintains relevancy to the deck only as a hit switch as an urgency tool for Areadbhair, Unicore, or even Trishula. As for the ritual spells, a 2-2-1 ratio (that being cycle, Kaleidescape, and then mirror) has been the most common ratio in modern Nekroz builds for a reason I am assuming involving them being a brick of sorts.</span>  <span>   As for Impcantations and the Dogmatika engine, the debate surrounding the two is that some say one engine is better than the other. To be fair, both have their fair share of problems, and both have their strengths. For Impcantations, I decided to go with a ratio involving with *(2 Candoll, 2 Talismandra, 1 Penciplume, 1 Bookstone).* The reason for not running Chalislime is because I feel it is not worth prioritizing the Impcantation engine solely for the sake of getting Nekroz monsters out; however I do keep in notion that I still use the Impcantation Ritual Spell card anytime I have the monsters not being conceived as Garnet pieces. As for Dogmatika, the only pieces I have going for it is Ecclesia, Titaniklad, and Nadir Servant. This is because of the components needed for Dogmatika Punishment which helps mill out all kinds of Extra Deck monsters I could use in any compacity.</span>  <span>  Finally comes the Other stuff which aren't too special; however the most notable cards include ""<a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom"">Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</a>"" (because it is a Draw 1 that allows me to put any pieces back that I will need later on); ""<a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a>"" mainly due to the fact I'm not running any hand traps for Nekroz doesn't traditionally run handtraps in their main deck unless necessary; and ""<a data-name=""Diviner of the Heralds"">Diviner of the Heralds</a>"" to mill cards like ""<a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a> and ""<a data-name=""Herald of The Arc Light"">Herald of The Arc Light</a>"" on summon.</span>"

Thus Megalith is a privileged deck because it ""steals"" the Ritual Mechanics as it doesn't follow the standard for Ritual Summoning. At most, what managed to surpass this deck was <strong>Drytron</strong> that ""steals"" in the mechanics when Ritual Summoning using the monsters' ATK and not the level. It should be clear that Megalith is by no means one of the hardest decks to learn in the game at the level of a D/D/D for example. People say this because it's true that no one who plays versus Megalith knows what you're doing but overall the deck is not beginner friendly but very welcome for those who like creativity in Yugioh!  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ////<strong>Understanding Megalith Archetype Cards</strong>:  In general, Level 8 Archetype monsters <strong>Ritual Summon a ""MEGALITH"" Monster</strong> from your hand when <strong>discarding itself</strong> from the hand to the GY and <a data-name=""Megalith Aratron"">Megalith Aratron</a> has a Quick eff of Ritual Summoning which allows you to use it on your opponent turn to make moves. Level 4 monsters Ritual Summon <strong>""ANY Ritual Monster""</strong> from your hand <strong>activating their effect in the FIELD</strong> and <strong>MUST USE themselves as part of the Tribute</strong> for the Ritual Summon, meaning you must first bring them to the field to after being able to use their Ritual Summon effects and they have to be part of the Tribute for the monster they will bring from their hand, among Level 4 who have Quick eff to do Ritual Summon is <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> and can be used on the opponent's turn. <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> is the combination of all the qualities of the previous monsters by Ritual Summoning a <strong>""MEGALITH"" Monster from your hand or DECK</strong>, being a <strong>Quick eff</strong> that can be used on the opponent's turn and doesn't even need to be used as a tribute of the monster that will bring to the field. An important detail is that all Megalith monsters can only use their <strong>Ritual Summon effect Once per Turn</strong>, however all <strong>Level 4</strong> monsters have the effect of when they are <strong>Ritual Summoned NOT HARD ONCE PER TURN</strong>, so if you manage to do 3 Ritual Summon from <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a>, <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> or <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> on the same turn they will activate their advantage effect every time, which makes them a bit broken and allows for a lot of different combos. And finally, along with all this, we have <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a>, which is a Quick-Play spell that, like Megalith Phul, Ritual Summons ""MEGALITH"" Monsters <strong>DIRECT FROM THE DECK</strong>, only here you must <strong>tribute a monster(s) with DOUBLE Level</strong> of the Megalith you are going to bring from the deck, so if you Tribute a Level8 monster you bring any Level4 Megalith and by Tributing any Level4 monster you bring <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> to the field, and if that wasn't enough Ritual Summon from the DECK to Megalith Unformed It is <strong>NOT Hard Once Per Turn</strong> and can be used multiple times in the same turn increasing the deck's power significantly.  The deck has <strong>incredible Recovery</strong> thanks to the <strong>Impcantation engine</strong> and the engine's own cards like <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a>, <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a>. High number of Starters and consistency cards and great interactions with the opponent and finally it is extremely budget. That's why you <strong>don't need to maximize Ophiel and Hagith</strong>, which is common for people to do, because their main role in turn 1 is to access Megalith Phul and then thanks to the engine's excellent Recovery you can always get them back to hand and do Ritual Summon every turn to gain advantage so it's best to leave both their slots for Tech Cards to improve the deck by going second.  <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> in my opinion is the best Ritual monster in the game, he <strong>adds any Ritual monster in the GY</strong> to the hand by <strong>manipulating its level</strong> to match the added target. And it has a <strong>Quick effect of Ritual Summoning</strong> Megalith straight from the DECK and doesn't even need to tribute it for that, so it generates a lot of advantage and interaction with the opponent throughout the game. A key part of the Megalith archetype.  <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Phaleg"">Megalith Phaleg</a> are surgical cards with Phaleg needed to <strong>finish</strong> and Och needed to <strong>control</strong> the game with Ritual Summon monsters outside the archetype. You want to use them whenever you need them and you don't need to see them in the first hand so we only use 1 copy of each.  Trap <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> is the best way to allow you to <strong>RANK-4</strong> plays in the <strong>Grind Game by reborning a Megalith every turn</strong>. It also <strong>synergizes</strong> with the FIELD Spell <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> which triggers eff of adding <strong>any Ritual Monster</strong> from the GY to the hand even if a Megalith is Special Summoned to the field and not only it was Ritual Summoned then the Trap triggers the Field Spell effect leaving your insane Grind Game even against the best Grind Game decks in the game you can manage very well.  <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> is the <strong>win condition</strong> of Megalith's archetype being the only <strong>interaction via engine</strong> available, when Ritual Summoned it targets and destroys opponent's cards by the number of Ritual Monsters with Different Names in its GY and can often <strong>destroy the opponent's entire field</strong> of just one time. And since the deck has several ways to Ritual Summon the opponent's turn, it's not difficult to bring it onto the field to be an interruption to the opponent's turn 2 plays and leave the <strong>simplified gamestate in your favor</strong>. And that's the strength of Megalith: its versatility in Ritual Summoning on the opponent's turn and interacting in different ways depending on the Deck they're using.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ////<strong>Generic Ritual Support to help Megalith</strong>:  Among the generic support of Ritual, the <strong>Impcantation engine</strong> stands out for generating an absurd advantage so that you can make Ritual Summon with the lowest possible investment, which makes perfect sense when it comes to the second oldest game mechanic that needs to be updated to be competitive. <a data-name=""Impcantation Chalislime"">Impcantation Chalislime</a> is the best starter in the engine because it has the effect of <strong>discarding a card</strong> from the hand to Special Summon an Impcantation straight from the DECK having 3 targets in the Megalith deck: <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> that when Special from the Deck adds a Ritual Spell that we only have the <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a>, the <a data-name=""Impcantation Talismandra"">Impcantation Talismandra</a> which adds a Ritual Monster from the Deck to the hand like <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a>, and the <a data-name=""Impcantation Penciplume"">Impcantation Penciplume</a> which adds a Ritual Monster from the GY to the hand. These monsters also have <strong>hand effects to reveal</strong> a Ritual Monster or a Ritual Spell to <strong>Special Summon BOTH it and an Impcantation from the DECK</strong>. All these monsters have restrictions on the use of their effects: <a data-name=""Chalislime"">Chalislime</a> makes you <strong>lose 2500LP</strong> if you don't Ritual Summon after resolving its effect, and the Impcantation non-Ritual Monsters can only use <strong>1 of the effects per turn, Only Once that Turn</strong> in addition to having continuous effect in the field that you <strong>cannot SPECIAL Summon from the EXTRA Deck</strong>. Finally, to complete the Impcantation engine we have the absurd Archetype Ritual Spell called <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a>, it Ritual Summons Any Ritual Monster by <strong>TRIBUTE ALSO ""IMPCANTATION""</strong> Monsters but in addition it has an <strong>excellent GY effect</strong> if you send an ""Impcantation Card "" from the hand or field to the GY to SPECIAL Summon an ""Impcantation"" from the DECK and return it to the hand which generates a lot of advantage and game volume.  <strong>Herald Engine</strong>: <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> is the best Normal Summon possible for Ritual decks because it does the same thing as <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> but with several more details, such as the fact that it can send both <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> or <a data-name=""N 'tss"">N 'tss</a> from the Extra Deck to be an interaction going second, and it even <strong>raises its own level</strong> by the monster sent to the GY being in these examples becoming <strong>Level6</strong>. It is also a <strong>TUNER monster</strong> which allows you to make Synchro plays and there are several excellent options available mainly because it becomes Level6 which allows you to make <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> on your End Board which is just the best Synchro monster in the game currently. Third it also has an <strong>effect when Tributed to Special Summon a Level 2 or lower Fairy</strong> monster from the Deck which is interesting to find synergies with the card, the main target to bring is <a data-name=""Eva"">Eva</a> which can add interaction to the hand when sent to the GY as <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> and another <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a>. Besides, we have to talk about the <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a>, which is an Extra Deck monster that you want to send to the GY because it has an effect equal to the <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> of <strong>adding a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell</strong> from the Deck to the Hand, We also have the LINK-2 of the Archetype <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> which is a very interesting card for being able to negate the opponent's Spell/Trap by sending Fairy Monsters from the hand to the GY and has an excellent Floating effect of being able to add up to 2 Ritual cards from the GY to the hand greatly improving your Grind Game.  <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> and <a data-name=""Senju"">Senju</a> are the Normal Summons of the deck and by themselves are great Starters to make plays. <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> is in the deck only because it is a search of Normal Summon <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> or <a data-name=""Senju"">Senju</a> when Tributed, you can also choose to use <a data-name=""Vanity's Ruler"">Vanity's Ruler</a> which is a very <strong>powerful floodgate</strong> to prevent only the opponent from Special Summoning and also helps you play around Psy-Framegear Gamma and Nibiru, the Primal Being. <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> is a card that will always appear in Ritual decks in at least 1 copy and for sure she is still in the game even with the abuse that Drytron did the card is very good for the other Ritual decks that people forget she is is also important. If there was a side deck in Master Duel you could use Benten to add <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>.  <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a> fetches all Rituals level 7 or lower which means Adding all starters in the deck and can also add Ritual Spell in GY to hand and it's not even hard once per turn.  Among the interesting generic Ritual Monsters to use in the deck we have the following main options: <a data-name=""Black Chaos MAX"">Black Chaos MAX</a>, <a data-name=""Lord of the Red"">Lord of the Red</a>, <a data-name=""Leviathan @Ignister"">Leviathan @Ignister</a>, <a data-name=""Shinobaron Peacock"">Shinobaron Peacock</a> and <a data-name=""Shirobaroness Peacock"">Shirobaroness Peacock</a>. <a data-name=""Black Chaos MAX"">Black Chaos MAX</a> is basically a Ritual Monster version of <a data-name=""Azathot"">Azathot</a> and that Megalith manages to loop to the field every turn quite consistently. In theory Black Chaos MAX is very good to <strong>turn off the opponent's turn</strong> and the game comes back to you and OTK it but it proved to be very difficult to do with the tests I made because practically you must first access it through <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a>, second get it by <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a>/Senju or <a data-name=""Talismandra"">Talismandra</a> and otherwise you can't do anything else besides the setup to Ritual Summon it on the opponent's turn, so you spend a lot of resources that when it comes back passes the turn you can't finish the opponent. Lord of the Red and Leviathan @Ignister I see them as the best <strong>interaction cards to use</strong> in the deck and the <strong>Shinobaron</strong> Ritual Monsters are also excellent forms of interaction, especially Shirobaroness Peacock which shuffles spells/traps back into the deck and both it has the effect that in the End Phase they go back to the hand and <strong>create two Level4 Tokens</strong> on your field to facilitate Ritual Summon on your next turn but I don't think they are necessary cards in the deck for the following reason: The biggest problem with these generic Rituals is that they only it has the function of entering the field and you <strong>spend a lot of resources</strong> for that which is the problem with Ritual mechanics about being too expensive. It's better when playing Megalith you do little, but that little if the opponent deals with the field I still have a lot of resources to get back into the game and if I need to enter the Grind Game with the opponent. The same goes for those who use <strong>Halqifibrax engine or FTK combos</strong> in the deck because one of two options will happen: either you instantly win when the Combo passes or <strong>lose to Hand Traps</strong> and Blind Second Cards like <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> that's when you can play for as much of <strong>Brick that adds to the deck</strong> when trying to make these moves. So it's much better to maximize Megalith's moves, which is a very well done archetype where <strong>all the cards talk very well with each other</strong> and make a respectful setup against any opponent than opt for those other engines that are not productive and don't generate you advantage in the same way that the purest version already does. Other Generic Ritual Monsters include: <a data-name=""Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended"">Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended</a> and Nekroz Rituals like <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a>, <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a>, <a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a>.  The deck's Extra Deck is mostly made up of <strong>TOOLBOX XYZ RANK-4</strong> that deal with almost any problem on the opponent's field and generate good interactions with the opponent like the <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> and <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> adding <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, we also have some useful Link Monsters in the Deck but which in general are less important than XYZ monsters, a good option is to use <a data-name=""Nephthys, the Sacred Flame"">Nephthys, the Sacred Flame</a> that when done with 3 Ritual Monsters it simply cannot be destroyed by battle or effects, cannot be targeted by cards and gains 2400ATK reaching 4800ATK which makes it an extremely difficult card for Control decks to take out as <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> and <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier,"">Black Luster Soldier,</a> LINK-3 are also a great win condition against Control decks. In general <strong>most of the cards are not mandatory so you can leave the Extra Deck as budget as possible</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ////<strong>Combos</strong>:  In the beginning, when I started to learn how to play Megalith, all the moves I made I always chose to access <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> through <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a> as quickly as possible and keep Looping Hagith and <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a>, Ritual Summoning them <strong>several times</strong> in a row to set up a minimal field and this worked because it was at the time of <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> existence in the game so even though it's not the most efficient way to use its resources because turning the engine doing Ritual Summon by the effect of Megalith and doesn't by the spell Unformed gives you much more advantage, <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> it simply regained all the advantage with its absurd effect of being able to add 2 to 3 Rock Monsters to the hand.  Over time I learned to use <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> more as a card for you to have on the end board to use on your opponent's turn. Of course, the card is excellent and you can use it as a <strong>combo starter</strong>, but as I got better with the deck I saw that looping Hagith Add Unformed and spending in many cases up to 3 Unformed on turn 1 is <strong>not the best way to make combo</strong>. With that I stopped using 3 copies of Hagith and Ophiel because you can use them several times per turn without needing the third copy as you have several ways to <strong>recycle them to your hand</strong> with the deck engine during your combos. And the Combos I do now with the deck play much better around cards like <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> and <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplets"">Forbidden Droplets</a> in addition to <a data-name=""Kaiju"">Kaiju</a>, which was only possible in the <a data-name=""LINKROSS"">LINKROSS</a> Format version because of <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a>, that is, the Combos were not the best way to play Megalith but you never got punished because you had the victory button called Block Dragon.  I would be using <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> instead of <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> if there was <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> in <strong>Master Duel</strong>, but for now Manju is enough for the deck but it's definitely a change I'll make in the future. Some of the combos must be repeated but at least it's good for you to train to learn Megalith because that's how you learn something. Some combos may be wrong so try redoing them to see if they are correct. Some combos I did Adding <a data-name=""Aratron"">Aratron</a> to the hand, but since I don't use him in the decklist anymore you can just add <a data-name=""Bethor"">Bethor</a> to the hand instead for example.  //////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo 1: (Chalislime + Discard) + Hagith + Ophiel</strong>  Chalislime eff Discard Random Card SS Candoll Candoll eff Add Inception Activate

cl2  //////////////////////////////////////////////// //// <strong>Final Deck gameplay details:</strong>  Megalith's Quick effects to Ritual Summon like <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> allow you to <strong>play around target effects</strong> like <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> to Ritual Summon them as tribute so they don't get negated and resolve their effects. Ritual Summon's Quick effect can also be used just to <strong>take advantage of negate and destroy monsters effects</strong> so you can chain the effect and use the Ritual monster as Tribute like Ophiel effect and Opponent's chain <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a>, you can cl2 use <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> eff to perform another Ritual Summon before Ophiel is destroyed <strong>gaining value even after taking interruptions</strong>. These same interactions apply to <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> to play around interactions that <a data-name=""target or destroy your Megalith monsters""><strong>target or destroy your Megalith monsters</strong></a> or even Manju's Normal Summon.  Funny thing about <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> Field Spell is that it triggers eff to Add 1 Ritual from GY to Hand even if your opponent Special Summons a Megalith Monster so in Mirror Match it has interesting applications. ***One move I make a lot is to Reborn <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> with <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> but this move makes when Phul <strong>leaves the field he goes back to the bottom of the deck</strong> which is something you don't want so a way to solve this is you start using <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> more during your combos because you can Reborn it and add Phul to your hand and use it as a tribute to Phul's Ritual and it will be the Megalith Och that goes back to the bottom of the Deck and not Phul and you have the <strong>setup to do Bethor on the opponent's turn in the same way</strong>.  Turn 1 the deck has no way in the engine to <strong>play around</strong> <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> unless you make a <a data-name=""Rafflesia"">Rafflesia</a> and use <a data-name=""Gravedigger's Trap Hole"">Gravedigger's Trap Hole</a> which only works in specific hands having to do 3 or 4 card Combo which is very ineffective though at least if you can add Trap <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> to the hand and Reborn <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> on the opponent's turn you will be able to <strong>Tribute the Nibiru Token that is Level11</strong> to bring <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> on the opponent's turn and destroy several opponent's cards, that is , even after taking Nibiru there are <strong>ways to have interaction and recovery on the opponent's turn</strong> with the combination of <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> and Emergence. Always try to <strong>play around Nibiru turn 3</strong> onwards if the <strong>gamestate is already simplified</strong> and you just need to finish the game with <a data-name=""Megalith Phaleg"">Megalith Phaleg</a> because you can definitely bring him to the field with a maximum of 4 summons. One cool thing about this deck is that you do a Turn 1 combo to add Nibiru to your hand with <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> because you don't care about having the field cleared by Nibiru since with 1 card like Emergence you can already recover the entire Megalith engine again to start plays. ***A tip about playing around Nibiru is not to use the <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> effect on the GY if you already have a way to continue the combo without having to use it, just in case you take <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> you use it as a Push to continue your moves and at least least able to add Trap <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> to the hand with <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a>. But if you are going to play <a data-name=""Talismandra"">Talismandra</a> Add <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> you can use Spell <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> eff in GY without any problems because to have a push after Nibiru will be easy since Benten Adds <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a>/<a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a>.  It's always very important when you have <a data-name=""Chalislime"">Chalislime</a> in the GY to add it back to the hand with <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> or <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> for the next turn to send it to the GY to add the <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> back to the hand and Special an Impcantation from deck.  Interaction Inpcantation Inception vs <a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a> = Even if Inception gets banished from the GY you will still Special Summon an Impcantation from the Deck.  Always check <strong>how many Ritual monsters you have in the GY</strong> to know who to Tribute with <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> effect to bring <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> straight from the deck.  <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> is certainly one of the <strong>best Grind Game cards</strong> in the game, it's absurd how this card alone can <strong>make your engine play again</strong> and even loop <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> because it returns the monster that gives Reborn to the bottom of the deck so every turn you get to use Phul to <strong>bring him back to the field</strong> and destroy all your opponent's cards.  Megalith has a lot of 2 Card Combo or 2 Card Combo and 1 Discard and the <strong>more cards you have in your hand</strong> the end result of the <strong>Combo will not be better</strong>, but <strong>more resilient to interactions</strong>. Depending on the hand you open you can <strong>break the opponent's established fields</strong> with various interations knowing <strong>how to start plays</strong> so that you can extend after the opponent's interruptions.  <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> only has the function of Adding Nibiru to the hand, so since its usefulness ends as soon as it's used you can RANK-5 <a data-name=""Drill Driver Vespenato"">Drill Driver Vespenato</a> on top of it that has an amazing floating effect. It's a pretty good addition to the build as well.  Always remember that if you choose to use <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> instead of Manju you can very easily make <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> to have an interaction with the opponent in the form of <strong>Omni Negate which is something Megalith was never able to do</strong> until the Baronne de Fleur was released in the game. Speaking of synergy between <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> and Baronne de Fleur if you needed to use Baronne de Fleur's omni negate on your turn you can in the <strong>opponent's Standby Phase</strong> use the effect of returning to the Extra Deck and Special Summon Diviner of the Herald and use its trigger effect and send a second <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> to the GY and add another Ritual Monster to the Hand. I'm still using <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> because I'm playing Megalith in <strong>Master Duel</strong> and there's no Baronne de Fleur in the game but for sure when he gets to Master Duel I'll use it in the deck along with Diviner of the Herald since it's the only way to you make an Omni Negate in Megalith's deck.  <a data-name=""Apollousa"">Apollousa</a> is a card that ends the Megalith, alone she can for all her play attempts. Interestingly if you use <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> + <a data-name=""Apollousa"">Apollousa</a> in Megalith's Extra Deck Apollousa has a <strong>great synergy</strong> with <a data-name=""Megalith Phaleg"">Megalith Phaleg</a> because it increases her ATK and that way you have a <strong>lot more negates to use</strong>. Speaking of LINK-4, the best option to finish games with this deck is <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> and not <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>. If you use the <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> in the deck, <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> can make really cool interactions, for example, even getting you to <strong>play around</strong> <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>, which is the best hand trap against Megalith and Ritual decks in general. Just in your first deck search do, for example, Ritual Summon <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> tribute <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> and do cl1 Benten Add <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> and cl2 Phul tgt <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> and add it to hand and that way when opening a new chain for your opponent to activate <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> you can deny it with Orange Light. However, as there is only one Benten in the game, having it available in the starting hand without having to pick it up is a very small chance and this interaction will rarely happen. This same interaction can be given throughout the game with the <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> when you do the <strong>first Ritual Summon of the turn</strong> because your Megalith will activate effect being cl1 like Ophiel for example, <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> cl2 Add Orange Light and <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> cl3 Add Benten and that way you have protection from <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>.  After understanding the combos better, despite Megalith being quite complex, you can see that there are several cards in the deck that <strong>play the same role in the combos with few changes</strong> in the way of building plays and the only real brick of the deck is the <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> that neither it's so harmful if it comes in the hand as <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a>/<a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> can also add <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> to the hand and even some hands can do Megalith Combo without needing the Impcantation engine because <strong>Level8 Megaliths</strong> can start their moves also. Thus, this is one of the most consistent Ritual decks in the game and, along with Drytron, the one that best <strong>interacts with the opponent during both turns</strong>. Certainly a fantastic deck, don't expect Konami to release something similar in the game, because it makes no sense to leave aside the Ritual Spell to make Ritual Summon, which is the great advantage that Megalith presents.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ////  <strong>Disregard the Side Deck</strong>, they are just card options that you can test in the deck or that is very common to see Megalith players using. Curious about the <strong>Megalith</strong> deck in <strong>Master Duel</strong> is that you can practically play it with <strong>full power in the ONLY N/R format</strong>, which makes this certainly the best deck in this format because of <strong>how powerful it can be compared to other decks</strong>. You don't have <a data-name=""Chalislime"">Chalislime</a> and <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> for example but there are still a lot of good combos left to do.  &nbsp;"

Prepared for possible future fusion event on Master Duel and some HOPIUM for Konami to add th,"Hello everyone. For the possible future fusion event for Master Duel I created this deck focused on summoning a blue-eyes fusion every single game, in hope of Konami adding the missing fusions for the blue-eyes archetype and <a data-name=""Ultimate Fusion"">Ultimate Fusion</a> which are not available in Master Duel at the time of uploading this deck. The strategy is simple but you are going to face options and choices that depend mostly on your preferences and your opponent's deck so my advice would be to test it against different decks if possible before expecting to win or summoning a fusion with 3 <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a> every game. Usually, you would like to choose between these two monsters to summon depending on your field and your opponent's potential plays: <a data-name=""Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"">Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon</a>."

Don't take the lists too seriously, it's just a skeleton. As a paleozoic frog player I think that one of the biggest problem of the deck is that we can't always end our board with <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>. <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> is a strong card that gives us an omni-negate that could stop strong combo piecies of the opponent or just protects our board or more importantly here our backrow. Cards like <a data-name=""Absolute King Back Jack"">Absolute King Back Jack</a> and <a data-name=""Rise to Full Height"">Rise to Full Height</a> already help a lot against s/t removals, but we aren't always be able to recover. I think that <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> could help the deck offering the same <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>'s protection. The key card behind this idea is <a data-name=""Hop Ear Squadron"">Hop Ear Squadron</a>. It can special summon itself from hand targeting a monster on our field during the opponent main phase and after that synchro summoning using it an the targeted monster. The plan is to put on board a paleozoic trap monster(really easy to do in the paleo rise/mill build) then during your opponent main phase summon  <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a>. <a data-name=""Melffy Catty"">Melffy Catty</a> is here in order to search <a data-name=""Hop Ear Squadron"">Hop Ear Squadron</a> and it's also a level 2 body for xyz summons. As I said earlier, this is only a list to show the idea or the deck. In the side I put some techs I'll test. I think I'll cut the frog engine. Put suggestions in the comments and stay tuned for next updated builds!"

Archfiend Guy here, bringing you all the Archfiend deck that I reached Platinum level with in Master Duel! If you are interested in an in-depth video of the deck, which breaks down the deck profile and related combos, then you can watch my <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/Y2cssS_jO_8"">deck profile video</a>  <strong>Deck style:</strong> Beatdown (Mid Range)  <strong>Important Concepts:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Potential vs True monster count</strong> <ul>  	<li>Archfiends float 1 or 2 at a time rather than spam multiple monsters. Because of this, your <strong>true</strong> monster count (what your opponent sees on your side of the field) is <em>not reflective</em> of your <strong>potential</strong> monster count (the number of monsters you have the potential to summon on any given turn). This makes it hard for your opponent to identify when they can push for game, as the <strong>number of monsters you can summon can be anywhere from 2 to 10+!</strong> Accesscode Talker usually cannot break through an Archfiend defence and it's important to tell you this before anything else as it is the main mechanic of Archfiends.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>Description:</strong> The main focus of Archfiends is to summon high attack monsters to beat over your opponent's monsters to win the game. They have the unique gimmick of being able to <strong>attack during your opponent's turn</strong> by using Dark Spirit of Banishment. Due to their high attack power, they usually have enough strength to attack over most monsters in the game. Additionally, Archfiends float very well thanks to their boss monster, Archfiend Empress. This monster, upon destruction, can summon any level 6 or high fiend from your GY to your side of the field. This effect is not once per turn! This means you can revive Archfiends multiple times in a single turn, so long as you keep reviving Archfiend Empress, which is easy to do with the Dark Spirit monsters, and Call of the Archfiend.  Archfiends also have access to Berserk Dragon, a 3500 ATK level 8 Zombie that can attack every monster your opponent controls! Its summoning Quickplay spell card, A Deal with Dark Ruler, is an Archfiend card, so is searchable through Archfiend Heiress. Thanks to Archfiend Emperor's ability and our link monster, Masterking Archfiend, Berserk Dragon is live often and has great OTK potential.  Archfiends also have the fusion monster, Archfiend's Manifestation, which is a 3k beater that can float into Summoned Skull.  Archfiends don't activate many effects on the field. Instead, they revive from the GY through the Dark Spirit monsters activating in the hand, or via Call of the Archfiend. They are mainly big beatsticks that build tall, not wide. This means that you tend to only have around 1 or 2 monsters on the field at any given time, and because of this, you can run powerful floodgates such as Skill Drain, Gozen match, Summon Limit and Mystic Mine.  Generally, you want to grind out the game and win through attrition, similar to Unchained. Once your opponent has exhausted their resources trying to break through your wall of Archfiends, you can safely attack for game. Conversely, you can also OTK using Berserk Dragon or the Numeron Dragon OTK.  <strong>The ""goto"" strategy every game:</strong> Your priorities should be focused on putting at least two level 8 fiends into the GY, one of which being Archfiend Empress, and putting both Dark Spirit of Banishment and Dark Spirit of Malice into your hand. Once you have this setup established, you can efficiently float through several means of destruction. Furthermore, once your Archfiends die through a card effect, your Dark Spirits will recycle themselves back into your hand, which allows you to float consistently every turn. An ideal game state is to have both Dark Spirits in hand, with Cherubini on the field alongside Archfiend's Manifestation and Archfiend Empress. Cherubini protects both from destruction and Archfiend Empress can also protect Manifestation by banishing dark monsters from the GY. <table> <thead> <tr> <td><strong>Potential Combos</strong></td> <td></td> </tr> </thead>  <tr> <td>Tour Guide and Scarm in hand</td> <td>Summon Tour Guide and Special Summon Fiendish Rhino Warrior from the deck.

But the monsters are one of the coolest in the game, and I've been YGO-chilling with this deck for a few days and feel sooooo great and satisfying. You can also choose other cards in the side deck and replace them into the main deck, depends on your dueling style. Also help me improve this deck, as this is the first time of mine making a deck and it is needed to be improved. I appreciate all of your recommendation.  Enjoy the game Duelists. GET YOUR GAME ON!  P/S : I forgot to said that Eldlich cards can help you destroy or banish card on either field. Now that's another tool of card destruction. Read the card texts to know about these effects."

The Sneks are cool, alright?! We can't all run Swordsoul and Floowandereeze!","The second variation of the Chaos Ogdoadic deck I made previously. This time, the deck contains a sort of Hieratic engine, only to promote tributes and special summons. This way, it is much easier to focus on searching Dragons (i.e. Levianeer) and going full combo without getting severely punished. It is also much easier to make an I:P Masquerena along with a Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres, because bouncing a card and getting an Apollousa on your opponent's turn seems pretty promising. The deck was also made this way to absorb impact from hand traps (i.e. D.D. Crow and Ash Blossom) while not being COMPLETELY all gas. Don't count your snakes out, either. Snake Rain + Water Lily is still a promising combo in this deck, as doing so turn 1 will leave more opportunities open (i.e. search Serpent Strike instead of 2nd Water Lily) to make a Hope Harbinger and Hyperyton."

The deck is tightly packed and more refined, but it doesn't have as much combo potential as the other two variants. It has the XYZ OTK engine in there, even though that is nothing special at this point. Also, less engine space means more room for hand traps. This way, it is much easier to focus on reptile control, but still not being completely punished by your opponent for trying to play the game. It is still easy to make a good enough board, and possibly a Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres, because, well, who doesn't want card bounce? The deck was also made this way to filter though the most prevalent engines while still not being COMPLETELY all gas. Your SYnchros really put in the work here, and can even be used for your XYZ and links once they fulfill their purpose. This is just a test, however, and personally, I think this is the second-best out of the three (I like Dangers, alright?). I might go with the Brave Token engine in the future, but for now I am focusing on Chaos Dragons."

Here some starting combos, tips on how to start yours plays:  <strong><em>Important notes:</em></strong> <p>- Don't activate the effects of Evil★Twin Link monsters (this turn you can only summon Fiends Monsters from the extra deck) until you have summoned I:P Masquerena or you will have ruined the combo. - You can search from the deck ""<a data-name=""Live☆Twin Sunny's Snitch"">Live☆Twin Sunny's Snitch</a>"" with the effect of ""<a data-name=""Secret Password"">Secret Password</a>"", which adds you a Live☆Twin monster when activated. - If your opponent denies you the effect of your Cyberse-type Live☆Twin remember that their Non-Cyberse-type versions can be special summoned if her twin is on the field.</p> <strong>Starting hand: </strong> <ol>  	<li><em><strong>A Cyberse-type Live☆Twin card +</strong> <strong><a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>: </strong>Cyberse-type Live☆Twin Normal Summon -&gt;

Once a naughty word, and the boogeyman of Yu-Gi-Oh!, now a decent budget deck for locals.","Salamangreat is a classic from 2019's so-called ""Eternal Format"". Once feared and loathed by much of the competitive landscape, after several nerfs and not being able to keep up with 17-negate boards, it fell far out of favor. It's still a fine rogue pick for your locals, though, and fairly inexpensive. The loss of 2 <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> hurt the deck's card advantage quite a lot, but an additional copy <a data-name=""Salamangreat Circle"">Salamangreat Circle</a> is an incredible boon for the deck. The compact engine allows the deck to play a robust hand trap package, and the particular hand traps you want to play in the main deck can be tailored for your local meta.  Salamangreat has the ability to put up a fight through the long game by constantly recycling interruptions and keeping the hand traps coming out off the top of the deck, threatening to grind out any deck not prepared to play a turn 3 or 4. Plus, since every monster in the deck (that you want to summon, anyway) is Cyberse, you can comfortably play under a floodgate like <a data-name=""Rivalry of Warlords"">Rivalry of Warlords</a> and still easily assemble lethal with a double-attacking, 5300 ATK <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> courtesy of <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> bringing back your <a data-name=""Update Jammer"">Update Jammer</a>.  Overall, this deck is a great budget option for the locals player who just wants to get out there and jam some games. Give it a shot, and surely you'll love it."

Standard full combo endboard is DPE + Babel + set Scythe + PUNK trap.  Opening E-Tele is full combo.  Opening Girsu or Scrap Recycler is standard board.

Compared to current common Orcust endboards, this isn't much fancier aside from having one more monster negate (PUNK trap) and Scythe lock possibly. The benefit of this build is that the Halq combo attracts the Ash, Imperm, and Nib before you have to Normal Summon (assuming you open E-Tele).  Common 40-card Orcust builds play 6 starters to get to Galatea (Girsu, Recycler)  This 51-card build plays 12 starters (Girsu, Recycler, E-Tele, Ze Amin) + letting you play around interruptions."

This will be the last build I'll be exploring for Buster Blader. For ful,"This is the third and last variant I'll be exploring for Buster Blader. Playing this deck, I believe that dropping Formula Synchron &amp; Satellite Warrior for Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss &amp; Crusadia Magius would be way more beneficial for Borreload Savage Dragon since you'll be sending Crystron Halqifibrax to the grave. Having Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman on the field would help in case you can't attack with Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman. You can use Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman to burn you opponent for Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman's attack points. Plus, having an extra negate with Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss feels way better. The reason why we need a 2nd copy of Crusadia Magius is in case the 1st gets destroyed. As usual, even with the previous builds, we utilize Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax with the protection of I:P Masquerena for going 2nd, to stall and to beat over and all special summoned monsters.  https://youtu.be/9qq6DrxCONQ"

Your main 2-card combo is Souleating Oviraptor and Babycerasaurus which if played correclty, can end on DPE, Verte, and UCT. This deck also utilizes cards like Fossil Dig and Small World to easily search your starters and extenders.

You can also try and go for the Draco Berserker OTK if you are going second. Most of the time, you want to open cards like Mo Ye, Longyuan, and Ecclesia to get your combo going. Cards like Emergence and Vessel provide you with a consistent way to search your monsters from your deck, allowing you easy access to both your starters and extenders. 1/4 of your deck (10 Cards) is composed of handtraps, which means that even on your opponent's turn, you can still negate your opponent's card effects and stop your opponent's plays. Overall, I think that the deck is very consistent and fun to play, so I highly recommend that you try it out for yourself."

Who needs warriors when you have Cyberse?,"""Code Talker""  This is an archetype that is rarely looked at and thought of as an archetype. Most people know our friends, <a data-name=""Decode Talker"">Decode Talker</a> and <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, who are members, but no one really knows the mountains of direct and incidental support this archetype has received over the years. Obviously Decode Talker is no longer the powerhouse he was in Master Rule 4, being the best generic Link monster to give yourself two more zones for Extra Deck monsters, but Accesscode has become <em>the</em> de facto boss monster for any deck playing Link monsters these days. Painfully generic and able to break boards and OTK like no one's business. But what if I told you there were more ""Code Talker"" monsters, and that they can be used to Extra Link, just like back in the good old Gouki days, only with fewer bricks in deck.  I can't describe the entire combo line, nor can I commentate on the sheer number of extenders the deck has access to, but DistantCoder, the Code Talker master, has been honing this deck for a couple years now, and he has a couple videos, which I will link <a>here</a> (deck profile) and <a>here</a> (combo tutorials). However, these are for an older build. The new build, posted below, can now make a triple co-linked <a data-name=""Tri-Gate Wizard"">Tri-Gate Wizard</a> and a <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> for extra protection, and I'll post a video of my own from DuelingBook to illustrate the new combo line <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/OMxGXWJu4w4"">here</a>.  One thing that is worth noting, though: <a data-name=""Small World"">Small World</a> is incredible in this deck. Since all monsters are Cyberse, but they all have different levels, stats, and attributes, you can go from any monster in hand to any monster in the deck. It's simply a great card that allows even the brickiest of hands (of which there are truthfully very few) to reach full combo and lock the opponent out."

First we got Main Deck:  2x Animadorned Archosaur-You do not want to draw this card most of the times, but it still can be a start of your combo in this deck with Babycerasaurus in your hand since it does trigger Babycerasaurus and also adds to your hand Double Evolution Pill but mostly, you want to get it from Miscellaneosaurus to your field after you use Miscellaneosaurus's hand effect that sends Misc to the graveyard and protects 90% of your deck from hand traps and then gives you ability to summon your Archosaur from Misc's effect.  1x Artifact Scythe-it stops most of the decks from playing the game, and in this deck, it doesn't have to be a brick in the hand 'cuz most of the times you do not want to go for Dagda+Anaconda 'cuz it takes away to much of your combo materials and stops any other plays you could've done instead of those two, so if you draw Scythe and you are not unlucky like me to draw: Scythe, Celestial, Dasher 1/3 duels (around once per match) then you should get to a good combo even if you draw scythe.  3x Babycerasaurus-you drew this and Archo, go for Double Evolution and Souleating Oviraptor, you summoned token through Lost World to your opponent's field and used Token Collector effect, you get a free Baby effect. This card is not once per turn and in this deck except this two ways you will most likely easily get to this card through Misc, Ovi, you will gain effect of it through Archo, Fossil Dig can give it to you, Lost World can trigger it with Token Collector in duo and that in the deck is alredy 30% of the cards that can give you advantage of this card that is not a once per turn card, which means it can be used with it's effect multiple times per turn so it being at three and adding 37.5% of drawing it on top of all of abilitys to tribute it and trigger it is incredibly powerful in this deck.  1x Destiny HERO - Celestial-part of the DPE engine that is also a +2 in every deck that uses DPE engine  1x Destiny HERO - Dasher-part of DPE engine which also gives you free special summon on your draw phase and is mostly used for Celestial's draw effect.  1x Dinowrestler Pankratops-this card is a one time Zoodiac Drident, it is a good going second card, but is also a good going first card since it can be summoned with the effect of petiteranodon.  1x Dogoran, the Mad Flame Kaiju-classic Kaiju, following the type since it can, good going second interuption with opponent's monsters like DPE, Dragoon (yes, I am seeing some Dragoons), Prank-Kids Battle Buttler etc.  1x Giant Rex-sometimes you will decide that you are on your period and that you want Laggia or Dolkka on your field after summoning the all mighty Ultimate Conductor Tyranno so when you banish this card with Double Evouliton Pill or for Ultimate Conductor Tyranno summoning condition it is automaticaly summoned to your field, and since sometimes you will have 1 Oviraptor on your field which is also level 4, this card is perfect for xyz summoning. It can also make Exciton Knight, Abyss Dweler or Dugares, which can with it's draw effect dig even more through your deck.  1x Miscellaneosaurus-first of all, it can be searched with something like Oviraptor. Now when you have it you can use it's hand effect to make your dinosaur effects unafected by any of your opponent's hand traps and effects which is perfect 'cuz then your opponent is not able to ever again interupt you during that turn. This card is also limited, otherwise if it was not and was unlimited like in the past, it would be played at 3.  1x Petiteranodon-if you use your Babycerasaurus's effect to summon this little guy and you tribute it on your opponent's turn with your Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, you get a free Pankratops that is one time Drident. Most of the times you do not want to draw it and want it on the field with Babycerasaurus's effect.  3x PSY-Framegear Gamma-if you are going second, this card is like one time impermanence, and if you are going first and your opponent uses something like ash blossom on your fossil dig or Engage or Terraforming, you can after negate also go into Framelord Omega which is like an upgraded version of zoodiac Drident which is curently banned.  Souleating Oviraptor-this is 1 of few starters you have, it searches your Misc, Misc triggers and summons Archo, Archo gives you Double Evolution and maybe triggers Baby, or if you are half unlucky Petiteranodon, then Oviraptor activates and get's rid of your Archo and gets back hopefuly Baby and on and on and on with all other combos.  1x Token Collector-if you use Lost World to summon token for your opponent to their field and then trigger Collector, you get a free monster on the field and since Lost World protects the tokens, you can for free destroy Baby from your deck to get a free monster to your field, and if you did not draw Souleating you can get it of the Baby, which is a good 2 card combo that I think cannot be negated with anything else except for Ghost Ogre.  3x Ultimate Conductor Tyranno-boss monster+soft once per turn book of moon+attacks all monsters your opponent controls+prevents link summoning.  1x PSY-Frame Driver-without it Gamma is unable to activate, so you have to have at least 1 in the deck.  1x Called By the Grave-it can on your turn negate a hand trap that is a monster and goes to gy as a cost like ash or ghost ogre (so imperm can still go through it, also can PSY) and it on your opponent's turn can also negate some kind of a graveyard effect or if your opponent has a copy of a card in his graveyard and a copy of the same card on the field, you can negate the card on the field by banishing the copy in the gy.  2x Double Evolution Pill-this card is on 2 'cuz we play 2 searchers, also you do not want to draw this card, you want to search it 'cuz of destroying part of Archo so it can trigger Baby or Petiteranodon.  3x Fossil Dig-it searches any starter combo piece you need in this deck, so it is pretty welcome at 3.  2x Fusion Destiny-as much as you want to get to it through Anaconda, that much you will want it in your hand and you will need as much copys as possible to legaly be in your deck.  3x Lost World-it gives your monsters protection from some effects like Forbidden Chalice and also can be combined with Token Collector to go for free Baby effect that can for free give you Souleating that can give you misc that gives you protection and Archo that gives you double Evolution Pill that can summon Conductor and also you can go into Abyss or Exciton or link Souleating and Token Collector into anaconda and Archo into linkuriboh and with Anaconda get the DPE. In my opinion it is solid two card combo.  1x Sky Strike Mecha - Hornet Drones-in my opinion Sky Striker engine is still a good engine since it can itself give you Dagda: with Engage you add Drones, with Drones you get a token and go to Kagari that gives you back drones and summons 1 more token which is level 1 so you can go into linkuriboh and then go to Dagda and all of this with this little engine. And now with no Normal Summons you go further with Dinos and at the start you get Scythe seted and since you will most of the times go into Anaconda for DPE, you alredy gave yourself an ability to lock your opponent's extra deck.  1x Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!-this card searches Hornet Drones and is the part of the Sky Striker engine  2x Small World-this card can literally search any card you want from your deck. There was not anymore place so it is on 2 and I think you will never see more than 2 except in 60 card decks.  1x Terraforming-is here to search Lost World and you alredy readed the combo.  Now for the Extra Deck:  1x Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer-it is a non-target destruction effect card that summons itself back in the next standby phase and is a part of DPE engine which is pretty powerful since it can be done over and over again every single turn and since you will mostly send Dasher and Celestial, both having a good effects so you can summon DPE, you will really be in plus with engine based around summoning this card.  1x PSY-Framelord Omega-it is a synchro version of DPE, just a little bit worse, but it instead of destroying (since some cards have good graveyard effects) it banishes from hand (which means your opponent would start with 1 less card).  1x Abyss Dweler-it stops Tenyi Swordsoul, Eldlich, Drytron comebacks, Tri-Brigade, DPE engine, Scythe engine...that is a lot of things that are in the current meta and only one card that is easy to summon can stop those from being what they are from 60% to 100%.  1x Evilswarm Exciton Knight-just a clean up after you seted everything with Tyranno's effect so you have a free attack into opponent's LP.  1x Evolzar Dolkka-negating a monster effect is pretty strong nowadays since most combos start with monsters and their effects and since this is not once per turn and the card has 2 materials, you can negate monster effect twice which can sometimes completely shut down whole combo.  1x Evolzar Laggia-this is 1 time walking Solemn Judgment (or the NO card) and Solemn Judgment itself is pretty powerful card, so negating a Normal Summon can, first be funny and second be really helpful. Negating a Golden Land/Eldlixir spell/trap is pretty good if playing against Eldlich, perfectly if you negate Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine that summons the Eldlich from the deck.  1x Gallant Granite-this searches Nibiru, if your opponent plays Prank Kids this is good and can be helpful in game two and three.  1x Number 60: Dugares and Timeless-this card's first effect is something you are looking for since it can make your combo longer sometimes if you of course draw the right cards.  1x Artifact Dagda-this puts Scythe on your field and after summoning DPE and resolving Scythe your opponent can just surrender, unless he is playing Altergeist or Eldlich or Dinosaurs that can get out of that situation and go into a fair respectfull board.  1x Dharc, the Dark Charmer, Gloomy-since Phantom Knight's are still a meta, it can take your opponent's Phantom Knight and make your combo a little bit longer, can give you Unicorn...  1x Knightmare Unicorn-it shuffles 1 card your opponent controls into the deck. Yes it targets but most of the cards are not unafected by targeting nowadays.  1x Linkuriboh-was always a good battle protection card and will always be a good battle protection card, and it can be also summoned with Archo as material.  1x Pentastag-you used Conductor's effect but you want to do more then 1000 damage, so if you summon this card that way that Tyranno is linked to it, you have a 3500 atk beatstick that can do piercing on every opponent's monster.  1x Predaplant Verte Anaconda-part of DPE engine.  1x Sky Striker Ace - Kagari-part of the Sky Striker engine  And now for the Side Deck:  3x Artifact Lancea-this stops Tenyi Swordsoul and Tri-Brigade decks, also stops Floowandereeze decks and it is that way good.  1x Nibiru, the Primal Being-is searchable, so you only need 1 if going first and you know your opponent plays something like Phantom Knight's or Prank-Kids, it is good to use this card on time.  2x Token Collector-in case opponent plays Swordsoul deck, this is a perfect card to stop that deck.  3x Twin Twisters-this card is good in this format since trap cards got some popularity and this card can destroy spell and trap cards, two of them, so Eldlich, Altergeist or something that plays traps is gone to this card most of the times.  3x Ice Dragon's Prison-mostly for Eldlich decks since Eldlich players for some reason play only two Eldliches, instead of 3 (dumb move Eldlich Players), you can banish both of those with this. Also Swordsoul can be stoped in some way with this and Phantom Knight's can be interrupted...  3x Summon Limit-goodbye Prank-Kids, goodbye Phantom Knight's. goodbye Tenyi Swordsoul, goodbye to any meta that special summons a lot, this card is their end.  I like this deck. It is the first Dinosaur deck I ever made and I hope there is not something bad within it. If you know a way how to make it even better tell me in the comments please."

A deck focused on using Blue Eyes to summon out powerful monsters from your Extra Deck. It's not really a great d,"<p>A super common way for you to special summon cards in this deck is from the graveyard, so do not be afraid to discard cards. Depending on what you have in your hands will greatly change how you play this, but this deck is also the famous ""Brick-Eyes"" where you can get a hand first round and realize, ""If he has Ash Blossom in his hand or Solemn Judgement on the field I lose."" This deck prefers going second as it has several easy set-ups into an OTK, but also can be completely wiped by any amount of negation. When going first, you have 4 plays;</p><ol><li>Get 2 level 8 cards on the field, Summon Draglubion, use its effect to special summon Heart-eartH Dragon, attach 1 of your Numeron Dragons as material. Heart-eartH dragon cannot be destroyed by battle and any damage you would take from battles involving the card your opponent takes instead. When the opponents turn ends their entire field will be banished, which leads you to using Draglubion to summon your other Numeron Dragon, attaching anything to it as material and than attacking your opponent directly for 18,000 damage. Even if they do get rid of Heart-eartH Dragon you can still summon Numeron Dragon, which means as long as there is a card in attack position on your opponents field you probably win, so this is still a very good first turn play.</li><li>Summon Blue Eyes Spirit Dragon in defense position. It can negate a graveyard effect once per turn and if it is targeted for an effect, you can tribute it to switch into Azure Eyes or Black Rose, which will essentially negate the targeting effect and prevent all of the dragons on your field (including itself) from being targeted until the end of your next turn.</li><li>Summon Chaos Max Dragon, it has a huge attack, your opponent cannot leave defense position monsters on the field and it cannot be targeted or destroyed by card effects. This isn't a sure fire win, it isn't your best option, but it is an option.</li></ol><p>&nbsp; When going second:</p><ol><li>Get Numeron Dragon on the field along with as many XYZ monsters as you can manage.<ol><li>Try not to special summon more than 4 times if you can help it, as the rock is a threat, but if you need to than you need to</li></ol></li><li>Get Neo Blue-Eyes on the field using either Greater Polymerization or Predaplant and just beat the living hell out of your opponent. It will be able to attack 3 times, cannot be destroyed by monster effects and deals piercing damage. It's a big 4500 beatstick that can deal 13500 damage in a single round</li><li>If you're running it, get Accesscode Talker out, best to do this through link climbing. This means climbing up from Link 1 or 2, to 3 and than into Accesscode. You'll than have 2 or 3 non-targeting pops to destroy cards on the field 5300 attack monster on the field.</li></ol>"

Maxx ""C"" generates so much value by punishing your opponent for playing the game. On the other hand, Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring is a way of hindering your opponent while they try build their board.  Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring is also used because its able to neagte the second most played stable Maxx ""C"", which would be the most played card if only Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring didn't counter it.  In order to combat this, I replaced a mid-tier stable for a hard counter for Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and Maxx ""C"". It's called Called by the grave. The Master Duel format only allows for 2 copies per deck so I replaced the 1 copy of Infinite Impermanence with Tachyon Transmigration as running 1 copy of a hand trap isn't ideal, but running a card that is better for going first, providing a free omni-/multi-negation is better than a card that can only target monsters."

Excellent support for the archetype included <em>Machina Citadel</em>, which functions as a quick effect board wipe of all your opponent’s monsters which is a very potent form of interruption. <em>Machina Overdrive</em> enables a circular resource loop between the banished pile, GY, deck and hand, while <em>Machina Redeployment</em> greatly increased the consistency of the deck. Newer support from main sets like <em>Unclaspare (R4NK enabler, free special summon and foolish burial)</em> and <em>Ruinforce (4600ATK beatstick and banish recursion) </em>have also greatly increased the power for this archetype.  The resulting support turns Machina from an archetype that was a jumbled mess into a compact powerful fighting force that can succeed in a grind game. Together with high impact staple trap cards and crippling floodgates, Machina functions as an anti-meta deck versus the combo-heavy meta! Control the game, simplify the game-state, then OTK your opponent in one fell swoop with your high ATK Machina army!  <a>If you want to see the deck in action, feel free to watch my Youtube video!</a> <p><span><strong>ARCHETYPES AND RATIOS</strong></span></p> The <strong>MACHINA</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 17 cards:  <em>1 </em><em>Ruinforce, 2 Citadel, 2 Fortress, 1 Metalcruncher, 3 Gearframe, 2 Unclaspare, 3 Redeployment and 3 Overdrive</em><em>. </em> This set of cards form the core of the deck, and once the cards in rotation, the monsters should rotate between the hand, field, GY and banished pile.  The <strong>HIGH IMPACT TRAP</strong>S in the Main Deck consist of 9 cards:  <em>3 Paleozoic Dinomischus, 3 Torrential Tribute and 3 Solemn Strike</em>. These trap cards are called “high impact” since they all can profoundly change the duel with their immense power. These cards are the most interchangeable cards between the sidedeck and maindeck.  The <strong>FLOODGATE TRAP</strong>S in the Main Deck consist of 9 cards:  <em>3 Gozen Match, 3 Rivalry of Warlords and 3 Skill Drain</em>. All these “floodgate” traps hamper or even completely stop your opponent’s ability to make plays, while at the same time allowing the Machina pilot to pop off. Be careful when using these cards, floodgates may stop your own gameplay as well!  The <strong>CONSISTENCY</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 8 cards:  <em>3 Pot of Extravagance, 3 Urgent Schedule, 1 Foolish Burial and 1 Super Express Bullet Train</em>. Pot of Extravagance may as well be a Pot of Greed since the Extra Deck isn’t needed much, giving the pilot a solid +1 for little cost. Urgent Schedule (With its main target being Bullet Train for extra resources) definitely gets your gameplan rolling as well, enabling a variety of plays with 2 free bodies on board.  The <strong>Extra Deck</strong> cards in this deck are mostly fodder for Pot of Extravagance and aren’t used much, but they still have some utility. It can be used for niche scenarios, field removal and to Machina on the field to the GY. Zeus also can be easily made with 2-4 matierials to wipe the field. It consists of:  <em>1 Zeus, 2 Liebe, 1 Super Dora, 1 Gustav, 1 Drill Driver Vespenato, 2 Gear Gigant X, 1 Heavy Armored Train Ironwolf, 1 Accesscode, 1 Knightmare Unicorn, </em><em>1 Knightmare Phoenix, 1 Dharc, 1 Qliphort Genius and 1 Double Headed Anger Knuckle. </em>  The <strong>Side Deck</strong> features cards that hard-counter popular strategies that are bad match-ups for Machina Control. It was made with Eldlich and Virtual World in mind.  It consists of:  <em>3 Artifact Lancea</em><em>. 3 Droll and Lockbird, 1 Harpie’s Feather Duster, 2 Twin Twisters, 3 Evenly Matched and 3 Solemn Judgment.</em> <p><span><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></p> The simple bread-and-butter “combo” this deck has involves normal summoning Machina Gearframe. It represents a “ROTA” and a “Foolish Burial” jump-starting your entire strategy while obtaining follow-up for the next turn. <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Gearframe. Search Unclaspare.</li>  	<li>Unclaspare summons itself when searched (locking you into machines), and on summon, sends a Machina from deck to GY.</li>  	<li>With Unclaspare’s on-summon effect, send the Machina of your choice (Citadel is usually the target, since it’s the deck’s main win condition).</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Gear Gigant X with Gearframe + Unclaspare. Detach material to search for another Gearframe from deck for next turn follow-up.</li> </ol> The cool thing about this deck is that it doesn’t feature long and complicated combos, since it’s mostly a “set 4 -&gt; pass” style of deck, making it simple to use! Even if this combo is interrupted, there are multiple ways to get Machina in the GY from deck with Foolish Burial, Urgent Schedule, and Machina Overdrive. Besides, you’re in no rush, since floodgates should bring your opponent’s plays to a standstill giving you plenty of time to set up.  The entire premise of this deck is to control your opponent with backrow, then beat them down with stronger monsters in a simplified gamestate. Remember to use every backrow to its full potential, using them at the most opportune time to stop an opponent. Even if your opponent destroys your Machina, they all have floating effects that occur in the GY.  <em>Fortress</em> destroys a card on the field when it is destroyed by battle and can handrip a card from the opponent’s hand if targeted by monster effect. <em>Citadel</em> summons itself from the GY when an earth machine is destroyed and can wipe the field by destroying your own machine – furthering your plays! <em>Ruinforce</em> can summon itself multiple times a turn given there is machines in the GY for it to banish and is an absolute POWERHOUSE during the battle phase.  If your opponent doesn’t outright surrender to the floodgates and Machina recursion, the duel tends to develop into a caveman style “unga-bunga” beatdown. If you’re a Yugiboomer like me who likes a simplified gamestate without much combo where all you do is destroy monsters by battle, Machina Control is the deck for you! <p><span><strong>THE ART OF FLOODGATES</strong></span></p> Hey Machina Pilot, you cannot just flip over floodgates rashly, here are a few tips to maximize pain on your opponent with floodgates! <ul>  	<li>Most Meta combo decks straight up lose when any one of the floodgates are flipped over. Protect your floodgates, and they’ll protect you!</li>  	<li>Monster reliant decks like Drytron, Tribrigade and Adamancipator die to <em>Skill Drain</em>.</li>  	<li>Multi-attribute decks like Virtual World, Flundereeze, Swordsoul and Dragon Link flop to <em>Gozen Match</em>.</li>  	<li>Multi-type decks and engines like Adventurer, Shaddoll-Invoked, Prank Kids and Sky Striker struggle vs. <em>Rivalry of Warlords</em>.</li>  	<li>Many decks use <em>Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</em>. To prevent this guy from coming back during standby phase, flip over <em>Gozen/Rivalry</em> during the draw phase.</li>  	<li>Many decks use the Adventurer engine. To prevent the engine from being used, chain <em>Gozen/Rivalry</em> to Rite of Aramesir. The player would be locked into the token’s type and attribute which are Fairy/Earth.</li>  	<li>Many decks use <em>Predaplant Verte Anaconda</em>. When the fusion danger noodle is summoned, chain Gozen/Rivalry to prevent the Dragoon or DPE from coming out!</li>  	<li>When an opponent reaches a part of their combo that doesn’t match their archetype’s type/attribute, flip over Gozen/Rivalry. For example, when Virtual World/Adamancipator/Swordsoul summons Halqifibrax, Gozen/Rivalry would lock them from summoning any other monster!</li>  	<li>Careful when using Gozen Match, it will lock out the earth/dark portions of your Machina Deck. It is better to be locked under Earth than Dark, since the Earth attribute offers more options for the Machina Pilot.</li>  	<li>When using Skill Drain, try to already have Ruinforce, Citadel, and Fortress in rotation in the GY, field and hand. These all cycle around to summon each other forming a resource loop, while their effects on the field are negligible. This trio are superior in a game of beatdown, since they are relatively easy to summon and are high ATK.</li>  	<li>Decks with built-in backrow destruction like Eldlich and Virtual World are bad-match-ups for this deck. Be sure to side appropriately when facing these them!</li>  	<li>If you’re facing a lot of backrow removal, side in Solemn Judgment or Anti-Spell Fragrance to ward off those pesky Lightning Storms, Cosmic Cyclones and Twin Twisters.</li> </ul> <p><span><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></p>  <ul>  	<li>Try to force out a simplified gamestate, where a grindgame is dominant. What this deck lacks in combo potential, it makes up for it in defensive control.</li>  	<li>Since this deck can summon 2 rank 10s easily with Citadel, Ruinforce, Super Express Bullet Train and Urgent Schedule, Machina Control can make Zeus. 2 material + Rank 10 Train + Juggernaut Liebe -&gt; 4 material Zeus.</li>  	<li>This deck obviously prefers to go first. However, trap cards are surprisingly good at breaking apart established boards! Most meta boards can be broken using floodgates backed up by high impact trap cards. Bait out negates, then obliterate your opponent’s board with the appropriate card like Torrential Tribute of Gozen/Rivalry. After your opponent’s board is sufficiently softened up, that’s when you can start using your Machina strategy.</li>  	<li>This deck can OTK in a blink of an eye, since due to the sheer offensive firepower of Ruinforce. This deck can also generate a lot of monsters with high attack on field with free special summons, while your opponent is hindered by your floodgates.</li>  	<li>Machina Control is fairly cheap as far as meta decks go. All that’s needed is the 17 card Machina core + Trap Cards + 15 Extra Deck fodder for Extravagance. Expensive cards can be replaced by cheaper alternatives and the deck won’t lose much power.</li>  	<li>Other cards for consideration in this deck that work excellently in Machina Control are Anti-Spell Fragrance, Lord of the Heavenly Prison, Ice Dragon’s Prison, Heavy Storm Duster, Waking the Dragon and Trap Trick.</li> </ul> <p><span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span></p> Nostalgic machine archetypes always have a special place in my heart ever since I’ve had cards like Machine King, Roulette Barrel and Mechanical Chaser from my childhood. My favourite archetype, Ancient Gears also are strong with recent support, but aren’t enough to reach meta status. Cyber Dragon reaches Rogue status, but only with the support of cards like Dragoon and DPE which aren’t native to the archetype. I wanted a pure machine deck that could do well while staying true to its roots!  When support for Machina with Mechanized Madness and other main sets arrived, I was super excited! Seeing Machina top tournaments for the first time with pilots like <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/machina-17/"">Kyle Galliw</a> and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/earth-machine-10/"">Elias Tsirogiannis </a>using a Machina cards was inspirational, to say the least. Using their decks as a base, I’ve made my own updated version of their lists, designed to absolutely tear into the current meta!  With Machina Control, may you strangle your opponents to the Shadow Realm with your paralyzing floodgates, high impact traps and seemingly endless Army of Machines. Dictate the pace of the game, simplify the board, then beat your opponent down with your Machina!  And with that, I’m totally bringing this deck to terrorize my next locals. &gt;:D GLHF Duelists!  <img class=""aligncenter"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/dsWFc2L.png"" alt="""" />"

And with the new support this is now easier then ever. One key note is to make use of ""predator counters"" which reduce you're opponents monster level to 1 and allow more effects to happen (basically uses you're opponents resources). Although it's not crucial to utilise them it boosts the ease to make and strength of you're end board. This naturally makes the deck better going second. The ideal end board involves as many fusions as you can spit out. Mainly; dragostapelia, triphyoveryutum and predator fusion dragon. I do however run a neos package, this summons rainbow neos which can remove all you're opponents monsters or backrow without destruction or targeting, which helps enable OTKs. And as a plus rainbow dark dragon can be summoned with this deck if you happen to open up with it, but this rarely happens. You could equally use DPE or dragoon. This build is a more ""pure"" ish build although I do recommend checking out ""Branded Predaplants"" which is a better version of the deck."

Surprisingly the new Archetype called “Magistus” came out soon after the “Spirit Charmer” was released in 2021. The “Magistus” archetype had a perfect synergy for the “Charmers” especially since they only rely on base from Attribute and Types. This deck is strong enough to be used in high Tier level on Master Duel or Tournaments(hopefully).... This build is very easy to obtain/play it and can be used for any newcomer duelist because most of the cards are actually straightforward for the combos which I already listed the key cards for anyone interested to play Charmer Deck.  Start with only using 3 simple Key Cards which is the only best I ever come out with for the Full Charmer's combos.  Just following the recommendation cards that are listed below. ___________________________________________  <strong>[Key Cards]</strong>: 3 Main Engine - <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a> - <a data-name=""Performage Damage Juggler"">Performage Damage Juggler</a> - <a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>  <strong>[Recommend]</strong> to Search/Use - <a data-name=""Lyna the Light Charmer"">Lyna the Light Charmer</a> (Hand) &amp; <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> (Spell/Trap Zone) - <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a> (Hand) - <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a> (Spell/Trap Zone) = <a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a> (Hand)  ___________________________________________  Once you finally set up your cards. You will proceed with the next step by activating “<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>” effect to send out “<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>” from your hand to the GY. Then use ""<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>"" effect to become Earth Attribute that allowed you to Summon “<a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend"">Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend</a>'' card from either hand or Deck by sending both “<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>” and “<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>” from the field to the GY, which make them to trigger of their effects by Chain Link 2 and bringing it back “<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>” from the GY to the field along with “<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>” by it own effect. Now you have finally had a chance to Summon “<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>” from either hand or Deck by its own effect. After that use “<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>” effect to search out “<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>” from your Deck then add it to your hand which is the only best Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF/Level 4/Light Attribute monster that can be able to search out by ""<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed - Dharc"">Familiar-Possessed - Dharc</a>"" effect when it Summoned by it own effect.  <strong>Reminder:</strong> Do not activate ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" effect during your turn when it Summoned to your field, it will disable you for summoning from the Exta Deck unless if you have too. (This is an Optional)  ___________________________________________  <strong>Tips</strong>: You might not actually get them from the opening hand with exactly cards. So I prefer you to try something else with different cards in your hand if one of the Key Cards are missing. You should better rely on your additional cards in your hand that might help you to set up your cards. Keep it in your mind that ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" is just an additional card to use Familiar-Possessed - Lyna's Effect to search out ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" from your deck to the hand.  ___________________________________________  <strong>[Additional] </strong>for more Consistency You can use ""<a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>"" as additional for ""<a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>"" or any Level 4 monster from your Deck like ""<a data-name=""Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre"">Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</a>"" or any Performage monster depending what card you need. Requirement: 1 any Spell card, except ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" card, if not, you can use it as well if you have too. I include “<a data-name=""Summoner Mon"">Summoner Mon</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Summoner Mon&quot;&gt;Summoner Mon&lt;/a&gt;k"">k</a>” from my Deck Profile since It actually works very well for any Level 4 monster.  ___________________________________________  The End Board got changed frequently due to lack of cards since I actually used Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon lately in the actual game which is not my original plan for this deck. So I came up with the new play style by giving you more options to play either ""<a data-name=""Number 106: Giant Hand"">Number 106: Giant Hand</a>"" or summon any link 2 like ""<a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>"" depending on any situation if you have more additional cards on your play to expand it.  I want to try something new in Master Duel with different cards that I have so it got changed especially from the Extra Deck.

The deck does a good job setting a solid first turn board, searches out the pieces well and can play through an Ash without falling apart completely. The most basic opening play requires <strong>Magicians' Souls</strong> (Searchable by Illusion of Chaos and by extension Preparation of Rites) and <strong>Aleister the Invoker </strong>(Searchable by Magical Meltdown and by extension Terraforming)  Normal Summon Aleister and search for <strong>Invocation</strong> (*If the search was hit by Ash Blossom just move on to the next part) Special Summon Magicians' Souls by sending <strong>Dark Magician Girl</strong> to the graveyard from the deck Link Summon <strong>Artemis, The Magistus Moon Maiden </strong>with Magicans' Souls Link Summon <strong>Predaplant Verte Anaconda</strong> with Artemis &amp; Aleister Activate <strong>Invocation</strong> and summon <strong>Invoked Mechaba </strong>(If Aleister was hit by Ash you skip this step) Activate Verte in order to pitch <strong>Red-Eyes Fusion, Dark Magician &amp; Red-Eyes Black Dragon</strong> and fusion summon <strong>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</strong> Activate Invocation in the grave shuffle it back into the deck and take Aleister back to hand.  The combo nets you 2 omni negates and ends with 4 cards in hand and sets up your graveyard to draw 2 cards off of Soul Servant (which you might have opened with in which case the hand would be 5 cards) That is the main opener but there are other shorter ones, and they weave into each other to mostly always end on at least Dark Dragoon.  For the side deck. If you would rather run a standard Ash + Crossout set up simply remove the Solemn Strikes, Timaeus and Apprentice for the general package. Timaeus and Apprentice will usually be the first to be sided out for whatever you want, and I wouldn't argue with going down to 1 Eternal Soul for the 3 of whatever you need as an out generally I side in <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> if I have to go second (These can also be replaced with Droplets, but the deck already discards for the negates and I don't have any Droplets)  other than that the side is pretty standard backrow hate except with Dark Magic Attack cause it's a searchable Duster."

This is the deck for you mate!  Solve linear equation in the middle of a duel or have fun melting the brain of your o,The playability of this deck is immense in my opinion. Highly recommended for novice players and maths enthusiasts in general. STRATEGY : :. Summon mathmech subtraction or multiplier.  :. Use the mathmech multiplier effect on the enemy target  :. If you have mathmech addition you use its effect on the mathmech multiplier. If you have mathmech addition use its effect on the mathmech multiplier. This not only increases your attack points but also doubles the damage inflicted on the enemy. Or use subtraction to decrease the ATK points of the enemy target xD.  :. Watch your opponent surrender on the first turn :)

It's basically an omni-negate that's stupidly easy to summon, requiring only a machine in the GY, and can easily be searched being an Earth Machine monster and also with the field spell. This opens up a lot of plays for the deck, even countering the devastating <strong>R O C K</strong> and also other impactful handtraps.

While the deck is a bit expensive due to demanding 3 Recital Starlings as well as a lot of SR rarity cards, it's cheap enough that you can rely on opening the secret pack they come from a few times to obtain the cards necessary, and craft whatever you still need.  Nerval exists in the deck as a searchable 1-of to make going into Bird of Sovereignty much easier to do, and going into a Stormwinds and/or Dark Simorgh can end games while on top of 2 more disruptions (Utopic Future Draco and Ensemble Robin), but can be taken out by preference. The deck can go 1st or 2nd very well with some minor tweaks to the deck to make one or the other better.  The side deck options are alternatives you can try out instead of some of the options in the main deck."

Enjoy developing the rock combos in which can summon the big boss monsters that sto,"-Always pick to go first if able.  -Always activate special summoning effects EXCEPT for that of Granite (adding a rock monster to hand is always going to be the better move).  -Always wait to use the Adamancipator spells until you run out of gas with the monster effects.  -Don't wait to get Fossil Fusion in grave to use Miracle Rupture, just use it right away to get the grave effects of Weather Soldier or Block Dragon.  -Your targets for Foolish Burial or Miracle Rupture will usually be Weather Soldier or Block Dragon with occasionally sending Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite if you open with Adamancipator Signs.  -Your targets for Extra-Foolish Burial will always be Fossil Warrior Skull Bone or Fossil Dragon Skullgar (typically Skullgar for the free fusion summon). The ONLY exception is if you drew monster reborn, in which you would send Skullgios or Skull King for the free boss monster.  -Your targets for Granite will usually be Adamancipator Seeker or Adamancipator Researcher, but if you've already activated both their excavation effects, you can add Block Dragon.  EXTRA NOTE: Feel free to switch out Infinite Impermanence for a different handtrap like Ash Blossom or Effect Veiler. As of right now, I like Imperm the best because it can't be countered with Called by the Grave and it can't be negated by Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess."

This deck uses Effect Veiler instead of Infinite Impermanence because it is a Tuner, which can help make the level 8 Synchros.  Phantazmay can help find the right Ursarctic monster, you need and puts a level 7 body on board.  Gadarla helps bypass various Barrier Statues because this deck relies a lot on Special Summoning, but you can also use Effect Veiler if you need to.  Nibiru can clear the enemy board and the token can be stolen with Ursarctic Big Dipper. It is also a Rock, so excavating it with Adamancipator Risen - Dragite can provide some removal.

Cheap non meta but still fun to play.,"<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_U0IXjzg9M</a>  &nbsp;  This is a fun cheap Phantom Knights Deck I only made it because I already had the cards left.  If I start first I summon Dante. There are a lot of options, cockadoo, junk forward, kagemucha + any lv3 monster, silent boots with gloves or cloak.  Use Dantes effect to send 3 card from deck to gy hoping phantom cards, repeat in turn 2 if dante is still on field.  Next step summon Rusty Bardiche. Therefore you need 3 dark monster. With Dante, Armageddon and Foolish Burial at least there should be some phantom card in your gy. There are several ways: Easiest: Junk/Cockadoo/Kagemucha +Boots + cloak/gloves on hand. GY options: banish Wing, Blade or Sword to summon a knight from gy so you just need two others on hand. banish cloak to get boots on hand. If theres no trap in gy banish boots to get shade brigandine and activate instant. banish gloves to send wing to gy, activate wing to summon a knight from gy. banish fragile armor so send Wing, Blade or Sword, or a phantom knight if you have already one of them in gy. Activate Bardiche to protect yourself with blad or sword, sending to gy cloak gloves or armor  Next step summon dark requiem. Your oppenent need to have min 1 monster and 1 other card on field. Activate Bardiche send 1 lv3 knight to gy and get rank up on field. Summon Break Sword (where Bardiche points to) just like Dante OR rescue ferret (1 phantom knight and another lv3 monster), but you need two phantom knights lv 3 in gy and/or as material (you already have 1 because of bardiche). Destroy 1 card with Bardiche if he has 3 cards or more on field. Activate Break sword to destroy himself and 1 card from your oppenent, but he still needs to have 1 monster open on field. Activate Break Sowrds effect in gy and summon two lv 3 kngihts (getting lv4). Summon Dark Rebellion activates his effect even the monster from your oppenent has 0 atk. In your oppenents tunf activae rank up and summon dark requiem where bardiche points to to destroy 1 card. If you can summon Rebellion before Break Sword its fine, with break swords you can destroy 1 card which is usefull when your oppenent has a lot of cards on field.  In general: Use Leviair and Mist Claw to get back banished monsters. With twin twister send to gy what you actually need there and destroy spell traps from you or your oppenent (both can be usefull). If you dont get Dante protect yourself with a evilswarm (summon knightmare in first round is also good start). here i got Wee With and Dharc in Extradeck, beause i had them already. With them its easier to summon Bardiche. If you dont have them play the snychros and a second Cockadoo (Cockadoo+ lv 3 for coral dragon activate coral summon another card from gy than summon sky dragon) and antoher copy of dark hole and dark eruption.  I love the Legendary Hero Decks, i play nordic deck and supported them with battle of Chaos cards (thats why i have dharc). I also have a elemental/destiny hero deck but now more than the half of deck isnt from legendary hero deck anymore...  Big upgrade of the phantom deck is 3 Knights of torn scale, Burning abyss (Cir, Graff and Cherubini) but theyre ""expensive""...cheaper alternative and still good support is Wee Withc, Knightmare Phoenix and Unicorn, Physic Tracker and Wheeler + Emergency Teleport.  &nbsp;"

Why is this? Simply put it that both companies are notorious at not only unoriginality and rehashing the same thing over and over; but also milking their same ideas to the point where the drops become crust instead of gold. While over the years we had some interesting occurrences from Ligthsworns to even Dogmatika; the fact that everything Dinosaurs touch becomes repetitive after awhile shows the reality with modern Yu-Gi-Oh and how Dinosaurs (as a whole archetype) symbolize corporate greed and how out of touch card design has it's consequences on it's own. That being said, the reason I went with the scrap variant was because it was the most recent to top at a YCS event with being at the Las-Vegas invitational back in February (with it finishing in the top 32 overall). Also while not directly aspired from this top 32 finished, I did concept some ideas for the sake of at least trying to find something new for Dinosaurs to try instead of repeatingly slapping the same gimmicks as hard as HEROs had the past few years.  With the DPE package being the mainstay for most of Yu-Gi-Oh and the epicenter of the current fuss in the TCG (besides the Adventurer Package); I had decided to go with <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> and <a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a> to either negate the effect before it happens, or to prevent it from repeating itself by stopping the special summong from the Graveyard. Another goody added in here is the Psy-Frame package: which includes Gamma + Driver, and <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Lambda"">PSY-Framelord Lambda</a> (a link-2 monster that allows you to activate psy-frame gear monsters from the hand whether you control a monster or not). The side deck featuring cards like <a data-name=""Token Collector"">Token Collector</a> and <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>are all checks and balances against decks like Phantom Knights, SwordSoul, and Numerous Adventurer packages running afloat. The Extra deck which hasn't really changed much aside from newest Charmer Link Monster (<a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a>), and maybe the super poly targets added in to keep Phantom Knights and other decks in checks at times. Then comes the scrap package, which features quite a mouthful to cycle from; but to put simply: you pop Scrap Raptor; Summon Chrimera off of the Raptors' Double Summon effect; Link Summon into <a data-name=""Scrap Wyvern"">Scrap Wyvern</a>, to special summon (preferably) <a data-name=""Scrap Chrimera"">Scrap Chimera</a>, to pop him to special summon <a data-name=""Scrap Raptor"">Scrap Raptor</a>, and pop one of your opponents cards. If that sounds like a waste of time that screams ""how do you do fellow kids"", then it obviously does, and Konami should feel ashamed and at least acknowledge that Dinosaurs ""felt"" more playable with or without this."

The goal is the get a Gryphon Rider and a Balerdroch on the field with Zombie World and Solemns ideally, but the different engines are perfectly capable of holding the games where you see one half of the deck. I like the idea of playing a maindeck focused Brave deck that doesn't lost to Scythe.  Let's go over the cards.  So I have a 10 card Brave package, pretty standard adventurer stuff, 3 Blue Girl, 3 Rite, 1 Gryphon Rider, 1 Adventure, 1 Dracoback. The last card is Foolish Burial, which is nutty in this card, but starts as a Rota for the Brave engine (while also finding Zombie World and Balerdroch when needed). I'd like more access to this engine, but near as I can tell Konami was wily with this engine, and realistically that's probably a good thing given how pushed it is in this form.  We can't activate the effects on the field of any monster we normal summon the turn we brave - we get around this by using graveyard effects, and by activating Banshee on the field on the opponent's turn when needed. You also have to sequence your plays right, since using Bloom locks you out of summoning Gryphon Rider as well. With that in mind, it is still pretty easy to put up a decent number of high quality interruptions very quickly with this engine. Because we are desperate for Zombie World, we're running 3 Banshee, 3 Zombie World, and Terraforming plus Foolish listed above. For Balerdroch we run 2 - you see it just enough in those numbers, and you'd rather end on Suck out of Bloom rather than just Balerdroch. You could replace 1 for 1 with the third Balerdroch if you're worried about grindier matchups with grave hate.  Next, I've got Pots. Weird mix, I know, but here's how I came to it. Initially I was running 3 Extra, but it didn't feel like enough ""go"" for me. I really wanted that raw card advantage, so I was on 3 Extra, but I decided to try 1 Prosperity in this mix. This immediately felt better in a lot of ways - the Brave engine gives you ways to pitch excess pots, and while Prosperity is usually weaker in this deck, I came to realize having 1 in the mix did up the consistency of the deck nicely. However, I was having some trouble in games where I saw multiple pots, since my Extra Deck got very thin very fast. I usually don't like Desires much, but in this deck you very often pull the whole engine out of the deck t1 before you ever even fire off Desires, and at 1 Desires if you play it smart it will almost never screw you. Again, raw cards are big here, and being able to actually pull those raw cards is important. However, I left the split, since Prosperity was fulfilling its niche quite nicely, and helps to mitigate from banishing all the Sucks or Link 1s or Barricadeborgs.  Interruption. Called is obligatory - ostensibly for hand traps, and useful there, but also just completely busted as an interruption. 3 Imperm is also kind of obligatory, and Imperm is basically the only Hand Trap I run these days. I think Solemns are also important here - Judgment helps stop sweepers from blowing out your field full of spells and traps, in addition to being a very powerful card and a decent chain ender in its own right. Strike is the ideal chain ender, this is the Countertrap that is good even going second, and having so many negates that pop is tight. 2 Ice Dragons Prison are insane here - they trigger Suck, and thanks to Zombie World also almost always have targets, and the card is already just an insane swing in a lot of common matchups before that. But I like the 1 Trap Trick in the mix over the 3rd, basically represents the threat of a third Prison, but also lets me stack an Imperm in the relevant column on the turn you set your backrow.  Accesscode is bad here, and still really good. But tbh you shouldn't have trouble grinding games out with this engine... assuming you can protect your threats that is.  Still tuning the deck. I'm up to 2 Adventure, and on just 3 of each Zombie World card with no One-For-One or Terraforming, just on most of my 2 card combos, trying to max my chances of the 3 card full combo payoff. One-For-One was hit or miss, but I feel like just running the third Bloom is usually better, and Terraforming was mostly a card I pitched for Adventure. With 2 Adventure you have slightly more, albeit slow, access to your engine while being able to stack your GY with Zombies, so it pulls dual roles, and you can even pitch a redundant copy to the first copy to recycle it with Barricadeborg. I still like 2 Barricadeborg even with a back-up Adventure, and protecting Adventure is still clutch, but the engine seems harder to disrupt this way, and the cost of running Adventure is low, in general, and especially in this deck. I'd love a 2nd Dracoback, since I've taken occasionally to using the token to make Slayer in order to get access to Balerdroch before making a 2nd token and then summoning Gryphon Rider, but this also now kills a lot of the grind game, since there's only 1 Dracoback, and Barricadeborg doesn't recover it. Still, I couldn't justify a 2nd Dracoback, the card is sometimes fine to see but is also kind of the main brick in the deck."

When Exosister came out in the TCG, the deck was streamlined into being just a <a data-name=""N&lt;a data-name=&quot;umber 39: Utopia Double&quot;&gt;umber 39: Utopia Double&lt;/a&gt;"">N</a><a data-name=""umber 39: Utopia Double"">umber 39: Utopia Double</a> enabler. Exosister is inherently flawed by the need for multiple generic extenders to get going, The Shaddoll Dogmatika engines work at a very strong way to lock your opponents out of the game, boosting the control power in a way that allows Exosister to crack back.  This list is very capable of making a turn 1 <a data-name=""Number F0: Utopic Draco Future"">Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</a> while also setting up Shaddoll and Dogmatika fusions in the graveyard with <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>. This in turn allows us to add and set <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, and to add <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, The Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis, The Knighted</a> to our hand. Pair this with a potentially searched <a data-name=""Exosister Vadis"">Exosister Vadis</a> from our <a data-name=""Exosister Mikailis"">Exosister Mikailis</a>, and we have 4 interuptions on top of locking out opponent out of special summoning more than once a turn with <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>. And if our opponent still can play (aka they drew forbidden droplet), we can also potentially go into <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a> on our following turn. Like most turn 1 decks, we focus on not letting our opponent play.  Due to our ability to activate <a data-name=""Exosister Vadis"">Exosister Vadis</a> on our turn, our ability to special summon multiple Dogmatika monsters (including Fleurdelis which permanently buffs all Dogmatika monsters when they attack), our link package, and our ability to lock our opponent from playing the game, our ability to OTK and attack relentlessly into our opponent is very strong.  Starters: Unlike alot of decks, there arent single cards that get us going. <a data-name=""Exosister Stella"">Exosister Stella</a> and <a data-name=""Exosister Elis"">Exosister Elis</a> can special exosisters from hand, or themself from hand respectively, but the deck really relies on what you draw for extenders. With that being said, <a data-name=""Exosister Pax"">Exosister Pax</a> could be considered a starter for its ability to pick a perfect Exosister to grab for your starting board, along with being an extender if you have a playable start already.  Extenders: For our main extenders, we rely on <a data-name=""Nefarious Archfiend Eater of Nefariousness"">Nefarious Archfiend Eater of Nefariousness</a>, a non once per turn summons as long as we control a spellcaster. Which means, they can almost always be playable on our board. We also rely on <a data-name=""Parallel Exceed"">Parallel Exceed</a> as a extender due to its ability to strengthen our access to 2 xyz monsters, as well as an overall consistency boost until we get the new support.  Dogmatika Engine: The Dogmatika engine that i chose to run was 2x <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a>, 1x <a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, The Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, The Virtuous</a>, 1x <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, The Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis, The Knighted</a>, 1x <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>,  and 1x <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>. This package ensures that can get Dogmatika Maximus on the board to send our <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a>, and <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</a>to get a search for our <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, and a summon of Ecclesia for Fleurdelis, or just to add Fleurdelis herself. <a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a> also has an ability to act as an extender.  Shaddoll Engine: Our Shaddoll engines consists of 1x <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, 1x <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a>, 1x <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a>, and 1x <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>."

You want to pay life points, and you don't want your opponent to touch you at all. Your starters for this deck are weird. You have <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Theriza"">Dinomorphia Theriza</a>, who grabs any Dinomorphia trap from deck, mainly <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Domain"">Dinomorphia Domain</a>. However you can also grab <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Brute"">Dinomorphia Brute</a> as a great secondary option if you already have domain. Another card that is solid for this is <a data-name=""Lord of the Heavenly Prison"">Lord of the Heavenly Prison</a>, with any other <a data-name=""trap"">trap </a>card he can safely grab your domain from deck. He is also extremely handy for keeping all of your other traps safe, especially the ones you want to keep like <a data-name=""Solemn Judgement"">Solemn Judgement</a> and <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain.</a>  Also it is important to note, that opening Skill Drain is just the best card, since most decks heavily rely on their smaller cards to do alot of movement to get into the bigger cards, Your most easily accessed cards are either 3000, or the main fusion you will be using Dinomorphia Kentregina with a whopping 4000 atk, not many things are gonna climb over her. She also floats which is amazing.  Your main Deck Dinomorphia monsters float into each other by banishing a trap which is still amazing, because you can utilize them to keep you alive. A simple strategy is to always banish your ""Card effect Protection"" traps if you do not have generic random traps in grave to use as cost for them.  Your best Named Traps in the deck are <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Brute"">Dinomorphia Brute</a>, <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Domain"">Dinomorphia Domain</a>, and <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Reversion"">Dinomorphia Reversion. </a>  <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Reversion"">Reversion is an amazing card as it can copy any Counter trap, i.e. Solemn Judgement and you essentially have to Summon Negates, and that is Super strong against most decks. Domain is a solid fusion from deck that, in this deck, has no real cost, and no restriction. Brute is your solid 1 for 1 removal that lets your dinos float</a>  Here is a  basic reaction example for when you have a simple game state and not the ""Best"" hand. You have a Set Brute, a <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Diplos"">Dinomorphia Diplos</a><a data-name=""Dinomorphia Reversion"">, and a Theriza in GY. Your opponent Normal Summons </a><a data-name=""Prank-Kids Fansies"">Prank-Kids Fansies</a><a data-name=""Dinomorphia Reversion"">. You can get rid of their first summon by using Brute to pop both diplos and fansies. Use the diplos in GY, banish the Brute, summon the theriza, use her effect, and grab a domain from deck. This does not include the other 3 possible cards you had in a starting hand. Lord of the Heavenly Prison + Solemn Judgement = can grab you any important trap, mostly domain from deck and if you already have domain, easily just grab any random solemn or </a><a data-name=""Dinomorphia Alert"">Dinomorphia Alert</a><a data-name=""Dinomorphia Reversion""> for Follow up plays. Alert can help you recover your dead fusions or back both of your level 4's you used for fusions, and then you can XYZ into and Evolz monster and now you either have a negate or if you decide to attack, make </a><a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS Sky Thunder</a><a data-name=""Dinomorphia Reversion"">.</a>  Remember in this deck, its High Risk and High Reward.

Extras like Skill Drain (most ideal simply because it's a one-time LP cost to shut down effects entirely) and Gozen Match, which is an ace-in-the-hole against decks that rely on many different attributes to be effective, can fill the gaps. Finally, finish up with Eldlich the Golden Lord or any of the XYZ summons, namely Gustav Max and Juggernaut Liebe, which can be a pretty crazy OTK combo given the right circumstances.  &nbsp;  I've had a solid experience running a similar deck on Master Duel, and so far it has translated well to TCG play."

Targets you can add for Dogmatika Punishment in the extra deck include Elder Entity N'tss, Wind Pegasus @Ignister &amp; Barbaroid, the Ultimate Battle Machine. You can special summon Barbaroid, the Ultimate Battle Machine from the grave using Cyber Dragon Nova. Use Barbaroid, the Ultimate Battle Machine's effect to deal burn DMG if his effect comes up.

I figured I needed to take a break from everything that is Yu-Gi-Oh considering both the meta game of the TCG and MD, and how absurd the secondary market is right now after doing some market watch, but I digress, I'm here now and I'm back with a fairly budget deck, Star Warriors/Combat Stars/Level 5 Warrior toolbox (??? I honestly don't know what to call this one lol.) As per usual, the side deck will be filled with cards that you might want to consider as either upgrades or substitutes but are not necessarily mandatory for the build.</span>  <span>So, why this deck? I've always been interested in making N/R rarity only decks in MD, and this just so happened to fit the bill, with the exception of a few tech choices but, it's whatever. Also, I've always wanted to make this archetype work.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck, and their respective alternative options, if any:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Tenma the Sky Star"">Tenma the Sky Star</a>, <a data-name=""Hayate the Earth Star"">Hayate the Earth Star</a>, &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Kaiki the Unity Star"">Kaiki the Unity Star</a></strong> - <span>These are your main stars (heh) of the deck. Hayate + Kaiki is pretty much a guaranteed <a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a>, and those two with Tenma and <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> is a guaranteed <a data-name=""Shura the Combat Star"">Shura the Combat Star</a>. Mandatory, no alternatives.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Assault Mode Activate"">Assault Mode Activate</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a></strong> - <span>Your standard Assault Mode package. Brings out any level 6-9 generic Synchro with the greatest of ease. The only close alternative I can recommend is pivoting into the Arcana Knights by adding x3 <a data-name=""King's Knight"">King's Knight</a>, x2-3 <a data-name=""Arcana Knight Joker"">Arcana Knight Joker</a>, x1-2 <a data-name=""Arcana Extra Joker"">Arcana Extra Joker</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Queen's Knight"">Queen's Knight</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Joker's Knight"">Joker's Knight</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Jack's Knight"">Jack's Knight</a></strong> - <span>This is just a free Level 5 LIGHT Warrior 2000 ATK body on board each turn (which sometimes becomes relevant with <a data-name=""Overlay Booster"">Overlay Booster</a> in which we play 2 of).</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a></strong> - <span>Your main win condition is a Fusion Monster so, you know...</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Feast of the Wild LV5"">Feast of the Wild LV5</a></strong> - <span>Your main win condition requires Level 5 or higher Warrior monsters so, you know... It's just a worse <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a>, but a <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a> nonetheless.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a></strong> - <span>Could be anything, really. <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>/<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>/<a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> as consistency/recovery pieces, <a data-name=""Fusion Deployment"">Fusion Deployment</a> or <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a> for the Arcana Knights, etc.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a> &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Shura the Combat Star"">Shura the Combat Star</a></strong> - <span>Your main win conditions. Idaten the Conqueror Star makes it easy for you to climb into Shura, so you don't really need 3 of him. This is also strange because Shura the Combat Star is ""supposed to be"" an upgrade from Idaten but somehow he feels weaker in testing? So, if you wanna make room for a <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a> if you also wanna play <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode"">Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</a>, one less copy of Shura the Combat Star won't hurt.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a></strong> - <span>Understandable. Flex spot, but I'd argue mandatory due to Dogmatika's existence.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend"">Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</a></strong> - <span>Just a good generic Level 8 Synchro. Also a flex spot.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Colossal Fighter"">Colossal Fighter</a></strong> - <span>Neat thematic boss monster, keeps on coming back when destroyed by battle. Mandatory if you want to play <a data-name=""Colossal Fighter/Assault Mode"">Colossal Fighter/Assault Mode</a>, which we don't really have an excuse not to since our deck is focused on Warrior-type monsters anyway.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</a></strong> - <span>We play some Xyz monsters. Could also be a flex spot, definitely not mandatory.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Tiras, Keeper of Genesis"">Tiras, Keeper of Genesis</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon"">Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon</a></strong> - <span>Generic Rank 5 Xyz monsters. The only alternative for either or both of them is <a data-name=""Constellar Pleiades"">Constellar Pleiades</a> and <a data-name=""Shark Fortress"">Shark Fortress</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></strong> - <span>These two should always go together. Not mandatory, but if you have them, there's no reason not to use both. Gets over a lot of Towers monsters like <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a>, and is a non-targeting, non-destruction removal upon getting rid of.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Gaia Saber, the Lightning Shadow"">Gaia Saber, the Lightning Shadow</a>, <a data-name=""LANphorhynchus"">LANphorhynchus</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a></strong> - <span>The latter's just removal coverage, LANphorhynchus is just a ladder to Avramax, and the former is just a generic Link 3 and a flex spot.</span></span>  <span><strong>Testing and Closing Thoughts</strong></span>  <span>It's... okay. It's not competitive by any means but, it does what it wants to do, at least. If rogue tier is consisted of decks whose viability to be pushed past rogue depends on its pilot, this is a deck whose viability to be pushed into rogue status depends on its pilot. It's not the fastest deck there is, but if you just want a cheap beat down deck for Master Duel then hey, you know. Just slap a bunch of generic staples that you currently have access to in this deck and you'll probably be just fine, I think. Overall, all I really wanted is to make this deck work, and I think I can be satisfied with this. Surely this could still be improved upon, but it's not that I'm gonna stop testing. Also, who doesn't like taking breaks from playing meta time to time? If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

Magical Musketeers are an off-meta deck, being able to disrupt almost anything your opponent throws at you given the right hand and draws. The Magical Musketeers all have 2 shared effects: 1. You can activate ""Magical Musket"" Spell/Traps directly from your hand on your opponent's turn. Being able to wretch out a counter trap or monster negate from your hand is PRETTY GOOD if you ask me. And number 2. All the Main Deck monsters have effects when a spell/trap is activated in their columns, which means they kinda play like Mekk-Knights, which is pretty cool.  We know how I do this. I explain the monsters, then the Spell/Traps, then the Extra deck monsters.  Anyways, the monsters. We're running the popular combination of handtraps: Ash Blossom and Maxx ""C"". I really shouldn't have to explain these cards, they explain themselves in their text and gameplay. Super powerful and can single-handedly turn a bad opener into a devastating hand. And then there's Dragon Buster Destruction Sword. You will only use this is a stupid combo with Cherubini and Union Carrier.  Now, the Magical Musketeers. We have 3 Capsar, 3 Doc, 3 Starfire, 2 Kidbrave, and 1 Calamity. Caspar is possibly the strongest main deck Musketeer. When a spell/trap is activated in this lad's column, you get to search a ""Magical Musket"" card from your deck given its a name that wasn't activated in the chain and resolve. He can search either a monster, spell, or trap, so his utility is amazing. Doc adds a Magical Musket card from your GY to your hand when a spell/trap is used in his column. He's the Caspar of the GY, which has its uses, being able to recycle powerful spell/traps or the link monster I'll explain later. Starfire special summons a Magical Musketeer from the deck given its Level 4 or lower. Which is fair, because being able to special Mastermind, a Level 8 with a powerful end of turn effect to draw cards equal to the number of Magical Musket spell/traps you activated that turn. Kidbrave allows you to discard 1 card to draw 2 cards. Baby Graceful Charity is still decent, but not as good as selecting cards you want to add to your hand, so that's why we run him at 2. Calamity reborns a Magical Musketeer from your GY when a spell/trap is activated in her column. It has utility, but not enough to run at 3 or even 2. Plus, we can search her with Caspar anyways, so 1 copy is fine.  Now, the Spell/Traps. Most of these cards are the generic power cards, so I'll go over them first. 1 Raigeki, 3 Pot of Desires, 3 Cosmic Cyclone, 2 Called by the Grave, and 2 Forbidden Droplet. I'm not gonna go into extreme detail about them, I'll just briefly explain what they do and why I ran them over certain cards. Raigeki pops all your opponent's monsters. Pot of Desires banishes 10 cards from your deck for you to draw 2 cards. ""Why not run Extravagance or Prosperity?"" Because we enjoy our Extra Deck. Like, A LOT. We have extremely powerful cards in it that I don't want to get rid of, so I use Desires instead. Cosmic Cyclone allows you to pay 1000 LP for a Spell Speed 2 Spell/Trap banish. You can run Twin Twisters in this spot, but I'd rather not discard potentially game-winning starters and spell/traps to pop 2. Plus, Eldlich is a pain, so banishing cards is great! Called by the Grave is your way of saying ""I don't like being hand-trapped today, thank you though."" You usually never wanna get Ash'd with this deck, so running this card is a must. Forbidden Droplet allows you to send cards in your possession (field AND hand) to be able to negate the effects and halve the ATK of monsters equal to the amount of cards you sent. It also has the added bonus of your opponent not responding with cards if you sent cards of that type to the GY for the cost of the card. Which means theoretically, this is a Spell Speed 3 spell, which Spell Speed 3 is only for Counter Traps. You can honestly run Forbidden Chalice or Infinite Impermanance instead of this. Any of them are fine.  And the last of the main deck: our Magical Musket Spell/Traps. 3 Cross-Domination, 3 Desperado, 3 Last Stand, 1 Dancing Needle, and 1 Crooked Crown. Cross Domination is the archetype's ""Forbidden""-type quick-play spell, being able to negate any monster's effect and set their ATK value to 0. Desperado pops any face-up card on the field. Dancing Needle banishes up to 3 cards in any GY and banishes them. Its good for proactively banishing problematic cards in your opponent's GY. Crooked Crown allows you to special summon a Magical Musketeer from your hand and if you do, your opponent can't summon a monster in their monster zone in the column that your Musketeer was summoned in.  Now its time for the Extra Deck. Not gonna lie, space was a little tough trying to balance out the extra deck. At first, I wanted to run a Utopia OTK package with Utopia, Utopia Double, and Double or Nothing, but it didn't come up a lot, so I chose the Buster Lock, with Cherubini, Union Carrier, and Dragon Buster Destruction Sword. If you wanna go all in for this, I recommend running Cir and Graff, both Burning Abyss monsters. I did it without them because I think we have plenty of Level 3's Anyways, we got 3 Magical Musketeer Max, 2 Phantom Knights of Break Sword, 1 Abyss Dweller, 1 Tornado Dragon, 1 Bagooska, 1 Cherubini, 1 Knightmare Phoenix, 1 Union Carrier, 1 Masquerena, 1 Knightmare Unicorn, 1 Crusadia Avramax, and 1 Accesscode Talker.  Magical Musketeer Max is the strongest card in this deck. Going 2nd and summoning this card is a potential +5 in card advantage, which is INSANE for a Link 1 monster. When he's Link summoned, you can special summon Magical Musketeers from your deck equal to the amount of spell/traps your opponent control or he can grab Magical Musket spell/traps equal to the amount of monsters they have on their field, given the spell/traps have different names. Break Sword is a Generic Rank 3 Xyz monster that can pop one card you control and they control. I'll be honest, most Rank 3 Xyz monsters in the game are awful, so I think Break Sword is the one worth running. Abyss Dweller shuts down your opponent's GY effects for an entire turn as a Spell Speed 2 effect. Crazy. Tornado Dragon is a Spell Speed 2 Spell/Trap pop. Bagooska is the best stall card when it comes to Rank 4's, so we run him as a last resort when we need a turn or 2 to hopefully turn the tide. Cherubini and Union Carrier solely exist to perform the Buster Lock with Destruction Sword. If you want this to be consistent, run Cir and Graff in the main deck like how PK Rhongo Turbo uses them to get into Cherubini and other important Rank 3's. Knightmare Phoenix and Unicorn are Spell/Trap pops and card bounces respectively, as long as you discard a card for cost. They are generically good link-climbing monsters. Crusadia Avramax is a Link 4 Boss Monster you can build up to, and it doesn't let your opponent target it with card effects and their monsters can only target him for attacks. Oh yeah, and when a special summoned monster attacks him, he can gain ATK equal to that monster's ATK during damage calc. Note that this is once per BATTLE, not once per TURN. And he floats into a shuffle when he's sent to the GY because of the opponent. And finally, Accesscode Talker. I have nothing to say about him. You should know he WILL end your game if summoned.  I'll go over possible inclusions for this deck that I didn't have: Utopia OTK package (Utopia, Utopia Double, and Double or Nothing), Graff and Cir (to help the Buster Lock), and every possible going second tool. This deck LOVES to go 2nd, so including cards like Lightning Storm, Harpie's Feather Duster, Evenly Matched, Dark Ruler No More, etc. are EXTREMELY good choices if you wanna go for it.  Anyways, that's it for these weirdos with guns. Have fun playing a mildly infuriating to go against deck and hopefully this guide helped you!"

Then, you can trigger the effect from the GY to get yourself back a monster (Cyberse Gadget gives you a token and Dotscaper Special Summons itself back to the field). Then, you're going to link away the Token//Dotscaper for a copy of Link Devote. Then, you're going to use Link Disciple's effect to tribute the Link Devotee to draw 1 card, then stack a card from your hand to the bottom of your deck. Then the effect of Link Devotee triggers since it was tributed, which gives you 2 tokens. Finally, you're going to link away the 2 tokens for a copy of I:P Masquerena. Along with this combo, you also run an Eldlich engine. With your Eldlich engine, you can also set lots of traps to interrupt your opponent's plays. Both of these engines allow for a great going first board and an equally great follow up. You also run the DPE package along with the Artifact Dagda + Sctythe, which stops your opponent from special summoning from the Extra Deck."

Scenario 1: Going first setting up a Scythe lock (typically the ideal scenario when going first)  The goal here is to get Scythe into the grave by the time your opponent's MP1 starts.  Example starting hand w/ out Adventurer: VW Lulu, VW Lili, VW Qinglong, Forbidden Droplet, E-Tele.  I like to start w/ a bait here, so I will typically open with the E-Tele to try and draw out an Ash to clear my way to go full combo.  However, the best play is to activate the Qinglong, then go for the Lulu Special Summon (SS) targeting Qinglong.  If that goes through, we continue.  If that gets negated, we are OK because we can still Normal Summon (NS) the Lulu further down the line.  Follow up w/ the SS of Lili, dumping a Nyannyan and a Chuche.  Now we are going to NS the Lulu, activating the effect of Nyan from grave to SS as a lv3 tuner.  If there is a serious concern about Nibiru here, you can hold off on the Nyan summon as we will not get the omni-negate in this scenario until our 6th summon.  If not, then proceed w/ the Nyan SS.  Activate the Chuche, bump up the Lulu to lv6, XYZ into Beatrice.  Activate Beatrice, dump Water Enchantress.  Activate Enchantress, get the Rite, go full Adventurer combo to get token &amp; Gryphon + Dracoback.  Now we have Beatrice (w/1 material), Token, Gryphon, Fateful, Dracoback on field, E-Tele and Droplet.  Activate E-Tele to go get Lulu, then if you have not already activated Nyan we can now activate from GY to SS.  Synchro Gryphon and Lulu into Baronne, pass turn.  On opponent's Standby, first activate Beatrice to detach the material and dump Artifact Scythe.  As a follow-up, in a separate Chain, activate Baronne to SS the Scythe sent to the GY.  If there is a negate activated, use Baronne's ability to omni-negate.  Boom - no ED activity from your opponent on that turn."

YOU WILL BRICK, but when you get a good hand you can OTK or outlast yo","Goal is to get out as many Lv. 8 monsters to Xyz into Draglubion --&gt; then get out Hope Harbinger for spell negate or Numeron Dragon for damage. Lots of revive cards so getting Blue-Eyes in GY helps. Spirit dragon negates GY effects, and you can use its effect to get Azure-Eyes out to protect your dragons. Duplicates of Xyzs mainly used as ammo for Draglubion's effect. Heart-eartH and Zeus used defensively. Not sure when new Blue-Eyes support will be added to Master Duel but will definitely make it into the deck. Add more hand traps if you can afford it.  Spirit of White can pop an opponent's Skill Drain if you chain its second effect to tribute it for a Blue-Eyes in your hand (skill drain only affects cards on the field).  Brick-Eyes is a problem, add draw cards if you have them. You can also use Cards of Consonance, Trade-In, and Burst Stream as bait set cards if you can't use them at the time (you'd be surprised how many people will waste back-row clear on them). Ash Blossom kinda ruins your plays, so add Called by the Grave if you can afford it.  True Light 's risks can be somewhat negated with either Azure-Eyes or Ultimate Creature of Destruction.  Future fusion used primarily to dump 5 cards to graveyard (white stone and blue eyes using 5-headed dragon as target) for effects and combo with RotDL.  &nbsp;"

First turn you can use Junk Connector to get a Lv. 2 in the GY then bring him back with Junk Synchron to get Junk Speeder. You can also use Synchron Carrier to get an extra normal summon for Junk Synchron. If you already have JS you can use Tuning to get Satellite Synchron for the Special Summon when you use JS's effect.  Revive spells and traps work well with Doppel Warrior and Satellite Synchron's effects.  If you can get out Clear Wing, Stardust Dragon, and Black Rose out at the same time you're pretty well set.  Synchronized Real can either be really good or absolute trash depending on when you draw it --&gt; might be worth switching out for handtraps.  Traps are mainly just what I had available, feel free to swap out for better UR's like Imperm. Paleozoic can be used to dump a Lv. 2 to the GY and its second effect can be comboed with Doppel Warrior or Satellite Synchron."

Ratio of Madolche cards in the deck is pretty much perfect, though if you need room you can remove 1 Magileine and maybe run Madolche nights if you feel you need another target for Salon. Side deck includes a number of cards that i have tested and consider good valid options depending on the meta. Madolche Promenade is to me the most important card of this deck and by far the best and most underrated Madolche card, it gives you a searchable negate and made all other madolche traps either obsolete or just mostly redundant in the case of nights. It gives you a GY play to add Brickingcess as a material to your boss monsters and it's the most consistent disruption you have. It's a shame it's once per turn.  You really don't want to be running more than 1 ticket. 2 Chateau does give you some other plays but it loses you consistency. 3 Salon is redundant. The boss madolches are all fine at 2, no reason to run 3 of any of them as you can recycle them easily if needed. Brickingcess's crucial as XYZ mat for Chocolat as well as the best target for Petingcessoeur to combo into Tiaramisu or Glassouflé that said you don't want to draw into her at all, hence the nickname and why you only want 1 copy of her.  Barrier statue is an excellent floodgate that stops your opponent but not you, though it costs a normal summon, Rescue cat is something i'm testing and it gives you a 1 card combo to summon two hootcakes to overlay into Leviair and maybe bring back a banished Anjelly as well in the process, though beware it won't work if you have used Petingcessoeur's effect in the same turn, but you can still use her effect afterwards.  Currently waiting for some new cards to be added, namely Small World and Vernalizer Fairies so i can improve madolche's turn 1 board, as it is the best you can do is usually Sistart + Glassouflé with a face up Salon and a set Promenade. It's very consistent and not bad, but not enough to deal with meta and not even remotely close to the oppressive boards most modern decks can do turn 1."

ChengYing synergises so well with Eater, Orochi (that we have as a 4 of with foolish burial)... It s kinda crazy.  Super poly can be played in this deck, but you'll have to save extra deck space for it.  Kaijus are playable but you miss space. That's why I used Lava Golem. Ra Sphere mode does not work here because it needs to be normal summoned and clashed to much with the castle.  Another idea is to use mind control to get back lava golem (it's level 8) or any monster from the opponent that could be treated as lvl 8 for XYZ summon the new Vampire xyz monster...  The side is mainly going first cards, which you'll need if you win the first game going second.  A lot of option for a great and modern Gren Maju Deck!!"

By integrating several different engines this deck has been going through <strong>changes over time with the arrival of new supports</strong>. The most recent were <strong>new Machina cards</strong> which is the main focus of this decklist. But in the future they saw more cards to improve the deck's roof even more like Therions' archetype that basically brings an <strong>omni negate</strong> <a data-name=""Therions' &quot;King&quot; Regulus"">Therions' ""King"" Regulus</a> to all decks that put <strong>Machine monsters in the GY</strong>. Also the Therions' allow you to <strong>loop Omni Negate back to the field</strong> thanks to the archetype's field spell <a data-name=""Therions' Ring, the Colosseum Saucer"">Therions' Ring, the Colosseum Saucer</a> so it will definitely make a big impact on the TCG as it already does on the OCG in decks like <a data-name=""ABC"">ABC</a> and <a data-name=""Sky Striker"">Sky Striker</a> for example. The week I'm posting this decklist was also announced a Fairy-type archetype that interacts with Earth monsters in a very interesting way called <a data-name=""Vernalizer"">Vernalizer</a> and that is definitely another addition to Infinitrack Machina. It's because this deck is <strong>constantly changing</strong> that I see it with gigantic potential to be one of the best decks in the format in the future, I have no doubt if it gets to big tournaments. Speaking specifically of the decklist below, the main additions are: <a data-name=""Machina Unclaspare"">Machina Unclaspare</a> and <a data-name=""Machina Ruinforce"">Machina Ruinforce</a>. The interesting thing about <a data-name=""Machina Unclaspare"">Machina Unclaspare</a> is that it allows you to make moves with only <a data-name=""Machina Redeployment"">Machina Redeployment</a> that previously could only be done with a <strong>3-card combo</strong>, such as making RANK-9 <a data-name=""Phantom Fortress"">Phantom Fortress</a>, RANK-10 S<a data-name=""uper Dora"">uper Dora</a> at the same time as having <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a> Outstanding to make your opponent think twice before trying to destroy your monsters. The fact that you make this move of <strong>sending a Machina Monster to the GY</strong> and then doing RANK-4 <a data-name=""Gear Gigant X"">Gear Gigant X</a> is also a great <strong>interaction bait</strong> if you have plays behind and the opponent spends hand traps on these cards. Overall <a data-name=""Machina Ruinforce"">Machina Ruinforce</a> is being used more because it's a forfun version of the deck because I don't think it helps the deck in the grind game in the same way as cards like <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a> that I'm not using in this version because I prioritize accessing the new boss monster from Machina archetype. If I were using a more competitive version <a data-name=""Machina Ruinforce"">Machina Ruinforce</a> would be <a data-name=""Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a> and that way I would go back to using RANK-8 <a data-name=""Dingirsu,"">Dingirsu,</a> in the Extra Deck instead of the second Super Nova. I've been told that this deck is very good if used with more than 40 cards but I particularly like to use as few cards as possible in my decks to fit a <strong>lot of tech cards</strong> even more in this format that if you don't use at least 12 tech cards you will suffer a lot against <strong>Adventurer Token</strong>, <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> and Good Stuff engines like <a data-name=""Rose Dragon"">Rose Dragon</a> engines to make very strong combos with <a data-name=""Halqifibrax"">Halqifibrax</a> and <a data-name=""Auroradon"">Auroradon</a> accessing several Synchro Monsters Omni Negate type <a data-name=""Borreload Savage"">Borreload Savage</a> and <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> and especially the best Synchro Monster in the game: <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a>.

Thanks to <a data-name=""Machina Fortress"">Machina Fortress</a> and <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a> the deck can <strong>play against floodgates</strong> like <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> and <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> because the Fortress when <strong>destroyed by battle you destroy a card that the opponent controls</strong> and the Citadel returns to the field every turn as a 3k ATK body and possible Raigeki Opponent's Field effect. Now if you yourself are using <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> and want to take it out of the field you can simply use LINK-2 <a data-name=""Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> eff s<strong>end Skill Drain to GY as Cost to Reborn itself</strong> to Field and start activating Monster effects.  A very <strong>simple OTK</strong> to do with this deck is you use <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ancient Gear Ballista</a> eff <strong>destroy your spell/trap to make opponent monster ATK/DEF=0</strong> and having access to RANK-10 <a data-name=""Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> you do 2k damage and then do RANK-11 <a data-name=""Juggernaut Liebe"">Juggernaut Liebe</a> and use effect to gain 2k atk and thus attack the monster with 0ATK and inflict 6k damage granting OTK.  The XYZ monster that has the LINK-1 <a data-name=""Goliath"">Goliath</a> as material is <strong>only protected from destruction by card effects while the Goliath is attached as material</strong> so if you detach it to activate the XYZ Monster's effect it will lose protection.  For some reason <a data-name=""Machina Ruinforce"">Machina Ruinforce</a> is a <strong>DARK monster</strong> so be wary of that detail because you can't Summon it to the field if it's under the restriction of <a data-name=""Infinitrack Brutal Dozer"">Infinitrack Brutal Dozer</a>. You also cannot shuffle it back to the deck with the <a data-name=""Infinitrack Tunneller"">Infinitrack Tunneller</a> effect.  <strong>Main targets to bring from the deck with Urgent Schedule (the choice depends on the gamestate of the match to know which ones are the most correct):</strong> ***Urgent Schedule = SS Harvester and SS Trencher = LINK-2 Ballista/Knuckle and have Trencher eff Reborn Harvester and eff Add Dozer  Urgent Schedule = SS Harvester and SS Citadel Urgent Schedule = SS Gearframe and SS Bullet Train Urgent Schedule =  SS Gearframe and SS Citadel  <strong>How to make decisions in some combos:</strong>  For example if you can do the Combo: Harvester + Redeployment + Discard ""Machina"" Card (Guaranteed to have Overdrive on the end board) You can decide instead of doing a full combo to just do the <strong>standard 1 Card Combo move</strong> - certainly thought of the opponent's deck expecting a lot of blind second cards post side deck. ***Redeployment discard Metalcruncher for example are already two excellent searches: <a data-name=""Machina Overdrive"">Machina Overdrive</a> and <a data-name=""Machina Fortress"">Machina Fortress</a>/Citadel so you can decide to play safe. ***Cool of having Fortress + Citadel is you discard Citadel to the GY and already have the interaction setup with the opponent.  It happens a lot that you do <a data-name=""Harvester"">Harvester</a>/<a data-name=""Heavy Forward"">Heavy Forward</a> <strong>Add 2nd</strong> <a data-name=""Brutal Dozer"">Brutal Dozer</a> even though you already have one in your hand thinking about the <strong>Grind Game and the interactions it will take this turn</strong>.  <a data-name=""Heavy Forward"">Heavy Forward</a>/<a data-name=""Harvester"">Harvester</a> 1 Card Combo = You can use <a data-name=""River Stormer"">River Stormer</a> in GY at the end of the Combo to get rid of <a data-name=""Heavy Forward"">Heavy Forward</a> if you have a <strong>full trap version of the deck</strong> and need space in the s/t zone.  Tip: If you draw <a data-name=""Machina Redeployment"">Machina Redeployment</a> with <a data-name=""Tunneller"">Tunneller</a> effect you can use it to add <a data-name=""Machina Fortress"">Machina Fortress</a> and <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a> and discard Citadel to summon Fortress and improve your End Board.  If you only use 1 <a data-name=""Trencher"">Trencher</a> in the deck and discard it to pay <a data-name=""Machiina Redeployment"">Machiina Redeployment</a> cost for example you will have to discard or summon cards like <a data-name=""Harvester"">Harvester</a> from the deck with <a data-name=""Brutal Dozer"">Brutal Dozer</a> and Tribute Harvester to summon the <a data-name=""Tunneller"">Tunneller</a> from hand and make RANK-5 River Stormer to the combo comes out complete.

No, I'm not playing the gimmicky ""+3 <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a>"" Yacine combo, it just is not as good as having both <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> on board. Also, for now I'll categorize this as just a ""Non-Meta Deck"" but it's no secret that Branded is already the best deck.</span>  <span><strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong></span>  <span>Why not? I love Fusion summoning, I love Fusion summoning more than once per turn more, and I love seeing the look at my opponent's faces as I slap both <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> on board after they Ash my Buster Whelp even more.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck, and their respective alternative options, if any:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a></strong> - <span>You don't need Magicians' Souls for the draw 1-2. You just need it to send Dark Magician to the GY, unless you drew a <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a> or an extra copy of <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a>, then sure you can pitch them for a draw. Good Ash bait, no real alternatives, except for x3 <a data-name=""Nemeses Corridor"">Nemeses Corridor</a> for a <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a> if you're playing in the OCG.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman"">Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Buster Blader, the Destruction Swordmaster"">Buster Blader, the Destruction Swordmaster</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Buster Blader"">Buster Blader</a> </strong>- <span>Your main Normal Summon. Searches Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman, which in itself is a 1 card Fusion Summon and Synchro Summon during your opponent's turn, and if your grip is blessed enough, could also end in a Buster lock. No alternatives for this build.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a></strong> - <span>Your main fodder for <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a>. Can search either <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge of Despia</a> or <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum of Despia</a>, for more interruption or recovery, respectively. No alternatives in this build, but you can cut it down to however much you like, although I wouldn't recommend it.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a></strong> - <span>You don't need more than 2 copies of Aluber and Ecclesia outside Despia heavy builds. I'd much rather Special Summon Aluber since Buster Whelp don't trigger upon being Special Summoned. No alternatives, standard ratio.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Celestial"">Destiny HERO - Celestial</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dasher"">Destiny HERO - Dasher</a></strong> - <span>YEP DPE. For you OCG players, just change Fusion Destiny to <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Denier"">Destiny HERO - Denier</a> and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Plasma"">Destiny HERO - Plasma</a>. More names = more access to DPE, you don't need Fusion Spells other than <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> here anyway.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a></strong> - <span>Yes, a Fusion Spell that uses Fusion Material from the Deck, go cry about it. ""Despia is a scam archetype, don't build it"" btw. Money well spent. No alternatives, standard ratio.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Paradise Branded"">Paradise Branded</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a></strong> - <span>Searches your Aluber, which searches your Branded Fusion, Paradise Branded, or Despia, Theater of the Branded. It's always good to have an archetypal <a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a> for any Fusion Deck so no reason not to play this card. No alternatives, standard ratio.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a></strong> - <span>A searchable <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a> that recycles your other Branded Spells/Traps from your GY and a searchable <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>. That should say more than enough. No alternatives in this build, but you can cut it down or bump it up to however much you like.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a></strong> - <span>Why play one or the other when you can play both?</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1-2 <a data-name=""Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman"">Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Buster Dragon"">Buster Dragon</a></strong> - <span>One of your main boss monsters, although technically all of your Extra Deck are boss monsters in their own right but I digress. It's also a floodgate against Dragon decks, or against anything in tandem with Buster Dragon. No alternatives.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion the Branded Dragon</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Lubellion the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion the Searing Dragon</a>, &amp; 1 <a data-name=""Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"">Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Your main Albaz targets. Albion Fusion summons by banishing materials, Lubellion Fusion summons by recycling materials, and Mirrorjade is a better <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>, which we also play one of. No alternatives.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Despian Quaeritis</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Masquerade the Blazing Dragon"">Masquerade the Blazing Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Generic Fusion targets in case you brick, for Despia, Albaz, and both, respectively. Could be anything you feel like splashing, like generic Super Polymerization targets, <a data-name=""Mysterion the Dragon Crown"">Mysterion the Dragon Crown</a>, <a data-name=""Dark Cavalry"">Dark Cavalry</a>, or <a data-name=""Dark Paladin"">Dark Paladin</a>, for example.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus"">Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus</a></strong> - <span>A <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> for Albaz. This card also searches either your Fusion Destiny or Branded Fusion. No alternatives.</span></span>  <span>Final thoughts:</span>  <span>This deck is explosive as shit. I tried my best to cut the ratios down to just 40 cards but often I just feel like handicapping myself by playing an apparently ""more consistent 40 card ratio"". Play 60 cards of this pile, it'll probably just work itself out just fine. Splash more cards like <a data-name=""Qadshaddoll Keios"">Qadshaddoll Keios</a> or <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> for <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> or <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a> for them filthy Drytrons, respectively if you want. Overall, I've been testing Albaz and Despia since their release, finding ways on making them work, and it still feels good to laugh at the deniers and finally overshadowing the was once overhyped Swordsoul and Flundereeze. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

This deck was conjured from the Abyss by me misreading Researcher.,"Okay, I have something to admit. This is the first deck I have made from scratch and its origin was me misreading Researcher and thinking its effects applied to Megalith cards.  However, I did realize that they synergized incredibly well with each other so I decided to throw all logic and caution to the wind and it went excellently. Then, when I realized that the deck was a weird number in between 40 and 60 I decided to bring it up to 60 cards and decided to use Thunder Dragons because Colossus is a really good card and it is criminally easy to summon. So with that all thrown together, I set this beast loose on the ranked ladder of Master Duel and I started getting really easy wins and only had one game where I actually bricked fully, and even then I probably could have stalled for time but I had obligations and didn't have time to wait. This is what I would consider an almost perfect version, but the versions I played leading up to this still worked just fine.  &nbsp;  So the strat:  Really you are just playing three decks at the same time and they all loosely work together to further each other. I'd say about 70 percent of the starting plays involve Megaliths and summoning Granite and have a Phul on the field. Then you get Researcher and hope you hit a crystal, If you don't I'd recommend going into Leonite in an attempt to hit either Seeker or Friends, Ideally, I'd be playing Signs but I don't have the CP to make them. If you want you can also just save the Phul and researcher to summon a Megalith on your opponent's turn to either disrupt or stall.  You can really just go from there and end up on quite a few good boards and it's highly likely your opponent will just surrender once you start comboing. There are probably quite a few different lines but I haven't played it for nearly long enough to find them out.  Ideal end board:  Probably something like Dragite, Borreload, Access, Titan, and Colossus, possibly Block Dragon. Or you could always just make Draglubion and Numeron swing for the game on the 2nd turn.  &nbsp;  Some questions that you might have:  Q: Should the Deck go 1st or 2nd?  A: Honestly either are good but I'd probably say 1st just to set up a strong board. I've had boards with 2 negates and Colossus in one turn.  Q: How expensive is the deck?  A: The Extra Deck is probably the most expensive part of the deck but a lot of the cards are staples such as Borrel, Unicorn, Accesscode, and Numeron Dragon. The main deck is relatively cheap with 18 SR's and 2 UR's but you can reasonably either pull them all from the secret packs or easily craft them, with Maxx C and Called By being staples.  Q: How does the deck play?  A: It's pretty easy, there are moments where some deeper thinking in certain moments would have been useful but in the end it didn't matter.  Q: How is it against meta?  A: So far the only non meta decks I haven't played against are Eldlich and Phantom Knights, but against all the others it was a pretty easy win.  Q: Longest Winstreak?  A: Discounting times I had to surrender due to other obligations or sudden disconnections, above 10, and still going strong.  Q: Ways to improve?  A: Learn the combos, replace friends with Signs, and replace miscellaneous cards with better versions, other than that my lack of experience in both playing the game and deckbuilding can't think of anything."

I would however consider and probably will change the Shenshen with a Borrelord savage dragon. The side deck could use some more work I am open to your guys's tips and comments. The combos are standard dino combos trying to get out the UCT and Omega to shuffle back misc as you overlay depending on who you are playing against.  A bit on my card choice and strats..  Shenshen is in the deck because he is unexpected in a dino deck but has a great effect locking your opponents GY and allowing you to shuffle back misc. Overtex can save you if Shenshen backfires and also has a great effect for blocking spells/traps, also you can send him to the GY with oviraptor and get a pill to your hand. Playing 3 babys?, yes I personally never found my self using petit for getting a pankratops and don't really see a reason to play him when he is a once per turn eff and baby is not so i prefer the third baby as he combos off great with oviraptor or misc from hand.  There is 3 Scrap raptors because him in hand can also be a huge combo with lost world which you have 4 of in you deck. Scrap golem is here to be used as an extra body for Apollousa and he is the only way to bring out Shenshen. Also I would love to swap x3 Chalice with Ashes but as I said it is kind of a budget deck. I think the rest is pretty standard."

Depending on what you pull at the start can change which strategy you can play though. If you pull a Ze Amin or an Emergency teleport you are almost guaranteed either a Foxy Tune or an Ogre Dance. However  If you pull both you can end you turn with a 3600 atk Amazing Dragon with either a Foxy Tune or an Ogre Dance. In addition Leviair the sea dragon is in place if an Amazing Dragon play isn't as viable as if your E-Tele doesn't play out correctly and you end up losing a key card such as Ze Amin or Sharakusai butv still have access to either 2 level 3 monsters or a Rising Carp as it can special summon back any lv4 or lower monster that is banished  As a support strategy the Mekk-kinights can be used as general strength support or effect if you are able to get out Spectrum Supreme.

That's incorrect.","As Brave Engine Prank Kids takes the stage, Prankers may feel like without the abused engine, you could not prank anymore. That's incorrect.  Don't get me wrong, the new set of cards baits the majority of hand traps which pretty much kill this deck, but who in the world would want to pay 500+ dollars for 9 cards that may be banned in 5 months.  I've tried countless variations of the deck, trying cheap versions but this one looks the more solid to me.  MAIN DECK  Let's start with the latest arrive: DPE. The card speaks for itself, it's broken as hell and even if you end up with a terrible board because of ash blossom, your fusion destiny is almost guaranteed to resolve and you'll have a reborning 2500/2100 1 card non targetting pop, and you may also special summon a monster and draw 2 because of his OP materials.  Coming to the spicy part, Prank Kids are a one card engine, you want to see at least 1 in your opening and or you'll almost certainly lose the game, so let's do some math. Everyone tends to put every kid at 3 except for rocksies and i agree with them, you dont ever want to banish one card even if you have to if you go with the pranks-line one card combo, so you'll sacrifice one rocksies for that. 3 places are pretty much considered any name (always adding drops or lamps).  That gives you 15 names in 41 totals cards resulting in a 91,22% of drawing at least 1 starting first which is pretty good, given that at 40 the chances increase slightly at 91.9%.  The rest of the cards are a bunch of hand traps and cards that just want to make sure your combo goes off.  For the hand traps you can go whatever you want, i personally dont like impermanence because if you draw it off pranks it's just dead, nibiru is just a godsend with a deck like this that struggles like hell starting second, ash is the best ht in the game in my opinion and ghost belle and meister are extraordinary against DPE(everybody uses him).  For ""extendenders""(with this I mean cards that guarantee you dont lose to mono ash on your first kid meaning a loss) you could increase crossout at 3 but if you draw it off pranks it is just a dead ass card like imp before, and all you want to draw are hand traps.  TDF is great if you are in a bad spot and you get nibirud, because at that point you'll have every butler name in your gy and you'll recycle resources which are crucial for this deck. Poly makes sure you end up with TOAD, goated card that helps you a lot and monster reborn could single single handedly recover the game, instant is another way of dodging ash, you summon weather washer, normal a kid and then go into doodle to chain block the kid in gy.  EXTRA DECK:  I fell like extra deck is standard, you play, sadly, 1 meow most important card of the archetype, 3 dodos(you could cut this to 2 but you often go with a combo that uses 2) 1 bow wow that gets you the butler and card effects invulnerability in your opponents turn, rocket ride can let you make disgusting things such as reborning dodo and bow, weather washer is autowin against control decks because people sleep on his effect, if they dont respond before battle they are gone and the last prank kid extra monster is Rip Roaring, you almost never go into this but against eldlich and control decks he is crucial and will win the game alone.  I just won't talk about Anaconda too much, just enjoy our time with it as long as it's not banned, if you have TDF you can go into verte with bow and a kid, and end up with DPE and butler, disgusting.  Toadally awesome doesn't need explanations.  Unicorn and Accesscode are essential in my opinion, if everything goes as planned in your opponents turn you'll have a board made of at least 2 prank kids, you go into dodo, trigger 2 little ones effect then go into unicorn, access black hole opponent and swing at least 5300: crucial.  SIDE  Side whatever you want and you know it's used a lot at your local tournaments, TCBOO it's insanely strong against certain decks and prank kids dont suffer it at all, i would have recommended 3 skill drains but since you are running dpe and verte its often an impairment.  Hope this helps, i also look forward in any suggestions.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The deck has been built around the Legendary Knights though they have been sided due to how well the deck can run without running those bricks. There are multiple engines / packages running in the deck that all contribute to how the Extra Deck can be utilized.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Deck Breakdown:  &nbsp;  Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight Package: Joker's Knight package with King's, Queen's and Jack's Knight along with Joker's Straight and Imperial Bower. Both Joker's Knight or Joker's Straight during the End Phase can recur back to hand from the graveyard by returning 1 Light Warrior monster from the Graveyard into rge deck. (Any Warrior from main deck can be returned from the graveyard into the deck to meet Joker's Knight or Joker's Straight recurring effect  because they are all Light Warrior's INCLUDING any of the Legendary Knights.)  Giltia the D. Knight - Soul Spear was recently added to contribute to the Joker's Package AND to also help Search Red-Eyes B. Dragon. (Giltia can also be used as tribute for Five Star Twilight along with Joker's Knight and Jack's Knight and can also be used for a Fusion summon fro Dark Cavalry and/or Red-Eyes Slash Dragon).  &nbsp;  Kuriboh Brothers Package: (Kuriboh Brothers including Kuribabylon with Five Star Twilight, Kuribohrn, Kuribandit, Magikuriboh, Skilled Brown Magician, Multiply, Detonate, and the Flue of Summoning Kuriboh). The Kuriboh's help search each other (Kuribahs' and Kuriboos' effect) along with helping search their own Spells/Traps (Kuribees' effect). Kuribandit, Skilled Brown Magician, Kuriborhn and Magikuriboh can all be brought out from the deck in several ways to assist in the duel  (Both Magikuriboh and Kuriborhn can be searched by Kuriboo's effect and be brought to hand and Kuribah's effect grants a special summon of any monster with 300ATK/200DEF onto the field after it or another Kuriboh monster on the field is destroyed by battle; All Kuriboh monsters in the deck are 300ATK/200DEF including Kuribohrn, Magikuriboh and Skilled Brown Magician). Kuribee's effect helps search any Spell/Trap with Kuriboh in its text (Five Star Twilight, Mulitply, The Flute oF Summoning Kuriboh, and Detonate are all searchable through Kuribee). Skilled Brown Magician serves multiple functions such as supporting the Kuriboh Brothers engine to even fusing with Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl into The Dark Magicians. Can also be used to make a Time Magic Hammer). Kuribandit is a VERY underestimated card. Kuribandit when normal summoned can be used as tribute during the End Phase to search the top 5 cards of the deck and add 1 Spell/Trap to the hand and send the remaining 4 to the graveyard. (Kuribandit works very well with Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight and adds any excavated Spell/Trap to the hand). Any of the DARK Kuribohs can also be used as tribute for Deck Devastation Virus.  &nbsp;  The Magicians, Palladiums, and Timaeus the United Dragon: Both Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl are the main Fusion targets of the deck (Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl are mainly to be used to go into the Dragon Knight fusion forms. Magicians' Souls may just be the easiest way to bring either Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl out of the deck yet Palladium Oracle Mana and Palladium Oracle Mahad both provide another route to bring Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl onto the field. Apprentice Illusion Magician adds another way to search Dark Magician and be added to hand. Magician's Salvation helps bring search and set Eternal Soul onto the field at a faster rate. Magikuriboh can be searched and brought out to either the hand or field through Skilled Brown Magician, Kuriboo, and Kuribah (After battle or effect damage Makgikuriboh's hand effect can be triggered to bring out Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl from either deck or graveyard and can be recycled from graveyard back to hand whenever a face-up Spellcaster you control is destroyed by battle or card effect. Timaeus the United Dragon can be special summoned from the hand by sending any Spell/Trap that mentions ""Dark Magician"" (A vast majority of Spells in the deck mention Dark Magician) is there to help get into any of the the Dragon Knight fusion forms through contact fusion.  &nbsp;  The Red-Eyes Package: As long as Red-Eyes Fusion stays at least at 1 in the TCG the Red-Eyes Package provides a-lot of synergy to this deck. The Black Stone of Legend can be used to summon out Red Eye B. Dragon but most importantly it can be used to push Red-Eyes B. Dragon from the graveyard back into the deck to avoid Red-Eyes Fusion becoming a brick. Red-Eyes Fusion has two targets in the extra deck (Red-Eyes Slash Dragon and Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon). If Red-Eyes Fusion is used to make Red-Eyes Slash Dragon ideally it is best to use Joker's Knight as the warrior fusion material because Joker's Knight can then be bounced back from the graveyard into the hand if there are any Light Warrior targets in the graveyard to recur Joker's Knight back to the hand. Red-Eyes Fusion can also be used to bring out Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon (the most abused path in making Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon). Any of the Red-Eyes monsters also serve as additional targets for the Magicians to go into Dragon Knight fusion forms in addition to there being more targets for the Claw of Hermos to make a Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword.  &nbsp;  Keeper of Dragon Magic: Keeper of Dragon Magic adds any ""Fusion"" normal spell ""or ""Polymerization"" from deck to hand (targets are Red-Eyes Fusion or Fusion Deployment) and helps add ways to go into the Dragon Knight fusion forms OR Red-Eyes Slash Dragon or Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon AND can help bring back either Dark Magician, Dark Magician Girl or Red-Eyes B. Dragon if any of them are in the graveyard as long as one of their fusion forms that lists on of them is in the Extra Deck when Keeper is normal/special summoned. Keeper of Dragon Magic also serves as another fusion material for for any of the Magician dragon fusion forms.  &nbsp;  Draw Power: Dark Magician Circle and Soul Servant serve as the main search/draw power cards of the deck. Even when Dark MAgical CIrcle does not add a card to hand it helps set up a card for the next draw. Soul Servant at Max power can draw 4 cards and helps search nearly all of the cards in the Magicians' package including any of the Spellcasters (with exception to Skilled Brown Magician) inclusively Timaeus The United Dragon.  Eternal Soul also helps thin the deck by searching out ""Dark Magic Attack"" and ""Thousand Knives"".  &nbsp;  The Legendary Dragons Package: Mirror Force, Ring of Destruction, Crush Card Virus and Tyrant Wing are strong disruption cards with a slight exception of Tyrant Wing. These Trap cards all serve a double purpose in helping disrupt through their Trap Card activation OR by going into they Dragon Fusion forms being Mirror Force Dragon, Destruction Dragon, Doom Virus Dragon and Tyrant Dragon by using The Fang of Critias. The Claw of Hermos serves like an equip spell toolbox depending on what Type of monster is used to make either Goddess Bow, Time Magic Hammer, Rocket Hermos Cannon, or Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword. The Eye of Timaeus helps The Magicians' Package in going into a Dragon Knight fusion form AND also increases Spell card targets for Timaeus the United Dragon to be special summoned.  &nbsp;  Fusion Deployment: Very simple yet very powerful card for any deck that focuses solely on a Fusion based extra deck. Fusion Deployment can be used to special summon Dark Magician, Dark Magician Girl or Red-Eyes B. Dragon from the hand or deck since there are various targets in the Extra Deck that list them as fusion material.  &nbsp;  Harpie's Feather Duster: The cream of the crop of staples. Destroys all spells and traps your opponent controls.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Side deck can easily be any other cards though I find that Spiritual Swords of Revealing Light, Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning and surprisingly Berserker Soul can also be main decked without them diluting much of the synergy already going on in the main deck.  &nbsp;  Thank you for the the interest! Please feel free to leave feedback!"

I have made some small changes that i think can improve it slightly. The strategy is to control the game with traps, which you recycle with Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon. Together with Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon, you also have Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon as your primary boss monster, and since it can also recycle itself, you have a lot of resources, which gives you a strong grind game. Besides Skill Drain, True Light and Dogmatika Punishment, the traps used in the deck are whatever you prefer them to be. A part from Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon, you're extra deck is kind of irrelevant when it comes to onboard presence, which makes the Dogmatika engine fit perfectly into the deck. Combined with cards like Elder Entity N'tss, you can make some cool plays with their graveyard effect. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>"

Whether it's resorting to Scythe Lock Turbo or playing Megalith or both. This is a really good thing. I always loved Drytron as a Deck, it's a cool concept and has lots of potential; only to be disappointed by how people abused it to make Ultimateness 4 Negates Turbo every single game. I was surprised and sad when I realized that Drytron boss monster is actually a ""balanced"" disco ball that says NO to everything your opponent do, and all it takes is a single Drytron monster to Ritual Summon it. Now I can finally see Drytron as a real Combo Deck that abuses generic Boss Monsters (like every Combo Deck does). So anyway, enough with this dilly-dally, now here's the Explanation of the Deck <h2>Combo</h2> Drytron is a very versatile Deck, so your Combo really depends on your opening hand. But here's a 2 card Combo anyways (Nova + Zeta hand): <ol>  	<li>Activate Nova -&gt; Summon Alpha -&gt; Link Alpha into Linkuriboh</li>  	<li>Activate Alpha in GY Tributing Zeta in hand -&gt; Search Benten</li>  	<li>Zeta Tribute Benten -&gt; Search Meteonis + Diviner</li>  	<li>Overlay into Mu Beta Fafnir -&gt; Send Gamma</li>  	<li>Normal Diviner -&gt; Send Arc Light -&gt; Search Phul</li>  	<li>Meteonis Ritual Phul -&gt; Phul add back Benten</li>  	<li>Phul Tribute Benten to Special Ophiel -&gt; Search Bethor and Idaten</li>  	<li>Synchro Diviner and Ophiel into Baronne</li>  	<li>Gamma Tribute Idaten -&gt; Special a Drytron from GY</li>  	<li>Meteonis add back to hand -&gt; Link Linkuriboh and 1000 ATK Drytron into Verte</li>  	<li>Ritual Idaten (detach from Mu Beta Fafnir) -&gt; add back Meteonis</li> </ol> Now there are multiple options that you can do: <ul>  	<li>Option 1: Link into 4 material Apollousa (Least optimal)</li>  	<li>Option 2: Overlay Phul and Idaten into Beatrice -&gt; Detach Idaten to Send Snow -&gt; Link Mu Beta Fafnir and a Drytron into Masquerena. (You can Masquerena into Apollousa during your opponent's turn after Snow Summon itself from GY). If you happen to have Natasha in hand or GY, Ritual Summon Natasha first to enable its GY effect next turn</li>  	<li>Option 3: Overlay Phul and Idaten into Beatrice -&gt; Detach Idaten to Send Delta -&gt; Delta Tribute Bethor -&gt; Draw 1 -&gt; Link 2 Drytrons into Masquerena. (You can Masquerena into Apollousa during your opponent's turn after Beatrice Send Snow)</li> </ul> The difference between Option 2 and 3 is that Option 2 guarantees you Snow while Option 3 can get Dropleted, while Option 1 guarantees Apollousa. Also don't forget to Verte effect because I didn't say it in the Combo Lines  There are multiple other Combos Drytron have, but I'm not gonna say it here, figure it out yourself by actually learning the Deck instead of memorizing a spreadsheet <h2>Deck Breakdown</h2> <strong>Main Deck:</strong> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""3x &lt;a data-name=&quot;Drytron Alpha Thuban:&quot;&gt;Drytron Alpha Thuban:&lt;/a&gt;"">3x </a><a data-name=""Drytron Alpha Thuban:"">Drytron Alpha Thuban:</a> Best Drytron monster; prioritize Searching Benten and Natasha (if you already have Benten), Megalith comes after, and Draconids comes last</li>  	<li><a data-name=""3x &lt;a data-name=&quot;Drytron Zeta Aldhibah:&quot;&gt;Drytron Zeta Aldhibah:&lt;/a&gt;"">3x </a><a data-name=""Drytron Zeta Aldhibah:"">Drytron Zeta Aldhibah:</a> Searches only 1 thing, Meteonis Drytron</li>  	<li><a data-name=""2x &lt;a data-name=&quot;Drytron Gamma Eltanin:&quot;&gt;Drytron Gamma Eltanin:&lt;/a&gt;"">2x </a><a data-name=""Drytron Gamma Eltanin:"">Drytron Gamma Eltanin:</a> Revive Drytron from GY, very important for Link plays.

But can play through disruptions pretty nicely, thanks to its consistency and Extenders. The consistency of the Deck is very high, like seriously. 10 non-Ritual Drytron monsters with 3 RotA and 3 Nova that Special a Drytron from Deck, and even Nova is Searchable with Fafnir. You also have Foolish which searches any Drytron. The Rituals are easily Searchable with Alpha, Zeta, Diviner, and Prep  Maintaining card advantage is also what Drytron's good at. After that 2 card Combo that I showed earlier, you still ends with hand neutral, 5 cards in your hand going first. The amount of searches this Deck has is just absurd. And Meteonis is very OP, Ritual from GY, seriously? The Drytron can also activate their effects every turn, like all of them, as long as you have a Drytron/Ritual Monster in hand. Drytron also can make Twin Twister and Droplet almost have no cost due to how it doesn't matter whether the Drytrons are in your hand or GY  One thing about Drytron that gives me the reason to play it is, fun and hard to play (this is subjective). I dunno why but playing Drytron without Ultimateness is very fun, the amount of possibilities of plays you could make is what makes it fun, but is also hard to pilot. Misplays happened very often due to that multiple plays you could make. Sometimes it's just hard to tell on which plays is the best. None of your Combo is as Linear as Pure Swordsoul, it's always unique depending on your opening hand  Drytron may not have the power it used to have, but it's consistency is still unmatched  And as always, this is not the optimal build. This is just how I build the Deck according to my liking. You can play Scythe Lock with Dagda if you wish so, noone will stop you from abusing such broken card. Enjoy it while you can, before Konami touch it"

Using Reprodocus will turn the ghostrick into a winged beast monster so that the bird sanctuary card can be attached to it and rank to the win condition of the deck. Being Lyrilusc these will be able to defend well either turn one or turn two being versatile to surprise the opponent.

Your game plan is to break any board and otk with a combination of Accesscode talker, one of your synchros, and Light dragon. If you can open with your field spell before you have to summon to search for it you have access to a draw 3 that will basically guarantee a victory. You could always fit more handtraps in but truth be told these are all I had, lowering the copies of cynet mining or Doyon would be okay if you wanted more disruption but theyre still vital so don't completely cut them.  You use A.I land to cycle through special summoning all your @Ignisters to load up the grave for Dark Templar. When Dark Templar hits the field you want to special summon one of three cards, Bururu, Pikari, or Doyon to the one of DT's link arrows and then summon the remaining 2 with his effect. This gives you access to synchro with Bururu who will also revive the other monster used to summon the synchro which will be a level 4 and if you have the other level 4 or Pikari on the field (Pikari can turn any @Ignister into a level 4) you can then xyz summon Light dragon. This gives you nearly Lethal but best case scenario you have a way to get a final monster on the board with your 3 revival spells or if you opened the field spell your normal summon, which lets you get a accesscode talker with 5300 attack. The Synchro your summon depends on what you are up against. If your opponent has backrow you need to pop you go into Pegasus, If you need to bounce a monster (even your kaiju back to your hand) you go into quantum dragon. Quantum is usually the best choice because of his effect and slightly higher attack. @Ignisters can also play with a pretty bad opening hand as long as they open at least 1 @Ignister and a revival spell (or achichi/Pikari for a search). The play is to open with an Ignister (preferably with the field spell so you can save your normal summon). Go into Infant, and then revive the Ignister you used to go into splash mage. Splash mage will allow you to revive that same Ignister to go into transcode talker (remember transcode can only be used if you have only used cyberse monsters this turn so no kaiju if you want to do this combo.). Transcode talker revive splash mage (or anyone) and then you can make accesscode talker with 5300 attack and 3 destructions."

I added some Critias card support because he can come in clutch to clear the board if you get into some trouble waiting for Chaos Form or get caught out. It's a very high risk/ High reward deck (I would add Bingo. Machine. Go!! and another Chaos Dragon but they're expensive and I wanted to keep this below 50 quid). The side deck also has Lair of Darkness with Ahrima if you want to be weird and go for the Starving Venom Fusion/ Super Poly disruption."

Opening with Aleister or Fallen of Albaz gets some crazy potential special summoning for the following turn which also gives big monsters on board. Fallen of Albaz can act as it's own Super Poly which can clear problem monsters. This is built around playing with friends who aren't the most meta players and love to not use any hand traps during play"

I say amaze because I never expected to ever see them topped at high level competition after Arc-V ended with a whimpering goatsee; but I also said disappointment because now you have more normies scrambling around and trying to turn them into the next Pendulum Magicians, but with worse results. That being said I prefer <a data-name=""Piri Reis Map"">Piri Reis Map</a> over <a data-name=""Small World"">Small World</a> for D/D/D. Why is that? Simply because it is easier to maneuver; it's easier to handle without having to take a valuable resource from your deck; and overall, it's just much more accessable to anyone despite halving your LP after the effect is used.  Now besides this hot take provided by a certain professional player who's top 8 is indeed earned at YCS Las-Vegas being out of the way, D/D/D has changed significantly since the release of the set ""Battles of Chaos"". In this set, we got cards like <a data-name=""D/D Gryphon"">D/D Gryphon</a>, <a data-name=""D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex"">D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex</a>, and <a data-name=""D/D/D Headhunt"">D/D/D Headhunt</a>; all of these which do in fact change up the game for this archetype to boost up their playability significantly. Another known thing about them is that they do an excellent job at being efficient with board building and making comebacks when being wiped from the field, which did happened in previous recurrences with Arc-V's version of D/D/D; but not as good as what we have now. Let's also not forget that this deck can play handtraps off the deep end, and dare I say it that it can Gamma the heck out of Nibiru; but I would've chose to play <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Lambda"">PSY-Framelord Lambda</a> if it were to meant cutting out a piece like <a data-name=""D/D/D Oracle King d'arc"">D/D/D Oracle King d'arc</a>, and/or a copy of <a data-name=""D/D/D Wave High King Caesar"">D/D/D Wave High King Caesar</a>.  The spells/traps are in usual D/D/D fashion with just the ones from the newest Yu-Gi-Oh set added, and <a data-name=""Piri Reis Map"">Piri Reis Map</a>. As for the side deck, Psy-Frame package is initiated because heaven forbid you don't get to go first or go get to pull a <a data-name=""D/D/D Cursed King Siegfried"">D/D/D Cursed King Siegfried </a>on turn one (or at any time for that matter) to stop the Adventurer engine from perfoming any field commotion whatsoever. <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> and <a data-name=""Token Collector"">Token Collector</a> are your go to side deck choices (as they were for the last few formats all thanks to Swordsoul and Adventurer players). <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a> is another piece that was added in case <a data-name=""Piri Reis Map"">Piri Reis Map</a> became irrelevant due to your opponent playing decks also brigading you with Hand Traps/Monster Effects played on your turn. The two Dark contract cards (<a data-name=""Dark Contract with the Eternal Darkness"">Dark Contract with the Eternal Darkness</a>, and <a data-name=""Dark Contract with Errors"">Dark Contract with Errors</a>) are both played in different situations depending on the deck your going up against; but I happened to use the first one mentioned more often simply because I didn't face Eldlich in the test duels I had to deal with. Finally comes the cardsRed Reboot and Called by the Grave: where they have slowly fell out of favour of being main deck staples, and have quietly became side deck staples out of their own leisure."

This version still allows me to run Crossouts, still gives me enough space to have Solemns in my side, and allows for the formation of a large Apollousa on the first turn via various hijinks brought about by Epigonen. I might want to mix this up a bit but I am partial to builds since it allows ABC to do what it did previously even better without making the strategy too bloated as might occur by relying more on summoning Anaconda and fusing via that card. Still, I plan on testing multiple builds and multiple versions of the same builds. I imagine even this build might be able to benefit from changes in certain card choices."

A lot of fun to be had, just don't be a tryhard. I'm experimenting a lot still, and this is just a work-in-progress build, so I'm open for suggestions.  The overall strategy is to banish Necroface as much as possible, abuse shiranui's banish effects, special summon nemeses to keep your deck higher than the opponent's and to get bodies on the field and maybe hit a kaiju to proc Inferno Tempest.

Firstly, before we start, you should know what kind of deck Sylvans are and what to expect.  Sylvans aim to excavate (also mill) their monsters, all of their monsters have an effect when they're excavated (for simplicity, whenever I mention 'excavating' hereon, that'll also mean milling, unless otherwise stated). Since each of their monsters has an effect of when they're excavated, their monsters also have effects that allow you to excavate, making getting started on your combos from just a single card that much easier. They aim to control their deck, you should think of your main deck as your second hand, as you mostly know the placement of each of the cards on top of your deck, so you can do a controlled mill in order to get where you want to faster and more efficiently.  Without further ado, though, let's get started on the deck list:  <span><strong>Monsters:</strong></span>  <b>(Note: There will be a number beside each monster's description, that is their level)</b>  <b>Sylvan Snapdrassinagon</b> - Snapdrassinagon is basically an extender for milling, as when he's sent to the GY (from deck, hand, or field) you can excavate the top of your deck. He's great for thinning out your deck when you need to, but he can be a bit of a garnet. He's only at 1 in this deck because he's not all that needed, but he can turn things around if you excavate a spell (more on that later). <b>[1]</b>  <strong>Rose Lover </strong>- Shouldn't be a surprise, Rose Lover is a great addition to pretty much any plant deck, as when she's in the GY you can banish her to special summon 1 plant from your hand, makes getting your plays off that much easier. <strong>[1]</strong>  <b>Sylvan Cherubsprout</b> - Cherub is the main target for Peaskeeper to be special summoned, since he's also a level 1 and when special summoned, you can choose to excavate 1 or 2 cards. His second effect is also decent, letting you special summon 1 level 1 plant-type monster from your deck (once per turn), making going into rank 1 XYZ monsters that much easier. <b>[1]</b>  <b>Sylvan Princessprout</b> - Arguably one of the more important cards, since both of her effects are really good. You can tribute her, excavate, and then place 1 'Sprout' (meaning only her and Cherubsprout) from your GY to the top of your deck. Her second effect basically just makes it easier to go into XYZ monsters, as when she's excavated you can special summon her and change her level from 1-8. <b>[1]</b>  <b>Sylvan Marshalleaf</b> - Marshalleaf allows you to excavate 1 or 2 cards when you normal summon him, making him a good starter. When he's sent to the GY, you can target 1 monster on the field and destroy it (not once per turn). <b>[3]</b>  <strong>Lonefire Blossom </strong>- Lonefire is a great starter or extender, you can tribute 1 plant monster (which will be himself 99% of the time) to special summon 1 plant monster from your deck. <strong>[3]</strong>  <strong>Flowerbot</strong> - Flowerbot has the effect of when he's sent to the GY, you can draw 1 card and then place 1 card from your hand on the top of your deck, so not only can you get rid of any potential garnets, but you can use him to know what you're going to draw.<strong> [3]</strong>  <strong>Staysailor Romarin</strong> - Romarin is an all-around versatile card that I couldn't recommend enough, since she has 2 good effects that allow you to pop-off. (Quick-effect) You can target 1 face-up plant monster you control and send 1 other plant-type monster to the GY to make sure it can't be destroyed by either battle or card effect once per turn. Her second effect is mostly what you'll use her for though, as when she's sent to the GY, you can send 1 other level 5 or lower plant monster from either your extra deck or main deck to the GY. <strong>[4]</strong>  <b>Sylvan Bladefender</b> - Bladefender is a decent card for the most part, mostly because when he's sent to the GY via excavating, you can add him to your hand. His first effect says if he destroys a monster by battle, you can excavate the top of your deck, but I don't know how often you'd be able to pull this off. <b>[4]</b>  <b>Sylvan Flowerknight</b> - Not much to say about Flowerknight other than he's a decent card, when he's normal summoned you can excavate the top card of your deck. You'll mostly want him for his 2nd effect, though, as when he's sent from deck to the GY, you can place choose to place 1 Sylvan card on the top of your deck. <b>[4]</b>  <b>Sylvan Guardioak</b> - Guardioak is an alright card and relies less on variables like Lotuswain (a level 5 that excavates based on how many cards your opponent controls) does. Once per turn you can excavate 1-3 cards from the top of your deck, and if he's sent to the GY by excavation, you can choose 1 card from your GY and place it on top of the deck. <b>[6]</b>  <b>Sylvan Sagequoia</b> - Sagequoia makes it easy to go into rank 7s, as he special summons himself from the hand when a Sylvan monster is sent to the GY, and (once per turn) you can excavate the top of your deck. He's also useful for retrieving your Sylvan spells/traps, as when he's sent to the GY from the deck, you can add 1 Sylvan spell or trap (from your GY) to your hand.<b> [7]</b>  <b>Sylvan Hermitree</b> - Although you probably won't have him on the field for long (mostly because you'll want to make rank 8s with him), when he is on the field you can excavate the top of your deck AND draw 1 card, making him a prime target for special summoning from the GY (more on that later). When he's sent to the GY you can look at the top 3 of your deck and change the order, making him useful for a controlled mill. <b>[8]</b>  <strong>Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy</strong> - Snowdrop is an amazing card for this deck, you can tribute 1 plant monster to special summon herself and another plant-type monster, making it good to get 2 bodies on field. You can also target 1 plant-type monster you control and all other plants you control become that level (so if you special summon her and a level 3, you can then use her effect to make the other card also become level 8). <strong>[8]</strong>  <strong><span>Spells:</span></strong>  <b>Mount Sylvania</b> - It's the only field-spell of the archetype, and it's a decent on at that. You can send 1 plant-type monster from your hand or (face-up) field to the GY and then place 1 Sylvan card from your deck on the top. During your opponent's end phase you can excavate the top card of your deck, making it useful to get in something like a Marshalleaf to pop a card.  <b>Sylvan Charity</b> - Sylvan Charity is a card you'll pretty much always want to run 3 of, because it's that good. You draw 3 cards, then if you have a Sylvan card in your hand (which you most likely will), reveal 2 cards (including 1 Sylvan card), then place those cards on top of the deck in any order. If you don't have a Sylvan card in-hand even after drawing, you place your entire hand onto the top of the deck in any order. This card makes it easy to get rid of any potential garnets and control your milling even more, while letting you get card advantage.  <strong>One for One </strong>- Hard not to put this in the deck, you can send 1 monster from your hand to the GY to special summon a level 1 from your deck, pretty much a must-have.  <strong>Foolish Burial</strong> - You can swap this out for something else, but you can just think of it as an extender, but <strong>do not</strong> use this to mill a card that's meant to be excavated first (ex: if you use Foolish Burial on Cherubsprout, his effect won't go off, since he needs to be excavated first).  <strong>Pot of Avarice - </strong>Avarice is also a must-have in this deck, as you can shuffle 5 monsters from your GY into the deck (which will be extremely easy in this deck) to draw 2 cards.  <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> - You don't really need me to explain this, do you?  <span><strong>Traps:</strong></span>  None, this deck list doesn't use any traps (for reasons explained below)  <b>Sylvan Princessprite</b> - Princessprite is an amazing card, not just because she's easy to bring out most of the time. You can send 1 monster from your hand or field (face-up) to the GY and then special summon a Sylvan from your GY, making getting your plays rolling that much easier, and you don't have to detach a material to activate this effect. You can detach a material from her to excavate the top of your deck, BUT if it's a spell/trap, you can add it to your hand rather than placing it on the bottom or top of your deck. <b>[Rank 1]</b>  <b>Orea, the Sylvan High Arbiter</b> - Orea is another really good card for the archetype, as you can send 1 monster from hand or field (face-up) to the GY to look at the top cards of your deck equal to the level of that monster and place them on the top in any order (ex: if you send Guardioak, a level 6, to the GY by this effect, you can look at 6 cards on the top of your deck). You can then detach a material, excavate 1-3 cards, and then return that many number of cards on the field to the hand (this doesn't target). <b>[Rank 7]</b>  <b>Alesei, the Sylvan High Protector</b> - You can declare 1 card name and then excavate the top of your deck, and if it's the card you declared, add it to your hand, otherwise send it to the GY. Very good card since you can almost always control what's on top, and even if you don't, milling is still useful. If a card is sent to the GY by card effect (this includes excavating your own card(s)), you can detach 1 material and then target 1 card on the field, place it on either the top or bottom of the deck. <b>[Rank 8]</b>  <span><strong>Potential Questions:</strong></span>  <strong>Why doesn't your deck list use any traps?</strong>  The deck is based around excavating and getting their monsters in the GY, spells/traps aren't milled and can prevent you from getting off some of your effects, the less you have the better. To make matters worse, Sylvan traps/spells aren't good, at all, so they have a negative impact on the deck.  <strong>The deck has no negation or ways to negate, how does that work?</strong>  It does struggle if you can't get some of your effects off, but for the most part it can play through negation if you have a decent hand (which the deck is made with being very consistent in mind, it just is a house of cards). If you want, you can replace something like 'Foolish Burial' and a 'Guardioak' with 'Dark Ruler no More' or something, Ash Blossom can work but chances are most of your copies will be milled.  <strong>What is the end-goal/end-board of this deck list?</strong>  This deck list is pretty consistent in pumping out monsters on the field (that includes XYZ monsters), it really depends. From what I've played, you'll mostly end on Alsei, Sylvan Princessprite, (possibly) Orea, Draglubion and Number 38. This deck has an insane amount of drawing power so as long as you go uninterrupted or can play through interruptions, you shouldn't have a problem with a decent end board. Feel free to change up the extra deck monsters."
