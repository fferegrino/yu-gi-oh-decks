Impcantations are what make this deck run so it includes monsters that get cards from the deck and that can get cards from the grave, additionally Chalislime and Preparation of Rites ensure you can work around negates, Impcantation Inception helps in removing Impcantations from your field so you can use your extra deck to possibly summon out a Blue-Twin Burst or a Black Luster Soldier with the help of Scape Goats. Even if Impantations stay on your field you are often left with normal summons to spare so there are several splashed cards to take advantage of this usually ignored benefit. Zaborg is the usual go to for summoning out as many ritual monsters as possible but cards like The Calculator benefit from this deck because you often have one lvl8 dragon plus multiple Impantation monsters which give it massive attack boost to OTK your opponent. Orgoth The Relentless can also be a massive monster that if youre lucky is indestructible and lets you draw cards. Ruins of the Divine Dragon Lords negates monsters effects the turn they are summoned which provides your dragons even more protection and there are cards like Mist Body that provide protection from battle. Because you'll have massive monsters with often attack to spare Twin Swords cuts their attack down slightly so you can attack twice and end even faster. Overall this is a big deck but after weeks of testing it out it is definitely more effective than the 40 card Chaos decks and is a lot more fun. Enjoy."

It has lots of synchro combos to help you summon these monsters as f,"This deck is built to summon powerful sychro monsters as fast as possible. Some of the main combos include:  -Red Sprinter+Red Resonator -&gt; Red Rising Dragon+Red Resonator -&gt; Red Dragon Archfiend  -Masked Chameleon+Archfiend Cavalry -&gt; Red Dragon Archfiend  -Vice Dragon+Dark/Flare Resonator -&gt; Red Dragon Archfiend  After summoning Red Dragon Archfiend, your best method of summoning your end goal, Red Nova Dragon, is through the use of Chain Resonator.  You can use Resonator Call to make this combo more reliable, and at this point, your Red Nova Dragon should be adequately boosted up with Tuner monsters in the Graveyard from the previous summons. While this is your main goal, the deck contains many other sychros that you can use as stepping stones to the bigger monsters if you need to so you avoid having an open field or risk your combos getting completely shut down.  This deck's main weakness is card effects that can shut down your powerful monsters. This is partially mitigated by Monster Reborn/Call of the Haunted, but if it becomes a problem, adding some protective cards may not be a bad idea.  This deck is a deck that I've been using casually against friends, so it does have some banned cards in it. The side deck has replacement cards if you're using it in a more formal setting. Overall, this probably isn't the most meta deck, but I'm not familiar with all the new summon types at this point because I just recently started playing again, so it's a style that I'm comfortable with. It is not built around the Link ruleset so that is something to keep in mind. Happy dueling, and let me know what you think!"

Future Tier 3 deck","<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGK_WQ4EHjo&amp;t=35s</a>  &nbsp;  Card Ratio explanations: <ul>  	<li>1x Aromage Laurier - You need to play a few Aromage monsters for a trap which enables distruption your synchros make so that you can activate the trap in a first place, If your lifepoints are higher you can summon, if you gain lifepoints 1 Plant monster can become a tuner, often a cost for a carrot</li>  	<li>1x Aromaseraphy Angelica- While your LP are higher it can revive itself if you control an Aroma monster. Again ultra conditional you need few targets. This card can also heal you so its a backup plan to trigger your plant synchros in case they pop your trap early</li>  	<li>1x Aromage Jasmine - Subpar additional normal summon if your lifepoints are higher, OPT draw a card if you gain lifepoints. the last target for a trap</li>  	<li>1x Glow up Bulb - a well known plant which really needs no explanation. Acts as a tuner for multiple synchro summons. That sacky mill</li>  	<li>1x Spore - same as the above except this card can manipulate its level. The deck is full of plants this powerful card is always live</li>  	<li>1x Foolish burial - so many targets</li>  	<li>1x E tele - run more if you can ll explain later</li>  	<li>1x One for one - doubt this card ll ever get semi - limited</li>  	<li>3x Psi-Reflector - a one card lvl 6-9 synchro aka Helps you summon the new Aromaseraphy synchro. E tele and one for one help you do that without NS</li>  	<li>1x Assault beast - Garent if you draw it you can still resolve psi reflector combo</li>  	<li>1x Assault mode activate - Garnet if you draw it sadface you need a way to put assault beast in the graveyard.</li>  	<li>3x Lonefire - Doesn't only access Scorpio. Many fantastic targets</li>  	<li>3x Scorpio - the best normal summon in a game. I am sure everyone knows what he does</li>  	<li>1x Darling cobra - just 1 its a 50 card deck for a reason (so that i can play less garnets)</li>  	<li>1x World carrotweight Champion - Certain rose dragon sends this card to the graveyard. so you access the free lvl 4 monster during the combos</li>  	<li>1x Garnet - OK</li>  	<li>1x Trickclown - since some Aroma monsters gain bonus effects if your LP is higher if you care about that play the Damage juggler and hat tricker or LS wolf. I prefer this tho. Dropping LP ain't bad since you need Less lp then your Opp for your trap to give you lifepoints which triggers Aromaseraphy synchros</li>  	<li>2x Ghost ogre (Hi fiber)</li>  	<li>2x ash</li>  	<li>2x impermanence</li>  	<li>2x twin twister</li>  	<li>1x Black Garden - helps with Fiber into Mist wurm during Opp turn. Outs mystic mine</li>  	<li>1x Frozen Rose - another potentional out for mystic mine so there are 4. sends a monster to search a plant, or sends a plant for draw 2 discard 1 during the Ephase</li>  	<li>3x CBTG - i mean this deck has the best normal summon in the game</li>  	<li>1x Dinowrestler Pankratops - searchable by oviratpor which I run at 6. Black Garden aswell as linking can help you fill up the OP field so that you can summon this which is amazing</li>  	<li>3x Oviraptor</li>  	<li>3x fossil dig (sometimes you search carboneddon a good pitch for scorpio)</li>  	<li>1x Carboneddon - this is what you send off Oviraptor</li>  	<li>1x Galaxy Searpent - this is what I summon of Carboneddon. (Better then the water guardragon due to gozen match)</li>  	<li>2x White rose dragon - Originaly I ran it at 1 but then I realised he is an extender if you draw it, Has bunch of + effects rather read it</li>  	<li>1x Red rose dragon - this is what you summon of fiber, I recc reading him. He needs to be used for a Dragon / plant synchro which molds your extra deck</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Extra deck <ul>  	<li>Gem-Knight Seraphnite - for brilliant fusion</li>  	<li>Stardust warrior. T.g wonder magician + lvl 5 synchros into stardust warrior</li>  	<li>Mist wurm. T.g wonder magician + 2 lvl 2 tokens (most commonly to summon this monstrosity during OP turn)ć</li>  	<li>Dragone Ogre deity of Teny - powerful lvl 8 synchro which distrups monsters, can attack twice sometimes . Psi - reflector can easly enter this</li>  	<li>Crystal wing synchro dragon - Monster negate</li>  	<li>Borreload savage dragon - Negates anything, requires link setup which isn't always easy due to fiber banish so this deck has many lvl 8 synchros</li>  	<li>Black rose Dragon - can be revived with a rose dragon maindeck monster.... nukes the field, sometimes with fiber during Opp turn, second eff matters this is a plant deck</li>  	<li>Moonlight rose dragon - the best option altho not that great. Bassicaly we need a good going first lvl 7 synchro dragon due to rose dragon restrictions</li>  	<li>Aromaseraphy sweet Majroram - Pops a card when you gain lifepoints. searches a continous trap which can net you lifepoints and search aromas</li>  	<li>Aromaseraphy Rosemary - negates a card when you gain lifepoints</li>  	<li>Garden Rose Maiden - Searches Black Garden, revives Rose dragons / Dragon synchros</li>  	<li>T.G wonder Magician - Needlefiber duh, you gotta pop something but poping empty bril fusion, savage material (he still has negate) or black garden ain't to bad</li>  	<li>Powercode talker - I never summoned him in the video because he was the latest addition. Use 3 tokens summon him. Its gooooood</li>  	<li>Aromaseraphy Jasmine - A plant link what else has to be said... nets you plants from deck</li>  	<li>Crystron Needlefiber - needs no introduction</li> </ul> Side deck  Typical side deck would reccomend evenly matched"

Includes the deadliest combos known to all banish dot decks. Let us abuse Trade-in into the ground brethren!,"The point of this deck is to do three main things:  Cut off your opponent's graveyard  Heal for massive amounts of life points  Feed ""Da Eiza""  &nbsp;  If you have been playing on ygo pro lately, you have probably seen a variation of this deck. However, my deck has several built in win conditions. This done through a few simple combos. Lets go over a few:  Toll Hike or Extra Toll / Gravekeeper's Servant + Banisher of the Radiance / Macro Cosmos / Dimensional Fissure / Dark Law  This combo does not allow your opponent to even declare an attack. However, Toll hike doesn't allow you to make one either. Therefore, only use that as a last resort. This can stall for a while until you get Gren Maju Da Eiza. You also can use Lava Golem to put your opponent on an 8 turn clock. Lastly, you can use Battle fader (or Gren Maju Da Eiza if you do not have any banished cards; you can perhaps use necroface then have your Gren Maju Da Eiza have zero attack for this) and attack Lava Golem in order to activate Inferno Tempest (I on run one at this time. Even in a 60 card deck, I couldn't find any space for a second one. But two is not bad).  Ledger of the Legerdemain or Seer's Passbook / Inferno Tempest / Eater Of Millions /Storm Castle of Stormberg/ Pot of Desires + Soul Absorption  What makes this combo so op to me is that you're actually benefitting from the cost requirement of these cards. In most decks, the cost of Pot of Desires or even Pot of Indulgence is devestating. However, in this deck it's a huge plus. It allows for you to use the powerful draw engine card Ancient Leaf.  Trade-In + Danger! monsters (With or without banish cards)  Trade-In triggers the effects of Danger! monsters even when they're banished.
