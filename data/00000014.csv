Usually you wanna tribute two Benten to summon your Lord of the Red though to get maximum value. Shaddoll Fusion going second is still insane since you can send Dragon for an easy s/t pop plus Beast for a draw as well as another Drytron name (Light attribute for Construct) to gain even more advantage.

There is also an added total effect lockdown strategy with Secret Village, Royal Decree, Haine and Jackal King (V1 had a bit of a higher focus on this strategy).</span>  <span>Secret Village of the Spellcasters - Prevents the activation of your Opponent's Spell Cards so long as only you control a Spellcaster monster and Haine helps to immediately destroy any Spellcasters your opponent summons.</span>  <span>Royal Decree - Negates the effects of all other Trap Cards. Though it is quite vulnerable to any form of disruption or destruction so always activate this last as the other cards in the combo prevent this. Also, don't let your opponent chain other trap cards to this card's activation.</span>  <span>Witchcrafter Haine - Spell Speed 2 Spot destruction of any face-up monster your opponent controls so long as you have Spell Cards in your hand to use as cost and with Secret Village of the Spellcasters up, your opponent can't activate Spell Cards without a face-up Spellcaster on the field.</span>  <span>Mythical Beast Jackal King - For the measly cost of just 2 Spell Counters, negates the effect activation of 1 monster and destroys it. This is also Spell Speed 2.</span>  <span>Yes, with a good hand, this is acheivable on the 1st turn. Also yes, I have actually acheived this combo many times.</span>  <span>Then Summon Witchcrafter Madame Verre, Mythical Beast Master Cerberus and Endymion the Mighty Master of Magic along with having cards to gain and gather Spell Counters, you have yourself an almost completely unbreakable board (can only be broken by an opponent's Special Summon tribute effects like the Kaiju monsters).</span>  <span>The nuke OTK Strategy when going second is a much more consistent strategy and there are many card combos to acheive this with. The least complicated one is having <span>Mythical Beast Master Cerberus, Servant of Endymion, Spell Power Mastery, Wichcrafter Creation, Mythical Institution and Any other Spell Card as the starting hand</span>. <strong>First off, activate Institution</strong> (handy but also a disposable first card in case of disruption). <strong>Then place Master Cerberus in the Pendulum Zone and destroy it with its effect to add Jackal King to your hand</strong> and place 2 spell counters on institution. Then <strong>place Jackal King and destroy it</strong> to <strong>Special Summon Master Creberus to the Extra Monster Zone</strong> and place 2 more spell counters on Institution. then <strong>place Servant in the Pendulum Zone</strong> placing 2 spell counters on Master Cerberus. Then <strong>activate Spell Power Mastery</strong> to <strong>add Endymion the Mighty Master to your hand and place the spell counter from the effect on Servant</strong>. Then <strong>Place Endymion in the Pendulum Zone</strong>. <span>At this point, you have 6 spell counters on Master Cerberus, 4 on Institution and 3 on Servant.</span> <strong>Use Servant's Pendulum Effect</strong> to <strong>Special Summon herself</strong> and <strong>either Magister of Endymion or Mythical Beast Bashilisk</strong> from the Deck. Then <strong>use Endymion's Pendulum Effect</strong> to Special Summon himself by removing the 6 spell counters from Master Cerberus and destroy up to 5 cards on the field as there are 5 cards now on your field that can store spell counters. Make clearing your opponent's back row a priority and make sure to leave 1 of your opponent's monsters on the field if possible. Then <strong>use Master Cerberus' Monster Effect</strong> to banish your opponent's remaining monster by removing the 4 spell counters from Institution. then <strong>Activate Witchcrafter Creation</strong> to add one of the Witchcrafter monsters that are Level 4 or lower to your hand. Normal Summon said monster, and <strong>use its effect</strong> to tribute itself and discard the last Spell Card in your hand to <strong>Special Summon Haine</strong> from your Deck. Battle Phase and you have more than enough for an OTK. Unfortunately, this is quite weak to hand-trap disruption from your opponent and destruction protection, hence why I moved on to v3.</span>"

Use the level 4 monsters/trap monsters to xyz summon Dark rebellion xyz Dragon. Once you have the deck's rank up magic card in your hand, waste all of Dark rebellion xyz Dragon's materials so you can use the rank up magic to xyz summon the deck's ace monster... Dark Requiem xyz Dragon! Make sure not to use all of Dark Requiem xyz Dragon's materials at once, because you will need one to stop your opponents monster effects+ you get Dark Rebellion xyz Dragon back from the grave.

I included Ojama Pink because we are just a couple of weeks from Blazing Vortex away, unboxings are already on youtube anyways. Strategies include: <ul>  	<li>Ojama Pajama searches for any Ojama card AND THEN you discard 1 card. This combos well with Ojama Pink or Ojamagic.</li>  	<li>With Ojama Duo you can summon 2 Ojama token on opponents field to disrupt them. Then on your turn you can banish Ojama Duo to summon 2 Ojama from Deck to easily get Ojama Knight (if you have a fusion method ready). Like this you have blocked 4 Monster fields</li>  	<li>Use Sky Cavalry Centaurea to get rid of Monsters from the field to the hand (so you get more value out of Ojama King for example)</li>  	<li>Use Quaking Mirror Force in combination of Monster Zone blocking abilities from Ojama Pink, Ojama King or Ojama Knight</li>  	<li>Super Polymerization in Side Deck can be used to fusion the Ojama Tokens from Opponents field</li> </ul>"

I did this by using the tri-brigades to link summon any link 2 with bottom left and right arrows, then used rescue ferret to make a lv 6 synchro (mudragon). Finally i would link off Tri-Brigade Kerass and the link it made into a dragon link monster (Armillyre, the Starleader Dragon or Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman come to mind). Now you have a fusion substitute for dark magician (mudragon) and a dragon effect monster on the field.  I need some feedback and assistance on making this more efficient. If any1 has ideas for good engines that would make this more consistent or powerful, plz let me know  I used Danger!s for bodies and the beast ones have good synergy with tri-brigades  The tuners I thought of were The Fabled Rubyruda and Afanc (afnac comes in blazing vortex soon)  I used zoodiac for a decent amount of lv4s not just for their own engine, but so I could summon them with Rescue Ferret alongside a lv2 tuner  Peropero Cerperus is just a good lv3 target for rescue ferret and will destroy your opponents stuff if you take damage  As a tech against traps, I used Scrap Goblin so I can turbo with rescue ferret into Naturia Barkion  Cards I thought would be good are Dark Desertapir and Mist Valley Baby Roc but they miss timing so they don't work <div class=""textarea scrollpane selectable os-host os-theme-dark os-host-resize-disabled os-host-transition os-host-overflow os-host-overflow-y"" tabindex=""0""> <div class=""os-size-auto-observer""></div> </div>"

The combo only needs <strong>1 Halqifibrax</strong>, watch the video for tutorial. The ceiling will be higher because we play Dogmatika to extend further while being ritual searcher for Knight of Armor Dragon via Herald of the Arc Light and we also run handtraps so we dont have to insta scoop going second. 1 Nibiru because it's seacrhable via Gallant Granite if we already have Adamancipator Researcher on hand.

I made this deck out of my hatred for dragoon. Also... I didn't know how to convert a custom deck to an excel spreadsheet... so I just made this link for a friend of mine. This is my first custom deck that's ever worked. It's also my first deck I've ever uploaded... so I'll try my best to explain it. I'm sure that there are flaws in it and I'm open to criticism to help make it better. &lt;img src="" data-wp-more=""more"" data-wp-more-text="""" data-mce-placeholder=""1"">Ultimately... you want to get </a><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Stage</a> in the field. There are a couple ways to do this depending on what's in your hand: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Quest</a> - This only works if you have 1+ other Generaider monster(s) in your hand... target a Generaider monster in your hand and add Generaider Boss Stage and <a data-name=""Generaider Boss Room"">Generaider Boss Room</a><a data-name=""Generaider Boss Room to your hand. Activate Boss Stage and set Boss Room.""> to your hand. Activate Boss Stage and set Boss Room.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Stage</a> - This is pretty obvious... just activate it and put it in the field.</li>  	<li id=""&quot;card-name&quot;"" class=""&quot;engine-dark-box&quot;""><a data-name=""&quot;Loptr,"">Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses - Normal summon Loptr, then tribute Loptr to special summon </a><a data-name=""&quot;Mardel,"">Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light, then activate Mardel to search Generaider Boss Room. Again... if you have another Generaider monster in your hand, search </a><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Quest</a><a data-name=""&quot;Mardel,""> instead and activate Boss Stage and set Boss Room.</a></li>  	<li>Set <a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Fight in your trap zone and activate as soon as you can... (If playing on dueling nexus... I turn manual chaining on so I can activate it during the opp's draw phase). </a></li>  	<li>Summon <a data-name=""&quot;Condemned"">Condemned Witch and add </a><a data-name=""&quot;Forbidden"">Forbidd</a>en Droplet (not necessary but I mean hey- it helps). During your opp's main phase, activate Condemned Witch and summon <a data-name=""&quot;Loptr,"">Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses and just do the thing previously explained. It's important to realize that this only gets Boss Stage in your hand (or Boss Stage and Boss Room if you searched </a><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Quest...  you won't be able to activate them until the next turn).</a></li> </ul> <h3>Generaider Monsters</h3> Once you get Boss Stage in the field zone, the world is your metaphorical oyster. When your opp adds a card from their main deck to their hand (which basically means during the draw phase) Boss Stage lets you special summon 1 Generaider monster from your deck. Since Boss Stage also lets you flood your empty monster zones with Generaider Tokens that can be utilized by other Generaider Monsters, you should special summon different Generaider Monsters according to the situation. <ul>  	<li>By default, I normally special summon a <a data-name=""&quot;Loptr,"">Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses if the opp isn't about to do something serious</a>. Not only does this allow you to tribute a Generaider token (or Loptr itself if you're really desperate), but it also adds 1000 ATK/DEF to all Generaider monsters/tokens during your opp's turn. Most of the time, I'll use Loptr's effect to summon <a data-name=""&quot;Harr,"">Harr, Generaider Boss of Storms</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Harr,"">Harr, Generaider Boss of Storms- This guy is pretty effective. Once per turn, you can tribute two Generaider tokens (or monsters if you need to) and negate any opp's card activation and destroy that card. Not only that, if your opp draws a card  any time other than the draw phase, you can activate Harr and make your opp choose 1 card from their hand or field to send to the grave (once per turn).</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Utgarda,"">Utgarda, Generaider Boss of Delusion</a>- Pretty good card that let's you tribute 2 tokens (or generaider monsters) and banish 1 card your opp controls.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Nidhogg,"">Nidhogg, Generaider Boss of Ice</a>- Let's you negate 1 special summon your opp tries to make. (side note: just started watching Soul Eater and Nidhogg is in it... so yeah ¯_(ツ)_/¯)</li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Dovelgus,"">Dovelgus, Generaider Boss of Iron- I use this if I have more than one Generaider monster and/or machine kaijus in my hand. Tribute any number of Generaider tokens (or monsters) and special summon the same number of machine and/or Generaider monsters in your hand.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Hela,"">Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom- Use this by tributing 1 Generaider token (or monster) and bringing back a Generaider monster from your grave. I also use this to put as many level 9 monsters on the board for Extra Deck special summons.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Room- Not a monster, but very important. Since you will most likely be activating a lot of effects with Generaider Monsters, your opp is more likely to chain something with those effects. If this happens, you can discard 1 card and negate it. Not only that, but both players then draw a card... which paired with Boss Stage, is a free Generaider special summon. Two birds, one stone.</a></li> </ul> It seems like a lot... but honestly you get the hang of it really quick. Another helpful thing is that these are all quick effects, so say your opp brings out the dreaded mystic mine (or any other shutdown card), you can activate Harr or Utgarda and yeet it off the field before anything unnecessary happens. <h3>Kaiju</h3> I think Kaiju is pretty underplayed. It's kind of hard to make a pure Kaiju deck since you can only control one Kaiju at a time... but that's what makes it a perfect addition to a 40 card deck.  I mainly have Kaiju in it to remove Dragoon or any other cards (but mainly Dragoon... I hate Dragoon) while avoiding ""destroyed by battle/ effect"" conditions. Normally I give my <a data-name=""&quot;Gamecial,"">Gamecial, the Sea Turtle Kaiju and myself </a><a data-name=""&quot;Jizukiru,"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>. If I'm especially lucky, I use Forbidden to add some more damage to the opp.  <a data-name=""&quot;Interrupted"">Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</a> is in here to act as a sort of Raigeki. Not only can you even out the field, but you can later banish Slumber and add 1 Kaiju from your deck to your hand.  <a data-name=""&quot;Kaiju"">Kaiju Capture Mission, </a><a data-name=""&quot;The"">The Kaiju Files, and </a><a data-name=""&quot;Kyoutou"">Kyoutou Waterfront are included to give yourself some Kaiju counters. I think that Kaiju monster effects are seriously overlooked and can be huge game changers. Just remember that if your opp has a Kaiju monster, they can also utilize Kaiju Counters from anywhere on the field. So be careful that you don't give your opp a Kaiju monster that can use 2 Kaiju counters while you can only use 3. </a> <h3>Other ""stuff""</h3> So there are some other cards in here that are pretty important. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Trias"">Trias Hierarchia- Works really great with Generaider tokens. During either turn, you can tribute 3 (or less) fairy tokens (or monsters) and special summon this card from your grave or hand. Then you can destroy 1 card on the field and draw 2 cards. It's also a level 9 monster, which is foundation of most the extra deck.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Exodia,"">Exodia, the Legendary Defender- This card gains ATK/DEF based on the combined ATK/DEF of the two cards used for its tribute summon. Not only that, but if possible, you can tribute 5 monsters you control and this card gains the combined ATK/DEF of those 5 monsters. Since Generaider floods your board with monsters pretty quickly, this shouldn't be too hard to do.  <em>Not only that!</em> But if you tribute 5 monsters for this card's summon, and then destroy an opp's dark/fiend monster, you automatically win. To be fair, if this gains the attack of 5 monsters, I don't think you have to worry too much about the dark/fiend condition. </a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Malefic"">Malefic Cyber End Dragon- Another card that I think is pretty overlooked. It's probably the easiest card with 4000 ATk to summon that I know. All you have to do to special summon this card is banish 1 Cyber End Dragon from your extra deck. Conveniently enough, there is 1 Cyber End Dragon in the extra deck at your disposal. It's important to note that if there is no face-up card on the field, then this card is destroyed as soon as you special summon it. Also... other monsters you control cannot attack. (If you have 3 other level 9 monsters on the field, you can special summon </a><a data-name=""&quot;Number"">Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon, detach 1 card, negate the ""other monsters you control cannot attack"" effect of Malefic Cyber End Dragon, and deal up to a whopping 8500 damage.)</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;The"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode and </a><a data-name=""&quot;The"">The Winged Dragon of Ra</a>- Sphere mode is in here for the usual reason. Winged Dragon of Ra is included for when you regain control of the Sphere Mode you give the opp. Also... with all the special summons you can do with Generaider, your opp is more likely to hit you with a Sphere Mode of their own. If this happens, you can use it against them and summon Winged Ra from your deck.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Ash"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring- I only run 1 Ash Blossom because... well I ran out of room in the deck. One is still helpful because it can be tributed by Hela, </a><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss of Doom to bring back a Generaider from the grave.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Ghost"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries- Another display of my hatred for Dragoon. The moment your opp controls more monsters than you, you can discard Ghost Reaper and select Dragoon in your extra deck. If your opp has Dragoon(s) in their extra deck... they don't anymore. The best part is that, even if your opp doesn't have a Dragoon, there is no punishment for an incorrect ""guess"". I also keep </a><a data-name=""&quot;Time"">Time Thief Redoer and </a><a data-name=""&quot;Number"">Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL in the side deck for the same effect. I just chose those two to place in the side deck because those are the two cards that can be problematic with this deck. You can substitute these into your extra deck (or any monster that you wish) and do the same thing. Just remember that the real enemy here is Dragoon.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Waking"">Waking the Dragon- Another card that I feel is underplayed (and that's fine by me) is Waking the Dragon. It literally exists for no other reason but to be destroyed by the opp's card effect. You can then special summon any monster (that you can) from your extra deck or main deck. Any fusion monster is fair game (except Dragoon), but be careful if selecting an XYZ monster to special summon. If you're gonna special summon an XYZ monster from the extra deck, I'd recommend either </a><a data-name=""&quot;Number"">Number C9: Chaos Dyson Sphere, </a><a data-name=""&quot;Number"">Number 9: Dyson Sphere, or </a><a data-name=""&quot;Number"">Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon. These monsters don't require XYZ material to work their magic. </a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Draining"">Draining Shield- Pretty self-explanatory. Free Life-Points/ attack negation. If you're lucky, you can use the extra life-points to give your Ra some more firepower.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Rank-Up-Magic"">Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force- I'll admit, this adds brick potential to a deck that is hard enough to normal summon with. However, I still wasn't sure if I should get rid of it (let me know what you think I guess). If you do get to use Rank-Up on Dyson Sphere... the payout is huge. As long as C9 Chaos Dyson is on the field, you can add up the materials to deal some wumbo damage.</a></li> </ul> <h3>Side Deck</h3> Some cards that I have in here that suit me.  There's only 10 cards in it, so you can replace and add to the side deck as much as you want, but since I wrote this much, I might as well explain why I have what I have in it. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Nibiru,"">Nibiru, the Primal Being- Um... same reason it's ever placed in the side deck. Even if you do hand the opp a card with a hella amount of ATK/DEF, the Kaiju aspect (and possibly Raigeki if you're lucky) can help you get rid of that. </a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Droll"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird- Just here to stop the draw. Placed it in the side deck with the idea of stopping Exodia draws. Can be used to stop any deck that relies on a lot of draw power.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Time"">Time Thief Redoer and </a><a data-name=""&quot;Number"">Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL- explained before... just in here to use with </a><a data-name=""&quot;Ghost"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Mind"">Mind Crush- Versatile but intended to stop Exodia. When you see the opp add a card to their hand, just write it down and make em get rid of it. Very devastating to Exodia, but use as you see fit.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Cloak"">Cloak and Dagger- If you know that your opp relies on one card (e.g. Cyber Dragon, Predaplant Verte Anaconda, etc.), you can try and set this up to tear them down. </a></li> </ul> Again this is just what I have in the side deck, you can replace it with what you see fit. <h3>Extra Deck</h3> Not much to say about it. Generaider adds a lot of level 9 monsters on your field, so the Extra Deck is mostly XYZ monsters that require level 9 monsters. All things considered, the XYZ monsters each work any situation. <a data-name=""&quot;Jormungandr,"">Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity is a Generaider monster that can be activated each turn to 1000 ATK/DEF each turn. Also, it forces your opp to draw a card, which lets you special summon a Generaider monster from your deck if you have Boss Stage in the field zone. Other than, it's pretty much up to you what you want to summon and when you want to. </a> <h3>Final Thoughts</h3> Soooooooo.... yeah. That's it. The downside to having a bunch of level 9 monsters is that bricks exist. However, this deck bricks just as much for me as any meta deck... which is to say, it doesn't brick too often. This is my first deck that I'm posting and I might do more... but idk. If you have any criticism to make, no matter how harsh, please make it. Also, I'm relatively new to Yugioh, but dang I didn't know decks could get this expensive. Personally, this deck has worked out on most other deck types that I've played (Cyber Dragon, Drytron, Dragoon (ew), Ojama, Darkworld, Exodia, Traptrix). With a good start, it shuts down <em>most</em> meta (kekw Eldlich is touch-and-go). This deck is ultimately for my man Rowan, but if you think it would work out for you too... feel free to do whatever you want.  ""&gt;  So basically... I made this deck out of my hatred for dragoon. Also... I didn't know how to convert a custom deck to an excel spreadsheet... so I just made this link for a friend of mine. This is my first custom deck that's ever worked. It's also my first deck I've ever uploaded... so I'll try my best to explain it.

Not only can you even out the field, but you can later banish Slumber and add 1 Kaiju from your deck to your hand.  <a data-name=""Kaiju Capture Mission"">Kaiju Capture Mission, </a><a data-name=""The Kaiju Files"">The Kaiju Files, and </a><a data-name=""Kyoutou Waterfront "">Kyoutou Waterfront are included to give yourself some Kaiju counters. I think that Kaiju monster effects are seriously overlooked and can be huge game changers. Just remember that if your opp has a Kaiju monster, they can also utilize Kaiju Counters from anywhere on the field. So be careful that you don't give your opp a Kaiju monster that can use 2 Kaiju counters while you can only use 3. </a> <h3>Other ""stuff""</h3> So there are some other cards in here that are pretty important. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Trias Hierarchia"">Trias Hierarchia- Works really great with Generaider tokens. During either turn, you can tribute 3 (or less) fairy tokens (or monsters) and special summon this card from your grave or hand. Then you can destroy 1 card on the field and draw 2 cards. It's also a level 9 monster, which is foundation of most the extra deck.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Exodia, the Legendary Defender"">Exodia, the Legendary Defender- This card gains ATK/DEF based on the combined ATK/DEF of the two cards used for its tribute summon. Not only that, but if possible, you can tribute 5 monsters you control and this card gains the combined ATK/DEF of those 5 monsters. Since Generaider floods your board with monsters pretty quickly, this shouldn't be too hard to do.  <em>Not only that!</em> But if you tribute 5 monsters for this card's summon, and then destroy an opp's dark/fiend monster, you automatically win. To be fair, if this gains the attack of 5 monsters, I don't think you have to worry too much about the dark/fiend condition. </a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Malefic Cyber End Dragon"">Malefic Cyber End Dragon- Another card that I think is pretty overlooked. It's probably the easiest card with 4000 ATk to summon that I know. All you have to do to special summon this card is banish 1 Cyber End Dragon from your extra deck. Conveniently enough, there is 1 Cyber End Dragon in the extra deck at your disposal. It's important to note that if there is no face-up card on the field, then this card is destroyed as soon as you special summon it. Also... other monsters you control cannot attack. (If you have 3 other level 9 monsters on the field, you can special summon </a><a data-name=""Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon"">Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon, detach 1 card, negate the ""other monsters you control cannot attack"" effect of Malefic Cyber End Dragon, and deal up to a whopping 8500 damage.)</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode and </a><a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra"">The Winged Dragon of Ra</a>- Sphere mode is in here for the usual reason. Winged Dragon of Ra is included for when you regain control of the Sphere Mode you give the opp. Also... with all the special summons you can do with Generaider, your opp is more likely to hit you with a Sphere Mode of their own. If this happens, you can use it against them and summon Winged Ra from your deck.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring- I only run 1 Ash Blossom because... well I ran out of room in the deck. One is still helpful because it can be tributed by Hela, </a><a data-name=""Generaider Boss of Doom"">Generaider Boss of Doom to bring back a Generaider from the grave.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries- Another display of my hatred for Dragoon. The moment your opp controls more monsters than you, you can discard Ghost Reaper and select Dragoon in your extra deck. If your opp has Dragoon(s) in their extra deck... they don't anymore. The best part is that, even if your opp doesn't have a Dragoon, there is no punishment for an incorrect ""guess"". I also keep </a><a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer and </a><a data-name=""Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL"">Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL in the side deck for the same effect. I just chose those two to place in the side deck because those are the two cards that can be problematic with this deck. You can substitute these into your extra deck (or any monster that you wish) and do the same thing. Just remember that the real enemy here is Dragoon.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon- Another card that I feel is underplayed (and that's fine by me) is Waking the Dragon. It literally exists for no other reason but to be destroyed by the opp's card effect. You can then special summon any monster (that you can) from your extra deck or main deck. Any fusion monster is fair game (except Dragoon), but be careful if selecting an XYZ monster to special summon. If you're gonna special summon an XYZ monster from the extra deck, I'd recommend either </a><a data-name=""Number C9: Chaos Dyson Sphere"">Number C9: Chaos Dyson Sphere, </a><a data-name=""Number 9: Dyson Sphere"">Number 9: Dyson Sphere, or </a><a data-name=""Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon"">Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon. These monsters don't require XYZ material to work their magic. </a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draining Shield"">Draining Shield- Pretty self-explanatory. Free Life-Points/ attack negation. If you're lucky, you can use the extra life-points to give your Ra some more firepower.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force- I'll admit, this adds brick potential to a deck that is hard enough to normal summon with. However, I still wasn't sure if I should get rid of it (let me know what you think I guess). If you do get to use Rank-Up on Dyson Sphere... the payout is huge. As long as C9 Chaos Dyson is on the field, you can add up the materials to deal some wumbo damage.</a></li> </ul> <h3>Side Deck</h3> Some cards that I have in here that suit me.  There's only 10 cards in it, so you can replace and add to the side deck as much as you want, but since I wrote this much, I might as well explain why I have what I have in it. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being- Um... same reason it's ever placed in the side deck. Even if you do hand the opp a card with a hella amount of ATK/DEF, the Kaiju aspect (and possibly Raigeki if you're lucky) can help you get rid of that. </a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird- Just here to stop the draw. Placed it in the side deck with the idea of stopping Exodia draws. Can be used to stop any deck that relies on a lot of draw power.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer and </a><a data-name=""Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL"">Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL- explained before... just in here to use with </a><a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Mind Crush"">Mind Crush- Versatile but intended to stop Exodia. When you see the opp add a card to their hand, just write it down and make em get rid of it. Very devastating to Exodia, but use as you see fit.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cloak and Dagger"">Cloak and Dagger- If you know that your opp relies on one card (e.g. Cyber Dragon, Predaplant Verte Anaconda, etc.), you can try and set this up to tear them down. </a></li> </ul> Again this is just what I have in the side deck, you can replace it with what you see fit. <h3>Extra Deck</h3> Not much to say about it. Generaider adds a lot of level 9 monsters on your field, so the Extra Deck is mostly XYZ monsters that require level 9 monsters. All things considered, the XYZ monsters each work any situation. <a data-name=""Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity"">Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity is a Generaider monster that can be activated each turn to 1000 ATK/DEF each turn. Also, it forces your opp to draw a card, which lets you special summon a Generaider monster from your deck if you have Boss Stage in the field zone. Other than, it's pretty much up to you what you want to summon and when you want to. </a> <h3>Final Thoughts</h3> Soooooooo.... yeah. That's it. The downside to having a bunch of level 9 monsters is that bricks exist. However, this deck bricks just as much for me as any meta deck... which is to say, it doesn't brick too often. This is my first deck that I'm posting and I might do more... but idk. If you have any criticism to make, no matter how harsh, please make it. Also, I'm relatively new to Yugioh, but dang I didn't know decks could get this expensive. Personally, this deck has worked out on most other deck types that I've played (Cyber Dragon, Drytron, Dragoon (ew), Ojama, Darkworld, Exodia, Traptrix). With a good start, it shuts down <em>most</em> meta (kekw Eldlich is touch-and-go). This deck is ultimately for my man Rowan, but if you think it would work out for you too... feel free to do whatever you want.  &nbsp;"

You might think that combo dino is no longer a thing since all the good halq tuners got banned and recently linkross also got banned - well think again. The new scrap raptor makes combo dino a thing again and believe it or not you don’t even use halq or auroradon for these combos! The scrap monsters have that part covered. I am running the bare minimum scrap engine (except raptor because it is a dino and a really good draw) - 1 Golem and 1 chimera so that you do not brick. Scrap raptor is a new card that comes out in LIOV. It is a dino tuner and works really well with a dinosaur deck since it can be searched and special summoned (off of baby, petri, and fossil dig and in some cases miscell or even oviraptor). The new dino is really good and makes it possible to do the combo. This deck also has only 2 bricks, which is a fairly small amount for a combo deck!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Before I explain the deck just a friendly reminder that all the combos, deck explanations and card choices are in my youtube video - Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me directly. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the video - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0OJU4Cdno8</a></span>  &nbsp;  <b>Notes before we start</b><span>: </span>  <span>VFD = True King of all calamities </span>  <span>UCT = Ultimate conductor Tyranno</span>  <span>All the dinos can be searched off of fossil dig as well </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Here are the combos I do in my video</b><span> -</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Combo #1 (VFD combo using oviraptor as normal summon)-</b>  <span>Hand: Souleating + Baby OR Miscell </span>  <span>End on: UCT + VFD + Laggia OR Abyss Dweller (and Dokka but why would you want that if you already have VFD?)</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Combo #2 (VFD combo using Scrap Raptor as normal summon) -</b>  <span>Hand: Raptor + Lost World </span>  <span>End on: UCT + VFD + Laggia OR Abyss Dweller (same as oviraptor combo)</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Combo #3 (Nibiru proof Apollusa Combo using oviraptor) - </b>  <span>Hand: Souleating + baby OR Miscell</span>  <span>End on: UCT + Apollusa (3 negates) + Borreload Savage (2 counters) + Dokka (2 monster negates)</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Combo #4 (VFD combo using Archosaur)</b>  <span>Hand: Archosaur + Baby</span>  <span>End on: UCT + VFD + Laggia or Dweller (same combo - different way to do it)</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Combo #5 (VFD combo using Lost world)</b>  <span>Hand: Oviraptor + Lost World</span>  <span>End on: UCT + VFD </span>  &nbsp;  <span>The deck is really consistent overall, being able to perform the combo very consistently. There are also only 2 bricks in the deck, which should help overall. This deck also plays a variety of handtraps and removal in the form of ash, gamma and droplet. You can also replace the droplet with something like nibiru so that you are playing more handtraps in the deck. You can also replace the handtraps with budget alternatives handtraps but I recommend keeping gamma since it is easily the best handtrap of the format and is also fairly cheap. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Some key cards you want to see in hand are -</span> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Fossil dig (can search ANY level 6 or lower dino)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Oviraptor (is the searcher and the main normal summon of the deck)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Scrap raptor (can be used with lost world to do full combo)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Lost World (is an amazing field spell and is used in the scrap raptor combo)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Babycerasaurus (Is a very ideal card since it can special any dino from the deck)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Miscell (no explanation needed here) </span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>There is another combo that I do not show in the video that I will show here.

Still shaky with my terms but, as long as you go second you are fine.","Mekk-Knights are pretty easy to summon as long as you go second majority of the time. This is a deck I made long time ago that I constantly edit because I use this on dueling nexus a lot.  The Borrels in the Extra if you are questioning why they are there, are only when you acually need their effects. You really want Mekk-Knights all over the board.  If you don't know how Mekk-Knights work, you can special summon them as long as their are 2 cards in the same column. So going second is important. But, because you use special summoning regularly you are going to be hit hard if your opponent uses <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> or <a data-name=""Summoning Limit"">Summoning Limit</a>.  <a data-name=""Purple Nightfall"">Purple Nightfall</a> is for banishing and NOT for any material (Unless Absolutely Needed). You can activate his ability (Quick Effect) to banish any Mekk-Knight monster on the field. But, if you banish him you can get him back during your next turn for a endless loop(or your teammates if you are in tag duel).  His effect banishes until your next standby phase. You can use <a data-name=""Purple Nightfall"">Purple Nightfall</a> to get the<a data-name=""Indigo Eclipse""> Indigo Eclipse</a> from your deck to your hand, then special summon <a data-name=""Indigo Eclipse"">Indigo Eclipse</a> from your hand to add another Mekk-Knight to your hand.  <a data-name=""Indigo Eclipse"">Indigo Eclipse</a>'s effect depends on how many of your opponents cards are in the same column when it is special summoned. So if there is one enemy card, you get one Mekk-Knight and so forth. From there you can read the other cards and everything reveals itself.  You only really need 4-5 cards to control the field. But 3 are very specific. They are 2 continuous trap cards and a continuous spell. The traps are <a data-name=""World Legacy's Secret"">World Legacy's Secret</a> and <a data-name=""World Legacy Whispers"">World Legacy Whispers, </a>and the spell card is <a data-name=""World Legacy Key"">World Legacy Key</a>.  <a data-name=""Secre"">Secre</a><a data-name=""t"">t</a> negates monster effects that are in the same column that a Mekk-Knight is in and, when activated, can special summon from your GY any Level 5 or higher monster.  <a data-name=""Whispers"">Whispers</a> negates spell cards that are in the same column that a Mekk-Knight is in and, when activated, can add 1000 Atk and Def to any Level 5 or higher monster.  <a data-name=""Key"">Key </a>negates trap cards that are in the same column that a Mekk-Knight is in and, when activated, can add to your hand 1 World Legacy card or Mekk-Knight monster from your banished zone  Now I have one more thing. The most Important Mekk-Knight monster is<a data-name=""Mekk-Knight""> Mekk-Knight</a> <a data-name=""Indigo Eclipse"">Indigo Eclipse</a>. Once per turn (Quick Effect) You can move any Mekk-Knight Monster you control (preferably him) to another monster zone. This includes the Extra deck monsters too  &nbsp;  Hope you like this deck. This is the first deck I am posting on this site for everyone to see. Have A great DAY!"

Requires the newly ","The main goal of this deck is to summon Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon, using Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon for at least one of its XYZ materials. During damage calculation, you can remove an XYZ material from it to increase its attack by 200 x the combined ranks of all XYZ monsters on the field. At minimum, this card will gain 1600 atk, for a total of 5600. However, if you use Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon as one of its XYZ material, and remove Afterglow for Prime Photon's effect, Afterglow's second ability will activate. You can special summon one Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon from your hand or deck to the field in attack position, and then Prime Photon's attack will double from 5600 to 11,200, which is generally enough for a OTK. However, if your opponent has any life points remaining somehow, you can attack with the special summon Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon for extra damage.  With the cards I've assembled for the deck, I run into very minimum bricks, and it's extremely easy to summon Galaxy Eyes Prime Photon Dragon in a single turn. To minimize bricks, I've included two copies of Foolish Burial Goods. One to remove Metalfoes Fusion from my deck to activate its effect to draw 1 card, or to send Return of the Dragon Lords to the GY in case you need protection for your dragons. However, outside 3x Photon Sanctuary, 3x Galaxy Expedition, 3x Return of the Dragon Lords, you can pretty much run whatever combination of spell/trap cards you think are best. If you're filthy rich, that means 3x Forbidden Droplet, 3x Evenly Matched, 3x Infinite Impermanence, etc etc. Only run Galaxy Expedition if you're running Galaxy Wizard. From my experience, Galaxy Expedition has the greatest potential to brick your hand, and without Galaxy Wizard to give you a potential level 8 monster without needing to tribute or special summon, Galaxy Expedition very easily becomes a dead card. So much so that I've toyed with removing both Galaxy Wizard and Expedition for something else, but haven't found any other combination of cards that work well.  As for the extra deck cards, outside Galaxy-Eyes Sol Flare Dragon and Prime Photon Dragon, you can slap whichever extra deck monsters you prefer in there. Accesscode Talker for example, if you're filthy rich. I just put a bunch of Galaxy and Photon Monsters in there to complete the theme.  For the side deck, I just put 1 of every hand trap or OP counter card just for reference, with the implication being that you'd want 3x of whichever you're rolling with. But putting 3x of each would be over the 15 limit. It's a pick and choose type of situation. I for one enjoy burning my opponent's hopes and dreams to the ground with Ash Blossom. And the price of Triple Tactics Talents enjoys burning my wallet to the ground.  &nbsp;  Some Combos:  The Photon Tokens summoned by Photon Sanctuary can be used to allow you to special summon Photon Vanisher. Then, when it's special summoned, you can add a Photon or Galaxy monster to your hand. Pick whichever combos best with the cards you managed to draw. If you have a Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon in your hand, it's best to search your regular Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon (or vice versa if you have Photon Dragon but no Afterglow Dragon), then use the Photon Tokens as tributes for its special summon. Then you can special summon Afterglow Dragon from your hand, special summon Prime Photon Dragon, and then use the combo in the first paragraph to, usually, finish off your opponent in one turn.  Galaxy Wizard's effects are very beneficial. You can search for whatever Galaxy card you need in your deck to combo into Prime Photon Dragon, or use its effect to make it a Lv8 monster. Then you can use Galaxy Expedition if you have it to summon Afterglow Dragon, and then use both those monsters to summon Prime Photon Dragon.  Galaxy Soldier's effect allows you to discard a light monster to special summon it in defense position, and then afterwards you can search for a Galaxy monster that you need to complete a potential combo. If you have Return of the Dragon Lords or Monster Reborn, you can sacrifice your Galaxy Eyes Photon Dragon, and then use those spell cards to special summon it. Or if you have Galaxy Trance, you can then activate it to special summon Afterglow and Photon Dragon, then XYZ summon Prime Photon Dragon.  Weaknesses: With the ton of negation effects that plague Yugioh, this deck can find it hard to win a war of attrition. Also, this deck as it stands lacks as much counterplay to your opponent's own combos. But that's what being filthy rich to afford Forbidden Droplet and its ilk is for. As a fun, non-meta deck however, I have a blast playing with it, and I hope to have all the cards for real to have some fun against friends (once I get some of them as well. I suspect buying companionship will cost more than even Forbidden Droplet x3... =/ )"

The philosophy with this deck is to destroy most if not all of your opponent's resources that they slap down on the board going first, and then close out the match with Sky Striker's unparalleled grind game.  <span>The deck features 4 card types in the maindeck:</span>  <span><strong><em>10 board ""equalizers""</em> </strong></span>  <em>3 Lightning Storm</em> - The most expensive card in the deck (About $100 each as of this writing) it is incredibly powerful. It can wipe either backrow or monsters given the player using it doesn't have face-up cards. This is useful going second, but can become a brick mid/late game. This card can be replaced by a cheaper alternative like Twin Twisters or Dark Ruler No More (still not quite the same or as powerful unfortunately, hope this card gets reprinted soon).  <em>3 Evenly Matched</em> - One of the most potent board killers out there, it's non-targeting/destroying removal can out most boards if allowed to activate. Just skip your battlephase as you go second, and watch your opponent's carefully crafted board that they've spent 10 minutes comboing for disappear into the Shadow Realm.  <em>2 Dark Hole</em> - An oldschool power card that is still super useful in a Sky Striker deck, as this deck doesn't mind it's own monsters are destroyed if there is access to Raye/Roze. This card is useful going second and even during mid-game - Clear your opponent's monsters, then summon Raye/Roze again to attack directly!  <em>1 Raigeki</em> - No explanation needed, smash your opponent's monsters!  <em>1 Feather Duster</em> - No explanation needed, obliterate your opponent's backrow! This is especially useful during this meta as it is dominated by control cards in the backrow, like Dogmatika Punishment, Ice Dragon's Prison, and Torrential Tribute.  <span><strong>8 tuner handtraps</strong></span>  The monster tuner handtrap line-up consists of <em>3 Ashblossom, 3 Ghost Ogre, and 2 Effect Veiler</em> (for the Halqifibrax/Selene/Accesscode combo). 8 of these bad girls allow for easier access to Halqifibrax, so that Accesscode can be created easily via Selene.  To those of you who do not know this combo, you just make Halqifibrax by linking away a tuner and a monster. Use Halq to summon a spellcaster tuner from your deck (effect veiler) to make Selene. Selene resurrects effect veiler from GY by spending spell 3 counters, then your link those to create your link 4 Accesscode to push for game.  These handtraps also can choke up your opponent's play during their turn, stifling/stopping crucial parts of board from developing so you can pick it apart on your turn. They can be swapped out for other handtraps to metagame your opponent's deck - just keep in mind that the more tuner monsters you swap out, the harder it is to do the Halqifibrax/Selene/Accesscode combo. (ex. Nibiru for combo-decks like Drytron, or Artifact Lancea vs. Dino)  <span><strong>15 Sky Striker Cards</strong></span>  Everyone knows what these cards do already, so I'll just explain why I picked the ratios for each card. <em>3 Raye</em> (obviously) but also <em>3 Roze</em>, just because she's just another name  that says ""Sky Striker"" so we can summon the Striker link monsters. Sometimes, not opening any of these ladies can mean the end of the game for the Striker player, because it doesn't allow the Striker to initiate a grindgame to capitalize on the lead that they made equalizing the game-state with going-second cards, thus allowing the opponent to recover. 3 <em>Airspace Area Zero</em> and 1 <em>Hornet Drones</em> are also added to allow for maximum access to the Striker links.  1 <em>Multirole</em> for resource recycling of Sky Striker Spells. Whatever you do, DO NOT let this card get banished by something like cosmic cyclone, if it does, that represents about half the grind game power of Sky Strikers down the drain. Ideally, after you equalize the gamestate in turn 2, you search this card with your first <em>Shizuku</em> at the endstep to initiate your grindgame for turn 3.  3 <em>Widow Anchor</em> is to maximize your ability for fieldwide control of your opponent's cards and to disrupt plays. I only added one <em>Shark Cannon </em>because I find that other cards are more useful. However, if you come across a deck that uses a lot of monsters in the GY (such as Eldlich) feel free to swap out other cards for Shark Cannon to control the graveyard.  1 <em>Afterburner!</em> is a only a one-of because so many other cards blow up the field in this deck anyways. If something is still alive after you obliterate the field with Lightning Storm and Dark Hole, finish em off with a classic <em>Afterburners! </em>This card can also destroy an active Area Zero if it's already on your field, giving you another Sky Striker monster on the board. Against backrow decks, feel free to swap this card out for <em>Jamming Waves!</em> to destroy their face down cards.  <span><strong>6 non-archetypal support spell cards</strong></span>  1 <em>Upstart Goblin</em> to put a free spell in your GY strengthening your Striker Link monsters as well as a relatively free +1 draw. It may give your opponent +1000 lifepoints, but arguably in most cases lifepoints don't matter if your opponent has few resources left after you whittle them down with your Sky Striker cards and board equalizers.  1 <em>Terraforming</em> to allow for easy access to Area Zero.  1 <em>Called by the Grave</em> to out those pesky ghost girl hand traps or banish that old annoying Eldlich dude being a creep in the GY.  1 <em>Reinforcement of the Army</em> to search for Sky Striker Raye to allow more consistent access to Striker link monsters.  2 <em>Pot of Avarice</em> for resource recycling, especially of your Sky Striker link monsters, especially because you burn through a lot of them. This card is a easy +2 because it's conditions of shuffling 5 monsters back into the deck from the GY is so effortless to do in Sky Strikers. Since this card's unban, I've taken out Sky Striker's own resource recycling card Hercules Base because I feel this card is superior even though it's unsearchable. Feel free to bump this card to 3, and maybe take out the Upstart Goblin. This card may be a bit bricky/sticky sometimes though, so be careful.  <span>For the <strong>Extra Deck</strong>, we have</span>  11 Sky Striker link monsters - 3 <em>Kagari</em> (spell recovery from GY), 3 <em>Hayate</em> (direct attack + dump Striker card to GY), 3 <em>Shizuku</em> (Free search and endphase), 1 <em>Kaina</em> (stop opponent's monster's attack), and 1 <em>Zeke</em> (Primarily to link away your oppenent's monster you gained control over and to banish an opponent's monster on board).  1 Hiita the Fire Charmer because it also allow access to Selene by stealing your opponent's used Ash Blossom, Almiraj or any other fire monster that is running around in the meta nowadays. Hiita is easily able to be made by first going into Kagari, the fire attribute Sky Striker and linking it away. From Selene, the player can make Accesscode for game.  3 cards for the Accesscode Talker Package - Sky Striker's win-condition nowadays is pushing aggressively for the win with Accesscode Talker by clearing your opponent's board by banishing link monsters with different attributes in your GY (which Sky Strikers easily fulfill) and attacking with 5300 for game. Accesscode is primarily made with Halqifibrax/Selene/Accesscode combo. Use Halq to summon a spellcaster tuner from your deck (effect veiler) to make Selene. Selene resurrects effect veiler from GY by spending spell 3 counters, then your link those to create your link 4 Accesscode to push for game. Be sure to first whittle down your opponent's lifepoints below 5300 and to make sure they have no more tricks in their sleeve beforehand to ensure an OTK.  <span>Additional Commentary</span>  <strong>Weaknesses -</strong> This deck is very strong, and it can consistently contend vs. the strongest decks of any era of Yugioh (so far) but it has a few weaknesses. This deck autoloses vs. anti-spell floodgates such as Secret Village of Spellcasters and Imperial Order. A deck that uses both of these cards is very difficult to beat (I'm looking at you, Altergeists &gt;:c) Monster cards that are untargetable/undestroyable/unaffect are very difficult for this deck to get rid of as well, such as Red Eyes Dragoon, Mathmech Final Sigma and Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon. These cards are specifically why I side Lava Golem or other kaijus to use in match-ups where these cards are common. Finally, there are some decks that actually still recover quite competently after you wipe their board and can counter-attack your fragile board with strong gigantic monsters for an OTK. Watch-out for games, and try to force a grind-game where you're several steps ahead to avoid this situation.  As a machine player that loves to play aggressively in dynamic interesting back/forth games, I absolutely LOOOOVE this deck. It's super fun wiping your opponent's carefully crafted board, then having your favourite pretty mech girl destroy monster after monster like the Doomslayer (RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT IS DONE!). Hope you folks have as much fun playing this deck as I do, even though Sky Strikers technically are not meta anymore. Raye is baye! &lt;3  Thanks for reading!

If Ultimate Dragon is destroyed, there are some cards for backup support to get the materials back like the Pot Of Avarice. Also, I stuffed some useless cards in the Extra Deck for banishing for Pot Of Extravagance. I put some strong attack forces and tribute slaves for drawing out the game to get the correct cards like Fusion Gate, which allows you to fuse without Polymerization and Pot Of Acquisitiveness gets the banished cards back and even gives you a card as well! Also, i included Mirror Force Dragon because its effect can defend all of the controlled cards, including itself! So in summary, this deck is to get out the best blue eyes cards and keep them out as well as float the materials back into the deck or hand."

The strategy here is to burn your entire deck to the GY to get at least 3 cards. The way you burn cards is similar to a Exodia deck but it's really not  I basically copied this deck from someone I played against a match online in Dueling Nexus, so this isnt my idea. I swapped cards out and made a few edits to try make less bricks happen.  You want at least 2 copies of <a data-name=""Blasting the Ruins"">Blasting the Ruins</a>, and <a data-name=""Magical Explosion"">Magical Explosion</a>.  The way to activate <a data-name=""Blasting the Ruins"">Blasting the Ruins</a> is to have 30 cards (at all) in your GY and if you do, you can deal 3000 damage to your opponent.  <a data-name=""Magical Explosion"">Magical Explosion</a>, is limited to one probably because of how broken it is when you play these kind of decks. It deals 200 damage for EACH spell card in your GY. So playing this when you have around 30 spell cards in your GY is really broken.  And that's it.

Here is one of the main strategys. 1-have( using alpha, zeta,diviner and some luck) slayer, battlelord, evolution/charge and origin. sounds dificult, but thanks to drytrons  is not so much.  use evolution, send a vendread battlelord from your deck to the GY, special summon  battlelord from your hand, and use his effect, banishing evolution, to protect your monsters of handtraps. Use origin to special summon slayer, by banishing battlelord from your GY. Now, make avendread savior with slayer and battlelord.  the effects of battlelord and slayer will trigger, and you can add a origin and a slayer from your deck to your hand, also send executor and anima from your deck to the GY. Now activate savior, and recover your origin, and activate origin by banishing executor from your GY, special summon slayer. Now activate origin, banish battlelord to special summon slayer. Now you have two slayers, and savior,infinite possibilities with beatrice and drytrons. But here is the basic to do with this board. Make apollousa and use the effect of anima to special summon the banished executor. (Apollousa with 3 materials+ Executor) remembering: this is the board without drytrons in your field. with these guys in the field, you can increment this board a lot. I will not explain everything that this deck can do, but is a great deck.  Thanks to reading this until the end ^^ "

The Cipher Deck revolves around summoning the Xyz Monster Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon as soon as possible, then to use that card and others in order to win. The Deck isn't as close in power to its original archetype, but it still is a fun deck to play with.</span>  <span><strong>HIGHLIGHTS:</strong></span>  <span><strong>Cipher Twin Raptor, Cipher Wing, Cipher Mirror Knight:</strong> All 3 work great with the Deck. Twin Raptor can call out another Cipher from the deck, Wing can easily summon itself if you control a Cipher monster (also is not once per turn), and Mirror Knight can revive a Cipher destroyed in battle, as well as being able to search a Cipher from the Deck.</span>  <strong>Galaxy Queen's Light: </strong>Also a great card for the Deck. It helps give the deck another way to make their Xyz without being super-reliant on Cipher Wing. Works well with <strong>B.E.S. Big Core MK-8 </strong>and <strong>Guardian of Order</strong>.  <strong>Photon Lead: </strong>Additional summon for LIGHT monsters, which is also good since this deck mostly has LIGHT monsters.  <b>Rank-Up-Magic Cipher Ascension: </b>Wasn't able to use the card a lot, but is still fun to keep in the deck.  <span><strong>EXTRA DECK:</strong></span>  <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon: </strong>The deck's go-to Xyz Monster. Can steal a monster you opponent controls. Can help get rid of troubling monsters and can make use of stolen monsters.  <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon: </strong>Ace card. Can destroy a card on the field, as well as reviving a <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon </strong>when destroyed.  <strong>Neo Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon: </strong>Pretty much <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</strong> but can steal up to 3 of your opponent's monsters. Will require the Rank-Up in order to summon.  <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Ex Dragon: </strong>A nice addition to the deck. Can protect your LIGHT monsters from being targeted by card effects, as well as reviving a Cipher Dragon that is in the graveyard during your Standby Phase.  The rest of the Extra Deck are extra options for the deck. Enjoy! :)"

I recommend melffy tag if you don't already have it in your hand or a monster like puppie if you dont have it all ready or the trap which gives u some interruption on your opponent. Then youse your melffy which you should have in hand either by adding it with melffy of the forest effect or by having it already in hand to special summon any melffy from grave which you should have because of the detaching of the unit from melffy of the forest. Then you can only do this next step if you used obedience schooled as your starter or you haven't normal summoned for turn. normal a second starter/extender or any melffy monster from hand to xyz again into a card appropriate for the situation either going first or second. If your going first I would go into joyous melffys and just stool out. By the way you really want to go second with this deck. If you are going second I say you should wipe the opponents board by using Alpha,  the master of beasts but remember to leave some monsters on your side and also its not a once per turn effect. Also i recomend attacking in some way with an xyz monster at some point in your first turn to make Divine arsenal. then just youse you melffys effects from hand and field at end phases and on the field any time you think you need to disrupt your opponent. The small combo i would youse is if your opponent summons a monster that can be destroyed by card effect and its causing you a real problem then use puppies effect from field to bounce itself back to hand to summon Kalantosa  which will destroy it when special summoned. That's really about it I feel like if you want to use this deck you need to come up with some off your own combos with it its more fun that way. Have fun with the deck and tell me how it goes on Instagram which is lukepastone :)"

The engine is 2 Seiyaryu (easily searchable, play 2 as backup), 3 Rayel (add Bellfire/Nativity), 3 Bellfire (add Seiyaryu/Rayel), 3 Nativity (add/ss Seiyaryu from hand). So, basically this Seiyaryu turbo needs <strong>Nativity+1 LIGHT fairy</strong>. Some Holy Night card we could play for recovery is Flamel (recur Seiyaryu from GY, niche battle disruption) and Advent (recur from GY/ss Seiyaryu from hand).  Since Nativity needs LIGHT fairy fodder, it makes sense to play the LIGHT fairy good stuff. Diviner is 1 card VFD by sending Trias Hierarchia, use Trias tribute Diviner, use Diviner ss Valkyrie Sechste, use Sechste ss Sigrun, make VFD. Artifact is good too since they're impactful fairies and also Nativity shuffles back the fairies, it means we don't have to run multiple copies of garnet. Eva is there as we can summon it through Diviner and it gives us Herald of The Orange Light with its effect online. We are able to run Extravagance as we dont need many extra deck monster to play.  The recursion line depends on several cards only, like Trias (it wont banish itself if used in VFD), Holy Night Flamel/Advent, and Eva. We don't run another lv7 LIGHT dragon as they're all bad cards and we need fairy fodder for Nativity, not dragon.  Pros: Unique playstyle with strong lock like VFD/Scythe.  Cons: The recursion and end board are weak."

Would appreciate any helpful comments.,"Trif's original deck profile ran 3 of ""Mythical Beast Master Cerberus"", but recently I found that it would often brick in my hands, and even if I started with it, it usually wasn't even protected when it had those 4 spell counters on it, so I replaced 2 of them with Jester Confits. Additionally: Magister and Mythical Institution often became bricks in my hand, and running Desires at 3 was a disaster when I'd have multiple copies in my starting hand, so I took out one of each and added in 1 Black Fang Magician and 2 Purple Poisons. Since this added a lot more DARK monsters to my deck, I replaced ""Into the Void"" with 1 ""Allure of Darkness"", because I didn't like the discard effect of the former.  For the extra deck, I changed it so often that I don't remember exactly what was in Trif's original? I think it had 3 Selene? I replaced 1 of them with a Thousand-Eyes Restrict which I would sometimes use in place of Millennium-Eyes whenever I played Instant Fusion, depending on my situation (though it would usually still be Millennium-Eyes more often than not). In place of Appollousa I added 1 Abyss Dweller because of all the L4 Monsters I added in and because even when I would set up a fairly decent board with a good handful of negates, the sheer the amount of floating effects from some of these meta-decks I've been facing are still able to play through the negates and then still overwhelm me.  Anyways I'm still a novice when it comes to pendulums and deck building in general, if you guys know any cards I should switch out for better combos/consistency, please do tell me. Thanks."

The trade-off is you lose 2 Apollousa negates, but with the amount of monster negates running around, losing this doesn't really matter (besides, a two mat Apollousa isn't that great anyway)  The new line is to use Elpy and Pisty to make Dillingerous dragon, then use Dill and the monster summoned off Pisty (or whatever other monster you have, but try to keep Rokket Tracer alive otherwise you can't make Savage) to make Rusty. This gets Dill into the graveyard which can then be resurrected to make Verte Anaconda off Rokket Tracer's effect."

Normal the lvl 4 rock -&gt; Activate Researcher -&gt; activate Analyzer. Use the effect of Researcher and Analyzer you are looking to hit Adamancipator Crystal Dragite to draw a card or Koa'Ki Mieru Guardian to protect board. Synchro into Adamancipator Risen Raptite to special a rock from top 5. Link 2 for Crystron Halqifibrax to special Researcher or Seeker. Link 2 for Predaplant Verte Anaconda using Halqifibrax. Synchro into Borreload then equip Halqifibrax. Activate Verte Anaconda to send Red-Eyes Fusion, Red-Eyes Black Dragon and Dark Magician from the deck to the graveyard. The Fossil Fusions are used to create beaters in the grind game or to make a material on the field for linking. A 2 card combo would be Miracle Rupture and Adamancipator Signs. Use Rupture to send Dragite from deck to grave and then use signs to Special Dragite from the GY. Use the effects to add Researcher or Seeker to the top of the deck then draw with Dragite to start your combo. Problems are bricking with Dragun materials and not finding a rock monster with Researcher or Seeker."

Oh, and some other cards too that you probably don't need, but makes a Red-Eyes player feel good.","This deck is mostly for personal reference. I'm addicted to making deck lists to pass the time. Help me.  I would've labeled this deck as a fun/ casual deck, but the inclusion of Dark Dragoon makes that description null. Even so, it is not the most optimal Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon deck, as you can obviously tell from the deck list. My goal was to make a for-fun Red-Eyes Black Dragon archetype deck, sticking as closely to the archetype as possible, and using only cards that I actually owned, instead of the hypothetical deck lists posted to the site. This is why Cards of the Red Stone and Allure of Darkness are at 2x instead of 3x (I only own 2 of each), and why I don't have Upstart Goblin, Raigeki (I instead use Dark Hole as a pretend-Raigeki since it doesn't affect Dark Dragoon, and it keeps the deck in-line with the ""Dark"" theme), Harpie's Feather Duster, Pot of Desires, or Cosmic Cyclone. It's also why Dragoon is at 1 instead of 3, because I'm not spending 80-100$ on two more copies.  I understand a lot of these cards are unnecessary. Dark Dragoon is the win condition, but I wanted to have a fun deck that allowed for strategies outside the honestly brain-dead strategy of ""draw or search for Red-Eyes Fusion, profit"". That's why I have kinky-byo to let me summon Beast-Eyes Pendulum Dragon, to further make use of my level 1 monsters, Claw of Hermos to let me summon Red-Eyes Black Sword, and why I have 3 copies of the Darkness Metal link monster that I'll never ever summon (I consider those cards my deck cheerleaders). Staying inside the boundaries of an archetype gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling."

If you have any suggestions, criticism, or praise lemme know down below!  Starting to get back into Yugioh after a good hiatus, and wanted to start fresh with one of my favorite archetypes.  UPDATE 1/31/21: I nixed Borreload Savage Dragon and replaced it with the new link 5 monster Underworld Goddess of the Closed World since having monsters on the field is no issue, plus linking away your opponent's monster (especially a link-2 hit) is highly favorable, and easier overall to summon vs. savage dragon.  I also changed some sideboard cards after playtesting.  UPDATE 3/25/21: I changed around the side deck as well as adding Zeus to the mix in place of Sunsaga.  For some reason one of my side deck cards isn't showing up on the site here.  The last card in my side deck is Coordius the Triphasic Dealmon."

You can use golden lord to send circle or combination to the graveyard to summon it back to the field! The main goal of the Dark magician engine is to boost out Dragoon. Magician's souls also synergizes very well with eldlich. The Dark Magicians can also be used to set Eldlich traps to the field!! You can also use Eldlich the Mad Golden Lord, Accesscode, Black Luster or even Dragoon to OTK the opponent. A typical end board should be Dragoon, Golden lord and a bunch of backrow. Overall a very fun deck to play and can also win duels! Have fun!! Suggestions in the comments."

You use Supernaturalist effect in order to add Necrovalley Throne (or Imperial Tombs if you already have Throne in hand) in EP. Next turn you just use Throne to add Gravekeeper's Headman, and use Headman's effect in order to summon Spiritualist again. You can now summon another Supernaturalist or link summon Verte Anaconda, in order to get Dragoon or Starving Venom Fusion Dragon, using SuperPoly.  I added Malefic Stardust Dragon cause it protects Necrovalley, and you can use it to summon Anaconda. Double Summon is also for Anaconda. If you have Recruiter on the field you can summon Artemis, triggering its effect. So you can add Commandant (in case you don't have Necrovalley on the field) or Spiritualist. Summon Black Rose Dragon (with Ash) if you want to clean the field. There's no Royal Tribute cause it's good only if you draw it in turn one imho, but you can add it in Side. SuperPolys and Storming Mirror Force in Side are for Dragoon.  I think this is the best Gravekeeper's deck ever built. Even if it's still a really slow-paced deck, it's a good antimeta, and it's also pretty simple to play."

Then at this point you will need to make a decision based on if you went first or second. if you went first link into kiskil then summon from the grave the other live twin to then link into lilla to then activate her effect summoning back kiskil (the link monster) to then draw a card. if you went second do what i just said but with the other twins. But the end effect will be to destroy a card on the field. then i would either link those two into unchained abomination and see if you have a unchained trap in hand to set it then end then activate abomination to pop it or to pop an opponents card. All the trap cards have primary effects that do different things but they all have similar secondary effects. these effects allows you to summon an unchained monster from the hand, deck or grave if the trap gets destroyed by card effect. This also counts for your own cards destroying them. This is the main strategies for the unchained monsters. Ive added to the deck some XYZ coverage with Numbers 97, 107 and 38 all rank 8. these can be summoned by the two level 8 monsters in the deck which are: <h4 class=""engine-dark-box"">Abominable Unchained Soul</h4> and <h4 class=""engine-dark-box"">Unchained Soul of Disaster.</h4> If you are going to XYZ summon then i would go into number 97 as he can summon (by its effect) one of the other rank 8 monsters by attaching the other to it as an XYZ material. In this deck you need to play lots of interruptions such as ash to stop your effects being negated and to stop your opponent making unstoppable boards with lots of negates.  That's all you really need to know but that's not the only combos you can do with it but I feel like you need to find some out on your own. One more thing I've play tested this deck out many times on nexus and went 5:0 with this deck on there so I know its competitive and is a very strong rouge deck.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Note for my build, some of the cards aren't officially out yet.  Some of the biggest issues with the deck are with consistency, not many monster effect negates, board control, or pump out big beaters to get over stuff. When playing the deck you want to play more defensive and more control based. I made the deck as a mix going 1st and going 2nd. As in having options while going 1st or 2nd. So in my build, I decided to tech 2 cards (Evenly Match and XYZ Import). And my extra deck has few board control options like Evilswarm Exciton Knight and Castle. But I will explain more about this deck while going on.  <strong>Monsters (19):</strong>  <strong>3x Ash Blossom</strong> - Standard Hand Trap. You need some sort of hand trap nowadays, too many can be cloggy so currently, Ash Blossom is one of the safest ones to main.  <strong>3x Time Thief Regulator</strong> - I recommend trying to bait out <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> before summoning this guy 1st. This guy has 2 jobs for you, when he is normal to summon, you can tribute him while you have no monster to special summon 2 <strong>Time Thief</strong> monsters from your deck. I recommend for your targets to be <strong>Winder</strong> and <strong>Adjuster</strong>. Both of their effects will kick up once you summon them. It also has a GY effect where if your XYZ monster was destroyed by battle you can special summon it from the grave but it is banished when it leaves the field.  <strong>3X Time Thief Winder</strong> - He is practically the Stratos for this deck, he can search out <strong>Time Thief</strong> cards and I would recommend using his effect to search out <strong>Time Thief Retrograde </strong>or <strong>Flyback. </strong>You can also special summon him from your hand by detecting materials from a <strong>Time Thief</strong> XYZ.  <strong>2x Time Thief Chronocorder</strong> - I would recommend running 1 or 2 copies. It has a graveyard effect that can special summon itself when your XYZ (partially <strong>Redoer</strong>) leaves the field with its own effect.  <strong>3 x Time Thief Adjuster </strong>- She can easily special summon herself if you normal or special summon a <strong>Time Thief</strong> monster and has a ""<strong>Foolish Burial</strong>"" effect that can dump any <strong>Time Thief</strong> card in the grave. I would recommend using her effect to dump <strong>Chronocorder</strong> or <strong>Bezel Ship</strong> in the grave but heavily recommend using it to dump Time <strong>Thief Startup/Time Thief Flyback</strong> in the grave using her effect. Since these cards have graveyard effects.  <strong>1x Time Thief Bezel Ship</strong> - I would recommend running 1 or 2 of this guy. It can special summon itself from the grave by removing <strong>XYZ</strong> material from a <strong>Time Thief XYZ</strong> but it banishes itself after it leaves the field.  For this deck, I am running a <strong>""Performage"" </strong>Engine.  <strong>1x Performage Damage Juggler </strong>- I recommend foolish burial him and either get <strong>Trick Clown</strong> or <strong>Hat Tricker</strong> to hand but if you draw into him you can still normal summon him or use him as a hand trap to not take damage.  <strong>1x Performage Trick Clown </strong>- one the best stall,<strong> Foolish Burial</strong> target and <strong>XYZ</strong> material card, his effect is ""If this card is sent to the GY: you can target 1 ""Performage"" monster in your GY: Special Summon it, but its ATK/DEF become 0, then you take 1000 damage 1000 damage. You can only use this effect of ""Performage Trick Clown"" once per turn. I love this guy in my Lightsworns build but he is also handy here especially since you are trying to get into rank 4 XYZs. You can detach him as XYZ material and his effects still go off.  <strong>2x Performage Hat Tricker</strong> - One of the good Performage monsters even when you go 2nd. It special summon itself if there are more than 2 monsters on the field, so if you go 2nd, you can just special summon him easily and not lose your normal summon that turn.  <strong>Spells (12):</strong>  <strong>1x Instant Fusion</strong> - It is an extender to help get out your XYZ or even link plays. I am using this summon <strong>Darkfire Dragon</strong> to kick off XYZ plays.  <strong>1x Foolish Burial</strong> - you have a few Foolish Burial targets in this deck such as <strong>Trick Clown</strong>, <strong>Damage Juggler</strong>, <strong>Regulator</strong>, <strong>Chronocorder,</strong> and <strong>Bezel.</strong>  <strong>1x Monster Reborn</strong> and <strong>1x Called by the Grave</strong> - They are good generic staples to have in hand.  <strong>2x Time Thief Startup</strong> - I mostly use it for its GY effect but it also works as a double summon to help to get <strong>""Time Thief""</strong> monsters on board for XYZ plays. Its GY is written as ""During your Main Phase: You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 ""Time Thief"" XYZ Monster you control: attach 3 ""Time Thief"" cards of different types (1 Monster, 1 Spell, and 1 Trap) from your GY to that monster as Material"". You can search this card using <strong>Winder</strong> or dump it in grave using <strong>Adjuster</strong>  <strong>1x Time Thief Hack</strong> - you don't have to run this card, but for my build, it is helpful to get over stuff or finish for the game. It also gives a protection effect for your ""Time Thief"" monsters during the turn they are summoned, they can't be destroyed by your opponent's card effects. This helps especially if you are going 2nd. You can even attack directly using its effect if you already have your opponent's material as XYZ material and give a 300 attack boost per material that is attached. I would recommend running 1 and it is searchable.  <strong>2x XYZ Import</strong> - This is a good going 1st card, especially if you know your opponent has to start their play with a monster that has less than your XYZ monster, most of the time you are going to start out with Redoer either way so anything less than 2400 ATK that your opponent controls will turn into an XYZ material. If you do it right, you can pretty much stop anything your opponent do for the turn.  <strong>2x Pot of Disparity</strong> - I generally prefer this card over Desires (especially since most decks do run <strong>Ash</strong>) or Extravagance. Because you get to control what you are banishing, from your extra deck and try to dig out what card you need especially if you going for games 2/3 where you are trying to search out your key side deck card. Its Duality effect doesn't restrict special summoning which is important on turn 1. If you don't want to banish anything or want more draw power, I strongly suggest <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong> 12 Dark Monsters, over something like Desires. I generally am against running Desires because Ash exists and also if you run decks that have a lot of darks or need cards in the grave.  <strong>1x Pot of Avarice</strong> - You are going to need to recycle all your monsters, XYZs or not. It can be cloggy running multiply so running 1 is good enough.  <strong>Traps (11)</strong>  <strong>3x Time Thief Retrograde</strong> - This card is your Spell and Trap shield and turns your opponent spell/trap into XYZ material.  <strong>3x Time Thief Flyback</strong> - You can stuff your opponent's GY cards if it is set as material if it is in the grave or stuff cards from your deck into Time Thief XYZ Monsters.  <strong>2x The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</strong> - It is a trap monster that can be used for rank 4 XYZ, if you don't have traps in your grave on your 1st turn, you can activate him right away.  <strong>3x Evenly Matched</strong> - One of the best board wipes in the game and with Redoer's effect, you can easily use him on your turn if you have nothing field. And it is one of the best cards especially going 2nd. This card single handly will make Hero's player rage quit after they set up their board because of their lower monster count, take care of annoying unbreakable boards, etc.  <strong>Extra deck (15)</strong>  <strong>1x Darkflare Dragon</strong> - you only have him for <strong>Instant Fusion</strong> target or banish for <strong>Pot of Disparity</strong><strong> </strong>if you want. You just it for that necessarily filler.  <strong>2x Time Thief Redoer </strong>- He is basically the boss monster for this deck and he is also a generic rank 4 that you can splash around in other decks. His effects read as  ""Once per turn, during the Standby Phase: You can attach the top card of your opponent's Deck to this card as material. (Quick Effect): You can detach up to 3 different types of materials from this card, then apply the following effect(s) depending on what was detached. <div class=""os-padding""> <div class=""os-viewport os-viewport-native-scrollbars-invisible unselectable""> <div class=""os-content selectable os-textarea"">● Monster: Banish this card until the End Phase. ● Spell: Draw 1 card. ● Trap: Place 1 face-up card your opponent controls on the top of the Deck. You can only use this effect of ""Time Thief Redoer"" once per turn.""</div> </div> <div>The goal for this deck is to stuff cards into him either from your opponent's side or yours and using his effects to draw cards, banish itself to not get destroyed, or place a face-up back on top of the deck.</div> </div> <div><strong>2x - Time Thief Perpetual</strong> - She has 2 good effects, during each standby phase she can stuff cards into <strong>Redoer</strong>, <strong>Doublebarrel</strong>, or another copy of herself. You can use her effect to special summon Time Thief monsters from the grave as well.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x - Time Thief Doublebarrel</strong> - I would also recommend a 2nd copy but 1 is good enough because you need stuff cards in him instead of something natural like <strong>Redoer</strong> can do. But his effects are worth it. Because he can turn into mind control or negate the effect a monster your opponent controls on the field. His effects read as:</div> <div> <div class=""os-padding""> <div class=""os-viewport os-viewport-native-scrollbars-invisible unselectable""> <div></div> <div class=""os-content selectable os-textarea"">""When your opponent activates a card or effect (Quick Effect): You can detach up to 3 different types of materials from this card, then apply the following effect(s) depending on what was detached. ● Monster: This card gains 400 ATK. ● Spell: Take control of 1 face-up monster your opponent controls until the End Phase, but it cannot declare an attack or activate its effects this turn. ● Trap: Negate the effects of 1 Effect Monster on the field until the end of this turn. You can only use this effect of ""Time Thief Doublebarrel"" once per turn.""</div> </div> <div></div> <div><strong>2x Castel</strong> - a decent rank 4 to go into and helps to get certain cards on the field</div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x Evilswarm Exciton Knight</strong> - He is one of the best rank 4 board wipes to get out</div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x Evilswarm Nightmare</strong> - Since you run a lot of dark attribute monsters, you can easily get this guy out to book your opponent monster, if they are running stuff like ""Sky Strikers or heavy on the Link"" he is useless but most decks, he is still good putting some board controls.</div> </div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x Abyss Dweller</strong> - Graveyard is like a 2nd hand, you can shut down your Opponent's second hand.</div> </div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x I:P Masquerena, Pheonix, Unicorn</strong> - Generic links that are good go-to.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</strong> - ""Unaffected by other monsters' effects, except those of Xyz Monsters. Cannot be destroyed by battle, except with an Xyz Monster. You can target 1 Xyz Monster in your GY and 1 card your opponent controls; Special Summon that monster from your GY, and if you do, attach that opponent's card to it as material, also for the rest of this turn, any damage your opponent takes is halved. You can only use this effect of ""Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops"" once per turn."" This card is great for XYZ heavy decks and also a 4k beater to get over your opponent's monsters.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>Side Deck (15)</strong></div> <div></div> <div><strong>3x Nibiru</strong> - for those heavy Special Summon and spam decks.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>3x Gamma + 1x Driver</strong> - a good hand trap option especially if you are going 2nd.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x Dimensional Fissure</strong> - You can run Dimensional Fissure as a possible floodgate. Because it doesn't banish XYZ materials. but put it when you are done setting up.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>3x Cosmic Cyclone</strong> - A lot of meta decks have Spell and Traps with GY effects so it is better to get them banished.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>3x Dark Ruler No More</strong> - Best go 2nd card after <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>, especially if you know they are running annoy stuff like <strong>Dragoon</strong>.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x Red Reboot</strong> - If you go 2nd or you know your opponent runs a lot of annoying traps, this card takes care of them. Especially for the face, you can activate it from the hand.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>Strategy:</strong></div> <div></div> <div>When playing this deck, you want to be playing more defensively and as possible. Time <strong>Thief Winder</strong> and <strong>Regulator</strong> are your best starting plays. And when you are stuff cards in <strong>Redoer</strong> or even <strong>Doublebarrel</strong>, you particularly want to stuff them up with spells and traps. That is where <strong>Time Thief Flyback</strong> comes in and <strong>Time Thief Startup</strong> comes up while in the grave. I generally made this deck where you can go 1st or 2nd, it won't matter much. So that is why I run stuff like <strong>Evenly Matched</strong> as a main deck card. Ideally, when going 1st you want to get out <strong>Time Thief Redoer</strong> and then get out <strong>Perpetua</strong>. When going 2nd, I would recommend getting out <strong>Doublebarrel </strong>or a different XYZ/Link depending on the situation.</div> <div></div> <div>Either way, I had a lot of fun playing this deck and I hope you guys get to try it out!</div>"

With it being able to attack all special summoned monsters and it's 4K attack it can get over most monsters. And being able to get rid of max 2 monsters on the field from a quick effect and not being effected by monster effects is a bonus.</li>  	<li>Quadrantids- The red headed stepchild of the group. Although not being able to pop cards as a quick effect, this card instead destroys all spell and trap cards. Although this effect is only a guarantee if you use two monsters with level equal to 2. Still it being unaffected by spells and traps and still having 4K attack is a plus. It's a good spell and trap counter if the opponent has a lot of spells.</li>  	<li>Demise- Good for whipping boards and protecting monsters. With the only monster that will really stay on your field for the whole turn being ritual monsters, Demise's effect of protecting Ritual monsters from being destroyed by battle is great protection and a good support to have on the field</li>  	<li>Amorphactor Pain- A good effect negator for extra deck monsters. This card negates the effect of fusions, synchros, and xyz monsters. A bonus effect the card has is the turn the monster is summoned, your opponents next main phase 1 is skipped. Although it could be beat out by a link monster with a high enough attack</li> </ul> Best set ups with ritual monsters: <ul>  	<li>Draconids and Quadrantids- Having the two boss monsters of the archetype on the field is always a good sign. With them both having 4K attack along with being immune to monster effects and spells and traps, it is a great board set up.</li>  	<li>Demise and Draconids- Demise can destroy all cards on the field at the cost of 2K life points. Draconids is unaffected by monster effects so if you could get this set up going second you could leave your opponent with 1K life points left.</li>  	<li>Amorphactor Pain and Draconids- With Amorphactor negating the effects of extra deck monsters and Draconids being able to attack all special summoned monsters, it helps Draconids get over any effects that could change their attack or negates destruction by battle.</li> </ul> &nbsp;"

Or OTK if you go second. The deck's weakness is that it is very weak to negations, hand traps like Infinite Impermanence, Nibiru the Primal Being and Ash Blossom. Especially now that Called by the Grave and Red Reboot are limited. Which of course in this day and age isn't an exactly good quality in a deck. However the deck is still fun to play eventhough the games usually end up in you dying to hand trap or opponent surrendering/quiting.  Replays: https://youtu.be/kPpkGYS3VVk"

Ready for 2021..,"Thoughts to consider below from a long time red eyes player...  Spam gearfried and black metal dragon combo.  Use one for one to help bring out a lvl 1.  Black Stone for summoning or Effect Veiler / rider of the storm winds for synchro.  Also World Legacy Guardagon for revival of a lvl 1 into a synchro or into Relinquished Anima / Linkuriboh if you're in trouble.  Use The King of D to play your Dragon Revival Rhapsody.  You also have the option to go for effect veiler with One for One, if you need a spellcaster for your Dragon Revival Rhapsody whenever The King of D isn't present.  Return of the Dragon Lords is your main protection from the GY.  Rider of the Storm Winds provides some.  Number 11 Big Eye will also get you out of trouble.  Successor soul too. This will help you dispose of an enemy monster.  When activating Dragon shrine, send Keeper of the Shrine as your second monster to the GY. You want him there as quickly as possible for safety and further plays. Noctovision is also your friend, especially to gain a second monster for your xyz.  Spam burn damage and fusion ASAP. Predaplant will be your friend here too if needed.  You dont need 3 Fusion or 3 Insight.  3 Red eyes will also brick too often so I stick with 2. I prefer 2 flare rather than 1 as you can often use his burn damage.  You also need to be wary of lack of draw power hence why I have 2 allure.  Still toying with Cards of the Red Stone and Reasoning.  &nbsp;"

The goal is to turbo out master peace (the one that's not banned), or to just spam cards as much as you can with only using three effect monsters.  for reference the cards I used points on were: an extra copy of box, a copy of diagram, and an extra copy of goldriver  Any and all feedback would be very helpful seeing as this is my first attempt at a trinity deck.  edit: didn't realize terraforming was co forbidden, replaced it with metaverse."

The deck is still missing some things and i'm running not that many copies of some staples here, and i'm using banned cards mostly because i'm playing against AI right now, i don't think it'd take many edits to get it legal in any case if i wanted to.  &nbsp;  The maindeck:  monsters:  2-3 copies of the staples as deckspace allowed, plus x2 copies of Lady Debug. If i was to remove a Gazelle to adhere to Limited legality i'd throw in a 3rd copy of one of the monsters at 2, probably Falco or Spinny. I don't run any monsters in the maindeck over level 4, so i have to rely on Link Summons, and my Fusions to do most of the heavy lifting in terms of ATK, Jack Jaguar is the best at 1800. The monsters are mostly just trying to be value-machines to get the actual threats out of the extra deck efficiently.  spells: I run a lot of illegal stuff currently to beat the ai and to account for what i have in my collection in LOTD. Pot of Greed is simply the best card draw available to use against the AI so i'm taking advantage of the ai not caring about me using banlisted cards. i'm also using a full playset of circles for more consistancy v.s. the ai. if i were playing against actual people i'd probably use a 1-of of pot of desires and an extra MST, and, since Circe is at-1 i'd probably replace those 2 cards by beefing up the traps a bit by adding another CotH, and throwing in a Infinite Impermanence.  &nbsp;  Traps: 1 mirror force to use in tandem with the raigeki for removal in case i have a hard time sacking a link monster for the removal effect on Salamangreat Rage. Since i currently use two Talkers in my extra deck, i felt a 1-of of Recoded Alive was justifiable. I'd probably cut it the second i got something better than the Talkers (cough savage borrelsword dragon cough another heatleo or so cough)  &nbsp;  Extra Deck:  Currently only have 1 heatleo (i really need at least 1 more....) running the Decode Talker and Encode Talker to mostly beef up my amount of Link-3s. Firewall Dragon and the xyz are placeholders to get through LOTD stuff since they're banned, would ideally replace them with a second heatleo and maybe Accesscode Talker to get more out of Recoded Alive or Savage Borrelsword Dragon if i could fit tuners in here. (so if i was to play this deck against people the banned cards would instead be like another heatleo and either of the above options, if I went for Savage Borrelsword over Accesscode I would try to make maindeck room for Ash Blossoms, obviously.)  I have no idea what i would put in a sidedeck currently, i'm casual/new."

They may not be all that scary on their own, but the more Talkers you get out the worse it becomes for your opponent! With monsters that special or link from hand, summoning multiple link 3's is an absolute breeze. The two most important cards in this deck, hands down are Microcoder and Cynet Codec. Micro Coder allows you to search any cynet spell or trap when linked from hand and codec allows you to search for a cyberse monster of the same attribute as the code talker you just summoned. These two cards allow you to start picking up momentum towards and end board. Below I'll put one of the most basic combos that ends on an un-targetable Accesscode Talker  To start this combo you need to have two cards in your hand. Balancer Lord and Lady Debug <ol>  	<li>Summon Balancer Lord and activate its effect to get another normal summon</li>  	<li>Summon Lady Debug, activate its effect to bring Microcoder to hand</li>  	<li>Link summon Lady Debug and Micro Coder from your hand to link summon Code Talker</li>  	<li>Activate Micro Coder's effect in grave to bring Cynet Codec to hand</li>  	<li>Activate Cynet Codec</li>  	<li>Link summon Transcode Talker with Balancer Lord and Code Talker</li>  	<li>Activate Cynet Codec and bring Code Generator to hand</li>  	<li>Activate Transcode's effect to special summon Code Talker from grave to the zone he points to</li>  	<li>Link Code Generator from hand with Code Talker to summon Encode Talker</li>  	<li>Activate Cynet codec, search Lady Debug</li>  	<li>Activate Code Generator in grave to send Dotscaper to grave</li>  	<li>Activate Dotscaper's ability and special summon it from the grave</li>  	<li>Link Dotscaper and Encode to summon Accesscode Talker</li>  	<li>Activate Accesscode talker and target Encode, boosting its attack points by 3000</li> </ol> You can choose to stop on Encode to have two un-targetable monsters with Encode protecting Transcode and Transcode able to bring Encode back if it's destroyed. Other than that there are many more ways to go about this deck. All of the ""Code"" main deck monsters have abilities when linked from the field so you can make some spicy mix-ups with that. Other cards you really don't wanna sleep on are Prohibit Snake, a hand trap that bounces, Cynet Storm, a field spell that boosts your monsters and makes link summons unable to be negated, and Cynet Conflict, a searchable counter trap that negates effects if you have a Code Talker on the field as well as banishing the card and preventing your opponent from activating cards of the same name until the end of the next turn!  This is by no means the best version of this deck, but I hope you have as much fun as I did!"

I think its very good in terms of accomplishing its goal; to get Bahamut out and summon Toadally. I've played with this deck casually quite a bit and I very rarely brick. If I do brick I usually have some kind of draw power in hand, either Upstart or  Moray, but almost every monster card in this deck allows me to get some kind of combo going.  I'm looking for all kinds of suggestions with this deck to improve it, I love sharks and when I found out there was a shark deck I went all in.

Swordstalker can be a good target for Silent Doom and save the Ancient Rules to get the Blue-Eyes White Dragon out onto the field. First Of The Dragons and Alligator's Sword Dragon are also relatively easy to get out, with traps such as Quaking Mirror Force keeping the materials safe and Birthright reviving them even if they are destroyed. Heat Wave can also shut down your opponents summons for a turn most likely, whilst keeping yours available. Exiled Force and Effect Veiler are included for coverage and cards such as Inspiration and Shrink can help in destroying tougher opponents."

Lava Golem is also a tactic here, summon him and then immobilize him with Spellbinding Circle. If they break that trap, use creature swap to take him back and either tribute him or attack with him for a big finishing blow."

Dark World Plunder Patroll Golden Castle of Stromberg. Basically, this is a greedy midrange discard.dek that can do a little bit of everything depending on your hand, it has lots of niche interactions that let you more or less pop off. This deck doesn't care about the contents of your hand, deck or anything else, and can simply ram it's resources in to the opponent until it loses  Some interactions of note: Mirage of Nightmare is the best and worst card in the deck, you can use it to trigger discard effects, but really the deck wants it to draw in to handtraps and Plunder ammunition, The issue is that you can get stuck in a discard loop where you have no hand on your turn. I've included a high density of cards that allow you to remove your own mirage and keep the cards it draws, including all the quick-play backrow removal, Set Rotation, Forbidden Droplets, and even Hop Ear Squadron to go in to Vulcan the Divine. You can also do all these same things to keep Golden Castle of Stromberg from milling your deck, if you have a line in mind that you need to search for  Danger! Zone: usually, you want to use this when you have a Danger in your hand already. it is almost always a +1 or 2. It's actually totally valid to run 3 of this card, but points are fairly tight here and the third Whitebeard is usually better. If you don't have a Danger in hand, you can empty out your hand to fish for a hit with it, if you miss, you didn't really lose anything because it was dead regardless  Plunder Patroll: This archetype has to many wacky interactions for me to tell you, you really just have to play the deck long enough to learn them, but my main tips are: watch out for Xeno-Locks on Whitebeard and Goldenhair; All Plunder Patroll discards are costs so they don't trigger Dark Worlds, but this can be mitigated with Mothman and Ojama Pink; Getting 2 Shipyarrd in rotation enables the top end of what the archetype can do."

Now keep in mind if you put wight baking (new card) in the grave from your deck you either get a +1 or stay neutral with card advantage.</span>  <span>When <strong>Wight baking</strong> is sent to the GY, you draw any 2 cards with ""skull servant"" in their text and discard 1 card from your hand which will always be <strong>Wightprince</strong>. With <strong>Wight baking</strong>'s effect any Wight cards count as skull servants, so you can pull them out of your deck. He is also really good hand trap protection when you have a <strong>King of skull servant</strong> on the field</span>  <span>When using <strong>Wightprince's</strong> effect to summon <strong>King of skull servants</strong> servant you almost always want to banish 2 <strong>The Lady in Wight</strong> or 1 <strong>The Lady in Wight</strong> and 1 <strong>Wightprincess</strong></span>  <span><strong>The Lady in Wight </strong>completely negates the effect of spell and trap for all level 3 or lower zombie type monsters except for herself. This adds an additional layer to keep <strong>King of Skull servants</strong> safe</span>  <span><strong>Wightmare</strong> can special summon a <strong>King of skull servant</strong> or <strong>The Lady in Wight t</strong>o the field, he can also bring a <strong>Skull servant</strong> or <strong>Wightmare </strong>to the GY. You almost always want to special summon either <strong>King of skull servant</strong> or<strong> The Lady in Wight</strong> to the field with this card's effect</span>  <span><strong>Wightprincess</strong> act as a handtrap and when summoned can send <strong>Wightprince</strong> to the grave, keep in mind her handtrap effect can also be used on the field and when her effect gets used she boosts ""King of skull servants"" damage by 1000.</span>  <span>The main 3 benefits from the shiranui support is the 2 trap cards and syncro summoning from the grave. </span>  <span><strong>Shiranui style shallow slash</strong> can be used to get rid of backrow or to shut down your opponent's combo in their first turn when they normal summon.</span>  <span><strong>Shiranui style samsara</strong> stops you from getting OTK'd by banishing 1 monster preferably with 0DEF and also let's you draw +1 card by recycling 2 0DEF banished monsters. For example syncro summoning from the grave with shiranui, or recycling wightprince and wightprincess into your deck.</span>  <span><strong>Powerful rebirth</strong> is useful to bring back the <strong>King of skull servants</strong> or <strong>Wightprincess</strong> which will send another <strong>Wightprince</strong> to the grave and her handtrap effect can be used again or bring back a <strong>Gozuki</strong> to send more cards to the grave.</span>  <span><strong>King of skull servants</strong> does have 1 weakness, destroyed by card effects. However his attack can theoretically reach 18k and he can come back to the field when destroyed by battle if there is a skull servant to banish in the GY. Having 1 star also let's him benefit from <strong>Wightprincess</strong>'s effect.</span>  <span><strong>Archfiend Zombie skull</strong> does help to remove <strong>King of skull servants</strong> weakness</span>  <span><strong>Mezuki</strong> is used to counter <strong>King of skull servants</strong> weakness</span>  <span><strong>Gozuki </strong>can be used to send <strong>Wightprince</strong>, <strong>Wight baking</strong> or the occasional <strong>Mezuki</strong> to the graveyard. Can also be used to special summon <strong>King of skull servants</strong> or <strong>Wightpricess</strong> from your hand when destroyed. </span>  <span><strong>Samurai skull </strong>Similar to Gozuki's effect, but he can only send 1 monster upon summon to the GY which is why Gokuki's effect is better there. However the cost to summon a monster from the deck is nothing and is beter than Gozuki's effect.</span>  <span><strong>Needlebug nest</strong> is used to get monsters in the grave as quick as possible also give <strong>King of skull servants</strong> an ATK boost</span>  <span><strong>Performerpal Pop-up</strong> is an interesting card, you can ignore most of it's effect except the first 2 parts and the cost. Send up to 3 cards from your hand to the GY, draw that many cards, pay 1000LP for each card in your hand. LP doesn't matter all too much for an effect this great. If <strong>Weightprince</strong>, <strong>Mezuki</strong> and <strong>Wight baking</strong> was sent to the GY you end up with 7 ""skull servant"" cards in the GY, a mezuki and you draw +1 more from <strong>Wight baking</strong> and +3 more cards from <strong>Pop-up</strong> to start your combo. All that potentially from just 1 card.</span>  <strong><span>Allure of darkness </span></strong><span>is a good staple card it let's you draw 2 cards, but be aware of what monsters are in your hand, otherwise you risk banishing monsters you don't want to.</span>  <strong><span>Update 1.1</span></strong> <table>  <tr> <td><span><strong><span>Action</span></strong></span></td> <td><span><strong><span>Card</span></strong></span></td> <td><span><strong><span>Reason</span></strong></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Removed</span></td> <td><span>Summoned skull</span></td> <td><span>meme card</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Reduced to 1</span></td> <td><span>Performapal pop-up</span></td> <td><span>Becomes harder to play after taking damage once</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Increased to 3</span></td> <td><span>Samurai Skull</span></td> <td><span>Performance was a lot better than expected, makes up for missing draw power by sending <strong>Wight Baking</strong> directly from deck to GY.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Removed </span></td> <td><span>Archfiend's Call </span></td> <td><span>Was meant to be support to bring out <strong>Summoned skull</strong> (meme card) more often. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Added to 2</span></td> <td><span>Forbidden Droplet</span></td> <td><span>Extremely useful tech card to remove or avoid nasty effects on the field, while still sending monsters from your hand to the grave.

If your opponent targets <strong>Shiranui style samsara</strong> you can always still use it's effect, because its effect doesn't stop even if it leaves the field. </span>  <span>You | Turn 5</span>  <span>Draw, you get a <strong>Needlebug nest</strong>. Depending on your previous <strong>Needlebug nest</strong>, if you got lucky and got a <strong>Mezuki</strong> in the grave you can always bring <strong>King of skull servants</strong> back to the field.

Everybody goes on about how Madolche is a going second deck, but let's be honest, in the current format going second is almost always met with 2+ negates. One if you're lucky. PSY- Frame would probably run better with the engine style, keeping monsters out of the GY but I own Ash IRL and still think it's a staple. Solemn Judgement to be safe, is there anything that gets past it? Probably, but chances are you won't have any issues. Paying half your LP doesn't really do anything, again, current format, duels don't last too many turns. Negate as much as you can to set up the EASY OTK combo. I won't be posting any actual combo instructions, these can be found everywhere.  The dimension shifter is experimental, but hear me out:  Perfect going first board/hand-  Teacher (GY disruption)  Promenade and maybe a chalice (1/2x negate)  Ash in hand (pushing it but I have gotten this hand quiet a few times)  Indestructible Hoot from Jelly, straight chillin  Sistart (protect the backline)  And bangggg Shifter to end.  How many deck engines rely on GY? MOST  This sets you up for an easy win.  Going second is far more tricky IMO. Madolche doesn't deal with negates too well.  You can always swap out/add as you please. The best thing about this deck is the freedom of choice.  Keep that Side Deck handy cause there are so many swaps that can be made depending on your situation."

Atrribute whirlwind,"Charmers are well... underpowered. I know this is not a shock to anyone, but the old beatdown style with different attributes and splashable ATK or DEF spellcaster values make this an interesting mash up. The new Charmer spell from the SD ""Spirit Charmers"" really gives the consistency to run the other archetype cards like Awakening and Possessed Partnerships. Awakening is a card the more competitive builds I have seen shy away from or only use at 1 copy, but being able to just amass different attributes to beat down over most monsters and getting an extra draw most turns is actually pretty useful, since the other engines do the control and focus on the extra deck utility. An obvious consistency booster would be Nadir's Servant, but I do not own any copies of that or Fleurdalies yet. I wanted to run 1 of each attribute charmer to make Awakening as useful as possible and stick to Charmers being the central focus. Dogmatika is an obvious pairing since having spellcasters that have 1500 DEF to revive off of the Charmer cards while being sticky and getting a lot of searches in is huge. Invoked is a 1 card engine that can utilize the varying attributes so I felt it had to be combined with the Charmers as well and is just standalone good.  I have not experimented with Shaddoll or Magistus cards in here, but I feel this combination is about the most competitive that can be made without having access to the $70+ cards (and only 1 invocation). Last thing that people could consider is the Dragoon package since you get a good amount of extra draws and searches it will always have discard fodders and is inline with the control and pop theme of the deck, but that would make 2-3ish dead cards if drawn and this deck is all about having a use for everything you draw (so no handtraps). Half the deck is dedicated towards Charmers to be super consistent and a fun rogue deck that can be built up with more $ and transform into the linear InvokedShaddollDogmatika if you want to get into regionals and be the most competitive. Not many techs in here as I run large amounts of each package/archetype and like how it plays with keeping it cheap (The 3x Ecclesia and 1x Invocation are about $100 and most of the deck cost).  &nbsp;  Main deck Charmer package:  1x of each Charmer - they are vanilla essentially but synchronize with all the archetype spell or traps and provide more Invoked access. The Lyna is the clear cut since there is already so many lights in the deck and Fairy Tail Luna is clearly better to normal, just can't be used with Charmers S/T outside of the draw from Awakening. I just wanted to run a copy of each personally  3x Spirit Charmers - a 2 for 2 that lets you set up anything you want from the Charmer package and provides huge consistency  3x Awakening of the Possessed - boosts your whole field with each attribute and gets an extra draw a lot of the time. Also adds card destruction protection for the Charmer monsters that people usually overlook  3x Possessed Partnerships - reborn a Dogmatika or Charmer then pop 1 if you have 2+ attributes and can be used to put Awakening or Unpossessed back on the field  1x Unpossessed - a free SS for a different attribute 1500 DEF mon when ANY monster is destroyed by ANY means. Also gives a +800 ATK to your Charmer attacks and battle destruction protection to them. Only 1 needed since it can be recycled and searched from Spirit  2x Fairy Tail - Luna - a pseudo light Charmer that can search on summon and is a main consistency card, 3 is optimal but I wanted to run a Lyna instead. Useful for bouncing an opponents monster face up unless they send another one to the GY  2x Witchcrafter Golem Aruru -  a good budget card as it came in the structure deck and provides a quick effect bounce on an opponents card if a spellcaster is targeted or attacked. Useful tech that could be run at 3 or cut in favor of something else. Also just a big body that can come out pretty easy  &nbsp;  Main deck Dogmatika package:  3x Ecclesia - just a super good card that pairs well with the Possessed Partnerships, Invoked, and slow down your opponent  1x Ashiyan - the 2nd best 1500 DEF from the archetype that can give a boost and recycle a card on top of being a free body from a Titaniklad send  3x Punishment - a great disruption that can generate advantage or more pops and is searchable  &nbsp;  Main Deck Invoked package:  3x Aleister - duh he runs the whole archetype and is a 1 card fusion that can be used every turn and searched from the field spell and by extent Terraforming or Metaverse  1x Invocation - the neccessary spell for the archetype, I only have 1 of but am fine with these numbers as it doesnt lead to boring fusion and pray for the best hands  3x Meltdown - search and guarantee the fusion summons  &nbsp;  Main deck techs:  1x Terraforming - Get the invoked cards live or slap down the secret village  1x Metaverse - refer to that ^  1x Secret Village of the Spellcasters - likely lock your opponent out of blowout techs and draw power without fear of it blocking you since you will almost always have a spellcaster in hand even if your monsters get nuked  1x Callled By the Grave - stop any annoying shennanigans  2x Crackdown - use opponent monsters for link material 0r just hold them to prevent climbing and effects. 3 would not hurt anything if a charmer mon or golem was removed  &nbsp;  Extra deck:  1x of each Charmer link -  link off opponent monsters or steal them from their GY  1x Abyss Dweller - prevent GY extenders and use almost any monster card in the deck to make  1x Selene Master of Magicians - Link climb to bring back a choice mon  1x Borrelsword Dragon - Big boi get bigger, condenses your field if need be too, can be sent to out Zeus  2x Titaniklad -  send for Dogmatika stuff and search. A third copy is almost never needed and I only have 2 so it works out well  1x N'tss - send for an extra pop, only have 1 but 2 or 3 could be useful depending on the matchup if you are willing to cut something else from the ED  2x Mechaba - great control card and easy to make in this deck, if 3 is needed your game is probably so long and grindy you are in a bad spot as is  1x Caliga - 1 attack and 1 monster effect can lock many decks down. very underrated but only accessable by a sent ED card or the Dharc (not relying on your opponents monsters)  1x Purg - keep swinging and piercing, could be cut but I like the option for a fusion that can attack all monsters  1x Raidjin - flip whatever nonesense your opponent has down and can be brought out with instant fusion. 1 is plenty since you don't always need it but is a great utility to have  &nbsp;  Side:  1x Pankratops - obvious good go second card, can help comeback if you get nuked as well  1x Feather Duster - ^  1x Raigeki - ^  1x Monster Reborn - sometimes better than the possessed trap because it can bring back your ED mons, but wont get extra pops or draws usually. Is a spell instead of a trap too  1x Set Rotation - matchup specific, but can annoy the hell out of opponents by blocking starters or make them pop it  3x DRNM - imo the best going second card right now and always is good to allow you to set up a board  3x Night Beam - after experimenting with each removal, this is the best for going second I have found. Does nothing for going first and probably wont be too useful turn 3, but they cannot chain the target unlike cosmic or MST and it has no card cost like twin twisters.  1x Pot of Avarice - Recycle and draw for a grindy match  3x Summon Limit - keep the wombo combos under control if you go first  &nbsp;  Thanks for the read on my first decklist post and give me your thoughts and feedback below! Keep in mind I am a newer player who does not have all the fancy expensive cards yet and my locals has a ton of variety so I did not make it specifically to be anti-meta or degenerate lock. I want to know if anyone has seen others have success with the Charmer cards as well and if you guys like keeping in the Lyna + Dharc and Golem and any other spice to consider. The side deck is the part most open to change in my opinion. Lastly, this does do well on DB also and some people just quit after seeing spirit into awakening + a charmer then using punishment on their turn so that's fun."

Prank kids recently took 1st In the Remote duel Invitat,"<span>Prank-kids were always a solid tier 2 option for the metagame. This was because it was a little too reliant on the normal summon and it lost to ash blossom. What was worse was that it could just not play against well established boards. Prank Kids are no longer tier 2 and I believe they are now a tier 1 contender in the metagame. Prank kids recently took 1st In the Remote duel Invitational and were undefeated (8-0)!!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Before we get into the deck explanation, just a quick reminder that I explain all of this, show all the combos and talk about playing through nibiru ALL in my Youtube video. Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me and also notifies you every time I upload!!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the Video -<a> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBrDJIQRxg8</a></span>  &nbsp;  <span>This deck is inspired off of the 1st place build. I think the reason for Prank Kids to not shine earlier was because people were not sure how to correctly play/use the deck. This happens to all new decks and experimentation is the key to finding the best possible way to utilize the deck. Pranks kids is just another example. Prank kids have evolved and there are some changes to how the deck is played. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Problems and how they are addressed -</b> <ol>  	<li> <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Losing to HandTraps </b><span>- The “new and improved” Prank Kids plays an additional number of extenders so that it doesn't lose to handtraps, especially ash blossom.  Prank Kids from before used Poly, Prank-Kids Pandemonium, Instant Fusion and in some cases even called by the grave. The new kind of build uses all of those cards and also uses Parallel Exceed. Parallel exceed is a great card to chain block the ash and it can also be used to make an extra abyss dweller which is a game changer in some cases because graveyard decks are EVERYWHERE in this metagame. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Extra deck Ratios</b><span> - Another difference from the old version is that now prank kids is not a combo focused deck, but a control deck. The new version does not play Prank-kids Plan or the Prank-kids Rip-Roarin-Roaster and only plays 1 copy of Prank-kids Battle butler and Prank-kids Bow-wow-bark. Battle butler is the deck’s main negation and Playing only 1 copy may seem absurd but it can easily be recycled off of Prank-kids Pranks, a card that can easily be searched off of Prank-kids Doodle-doodle-doo. The only Prank kids card we are running 3 of (in the extra deck) is Prank-kids Meow-meow-mu and this is because it is the deck’s main link monster (a link 1) and can also not be recycled since it has a graveyard that banishes itself from the GY. The deck also plays some more generic removal cards in the extra deck including the Knightmares - Phoenix and Unicorn and Accesscode talker as well. Accesscode is also a great OTK card. The extra deck also runs verte to speed up the engine. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Playing through well established boards</b><span> - The deck also addresses the problem of fighting a well established board very well. In this build of mine I am playing 3 forbidden droplet, 2 Cosmic Cyclone, 3 Mystic mine, 1 terraforming (to search mine and can also search Prank-kids Place) and the 1 Set Rotation (can search mine or place). I hate to say this but Mystic Mine is actually a very good addition to Prank kids. It was also used in the 1st place deck. It is a lifesaver if you get hit with something like a nibiru and can save duels. It is a win condition on its own. Forbidden Droplet is another way to clear boards and it can also counter True King of All Calamities, the most dangerous card in the metagame in my opinion. It is essential to play droplet in this because gamma cannot be played in prank-kids and also because VFD = free win for the opponent if you don’t have the right countermeasures. Cosmic Cyclone is great to deal with backrow, counters Virtual World and is a great removal option.</span></li> </ol> </li> </ol> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Comboing <span>- The deck can combo fairly easily and every single kid is a starter. Place, terraforming and set rotation are also starters since they all eventually search a kid. The deck (counting the searchers as well) has 17 starters! The combo only needs any kid to perform! The nibiru proof version of the combo can also be done if you draw the right hand (combos in my video). The deck can also do the nibiru proof combos very easily and consistently. I have 2 Nibiru proof combos in my video for you to check out.</span></b></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">Handtraps and control <span>- The deck is playing Droll and Lock Bird and ash blossom as the handtrap choices. This deck cannot run gamma because it will brick and doesn't really work in Prank-kids unfortunately. Droll is an amazing counter to most decks mainly Drytron which is literally everywhere. Ash is just a staple and can counter anything. For the control part of the deck, we have the Mystic mines, droplet, the knightmares, and some others. After you control the board, you can easily just OTK the opponent with accesscode.

The Tri-brigade cards just generate SOOO much advantage - It is literally like link summoning by banishing the materials from the graveyard!! The Lyrilusc part of the deck can get the combos going and can also search and special summon Nervall - a very important combo piece. Lyrilusc (Using Tri-brigade) recently took 2nd in the 2021 Remote Duel Invitational as well! </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Before we get into the deck explanation, just a quick reminder that I explain all of this, show all the combos and talk about playing through nibiru and getting rid of bricks ALL in my Youtube video.

The deck can also consistently play through Nibiru! On top of all of that, the deck also plays multiple handtraps/removal cards like D.d Crow (Counters basically any deck that utilizes the GY and is also a winged beast), Droll and Lock Bird (counters Drytron!), Alpha (as I mentioned earlier) and Forbidden Droplet (counters VFD). The deck is also BRICKLESS! You may think I am lying right now because drawing cards like [YGOCard]Mist Valley Thunderbird[/YGOCard], [YGOCard]Mist Valley Apex Avian[/YGOCard], and the barrier statue are bricks. This is true but [YGOCard]Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom[/YGOCard] lets you draw a card and place a card in your hand to the bottom of the deck when she leaves the field and you make her in every single combo/scenario and she always leaves the field (not sure why you would keep her in the field but there are always exceptions). So if you draw an unwanted brick, Just put it in the bottom of the deck!! The deck can also combo fairly easily and can end on (easily) an infinite negate board and can also have more interruptions on top of that in the form of apollusa and Ancient Warriors Oath - Double Dragon Lords just in case the opponent has something like dark ruler or a kaiju to out Avain. The deck also has tons of removal (I listed earlier) and can OTK the opponent fairly easily. The deck can easily break boards and clear the way for big beaters to destroy the opponent (Mainly Accesscode and Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen). Overall, I think TrI-brigade is a solid metagame contender and can take on the top tier decks as well! </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Again, I explain all of this, show all the combos and talk about playing through nibiru and getting rid of bricks ALL in my Youtube video.

Especially when we already have an archetype based on EARTH Warrior's, am I referencing Gouki? I could have, but no, I'm thinking of an archetype that's older, Amazoness.  Amazoness was already a powerful deck based around Amazoness Queen and then later Amazoness Empress. However, they also fell short to what they can give at the table as spamming the field was difficult. Even with cards like Amazoness Spy and Amazoness Baby Tiger, it was missing something.  That's where War Rocks come in, most of them are indeed outdated and they are considered the Internet Explorer archetype since they came a little too late for their time period. However, Amazoness benefited off this new archetype, how? Maybe Gactos? Well, with Gactos around it did made it easier for Amazoness to spam the board and make Rank 4 plays off Swords Woman and Gactos being that they are both Level 4, but what's interesting is not only Gactos, but Amazoness also got a beneficial replacement Field Spell out of War Rock Mountain compared to their older in-archetype Village Field Spell which was not enough of a Field Spell to even consider running it as Village did absolutely nothing, however Mountain not only searches Gactos, but also protects ALL of your Warriors, not just War Rock. Its also the best dummy spell you could give to your opponent through Set Rotation while giving yourself something like Mystic Mine since it'd do absolutely nothing for your opponent (unless they played War Rock)  This being said, is this enough to consider running a War Rock engine?  Well...yes? There's also one other card that is in my new Amazoness build, because if you haven't noticed, I'm also using an easily accessible War Rock Skyler. But why Skylar? Well, its true you're not going to use her effect too much as it kind of sucks (but I guess if you wanted to revive a Amazoness Queen or similar then you could) But the biggest thing about Skyler is not only that she is spammable by both Gactos and Mountain, but she's a Level 6. Guess who else is a Level 6 that is also easily spammable by Amazoness Princess, oh right, Amazoness Queen. So not only does War Rock provide extra searches, protection, and Rank 4 plays, but they also grant Rank 6 plays as well. Which is why Photon Strike Bounzer is in the Extra.  With all of this in mind, I've based my new Amazoness build around the War Rock engine, and also added a few techs here and there like Mystic Mine, Set Rotation, Fusion Recycling Plant, and etc. that allows Amazoness to be at their best possible to not only spam the field, but still be able to control the field through various effects. At the same time, this is the closest thing right now where Amazoness can actually have a presence with Rank 4's and 6's and have access to a larger Extra Deck pool. Because Amazoness really needed another powerful Level 4 and also be more consistent. So even though it wasn't a new in-archetype card that helped, I can say that Gactos, Mountain, and possibly Skyler was good enough to at least give Amazoness more playability.  Keep in mind, this is my first time here, and also first post, but also wanted to share what I had on my mind recently and hopefully you'll enjoy this deck profile as much as I've had recently."

I also have a 50 card version that I will also post as well after this.  This is if you are going first. Now you have a few things you can do depending on what you have in hand, If you are able to get tracer on the field and use its effect at the end to pop dragon ravine to summon another level 4 dragon you can have enough resources to end on a <strong>anaconda</strong>, <strong>winda</strong>, <strong>dingi</strong>, and <strong>savage</strong>. You need spiral dragon, romulus, tracer, 1 level 4 dragon, and two other dragons one must be dark to go into anaconda. If you cant get enough resources you should still be able to end on <strong>winda</strong>, <strong>dingi,</strong> and <strong>anaconda</strong> for a <strong>winda lock</strong>.  First thing is to go into striker to search boot sector  Then use an extender and go into romulus  Use boot sector to summon 1 or 2 rokkets rokkets  use extender if possible to summon another dragon like monster reborn  Link romulus and one the other dragons on the field into anaconda  Use dragon ravine to send one card from hand to graveyard to send spiral dragon to graveyard, use its effect to summon itself  If you have enough resources at this point use tracer and on level four to go into savage and equip the romulus in the graveyard  Then use spiral effect to change other monster to a level 8 and rank up into dingi  Use anaconda effect and target insta fusion summon winda  Go to end phase and use dingi effect to keep winda on field on opponents turn  Hope this isn't too confusing to understand, might link a video later of me doing some test hands and combos and might do the same for the 50 card version  Video of deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vocPQtXKn2U&amp;feature=youtu.be"

If you cant get enough resources you should still be able to end on <strong>winda</strong>, <strong>dingi,</strong> and <strong>anaconda</strong> for a <strong>winda lock</strong>.  First thing is to go into striker to search boot sector  Then use an extender and go into romulus  Use boot sector to summon 1 or 2 rokkets rokkets  use extender if possible to summon another dragon like monster reborn  Link romulus and one the other dragons on the field into anaconda  Use dragon ravine to send one card from hand to graveyard to send spiral dragon to graveyard, use its effect to summon itself  If you have enough resources at this point use tracer and on level four to go into savage and equip the romulus in the graveyard  Then use spiral effect to change other monster to a level 8 and rank up into dingi  Use anaconda effect and target insta fusion summon winda  Go to end phase and use dingi effect to keep winda on field on opponents turn  Hope this isn't too confusing to understand, might link a video later of me doing some test hands and combos.

After using it for a minute (and watching more of Pend God's videos) I made a few adjust,"For the most part I'm still using the same standard Endymion/Mythical Beast combos, however I increased Cerberus from 1 to 2, since it is a free way to get Jackal King/Garuda in my hand, and he's also a nice target for Magicians' Souls going second so that I decrease my chances of drawing into him and bricking (sometimes, when I already have a scale that I can't readily pop), and also for Selene to bring back so I can banish one of my opponents monsters.  I used to have 2 of Purple Poison and 1 Black Fang Magician, as well as 1 Allure of Darkness for those darks, but they were just really bad to have if I wanted to combo off and go into a full board of negates, as I would usually want to save my normal summon for Blue Boy for the spellbook engine, and also it just seemed really dumb to pendulum summon them out to link into crowley if I didn't already have Jackal King/Mighty Master in hand, as I would just use the spellbook engine to draw into my negate cards then with no way to summon them out.  Instead, I put in 2 of Magician's Restage and 1 Foolish Burial. This has turned out to be a pretty solid way to rack up spell counters while also adding more monsters to my field for link materials and drawing more cards. Here are some examples (its entirely possible this is just common knowledge for Endymion players but I am also fairly new to playing Yugioh):  1: If I had practically no pendulum monsters/search cards in hand, but I had 1 Restage and Foolish Burial, I would use foolish burial to send a Magicians' Souls to the GY, then Restage to bring it back and then use Souls to pop Restage/ (sometimes Institution too depending on my spell counters) to then draw more cards. This is really my main use for Foolish Burial, but I will also sometimes use it to send Reflection or Cerberus to the GY as a target for Selene, depending on whether I go first or second, if I don't have Magicians' Souls in hand to do this. If I do have one of my starters, then again this is also a really good way for me to rack up a ton of counters to search/special summon.  2: If my starting hand had Spellbook of Knowledge and no blue boy or secrets, but I had either Magicians' Souls or Jester Confit--preferably Souls--as well as a Restage (or if I draw into Restage with Knowledge instead of like Servant/Reflection/Abductor/Spell power mastery to start my combo) then I would use restage to bring back it back (and then send less helpful spells to the GY to draw more if its Souls).  3: If I have Souls and Restage in hand, then I activate souls, then Link 1 into Artemis, then Restage to bring back Souls, pop Restage to Draw 1, and then Link 2 into Crowley to run my spellbook engine.  There's probably more combos, but these are just the main ones I tend to use. Again, with all of these examples, assuming the worst: I am unable to scale anything and therefore I am not racking up counters, but with all my draws I will almost always get a starter and enough spells to get its counters, but if I am to scale even just one thing, then I can just get counters for days.  Also, Restage is generally just a good target for my Mighty Master to destroy whenever I want to pop him from my high scale on turn 1. I normally target Citadel if I have it out, so that I can use Citadel's effect to avoid destruction, but then Mighty Master won't get his counter for additional protection (occasionally I will also target Mythical Institution if I feel like I don't need it).  For my extra deck, I replaced Abyss Dweller with Bagooska since Bagooska seems like a more general way to negate monster effects (although I did side Dweller for me to switch out with Bagooska depending on the match up).  I replaced Geonator Transverser with Apollousa. Transverser was really just in there as a potential out to Dragoon, but I almost never used it to do that. In fact, I pretty consistently have been able to out Dragoon with Accesscode, so it made more sense to free up a space for Apollousa to get more potential negates, although I usually will end my turn with Selene out and Reflection in my hand/the GY so that I can bounce back a potentially bad extra deck summon/normal summon (and then I'll also keep an extra space for me to use Garuda to bounce back another similar summon if I can't use it to MST a facedown or an annoying continuous spell/trap. I still need to find a way to work Apollousa into my combos without removing my other negates.  Lastly I took out Thousand-Eyes Restrict, since Millennium-Eyes just felt like a better target for my Instant Fusion to its ability to chain onto a monsters effect and grab it for myself (especially the ones that ""Can't be destroyed by card effects""), and I replaced it with Day-Breaker, for its ability to pop spells/traps, free up my scales, and also to get some more counters for my negates to use. I toyed around with using Saryuja instead to fix bad hands, but usually, by the time I have enough cards out to use his draw 4 effect, I would have already played most of my hand, so I would be removing 4 monsters from my field to draw one card, this being after I had already pendulum summoned/normal summoned.  When I'm siding out, I will usually take out 1 Cerberus, 1 Jester Confit, and 1 Restage. If I need to side out more than 3, I will then side out 1 Blue Boy and 1 Secrets, and I normally don't side out more than 5 cards, but also I might just not know how to side deck (please keep in mind that I have just been playing for a little more than a month at this point). Of course, it goes without saying that I'm interested in hearing any differing opinions you guys might have regarding side deck decisions or card ratios, since I am also posting this in part to get some feedback to improve my deckbuilding. Thanks!"

There is always space for changes.,"Try to bring Supreme King Gate Zero and Gate Infinity at the start to summon big monsters in first turn. If you couldn’t bring gate infinity during the first turns, better go for another pendulum because of it’s effect. If you need an emergency pendulum summon, you will probably need monsters with high pendulum scales but what if you have low scales and it needs to be done? DO IT. After this. You can wait for the Twin Twisters or Performapal Sleight Hand Magician to destroy your scales and put up more USEFUL ones."

The main idea is to turbo out the links while using N'tss, Golden Lord, and the spells to interupt and clear the opponent's board. This allows you to build a way bigger board than normal Striker variants allow. Dogmatika has a good amount of synergy with the deck, as you can easily get their bodies on the field and dump extra deck monsters, although their restrictions mean you have to change the usual Striker gameplan somewhat. Eldlich allows you to beef up the regular backrow tremendously, and get another body on field along with clearing the opponent's board. Eldlich also allows you to easily reccur resources, making the grind game of Striker easier. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Have a good day."

The new support monster <strong>Lu Feng </strong>(and not <strong>A man's honor</strong> that card is<strong> garbage</strong> ) helps with the problems of Ancient Warriors a lot and gives the deck a little bit more consistency and power.  <strong>The tech cards I decided to play: </strong>This deck is a pure second going deck, so I run three copies of <strong>Gnomaterial.</strong> Not only is this card a very good hand trap right now, it also fits perfectly with decks like Ancient Warriors which go blindly second. You want your opponent to build a board with some monsters, but an useless board which is easy to break and <strong>Gnomaterial</strong> makes sure it does that.  Next up I decided to run three copies of <strong>Foolish Burial Goods.</strong> When you usually look up for some Ancient Warriors deck profile, you will never see that card to show up. And I don't understand why. That card lets you dump <strong>Borrowing Arrows</strong>  or <strong>Metalfoes Fusion</strong> to the GY. <strong>Borrowing Arrows</strong> is a very important card because it searches out your best continous spell card in your deck and that is <strong>Three Visits</strong>. But if you already got the <strong>Three Visits</strong> on the field, just search out <strong>East-By-South-Winds </strong>so <strong>Double Dragon Lords</strong> doesn't have to do it and instead can search out a monster. I also decided to run <strong>Metalfoes Fusion </strong>because if you draw  <strong>Goods</strong> and <strong>Arrows</strong> that one card becomes useless in your hand so running that single copy of <strong>Metalfoes Fusion</strong> not only makes <strong>Goods</strong> more useful , but also boosts your consistency. <strong>Borrowing of Arrows and Metalfoes Fusion </strong>can both be send from the hand or field to the GY as a cost for your Ancient Warrior monster effects, so why would  you not play it?  The reason why I decided to run <strong>Desires </strong>instead of Extravagence or Prosperity is because they cost a whole lotta money and it doesn't lock you out at drawing cards for the rest of the turn. If I run Extravagence in my deck, I can't use the second effect of Liu Xuan (tho you most likely use him as link material), the metalfoes fusion and the upstart goblin. <strong>NO SYNERGY. </strong>Also you don't really care about the resources you banished with desires, tho banishing your win conditions like <strong>East-By-South-Winds </strong>can suck.  I also run a single copy of <strong>Cao De.</strong> I see a lot of decks cutting him out and I kinda see why because he is a win more card. But one of the main reason I run him is because of <strong>Lu Feng</strong>. He is much easier to summon now, because you actually have a way to pop one of your opponents cards ( not including mst or feather duster because they arent searchable..). Also I feel like he is the heart and spirit of the deck and probably my favorite monster and he is big beefy and chunky so run him at one copy.  A lot of people cut out <strong>Lu Jing</strong> aswell, but in this deck, it is very easy to have at least one Ancient Warrior spell in your GY because of <strong>Goods.</strong> To control two Ancient Warriors with different Attributs is very easy, you just need to control him and a <strong>Guan Yun</strong> or a <strong>Lu Feng</strong>. Both easy and free special summons. His second effect is actually not as garbage as the one from <strong>Zhou Gong, as he can pop one of your opponents spell/trap card going +1.</strong> But <strong>Sun Mou</strong> has the best effect among all of them, because he searches a monster and bounces a monster your opponent controls.  <strong>How to play this deck?</strong>  One of the most common plays I do is I summon<strong> Guan Yun</strong> and pop one monster my opponent controls. Then I can normal summon <strong>Sun Mou</strong> and search out<strong> Lu Feng. </strong>After that I summon <strong>Lu Feng</strong>, pop and <strong>Sun Mou</strong> will bounce one card. Then I use <strong>Guan Yun</strong> and <strong>Sun Mou</strong> as link material for <strong>Double Dragon Lords</strong> and search out <strong>East-By-South-Winds.</strong> Then I bounce one card <strong>again</strong> and send <strong>East-By-South-Winds </strong>to the GY. Now my opponent cannot respond for the rest of the turn whatever I try to do and pop one card (non-targetting effect) as soon as I declare an attack. That also means they can't activate cards like mirror force or any of them annoying battle traps.  With that being said, thanks for listening and I hope you enjoyed my deck list  Edit: Refreshed the deck list a bit. Playing now a total of 6 handtraps and decided to play <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> instead of <strong>Ghost belle</strong>. If you can afford <strong>Infinite Impermance</strong>, go ahead and buy 3 of them thangs... Also cut a copy of <strong>Goods</strong> because playing three of them can be a bit bricky sometimes (hard once per turn). Also side deck has been added.  &nbsp;"

I wanted to try something different and Armed ","Main Combo: 1 starter, 2 extenders  This is the main combo explanation, and for this One of the starters will be Starliege Seyfert, and the 2 extenders will be Noctovision Dragon and World Legacy Guardragon. The starting hand will consist of the 3 cards mentioned above, and 2 random cards. First, normal summon Seyfert, then use his effect to send himself to the graveyard to add Black Dragon Collaserpent. Then use the effect of Black Dragon to banish Seyfert and summon it. Link Black Dragon for Striker Dragon, chain noctovision's summon, and add White Dragon Wyverburster and Boot Sector Launch to the hand. Banish Black Dragon to Summon White Dragon and then link the 2 (White Dragon and Striker) into Dragunity Knight Romulus, and search Dragon Ravine. Everything up until this point should be standard dragon link plays. Use and activate Dragon Ravine and discard 1 random card to put Absorouter into the grave, adding a Rokket (search Rokket Tracer) monster to the hand. Then swap the field spells for Boot Sector Launch and summon Rokket Tracer from the hand. Then, link Rokket Tracer and noctovision into Crystron Halqifibrax. Draw 1 card from noctovision and summon Rokket Synchron From the deck as your tuner. Link the Romulus and Halqifibrax into either Apollousa or Unchained Abomination. (Going first make Apollousa, going second make Unchained) Link Rokket Synchron into Elpy and put him on the right-most zone Abomination or Apollousa points to. Activate Elpy's effect and summon Armed Dragon Thunder LV5 fom the deck. Activate Armed Dragon Thunder LV5 and discard a monster (Hopefully you have one in hand from your starting hand or Drew one off of Noctovision) Summon Armed Dragon LV7 from the deck and add Tempest from Armed Dragon LV5, because you can add a level 5 or higher wind dragon if it is sent to the grave to activate a dragon monster's effect. (Literally his own effect) Discard Tempest to activate LV7 and summon LV10 from the deck. Then using World Legacy Guardragon, revive a dragon from grave, and then link it into Pisty and then revive tracer from grave. Banish 2 dragons from grave to summon Tempest from grave, then banish Tempest,(Dont forget to add Crusadia Draco to hand when Tempest is banished) Pisty and Elpy, and summon Trishula from the extra deck. Activate Trishula and banish Dragondark to add Thunder Dragonhawk. Discard Dragonhawk to summon Dragondark from the banished. Summon Crocodragon (using Rokket Tracer and Thunder Dragondark) from the extra deck and draw 1 card. Then XYZ summon VFD (True King of all Calamities) using Trishula and Crocodragon. If you drew into Quick Launch, Monster Reborn or World Legacy Succession off of Crocodragon then you can revive tracer and pop Boot Sector Launch to summon a Rokket from the deck and then synchro summon Borreload Savage Dragon, and equip Halqifibrax from the graveyard for some negates. (Make sure to put your VFD and Savage into defense to counter Lighning Storm) Overall, I wanted to bring something new and interesting to the table, I hope you guys like it. Feedback is always appreciated.  Combo 2: 1 starter, 1 extender  Pretty much go through the exact same combo as shown above, except summon Omni Dragon Brotaur from Elpy instead. Then discard and target itself and add Chaos Dragon Levianeer, link Brotaur into Pisty. Summon Levianeer by banishing 3 dark monsters from the grave, (including Tracer) then summon Tracer back off of Pisty's effect. Then Banish Levianeer, and the 2 Guardragons to summon Trishula and banish Thunder Dragondark to add Thunder Dragonhawk. Discard Dragonhawk to summon Dragondark from the banished. Then do the same thing of synchro summoning crocodragon and hopefully draw into either Quick Launch or a revival spell for the additional Borreload Savage. Lastly, overlay into VFD for the icing on the cake and pass turn. (Make sure to put your VFD and Savage into defense to counter Lighning Storm)"

I was inspired by this Trif/Yacine video (https://youtu.be/PBz63A_Bx_4) and tried to make a different VFD build based on odd-eyes pendulum support.  This is a very long combo and I want to tell you step by step how you do this combo. Of course, this combo has vulnerabilities: it is not Nibiru-proven and Droll &amp; Lock maybe make you cry... But I still think it's a very good alternative to play using our lovely odd-eyes monsters.  <em>Edit1: I forgot the Elpy effect so in this first version I would not be able to summon Apex. I changed the Elpy target from Sloth to Persona. I still have one Extra-Deck negate if I need to and I can negate Elpy's effect and summon Apex on the End Phase. I think it's still a good combo. I will explore more variants later... </em>  <strong><span>Combo</span></strong>  The main combo starts having Pendulum Call, Darkwurm, and Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon in your hand. Let's go to the recipe:  1- You activate pend call, send darkwurm to GY and get Harmonizing and Nobledragon.  2- Special Summon darkwurm and get Gate Zero.  3- Normal Summon Nobledragon and link summon Halqi.  4- Special Summon the Winged-beast tuner which you prefer (I use Windmaster)  5- Link Summon Simorgh  6- Adjust your pendulum scales using Arc Pendulum and Gate Zero.  7- Pendulum Summon Nobledragon, Darkwurm and Harmonizing.  8- By harmonizing bring Stargazer Magician  9- Synchro Summon Meteorburst and activate it's effect summoning Gate Zero from the scale.  10- Activate Gate zero effect, target and destroy meteorburst. You will Special Summon Darkfire here.  11- Chain Link 1: Arc Pendulum Dragon | Chain Link 2: Gate Zero  12- Gate Zero comes back to the scale and you special summon Odd-Eyes Synchron by Arc's effect.  13- Now you just make two synchro 9 monsters using harmonizing and stargazer and using odd-eyes synchron and gate zero (by synchron's effect)  14- Go for VFD :)  15- Link Summon Elpy using the Darkfire to Elpy and bring Odd-Eyes Persona.  16- Negate Elpy's effect using Persona (to be able to summon Apex).  16- End Phase: Bring Apex to your field.  That's it. Now you have the VFD, one omni negate, and one extra-deck monster negate.  &nbsp;"

Dinosaur list based on turboing UCT, running some neat value in the extra deck.  1 Terraforming and 3 Lost World. I can't believe I used to cut this card, it might be dead sometimes, but in combination with other dinosaurs the card is nuts. 3 Token Collector, here for the combo - very bad as interaction since Linkross was banned, but I love the explosive potential of the deck. This card + Lost World + any dinosaur is the nuts. But generally the goal of the deck was just to turbo UCT, so most of the time all this is doing is getting to pill + dinos in the GY. Lost World also adds to Dinosaur's built in protection.  Miscellaneosaurus is really good, and a card you want to see rather than search, so it is a pretty obvious 3 of. Oviraptor searchs Tyranno and builds combos, but genterally your goal is to play under Nibiru, so who cares? They're one card starters, I'm running them. Animadorned Archosaur starts your combo so long as you have something to pop, and is an essential combo piece, so it's a 3 of even though you're usually searching it. 2 Pill so that you can usually pop something with it - that's the engine.  Pankratops is an obvious auto-include, I would run 3 of these in going second dinos if I could. Overtex Qoatlus is another spell negate, at its best the deck can still combo off turn 1 to a board full of negates, and this helps make that possible. 3 UCT because in this version you want to see it. I made sure to keep space to run 3 of these, I know you can often search him, but I want to come in under Nib as often as possible. Giant Rex helps make Rank 4 Xyz monsters, while Jurrace Aelo helps make Needlefibre. 3 of each of the babies and 3 searchers helps us to see dinosaur normal summons for Lost World. I also really like ending on an extra Pankratops early, and more Petiteranadon helps do that.  Ash and Nib because Ash and Nib are usually good going second.  Side deck is 3 Gamma and a Driver, for when you really need the power, 3 Dark Ruler No More and 3 Lightning Storm to break boards when you're going second, 2 Evenly Matched to go with the Lightning Storm and Pankratops for Spell + traps, and 3 Imperm because it is Generic and powerful.  No Extravagence because I don't like the card. It is powerful, and I have run it, and I will run it in the future, but I don't like it so this time I'm not running it. That technically makes the deck slightly less powerful, but I'm willing to give up card advantage for full playsets of the cards I want to run. If you were to run this list and have Extravagence you could just add them on top - the consistency you'd lose from having a 43 card deck is more than made up for when you do see those 3 cards.  Extra Deck is Halqifibrax, usually summoning Ash, sometimes using Ash to summon Aeolo. The Fire and Water Charmer are cards you can go into from there - The Water Charmer has a great target in Needlefibre, whereas the Fire Charmer can let you summon and opponent's Ash to go into Halqibifbrax, hopefully getting enough advantage to make a Link 4, usually Accesscode. Selene can be gone into when you make Needlefibre with Ash by making Aeolo into Relinquished Anima, or through other routes by making Archosaur into Anima. You could run Effect Veiler to make this even more efficient, but I wanted Imperm and Nib, and I wanted to run Anima anyways. Linkuriboh, Salamangreat Almiraj, and Secure Gardna help you get monsters into the GY for Pill while making few summons, a super nice emergency button. The rest is Rank 4s, because these ones are good."

Well if your answer was yes, then this deck is for you! If not, then......Why are you here?  Jokes aside, it's time for some real talk. <h1><strong>Deck Description.....</strong></h1> Here I will describe the deck and talk about the purpose of every card in it, starting with.....  The<span><strong> FROGS: </strong></span><span>First is ""Ronintoadin"" of course this friggin frog doesn't need an introduction, he banishs a frog from the gy to revive itself and it's not opt, which makes it great for extra deck summoning and other things.</span>  Second is ""Swap frog"" this froggy is great for setting up your gy and for providing extra deck material as well, because when it's summoned (normal or special) it allows you to send one aqua type monster from your deck to the gy (not opt) , it's second effect is to return one monster you control to the hand (usually itself) to allow you to normal summon a ""Frog"" monster in addition to your normal summon/set, it's third effect is to discard one water monster to special summon it.  Third is ""Dupe Frog"" this smart boy allows you to search any frog monster from your deck when it's sent from the field to the gy, also while it's on the field your opponent cannot target other monsters for attacks except itself, which means that if you control 2 of  them you basically lock your opponent out of attacks.  These were all the main deck frogs, now to the other main deck monsters.  ""Barrier statue of the torrent"" this blue statue prevents both players from special summoning non-water monsters, this doesn't matter much to you since most of your monsters are water, also this monster is involved in the lock this deck was built around.  Now for the Kaijus starting with....  ""Gameciel, the sea turtle kaiju"" turtle boi here doesn't need an introduction, all that matters is it's attribute (water) and that it's involved in the aforementioned lock.  ""Thunder king, the lightning strike kaiju"" same as gameciel, the only reason it's in here is because ""interrupted kaiju slumber"" is here.  And the last main deck monster is ""Graydle slime jr."" you basically use him to swarm the field, and to special summon ""Dupe Frog"" in case of an emergency.  Now that the main deck monsters are done, let's get to the spells and traps.  ""Surface"" basically a monster reborn to your frogs  ""Card destruction"" To fill up the gy and getting to your combo pieces.  ""Foolish burial"" to send ""Graydle slime jr."" to the gy, so you can use the one in your hand (if you have it).  ""Interrupted Kaiju slumber"" nuke the field, summon Kaijus, and search Kaijus need I say more?  ""Fury of Kairyu-Shin"" Search ""torrential tribute"" and protect your monsters.  ""Moray of greed"" Draw power (can be replaced with ""pot of avarice"" since you might have monsters in the gy that you want in your deck.)  Now on to the traps.....  Let's start it off with the ""Paleozoic"" traps.  ""Paleozoic pikaia"" Allows you to discard a ""Paleozoic"" card to draw 2 cards, good for consistency and triggering your ""paleozoic"" cards in the gy.  ""Paleozoic canadia"" basically a book of moon in trap form, good for disruption.  ""Paleozoic olenoides"" allows you to target and destroy a spell/trap card on the field, non-monster backrow removal is good to have.  ""Paleozoic dinomischus"" allows you to discard a card then target and banish one card on the field.  Now for the other traps....  ""Storming mirror force"" protects your monsters (since most of them have low attack and they most likely won't run over anything) and Allows you to bounce back your Kaijus.  ""Torrential tribute"" destroying all monsters on the field can catch your opponent by surprise.  Now that all of the main deck is over let's move in to the extra deck.  ""Paleozoic anomalocaris"" and ""Paleozoic opabinia"" things to summon using your ""Paleozoic"" cards on the field and to search them.  ""Toadally awesome"" Omni-negation, ""Frog"" searching, and recovery on death, there is a reason why this unholy abomination is the deck master.  ""Number 29: Mannequin cat"" when a monster is special summoned to your opponent's field she allows you to special one monster from your hand, deck or gy with the same attribute as a monster your opponent controls (you summon ""barrier statue of torrent"") she also allows you to detach an xyz material to special summon one monster from your opponent's gy to their side of the field (only use this effect if your opponent has a water monster in their gy or if they have ""Gameciel, the sea turtle kaiju"" on their side of the field.) Needless to say, she is involved in the lock we talked about.  ""Mistar boy"" and ""Mermail abyssalacia"" basically serve the same purpose, attack boost and recovery on death.  ""Marincess coral anemone"" allows you to special summon a water monster with 1500 or lower attack from your gy  ""Salamangreat almiraj"" you use it to send a normal summoned frog to the gy (usually ""swap frog"".) to special summon it, and it protects your monsters from effect destruction, so that's nice to have.  ""Paleozoic cambroraster"" something to use your ""Paleozoic"" cards for and to search them.  And that's all of deck, now to the strategies and combos... <h1><strong>Strategies &amp; Combos....</strong></h1> Turn 1: Summon ""Swap frog"", send ""Ronintoadin"" to the gy, activate ""Swap frog"" return it the hand, Activate ""Swap frog"" discard a water monster to special summon it, send a ""Frog"" monster to the gy, activate ""Ronintoadin"" banish a ""Frog"" from the gy and special summon ""Ronintoadin"", XYZ summon ""Toadally awesome"", set traps if you have them, then end your turn.  Turn 1 alt: Set, pass.  The lock: Summon ""Number 29: Mannequin cat"", tribute an opponent's monster to summon ""gameciel, the sea turtle kaiju"", activate ""Number 29: mannequin cat"" target ""gameciel"" special summon ""Barrier statue of the torrent"".  And that pretty much sums up everything you need to know.  &nbsp; <h1>Notes &amp; Afterthoughts</h1> The side deck isn't really important as this deck is just for fun, and that's why the the side is filled with random water support. You can adjust it however you like.  No one will probably read anything I wrote which makes me ask myself, why did I wasted almost 2 hours of life making this and submitting it? Which in turn depresses me.  Well whatever I hope you enjoy the deck. <h1>THE END.</h1> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Novas are a massive boost in consistency, though the deck is honestly still playable without it, and is quite cheap otherwise. With even one copy of Nova, you should look to also include three copies of Drytron Fafnir (their Field Spell) which can search Nova as well.</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The absence of Nova + Fafnir from the main leaves a lot of space to be filled. There are many ways you can go about this.</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The sample list plays a small Pre-Prep engine with Herald of Perfection. It's very simple to play, especially if you're unfamiliar with the deck, and helps raise your overall ceiling - athough optimized competitive builds have generally moved away from Pre-Prep.</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Another viable Ritual engine is the Megalith engine, which provides numerous options. These variants generally also suffer from consistency issues, made worse by the lack of Novas in the budget version. Less consistent access to Alpha means less consistent usage of extra Ritual monsters.</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">You could play cards that search Drytron monsters in an attempt to patch up consistency. Examples include Where Arf Thou, or normal summons that fetch Drytrons such as Cyber Dragon Core (getting Emergency) and Mathematician.

You like dragons? Got 'em. You like to bet your soul with cursed cards? It'll do that. You want to,"This deck is meant to shift and breathe, giving you a wide breadth of tools to adapt to your opponents on the fly like some sort of terrible Blue-Eyes swiss army knife or a particularly draconic hydra. As soon as they think they have you figured out, you can pivot on a dime and hit 'em with something completely different before they have time to react.  The goal is to let you get creative; it draws consistently well but rarely plays the same way twice—that's the joy of it, in my opinion. Even when I lose with this deck I pretty much always feel good about the duel, and it's versatile enough to hold its own against just about everything I've thrown it at in MR4* casual play. I'm told it's fun to play against, too. It's a puzzle box for everyone on the field, not the sort of deck just out to curb stomp without mercy.  And, as a bonus, it's super cheap.  &nbsp;  So! Let's break this puppy down:  The extra deck is minimal, because if you pull Orichalcos, it'll lock you out of summoning from it. As a result, getting an Azure-Eyes out early is helpful to keep grabbing Blue-Eyes from your graveyard, and once it's initially summoned you can revive it again after Orichalcos is played. Plus, its effect-immunity is triggered by any special summon of it, not just the initial synchro, which can be handy if you find yourself backed into a corner. There aren't many link monsters released as of early 2020 that work well with this deck, but Defender and Decode Talker are nice to have around if you've got the materials to keep making more Azure-Eyes or want the attack bump, and Decode Talker can be handy to tribute opponent's monsters who are causing you trouble.  This deck basically has three kinds of monsters: Blue-Eyes, things that can get you Blue-Eyes, and ritual summons that will just absolutely ruin your opponent's day.  You've got lots of options both for searching your deck for Blue-Eyes, and retrieving it from the graveyard. As a bonus, Melody of Awakening Dragon also lets you snag BE Chaos MAX out of your deck if you want.  The ritual summons are the powerhouse of this deck. If you're playing Master Rule 4, they dance right around the restrictions on summon location, and they come with some extremely solid effects to hamstring whatever nonsense your opponent thinks they're up to on the other side of the table. Pre-Prep can net you the materials for Lord of the Red in one shot, and any Blue-Eyes card is enough to pay the cost—then just rebound it from the graveyard again with whatever retrieval method is easiest at the moment, and chances are that in doing so you'll give yourself a chance to activate one of his effects right out of the gate. Chaos Form takes a little more work, but if you pull it and don't have a matching ritual, chances are high you've got the materials to either pull BE Chaos MAX from your deck or strip it to the GY, and from there just bounce it into your hand with a relevant effect.  BEWD variants tend to be pretty chunky as a baseline, but if you can add extra ATK onto them they become scary fast. You won't want to bulk up your baseline normal-summon BEWDs, since those are the pistons in your engine, but the effect, synchro, and rituals are all fair game. BE Chaos MAX makes god cards look like chumps if you can get her out and boost her effectively, because card effects don't kill her and she does double piercing to defense-position monsters. Power of the Guardians is a reliable way to start stacking ATK, and if you can get Black Dragon Sword out mid- to late-game, she'll just walk right over your opponents for fun. If you're really lucky, you'll have gotten Orichalcos out before her; that'll boost her by another 500 just for giggles, and also protect the weakest card on your field. You see where this is going. BE Chaos MAX in attack position, boosted, is a nightmare to take on in a battle of sheer ATK and card effects don't touch her.  Claw of Hermos into Black Dragon Sword is a great way to give an ATK/DEF boost to just about anything. It can make Maiden even more annoying of a wall, or like we've already touched on, skyrocket BE Chaos MAX's double piercing damage to outright rude proportions once you've gotten a few dragons into your GY.  Obelisk is... just a fun guy. Look at his big ol' arms. Who wouldn't love him?  Maiden is a great stall if you're having trouble getting something you need, since looking at her wrong will grab a Blue-Eyes from pretty much wherever you may have misplaced it. And you can bounce quite a few other cards in the deck off her with a targeted effect if you want to trigger that yourself, too. Both she and your other tuners are there to get BEWD wherever you need it at a given point in time, but can also help recall BE Chaos MAX if it gets offed, or another Blue-Eyes variant with useful effects for the given game state.  You've also got a handful of cards to drop your tribute requirements for BEWD and Obelisk. If you don't want to run Obelisk, swap your two Kaiser Sea Horses out for Keeper of the Shrines for some more GY versatility.  The rest of your deck is dedicated to spell cards, largely ones that help you shuffle around your various dragons to where you need them. Depending on your opponents, and what sorts of decks they're running, you'll want to swap these around a little bit. Most of your control over your opponents should be coming from your monster effects rather than your spells and traps, but this is a good place to cover any gaps you find in your deck (my default build will go down fast and hard to banishings, for instance, because my local crew hasn't been running much offensive banishment lately). Just watch out for adding too much and disrupting the overall balance, because this deck's ability to keep shifting its loadout on the fly is its main strength and if you bog it down you'll find yourself in trouble with no way to keep monsters on the field. The BEWD effect cards are also a good place to swap things in and out to balance as you need.  Beyond that... enjoy!**  &nbsp;  *I built this because I'm a hopeless nostalgic and thought it'd be fun to craft a BEWD deck for Master Rule 4, which could weasel its way around the lack of link monsters that sync well with the archetype. I've yet to take it into MR5 duels, so I can't speak to its efficacy against the less-restricted special summons.  **<em>afterimage</em> claims no responsibility for soul forfeiture that may occur as a result of activating the Seal of Orichalcos; please barter your mortality responsibly."

Masterful Sun Mou provides a good way to search for a metalfoes and can co-exist with Baobaboon(As Sun Mou can be pendulum summoned), and honestly, way better than Magician's Soul in a way.  &nbsp;"

You then proceed to beatdown with a bunch of easily summonable Level 4 / Rank 4 / Link monsters that become much more threatening with the additional ATK.  Dark Doriado makes all non-LIGHT or DARK monsters gain an additional 1000 (1200 if a DARK card is in play).  Magical Abductor searches Dark Doriado or a copy of itself and opens up a Pendulum Summon option.  Link laddering is easy by using Artemis if you don't have a LIGHT monster, then Lyna, then Selene. Lyna can steal an opponent's LIGHT monster from GY to make it even easier to summon Selene. Trick Clown can go into Selene by itself if you use it to summon Artemis, revive it, then use those two to make Lyna, then steal a LIGHT monster.  Fairy Tail Rella can use Bamboo Swords or Wonder Wand to draw more. Awakening of the Possessed combos with Lyna, Selene, FP Lyna and Rella to draw 1. Pre-Prep searches Doriado and its Ritual Spell.  Selene can summon Jowgen the Spiritualist from your hand or GY on the opponent's turn to lock them out of Special Summons. If you trigger Jowgen to destroy Special Summoned monsters while you control Awakening of the Possessed, your Familiar-Possessed monsters will survive destruction. This also goes for Time Wizard of Tomorrow.  Bujintei Tsukuyomi or Dugares the Timeless can be used as a draw extender and then goes into Drill Dozer Vespinato, which benefits from both Awakening of the Possessed and Dark Doriado's ATK gain.  The Dogmatika monsters can freely summon from hand if you turn 1 monster into Artemis or use Instant Fusion, which makes Link Summoning or playing Rank 4s easier.  Artemis and Fairy Tail Rella can be used to manipulate Cursed Bamboo Sword by attaching it and linking away or discarding it to attach another copy to Rella, then search Golden Bamboo Sword. Foolish Burial Goods also triggers it to search Broken or Golden Sword.  In a pinch Bagooska can be useful since it doesn't negate Doriado's effect (it doesn't activate) and your Link monster (Lyna or Selene) is unaffected by it."

Combos Are fairly non-linear but the end board is typically a dark rebellion with a RUM set to go into dark requiem for a pop and three negates, an apollousa for three, and a set fog blade. <h2>Ratios and Stuff:</h2> <h3>The Main deck:</h3> <h4>Monsters:</h4> 3x Torn Scales, a great starter and extender for the deck, being able to dump any PK card as well as revive itself from the graveyard is very good in a deck like this  3x Silent Boots, an extender that also fetches a piece of backrow for your troubles  3x Tour Guide, the best starter in your deck, being able to fetch a graff from deck is really good  3x Kagemucha Knight, is a great extender that can chain block your tour guide so it can;t be ashed  2x Ragged Gloves, you mainly use this to dump either a fog blade or wing to get their graveyard effects to revive a card  2x Ancient Cloak, It can fetch you more cards for extension and that's about it  1x Stained Greaves, this is a fringe extender that can be decent for some combos  2x Graff, it floats into a BA, need i say more  1x Cir, You use this in the combo to revive Cherubini, but I tend to see that it bricks at more than one in this version  1x Scarm, You can use this during the end phase to search another tour guide for more plays the following turn  1x Tsuchinoko, this is just a really good extender  1x Jackalope, Another just good extender  1x Armageddon Knight, honestly not very good in this deck, but it can be used for some fringe combos  3x Ash, just a generically good hantrap, nothing really else to it  3x Belle, This is a meta call, both Drytron and VW rely on the grave, I typically prefer skull meister, but this one's level three so it won't be dead going first <h4>Spells:</h4> 1x Foolish Burial, a good card to just be able to dump any monster from your deck  1x ROTA, It searches a lot of good cards  1x Called By the Grave, This helps you play around handtraps, I wish this would come back to three  1x Upstart Goblin, This is a placeholder card, you could play whatever over this, I just couldn't think of anything  1x Rank-Up-Magic Force, this lets you go into dark requiem during your opponent's turn, giving you a pop from rusty and three negates <h4>Traps:</h4> 3x Fog Blade, this is a searchable negate that also can revive cards from the graveyard  1x Wing, this you use only for it's grave effect to revive a card  1x Shade, you use this as a free 4 for some fringe combos with AK <h3>The Extra Deck:</h3> 2x Break Sword, This card is main use is to be popped by rusty to get two level 4s out to make dark rebellion, but it;s scrap dragon like effect is also good  1x Leviair, This can revive a banished card which comes in handy often  1x Dante, This card is a last resort if you've been interrupted or something and you need more stuff in the grave  1x Dark Rebellion, you use this to rank up into dark requiem  1x Raider's Knight, used for fringe going second arc rebellion combos  1x Dark Requiem, This is three monster negates  1x Arc Rebellion, This is a going second card used to OTK or go into zeus  1x Zeus, a plan B for most situations, but it's a very good plan B  1x Rusty, this dumps a PK and set's a fog blade, as well as popping break sword for the requiem combo  1x Cherubini, This is you main starter, it dumps a level three, that can be a graff, or a scales depending on the combo  1x Apollousa, It's more negates  1x I:P, this can let you go into knightmares on your opponent's turn  1x Unicorn, this can just spin away any card, great catch-all removal  1x phoenix, it's backrow removal <h2>Some Neat Tech Choices:</h2> <h3>The Dragoon Engine:</h3> This deck struggles with the lack of backrow negates, Dragoon can fix this, but it tends to be bricky <h3>The Utopia Engine:</h3> The Utopia engine uses utopia double as well as utopia kaiser to let you go into Kali Yuga or VFD using the other RUM, it's just not very consistent and works better in it's own dedicated deck <h3>The Dogmatika Engine:</h3> I think that Dogmatika could suppliment the deck nicely, especially since requiem has the ability to revive an XYZ monster after a negate, such as number 38 for a backrow negate, however I find that I don't really know how to make the full value of this engine work, so if a better player can make it work, there are some cool interactions to be had there. <h3>The Predaplant engine:</h3> This could be another starter, it gives you 3 level threes for your plays by searching out instant fusion with cobra.

It still can keep up with the current meta due to all of the support it gets through out the year. <ul>  	<li>Droll &amp; Lock Bird-This card is a counter to a lot of cards in the meta and a great option to have in any deck. Running three of this card helps the deck keep up with many decks in the meta.</li>  	<li>Forbidden Droplets and Harpie's Feather Duster- Both cards can easily help clear boards. Most Hero monsters in the extra deck have high attack and can easily get over most monsters. Sunrise's effect of destroying a monster on the field when an attack is declared involving a Hero monster becomes more effective with Forbidden Droplets negating monster effects and cutting the attack in half. Harpie's Feather Duster is obviously one of the best ways to clear spells and traps.</li>  	<li>Fusion Destiny-Good combo piece. If you haven't watched Teamsamuraixi's new Hero Deck profile he shows a combo from just playing Fusion Destiny. <ol>  	<li>Use Fusion Destiny to bring out Dangerous by sending Malicious and Shadow Mist to the graveyard.</li>  	<li> Banish the Malicious in your grave and special summon the Malicious from your deck.</li>  	<li>Link into Cross Crusader with Dangerous and Malicious then use its effect to bring back Dangerous to the field.</li>  	<li>Then use Cross Crusader's effect to tribute Dangerous to search Liquid Soldier</li>  	<li>Normal summon Liquid Soldier and bring back Shadow Mist</li>  	<li>Use Shadow Mist's effect to add mask change to your hand</li>  	<li>Link Dread Decimator with Liquid Soldier and Cross Crusader</li>  	<li>Use Mask change during your opponents turn to bring out Dark Law</li>  	<li>Using Shadow Mists effect you can search Honest Neos for extra protection for a 2900 Atk due to Dread Decimator's effect.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Evil Hero Engine-This engine is pretty expensive because of Malicious Bane so it's completely optional to run. I have it in the deck because of how much of an impact it has on the field. It can nuke the field and also can't be destroyed by card effects or battle.</li> </ul>

The main point of the deck is to use your normal on the Marincess's, use them to load up the grave with the Marincess's you want in there. Afterwards, you use the Frog package, Scryp, etc, to climb up into one of the link-4's, which you use to activate your main card, a archetypal Imperm, from the hand. There's also the Bahamut plus the frogs to get an extra negate on board, plus some bodies. There's also the small Paleo package to strengthen the backrow and add in on the negates and interuption."

I loved playing the deck pure during TOSS format, and have overall enjoyed my time with it. Without Harp, the deck was seen as a lost cause to many, and the deck was thought to return with Girsu coming out in the TCG.

I mean psychic wheeleder and psychic tracker as extender, the release of bardiche in legendary hero decks, Cherubini in DANE, the last support wave in PHRA and the release of tour guide of the banlist, the deck has now pretty good combo potential. </span>  <span>The playstyle of Pk is simple, firstly you try to get 2 level 3 monsters onto the board to summon cherubini, secondly you use cherubini to get graff or libic into the gy to get a cir out of the deck/hand or if you used tour guide allready to get one of them to the field and linked them of you can send any of your pk's to the gy and then you can go into bardiche and activate cir to get cherubini back onto the field. From here you have several options to come to the end board.</span>  <span>The 1st turn endboard (if you didn't brick or got nibirued) is 1 bard which is equiped with a wizard buster dest. sw.,1 I:P (apolousa/knightmare uni.), 1 verte anaconda,  1 union carrier, 1 dragoon and 2 fog blades. And on you're second turn you're going to OTK youre opponent with accesscode and arc rebelion, if this didn't work you can use AA-ZEUS and I:P as a back up plan.</span>  <span>The SPICE: 1 wizard buster dest. sw. is a great out against decks like drytron, it's basically a dweller for monster eff's. </span>  <span>The weak spots: This deck has obviously many weak spots, but I will only list the greatest. Artifact lancea, nibiru, forbidden droplets, dark ruler no more, Skull meister/ghost belle, d.barrier.</span>  <span>Future support: This deck is always happy if level/rank 3 or really generic XYZ support (like AA-ZEUS or F0 utopic future dragon) is on the horizon. The next card that we could get in the TCG that we know of is F0 utopic future dragon which is an upgrade to F0 utopic future. If we get this here in the TCG the endboard could shift from I:P for apolousa to F0 dragon. And here is why: 1.It has protection against destruction effs.and battle, 2. You can negate a monster eff and steal the opponents monster if he controls it and 3. If you have dante as XYZ material and detach him you can recycle Cherubini.  </span>  <span>And that's my Pk deck for the Feb. 2021 format. I'll update this deck as soon as new support is announced. </span>  <span>Ps. when do we get F0 utopic future dragon in the TCG komoney?!!!</span>"

The deck is oriented around aroma gardening and blessed winds.,"This and any deck that uses the aroma engine highly relies on backrow not being disrupted. If your opponent has a fast way of getting rid of your backrow (by being destroyed or banished) then you can replace them, since the main deck plays multiple backrow cards except for 2 slecific aroma traps, they aren't as important as blessed winds. Otherwise your gonna set up and with a protected stardust dragon you don't really have to worry about anything, except for evenly matched. That card hard counters this deck, so if you really want, you could swap some cards for a predaplant anaconda-dragoon combo. But if your opponent negates your backrow continuously, you'r in trouble. Most likely your going to lose if you faced against a fast paced combo deck. But on the other hand, this deck holds some combos too. Combo 1: you need a tuner and any other monster (that's why i play mind control) to easely make halqifibrax. Combo 2: you will need 2 plant monsters and A LP gain when you summon aromaseraphy jasmine. You'll search angelica or rose girl, but if you have both you can search something else. Then you need an extra monster for the 3rd effect of aromaseraphy jasmine. You'll special lonefire blossom and keep in mind that specialing all 3 copies of lonefire is not a good decision since you want to draw it. Combo 3: if you have a dna surgery you can surprise your opponent by normalling rose tentacles or using fragrance storm on your opponent's monster. Combo 4: when your opponent declares an attack on an aromage monster you control, if you have humid winds: activate humid winds to search marjoram then you can special summon her and banish a card(s) in your opponent's GY. Apart from all of that, it's all control based and oriented around your backrow. The best aroma backrow is aroma gardening, it can stall you long enough to get you back in the game, after that the 2nd best is blessed winds. Your whole deck is made around those cards. If your opponsnt desen't manage to disrupt you hard enough, you'r gonna generate resources like crazy. Another reason why i play dna surgery is for your extra deck monsters to gain extra effects from your aroma monsters, and another bonus is that it can potentially mess your opponent's effects, so i recommend you flipping it before the main phase. Only con about dna surgery is that it doesen't change types in the GY, so you can't recycle your extra deck monsters. Best cards to foolish burial are rose girl and flower bot, but sometimes aromages especially laurel and angelica."

","So, here's what I refer to as a ""Dark pile"", AKA just a pile of fucking generic  Dark attribute support. The core of this deck is PK with a Danger! engine, to get fodder on the field easier for Bardiche, in order to set up a backrow of Pog Blade so you can pog the opponent's combo pieces. The Dangers! are fantastic for dumping PK's to grave and getting tons of bodies on field, and they also serve as a great source of draw power. There's also the duo of Dark Grepher and Armageddon Knight, which both help to fill up the grave to extend plays. As should be obvious by now, the graveyard is essential for this deck. I also included a small Levianeer package, so at the end of your plays, you can banish 3 unused Dark's to get out Levi and rip a card from the opponent's hand, making them start with 1 less card, as this is a going 1st control deck. In the extra, it's mainly a toolbox of various large monsters. There's Bardiche, which is your main large monster to summon as to set up a huge backrow. You also have the huge Xyz line-up, which is mainly there to be ranked up into VFD/Cali Yuga, but if you're unable to rank them up with Magic Force, you have the alternative option of poking in and going into Zeus instead. You also have the small Xyz Dragon package as to go into either Rebellion to finish off the game, or Requiem for negates, coupled with Pog Blade. This can make for an incredibly powerful deck if played right, but it sure as fuck isn't a meta contender for the time being, at least in my opinion. It's too fragile to cards like VFD and Vanity's to be able to go up against various meta decks. But, it's still incredibly fun and shows what PK is capable of doing in their long legacy. Update: Swapped around VFD and Cali for some better going first/second rank 8 options. Henry helped me with them; he's surprisingly chill on Discord."

The Meta is dominated by combo decks that end in floodgates, control decks that set for five only to xyz summon for six and every other deck is just Shaddoll. Players resort to religious punishment to obstruct their opponents and Invoked is still exactly where it has always been. Has anyone seen Dragon Link?  At least one thing is for certain and that is that Salamangreat will find some way to adapt to whatever is currently meta and slightly change their deck to fit it's needs. If Fire monsters are good at one thing it's fighting fire with fire. If VW's emission scandal wasn't enough they've done did it again and brought floodgates back into the meta so the people at Salamangreat HQ (which is just a redecorated Sanctuary) quickly responded with, well, fighting fire with fire: Floodgates.  The current Meta decks are incredibly divers in their types. Hence, Rivalry of the Warlords. VW has wyrm and psychic, Drytron has machines and fairies and Eldlich Zoo has zombies and beast-warriors and the occasional spellcaster casting Divine Smite with a Nat20 for way to many d8s. I also heard there's a new villain trying to take over the tri-state area. Well slap a fedora on your Rivalry and call it Agent R: Good news, you just won. Locking these decks into a mono type really messes with their board and if you're hit by a Nibiru because you're opponent is stuck in July 2020 you'll at least force him into rocks, rendering all of his monsters useless unless they are playing Adamancipator. You should be fine.  If you're opponent has what is formally known as DINO DNA - <span><span>You see,</span> a few</span> <span><span>years back</span> on</span> <span>a routine dig..<span> - or plays any other deck that has more attributes than it has types, Gozen Match is a fantastic floodgate. You can't access your Code Talkers under it but Salamangreat Rage's first effect can pop if whenever you feel the flood has done it's job and you can safely leave the comfort of the arc. Just don't get stranded on a mountain; I know someone who had that happen to him.</span></span>  Parallel Exceed, or friendly neighborhood...something..is back but he's not here to leave, he's here to stay! (think I kinda messed up the saying) He's not an extender for your turn 1 Borrelsword because you're not used to winning the dice roll, instead he enables a small r4nk toolbox with Abyss Dweller and Bagooska.  Since you're not playing too many extenders (notice the complete absence of Will of the Salamangreat) you have enough space to comfortably run Called by the Grave and Upstart Goblin for a nice 39+1 card deck. Droll's dead this format, right?  WeLl AcKcHuAlLy, I pReFeR lAdY dEbUg. If this is you then congratulations, you just graduated clown school. (It's an actual thing and it honestly sounds cool. I'm sure it <span>mad</span>e you a very confident person which explains your bravery to make such foolish statements.) Bufferlo can be chain blocked, it gives you draw power, dumps your Salamangreats, is a fire monster (which is very important for Gozen Match) and it's also not a bug but instead belongs to a near endangered species that could use some more representation. (No, I'm not talking about Chemicritter players)  As always, Forbidden Droplet can be swapped for Dark Ruler No More and Accesscode Talker can trade places with Topologic Zeroboros.  Almiraj is probably the most flexible extra deck slot but I've seen more hands with Parallel eXceed and a handtrap as my only NS than I have a seen the video of Trif Gaming getting banned from Konami. He did nothing wrong, man!  Thanks for reading and please stop playing Mystic Mine. You know who you are."

I believe this to be the most consistent form of the deck, being able to wack out Red Supernova on the first turn. This deck is pretty gamer in my honest and valued opinion. So, what's the strategy? Generally, you want a level 2 tuner and a level 4 non-tuner on the field to Synchro into Red rising dragon, and develop from there. The level 2 tuners in this deck are RED resonator, and CRIMSON resonator.  Red is decent, and it can aid in the recovery of life points if special summoned back from the grave via Red Rising Dragon, however, I prefer Crimson. Because, this way, If you have just summoned Red Rising Dragon and that crimson Resonator is the only other monster on the field, you can activate its effect to summon EITHER -- 2 more Red Resonators (LP bonus this way) or 1 Synkron Resonator and a Creation resonator (returns a resonator in the GY to your hand). If this succeeds, you have the perfect setup to go into Red Supernova Dragon - an incredibly powerful card, or (if the situation calls for it) King Calamity, by going into a RDA and then using your remaining two resonators to synchro in the the magnificent level 12 card.  I included 2 copies of Twin Twister just in case something like Zombie World is activated, preventing the summon of Red Rising Dragon. 3 copies of Resonator Command is a must -- it shouldn't be any lower than 3. Red Screen, as described in another, similar deck list (credit is where credit should be due) is simply put, a better version of Swords of Revealing Light. I included some draw power cards, because on the off chance you brick, it is imperative that you draw cards immediately, without waiting for the next Draw Phase.  That should be all, I tried keeping it as close to 40 cards without affecting the strategy. Thanks to the Rulers of Hell decklist for being the basis of my edited version. All criticisms welcome."

And nice tits.","So here's a pretty simple OTK deck, as Lunalights center around fusing into large beatsticks and sending their monsters to the grave for additional effects. To load up the graveyard and get additional bodies on the field for Verte, I included a Danger! engine. They give strong draw power, along with dumping your Lunalights into the grave for their effects and getting bodies onto the field for link material for Verte. The Lunalights are mainly to be dumped into grave, except for the Pendulum, which youw ant to slap down into it's scale immediately. After you dump them in, you can go into Verte and use Verte to send the fusion spell, dodging it's hard once per turn and going into the larger fusions. Then you're able to swing in for a ton of damage and hopefully finish off there. The deck's incredibly consistent, can finish off the game in a single turn, and most importantly, it has furry girls with nice tits."

I don't know what you want me to say here, it makes Isolde and goes brrrrr.","Hello fellow degenerates.  Here is a version of Infernoble Phantom Knights that I've been labbing and having success with both online and in person play.  Any hand that can make Isolde, which is most hands this deck produces, can end on Savage plus VFD, a combo that's pretty solid at the moment versus most decks.  If you manage to find Torn Scale, who represents an additional two bodies via the other PKs, you summon Apollusa on six, ending alongside Savage, Herald, plus a level 9 synchro of your choice. Charles is the thematic choice, but there's a new generic level 9 synchro running around these days who's pretty good. Called, uh... Shenshen? Who completes the Macro lock combined with Herald so any card going to the graveyard from hand, deck, or field is banished instead.  Interrupted, I find I can still usually end on at least Herald plus Savage in most circumstances, which is not insignificant, especially with Drytron.  I'm open to criticisms and suggestions, of course, you all know where the comments are."

Long story short short: Junk Converter + Opponet with no hand traps = 90% win.  This deck revolves around summoning Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity during your opponets turn which makes them <strong>unable to use any effects.</strong>  In order to do that you will need to follow this simple one card combo:  In order for this to work you will need to have junk converter in hand. He can be searched with reinforcement of the army or you can draw into him with the multiple draw cards which you have.  The combo is:  1.Junk converter effect search for junk synchron.  2.Normal summon junk synchron and special summon converter.  3.Synchro into Junk speeder.  4.Use converter effect to ss junk synchron from gy.  5.Use speeder effect to special summon from deck ""Satellite Synchron"", ""Cyberse Synchron"" and ""Steam synchron"".  6. Synchro summon using Junk Synchron and Junk Speeder into Chaos Ruler.(You dont have to use the effect but it is good way to add cards like caligo and dopper.)  7.During opponets turn use steam effect to synchro summon using ""Chaos Ruler"", ""Steam Synchron"" and ""Cyberse Synchron"" into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity.  8.His effect will trigger and so your opponet will not be able to do anything :)  <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>  This deck is not only limited to this combo even though it is its main purpose. You can try to go into as many synchro's as possible depending on your hand. You can also use any card that is on the field excpet steam synchron, cyberse synchron and chaos ruler since those are needed for Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity.  P.S.  This is the first deck that I have submitted so if you have any suggestions please tell me :)"

Another difference is I field Lady Debug for extra search over Balancer Lord.  <em>Spells:</em>  Usual set of A.I./Ignister spells, I run 2 A.I.Land and a Terraforming over 3 A.I.Land to reduce opening hand flooding.  <em>Traps: </em>a Mirror Force for extra removal, and an Impermanence for some extra negation (have another in the side deck if i feel like i need 2)  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck:</strong>  Link: The Arrival and Darkfluid are the main boss monsters, with Accesscode as a backup. Dark Templar is used to Soul Charge out more Materials for links/synchros/xyz, while Fire Phoenix is a nice board presence card especially w/ TAI Strike. Wicckid and Splash Mage provide some cheaper link plays, providing either protection for other monsters or getting more stuff out of the GY.  Synchro: Wind Pegasus is nice for some Spell/Trap nuking along with it's other effect, while Cyberse Quantum Dragon, like Wicckid provides protection for other monsters and also is a decent monster in general.  XYZ: 2 Light Dragons. Light Dragon is nice.  Sideboard: I have some stuff in my sideboard for getting more control cards to stay alive if it's an issue since my deck isn't as laser-focused on OTK as other @Ignister decks. (Lightning Storm, Harpie's FD, SoRL, another copy of Impermanence, Dark Ruler, etc.)  &nbsp;"

The synergy between these archetypes is very good which ma,"<span><strong>This deck is as casual as they come. It's by no means competitive or meta, but it is interesting...</strong></span>  <span>This deck has 2 goals. Summoning high level xyz with the trains, the Flying Pegasus and the Anchor Drill and getting your Chaos Ancient Gear Giant out. Ancient Gears on their own are not that good in my opinion so a little support from an archetype that can frequently summon is nice.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Golem: </strong>You don't really want to draw this card. You can't special summon it and tribute summoning this thing gets countered very easily which ends up with you losing 2 or three cards (if geartown is on the field only 2). It's why I put them at 1. I don't think you will even use more than 1 Golems in a duel. The longer the duel lasts the harder it becomes to win.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Gadjiltron Dragon: </strong>I can hear you thinking to yourself; ""Why Gadjiltron Dragon? Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon is much better!!"" True the card is better, but for what we are trying to do here Gadjiltron Dragon suits this deck better with it 8 star scaling. With this card you can get very easily into Seven Sins and banish your oponnent's monsters often locking them out of their effects in the process. This card is searchable with Urgent Schedule, Ancient Gear Wyvern and can be returned from the graveyard using Bullet Express Train. So only 2 as well.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Wyvern: </strong>This card is basically the Elemental Hero Stratos of this deck. It searches out any Ancient Gear cards in your deck. You can extend the combo searching for Ancient Gear Box first and then using the effect of Box you can add an Ancient Gear Frame or Infinitrack Anchordrill to your hand. You go plus 2 for no cost so run three at all times. </span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Box:</strong> This the garnet in the deck so you really don't want to draw it. I run the card at one because it is recyclable so you can just use it from the graveyard again. Running at 2 could be possible too but I would not recommend it at three. The risk of drawing increases substantially.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Frame:</strong> When summoned you can discard one card in return for an Ancient Gear Fusion or Ancient Gear Golem. Handy card in a pinch but often you'll use Wyvern instead. We use 1</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Hunting Hound: </strong>A walking polymerization. When summoned it does 600 damage to your opponent but We use it for its ability to fusion summon any Ancient Gear monster. Often we fuse into Ancient Gear Howitzer to get an Ancient Gear Golem on the field. Definitely use 3.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Howitzer:</strong> In my opinion a very underrated card. Unaffected by card effects and it can inflict 1000 damage to your opponent... Every turn. Your opponent probably wants this card destroyed. But if for some reason he doesn’t and you don’t really care for the burn effect you can always destroy it yourself to get Ancient Gear Golem out to fusion summon a Chaos Ancient Gear Giant. If you have Ancient Gear Golem out in the field and you use Ancient Gear Fusion you can use material from the deck to complete the summon instead. So Howitzer is a powerful card that opens the path to an even better card. We run 1 or 2.</span>  <span><strong>Super Express Bullet Train</strong>: A rank 10 train card that is very easy to bring out. All you need, is to have only earth machine monsters on the field. Usually the plan is to bring out this card together with Heavy Freight Train Derricane and possible Flying Pegasus and Anchordrill to xyz summon your bossmonsters. Downside is that it can’t attack without sending 2 cards you control to the graveyard. This however poses no problem for us because we only use it as xyz fodder. A nice extra is that it lets you take back a card from the graveyard to your hand if Bullet train is in the graveyard. I run 2. I wouldn’t use three to prevent bricking.</span>  <span><strong>Infinitrack Anchordrill:</strong> Has enormous synergy with the Ancient Gear archetype. It is usable for Ancient Gear Box because it has 500ATK and it can summon another card from the hand. Besides that it can combine the stars for both cards making lets say Gadjiltron Dragon and Anchordrill fodder for the rank 12 xyz Seven Sins.</span>  <span><strong>Heavy Freight Train Derricane: </strong>Just like Bullet Express Train it is so easy to bring out. Use this card for xyz fodder too. Ideally we run 2.</span>  <span><strong>Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede: </strong>Lets you summon a card from your graveyard in defense position but without its effect. Nice effect but we will use its secondary one more often. It lets us copy the level of another face up card to either Flying pegasus or the other way around. Best used with the trains or level 8 monsters. I use 3.</span>  <strong>Exodius: The Ultimate Forbidden Lord: </strong>We use this card as xyz fodder too and it lets you recycle the cards in your graveyard. One is enough.  <strong>Machina Citadel: Same with Exodius:</strong> we use it as xyz fodder and sometimes you can use its effect to destroy your opponent's monsters. One is enough.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Spells (we don’t really use traps in this deck.)</strong></span>  <span><strong>Foolish Burial goods: </strong>Use this to send Ancient Gear Catapult to pop Geartown. One is enough.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Catapult: </strong>We use Catapult to pop Geartown and summon Ancient Gear golem and Wyvern to get into Chaos Giant. Only way to really summon Golem aside from tributing and using Howitzer. Run three at all times, it is the foundation of the Ancient Gears.</span>  <span><strong>Geartown:</strong> Used in tandem with Catapult this can give you a Chaos Giant and more. Like Catapult, run three at all times.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Fusion: </strong>If used with Ancient Gear Golem you can search the deck for materials too. Chaos Giant can be out in one turn this way. I would run three.</span>  <span><strong>Terraforming:</strong> Speaks for itself really.</span>  <span><strong>Urgent Schedule:</strong> This card lets you summon 2 monsters from the deck. One lvl 4 or lower and one level 5 high or higher. This used to be quite an expensive card but is more affordable nowadays. Getting 2 free summons when your opponent controls more cards is very helpful for your xyz and fusion plays. I recommend running 3.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Fortress:</strong> I have mixed feelings about this card. On one hand it protects your Ancient Gears but on the other hand it is an extremely xenophobic card. When popped it allows you to summon an Ancient Gear monster from your hand or grave but for the rest of the turn you can summon ONLY Ancient Gears. So be careful with this one. I run 3 but you could run 1, 2, 3 or even none I don't really know with this one.</span>  <span><strong>Pot of Avarice: </strong>Very nice card to recycle your cards in the graveyard again and it gives you 2 extra cards in the hand as well. We use 1 or 2.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>The extra deck</strong></span>  <strong>Double Headed Anger Knuckle:</strong> This card is good for getting those level 10 cards on the field. We use only one.  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Ballista:</strong> This card is a godsend for Ancient Gear players. It synergizes immensely with the trains and earth machine monsters in general. It only requires 2 earth machine monsters to summon it. Ballista can add one Geartown to your hand or any Ancient Gear Monster in the main deck. Usually what you want to do with this card is to add a Geartown to your hand, you play it and then activate Ballista’s secundary effect to reduce an opponent’s monster ATK/DEF to zero and send the Geartown to the graveyard as cost which in turn activates Geartown’s effect. </span>  <span><strong>Chaos Ancient Gear Giant:</strong> The one card I’ve been talking about so much. With his 4500 atk and powerful effect it’s a force to be reckoned with. Unaffected by spell and trap cards and the option to attack every monster your opponent controls once. If that wasn’t good enough already it does piercing damage too. Run 1 or 2, it depends really.</span>  <span><strong>Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem: </strong>Sporting an attack of 4400 this card this card is quite the powerhouse too. Its effect isn’t as good as Chaos Giant but it can get an Ancient Gear Golem on the field when destroyed, giving you the chance to get another Chaos Giant. We run 1 or 2.</span>  <span><strong>Megaton Ancient Gear Golem:</strong> Essentially a weaker version of Chaos Ancient Gear Giant. When fusion summoned with more than one Ancient Gear Golem it can attack multiple times in your battle phase. When destroyed by card effect you can get your Ultimate Golem out and that way you could get an Chaos Ancient Gear Giant too.</span>  <span><strong>Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe: </strong>A rank 11 xyz easily summoned using Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora. Can attack up to the number of attached materials plus one. You can boost the attack of this card by 2000 by detaching one card which makes Liebe a powerful beatstick. 1 is more than enough.</span>  <span><strong>Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora:</strong> Can detach one card to make another unaffected by card effects. When used on Chaos Giant it makes the card nearly invincible.</span>  <span><strong>Number 77 Seven Sins:</strong> Out of all the rank 12 cards this one is the easiest to summon. There are 3 ways to summon it and they all have their merits.. We can summon it the normal way by using 2 rank 12 monsters, this has the advantage that we can use its effect immediately and banish your opponent monsters. The only downside here is that seven sins has only 1 card to protect itself when targeted for battle or by card effects unless you don’t activate the effect. The second way involves xyz summuning Rank 8 Dingirsu Orcust of The Evening Star to your field. You then overlay Pain Gainer on it and then into Seven Sins. Last way to summon it is to xyz summon Ravenous Tarantula into Sevens Sins or first into Pain Gainer and then Seven Sins. We run only one, the resources needed for this card are substantial enough that you probably won’t get another one on the field.</span>  <span><strong>Number 84 Pain Gainer</strong>: Also 2 ways of summoning it but doing it the normal way  is not really possible in this deck. We mostly use Dingirsu or Ravenous Tarantula to summon it instead. Usually this card is just a stepping stone for Seven Sins or if you can summon Seven Sins the normal way and still have room for Pain Gainer it can be a good card on its own. We Also run one.</span>  <span><strong>Number 35 Ravenous Tarantula:</strong> If used a bit further down the duel this card will turn all your monsters into beatsticks on steroids. It adds the difference in life points as attack and defense to face up cards you control. This in combination with a Chaos Giant will completely destroy any monster. We mostly use the rank 10 trains or a Flying Pegasus to Xyz into it. If you decide to not go further the xyz chain and keep it as it is you can punish special summoning with it too. Every time your opponent special summons a monster they lose 600 lifepoints. And if that wasn’t enough you can detach one monster to destroy all monsters your opponent controls that have attack less or equal to this card. You could run 2 but I run one.</span>  <span><strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy:</strong> A very good  generic staple usable in a lot of decks. It has decent negate and forces cards to attack this one instead of another card your opponent wants to attack. When an xyz card is destroyed you can add half the attack of the destroyed card to another xyz you control. 1 is enough.</span>  <span><strong>Dingirsu The Orcust of The Evening Star:</strong> Really a good staple as well. I am actually inclined to use Dingirsu more then Harbinger in duels. You can use this card for Pain Gainer too. Aside from that it can protect cards from destruction by detaching materials. Run 1.</span>  <span><strong>Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid: </strong>Can be used as material for Dora when you destroy a monster by battle. It has build in protection as well. I would run 1, it’s a good card but I don’t use it all that often.</span>  <strong>There is no side deck in this profile. I leave this to your imagination. Some examples of good cards I would use are Twin Twisters and Unending Nightmare. The rest is up to you.</strong>"

So the primary strategy is to set up your twin loop while locking them out of the game with backrow and Gryphon, and using Abomination to pop cards on the field with Lil-la. This also allows you to use floodgates like order as one turn stuns because Abomination can pop them when you don't need them anymore. Excced lets you extend into I:P and set up Gryphon lockout, Unicorn spin, or Underworld Goddess. While Alpha is a card you can summon with either twin links on the field can act as spot removal and extend by being link material. It's not needed but its an interesting tech. If you don't want to play Gryphon and are looking for something more aggressive you can swap it out for an Accesscode. Don't know what the meta will look like post LIOV so hand trap ratios can vary, and always looking for ways to improve the deck so suggestions are welcome!"

However having fun and win games is not as big of a trouble as the first sentence made it sound. You summon big beatsticks, clear boards and throw hand traps as if you friend fell over and you just prepared a whole batch of snowballs meant for their face.  We split this deck in two paths you always want to do.  The Armed dragon path leading to a Level 10 Thunder / Lv10 thunder + White or vanilla for board clear,  And the Windwitch path which will  make you a protected crystallwing.  Thanks to the Windwitch combo not needing the normal summon, you just need to draw your bell or search it with wynn and start the combo. Afterwards you can do your armed dragon up rank protected under a crystallwing.  The key card here is Wynn, being able to either search the Armed dragon path starter or the windwitch starter gives your endboard quie the consitency, and if you already have both in hand, then she can search you a hand trap, where we also play a few wind ones.  &nbsp;"

Have your recent Gacha pulls been very lackluster? Do you believe Altergeist to be too strong of a tier 0 deck that would be unfair to play against so you wish to play a fairer control oriented deck? Whatever your reason to turn to S-Force I judge you by your life choices that led you here.  But now that you have decided to fight the good fight in the name of justice and chase after I:P Masquerena all day and night (oh I see, so that's why you're here) we might as well have a look at a deck list.  &nbsp;  <span>You know a deck list is going to be good if whoever made the deck feels they need to explain and justify their choices beforehand. But alas, here we are:</span>  If you rather play Pot of Extravagance (because you inherited 500.000$ to afford those pots and all the extra ED monster it requires) you can easily cut out the Ghost Reaper targets.  Since I'm instead playing Pot of Desires I chose to run 2 S-Force Showdown. Same with Orrafist, since he's not too bad. Well he's not good either but Ghost Ogre'ing a monster once is better than not ogre'ing at all.  &nbsp;  <span>""I'm sorry, I've spend the past week starring at Rappa Chiyomaru and have honestly no idea what this deck does"":</span>  Well hello there, man of culture. If you haven't taken the time to go through this deck's line of plays by yourself - for completely understandable reasons - let me do you a favor and go through their 2 main combos.  <strong>Rappa Chiyomaru + Gravitino:</strong> ""I Normal Summon Aleister!"" Sorry, force of habit. I meant Normal Summon S-Force Rappa Chiyomaru. You then banish Gravitino in hand for cost returning her to your hand to Special Summon S-Force Oka-San (apparently some people call her Pla-Tina). She will then Special Summon your banished Gravitino who in turn adds a S-Force Spell/Trap to hand. Add S-Force Showdown and Special Summon Chiyomaru from hand.  <strong>Rappa Chiyomaru + Pla-Tina + any S-Force Monster:</strong> This combo too starts with Normal Summoning Chiyomaru. (I think I'm starting to get over my nightmares) This time you banish the remaining S-Force from hand for Chiyomaru's effect. This S-Force cannot be Pla-Tina since she cannot Special Summon herself with her effect. If you had Gravitino you could just do the above combo meaning realistically the S-Force you'd banish in this case are either a second copy of Chiyomaru or Orrafist. Now Chiyomaru will Special Summon Gravitino from deck who will again search you Showdown. Showdown will Special Summon your Pla-Tina in hand (yes, she only shows up at the very end of the combo, I'M SORRY!) who will Special Summon the S-Force monster you banished at the very beginning for Chiyomaru's effect.  <strong>Tl;dr or the ""still can't get my eyes off of Chiyomaru explanation"": </strong>First combo ends in Chiyomaru, Pla-Tina and Gravitino. Second combo end in your banished S-Force, Pla-Tina and Gravitino.  &nbsp;  <span>""So that's it?"":</span>  I hear ya (and Konami I hope you can hear them, too) and well, yup. That's it. A 2 to 2.5 card combo that results in 3 monsters on the board with no interruption. But what it does do is giving Mekk-Knights a run for their mechanics (and losing the race by miles). They affect your opponents monsters in the same column as your S-Force monsters. Most notably is Gravitino who makes it so that if your opponent's monster in the same column leaves the field it gets banished instead. So try placing your three monsters in the middle three zones to cover both EMZ to force their Link Monsters to get banished after link climbing.  But the spice lies with the rest of your hand. There can be only one is one insane card. (What, you expect me to elaborate?) If you draw Specimen you can actually link 2 of your S-Forces away for I:P and then Special Summon Gravitino back in the same column as an opponents monster. I'd advise you to use Pla-Tina and Gravitino as link material since Chiyomaru's effect is a Quick Effect to summon another S-Force in a zone your opponent controls a monster to force a banish with Gravitino's effect if you happen to have another S-Force in hand to pay for her cost. (no I'm not keeping track of how many cards I'm hypothetically holding) Your Chiyomaru could then Special Summon Orrafist for an actual interruption. If all else fails, you have a good array of handtraps at your disposal with Dimension Shifter, Ash Blossom and Ghost Belle.  &nbsp;  <span>""Where's Isolde?"":</span>  Another good point, well done. As nice as it feels to resolve Isolde, set up the aforementioned board with a bonus Apollousa I doubt you've played any actual Yu-Gi-Oh since your kindergarden days. The chances of your Isolde engine getting ashed at your Normal Summon is a high as it gets leaving y\ at the mercy of a bloodthirsty zombie lord and it's genetically modified human-animal hybrid pets and his intergalactic weapon of mass destruction. I wouldn't wanna be your Torn Scales. So where's the difference if they ash your Chyiomaru you may ask and you may not! Chyiomaru's a quick effect, your Gravitino is already banished so amy S-Force card will do to set up the same board during your opponents turn. So if you can't win anyways, might as we steal their turn. I swear we're on the side of justice!  &nbsp;  Well, that should be about it.  Now go fight crime and get your game on!"

Here I will explain why I added some of the cards.  <strong>Main Deck </strong>(40 cards)  The 1x cards (Rollback, shadow, mask, goblin, cyber and Comic) The purpose of these cards is really to search them when you need them. For instance shadow toon is worthless on the first turn.  3x Toon harpie lady: These cards are very important. They are free special summons as long as Toon kingdom is on the field. Also If you play them whilst another toon monster is on the field you can destroy one of your opponent's spells/traps. This is useful to get rid of potential threats.  3x The Black Sone Of Legend: This card's purpose is to special summon Red-eyes then use Red-eyes to special another toon card from your hand.  3x Toon mermaid: Free special summon.  3x Toon Dark Magcian: The best toon card (in my opinion). The card's purpose is to set/special summon the 1x cards and to special summon Toon ancient gear golem and Toon Black Luster Soldier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1x Toon Ancient Gear Golem: Great at dealing damage.  2x Toon Bookmark: I put 2 instead of 3 so there was room to add comic hand. Adds Toon Kingdom to your hand and serves as protection for Kingdom too.,  3x Toon Terror: Great at negating spells/traps and destroying monsters.  2x Toon Briefcase: Stops your opponent from getting monsters on the field.  <strong>Extra Deck</strong> (add cards so the total becomes 15)  1x Clear Wing Sychro Dragon: Powerful card that can be summoned once you side in Ash Blossom and/or Ghost ogre (use an lv3 tuner+ a lv4 toon).  <strong>Side Deck </strong>(15 cards)  3x Ghost Ogre: If your opponent is taking control of the duel(s) using card effects side her in (can be used to synchro summon clear wing). She is a great replacement for Toon Terror; she can be activated from the hand.  2x Ash Blossom: If your opponent is doing the specific things listed on the card side her in (can be used to synchro summon clear wing).  3x Toon Buster Blader: Side him in if your opponent is using dragon cards.  1x Toon Rollback: side it in to deal damage as quickly as possible.  Raigeki: Side it in if your opponent is getting large and powerful fields."

You HAVE to open either S'monk + shark, or Magician +Shark. The end board is a 3-4 mat apollousa, a toad, and dragoon. The bad draw cards are there for as much consistency as possible, along with double summon to try to salvage dead hands. I am going to say that they shouldn't unban zenmaity because that would make the combos too consistent and this deck would be trouble. Hunter isn't even good, it's just a name with a tolerable effect.  edit: got rid of hunter and one bat for a soldier because it doesn't get rid of board presence."

Predaplant Engine,"I've been working on this particular Shaddoll build for a bit now and I'm pretty excited with the results so far.  Squamatta &amp; Wendi are your primary engine cards so you have to run 3 each. Ariel is your combo enabler with some incidental GY hate stapled to it. Keios is really just a Light tutor target to enable your plays with Construct. The rest are utility effects that you can access at almost any time you want.  Performage engine enables your combos via Trick Clown. Damage Juggler can have some nice synergy with the Predeplant engine as well as granting you more utility. Hat Tricker is just a tutor target and extender, he also grants access to the Earth type in the main deck.  The Predeplant engine is nice here because Shaddoll doesn't need a normal summon in-archetype but can have issues finding its Fusion spells at times. Scorpion for Cobra fixes this issue quite nicely while offering Dark type monsters to fuse with and putting bodies on the table for link summons. The fact that Scorpion can tutor any of your fusion effects is also quite nice as it offers a lot of utility.  The hand trap line-up is pretty standard. Ash is the best HT in the format. Gamma protects your Shaddoll Fusion from Ash while also providing Light monsters for Construct. Veiler isn't the best HT option in the format, but we really want access to Light monsters as often as possible and Veiler is likely the next best card for the slot.  Rainbow Neos is probably the portion of the deck that looks the strangest, but hear me out. There are a couple of reasons to play it over Dragoon in this deck. For one, we like the Light type monsters a lot more than the Darks, so opening with the fusion material hurts a lot less. But there is also the fact that Neos Fusion is a much better target for your Predeplant engine since you can summon the same turn you activate it.  There is also a metagame aspect to this pick. Currently the deck does fine vs Drytron and Virtual World, as we play good ways to interact with them in the main deck. However, Eldlich can be an issue for the deck. Rainbow Neos is actually an incredibly strong card in this match up. All 3 effects can be absolutely backbreaking against Lich when used at the right time, and he can't be outed by a single Conquistador thanks to the GY effect of Neos Fusion.  Also, and arguably most importantly, Rainbow Neos is just way cooler than Dragoon.  Not a lot to talk about as far as spells go, but I will say that your 3 limited spells all offer an absolute bevy of utility for you and I would not leave home without any of them.  As for traps, Incarnation is a combo enabler and utility piece in one. 2 feels like the right number. Only 1 Schism might look wrong for how powerful the card is, but it's extremely easy to access from the deck whenever you want it.  Extra deck:  -Shekhinaga is important as a Super Poly target vs Zoo  -Construct is your best card, never leave without 3  -Apkallone offers incredible utility between both of its effects  -Winda is stupid good. 1 is usually enough, but I like running 2 in case I burn one early on an Instant Fusion play or just on an early combo start.  -Venom &amp; Mudragon are easy little Super Poly targets. Venom is extra important since you can make it off of Verte Anaconda and any opponents monster you can target with Anaconda's effect. Mudragon is nice because it can also be summoned off of Instant Fusion and become any type you might be missing in a pinch.  -Accesscode Talker is your combo end boss. When made with Unicorn, Talker+ Construct offers an easy 8100 damage while clearing the opponents board on the way.  -Unicorn is great utility and the link-3 enabler to make big Accesscode.  -Cross-Sheep is your link-climbing expert and another important piece of your main combo.  -Anaconda is Anaconda.  -Gravity Controller enables any opening that can make Construct or Apkallone to tutor Schism to your hand.  1-card Shaddoll Fusion combo: <ol>  	<li>Activate Fusion, sending Trick Clown and Squamatta to make Construct</li>  	<li>Trigger Clown, Squamatta, and Construct. SS Clown, send Wendi and Incarnation to the GY.</li>  	<li>Trigger Wendi, set Ariel from deck.</li>  	<li>Link Construct and Clown to make Cross-Sheep, picking back up Fusion with Construct's effect.</li>  	<li>Remove Construct for Incarnation's cost to flip Ariel face-up.</li>  	<li>Trigger Ariel, summon Construct from banish into a Cross-Sheep zone.</li>  	<li>Trigger Cross-Sheep and Construct, sending El Shaddoll Fusion and summoning back Clown.</li>  	<li>Link Sheep and Construct to make Unicorn. Pitch Shaddoll Fusion to Unicorn, and pick up El Shaddoll Fusion with Construct.</li>  	<li>Link Unicorn and Ariel to make Accesscode.</li>  	<li>Fuse Clown and any Shaddoll in hand to make Construct.</li> </ol>"

The deck runs 60 cards to help reduce brick hands.  The Eldlich engine is the backbone of this deck. Golden Lord can be used as a beat-stick or for back-row removal, and he enables the secondary effects of the Eldlich trap monsters. Cursed Eldland allows you to search you other Eldlich cards. Sanguine summons Golden Lord from your deck or GY and it floats into your trap monsters. The trap monsters can each float into Sanguine. Gustav Max can be made if you get both Golden Lords to help close out games.  The Red-Eyes engine is designed to turbo Dragoon. The vanillas and Fusion card are needed for the summon, and Insight and Wyvern help you get to Fusion. Link Spider allows you to make Anaconda using trap monsters, and Anaconda gives you another way to access Fusion. Dragoon is way too powerful, so you have to play him while you can. Wyvern can bring him back after he is destroyed if the conditions are met.  The Dogmatika engine gives you access to a lot of removal and extra deck hate. Ecclesia allows you to search the other parts of this engine on summon, and can be special summoned if your opponent controls an extra deck monster. Fleurdelis is a beat-stick and negate. Maximus removes cards from your opponent's extra deck and can trigger N'tss. Nadir Servant can trigger N'tss and search Ecclesia. Punishment is removal that can also trigger N'tss for an extra removal.  Ash Dragon can be sent instead of N'tss if you want a search instead of removal.  The Shaddoll engine gives you access to control and removal tools through its extra deck monsters. Construct can run over extra deck monsters. Apkallone has battle protection and negation. Winda is a special summon floodgate. The main deck monsters provide a diverse tool-box through their flip and sent to the GY effects.  The Invoked engine has the rest of your extra deck monsters. Mechaba has negates. Augoeides can destroy a monster. Purgatrio is a beat-stick with piercing. Caliga is a battle and effect floodgate. Their main deck cards search each other, and provide recursion allowing you to recycle Invocation and Aleister.  Terraforming provides an extra copy of Meltdown which is the start of your Invoked search chain. Prison is powerful removal that can be used against most decks. Torrential is a great tool for punishing over extension, and, if Golden Lord was summoned by his own effect, he is immune to the destruction.  The side deck has back-row hate and hand-traps that can be sided in as needed."

I'm not saying it's good, it is Crystal Beasts after all, but I think it can be competitive with some newer non-meta decks. There are a number of strategies. You can try to get Hamon out and then Rainbow Dragon or Rainbow Overdragon. The Links and XYZ monsters allow you to use your crystal beasts for something useful and then to send them to the graveyard where you can access them with support spells. You have access to Zeus through Utopia, and Rainbow Neos is great spot removal.  Let's go through the cards one by one and explain what they're run for.  <strong><span>Monsters:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>1x Elemental Hero Neos - Bricky, but needed for Rainbow Neos</li>  	<li>1x Rainbow Dragon - an okay boss monster, but very hard to get out, mostly used for Rainbow Neos</li>  	<li>3x Sapphire Pegasus - this card is your bread and butter. Use it to search itself and fill your back row with Crystal Beasts.</li>  	<li>2x Ruby Carbuncle - I probably think this card  is better than it is, but its effect of being able to special summon the beasts in your back row can be really useful for flooding your board with monsters you can use to link off or XYZ.</li>  	<li>1x Emerald Tortoise, 1x Amber Mammoth, 1x Topaz Tiger, 1x Amethyst Cat, 1x Cobalt Eagle - None of these cards are especially useful, mostly used for Ultimate Crystal Magic and for filling your back row.</li>  	<li>3x Ash Blossom - I mean come on. You can use this to negate so much. Very useful for shutting down your opponent and keeping yourself alive.</li> </ul> <strong><span>Spells and Traps:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>3x Crystal Bond - This card is so good. You can use it to search out a Sapphire Pegasus and put a Ruby Carbuncle in your back row. A lot of plays begin with this card.</li>  	<li>3x Rainbow Bridge - This card lets you search out bond, beacon, or any other spell that you might need at a given time. Very useful card.</li>  	<li>2x Rainbow Ruins - Could maybe be bumped down to one or even zero. Just useful for staying alive longer and giving you an out when you inevitably fill your entire back row with beasts.</li>  	<li>2x Crystal Abundance - This card is really good but the condition is pretty prohibitive. You can use it to flood your board and OTK or just link off the monsters. Could honestly be bumped to three, but only if you think it's actually good.</li>  	<li>3x Crystal Promise - Great with sapphire pegasus as a way to get out Rainbow Neos instantly. Normal summon a pegasus, search out a pegasus, use promise to special summon the second pegasus, then you can link them off into verte anaconda and summon Rainbow Neos.</li>  	<li>3x Crystal Beacon - Good for an OTK that the deck is kind of built around. More on that later.</li>  	<li>1x Crystal Blessing - I think this is the worst crystal spell I included. It's good to fill your backrow after linking, but useless otherwise and bricky if you don't have any beasts in your graveyard.</li>  	<li>1x Neos Fusion - You only really need one for verte anaconda, but you could maybe run two if you also bumped up your Rainbow Neos materials.</li>  	<li>1x Raigeki - Pretty self explanatory, destroy your opponent's monsters.</li>  	<li>1x Harpie's Feather Duster - Pretty self explanatory, destroy your opponent's back row.</li>  	<li>2x Ultimate Crystal Magic - Lets you get out Rainbow Overdragon. Pretty good, easy to activate, could probably be bumped to three.</li>  	<li>1x Crystal Conclave - I do not think this card is as good as other people make it out to be. Special summoning is nice, but it takes up a zone in your back row that could otherwise be a beast.</li>  	<li>1x Infinite Impermanence - Deal with your opponents effect monsters and negate them.</li>  	<li>1x Witch's Strike - Great for getting back at your opponent when they negate a summon.</li> </ul> <strong><span>Side Deck:</span></strong>  I think this deck actually has a lot of potential for the side deck. I listed a lot of cards that could be bumped down. You could definitely drop the  5 crystal beasts, a Neos Fusion, and so on and then fill up on hand traps or whatever else you need. <ul>  	<li>2x Nibiru - This card is great against certain decks. This card is a one card OTK enabler.</li>  	<li>2x Hamon - This card can act as a replacement boss monster if you want another win condition, but getting out Rainbow Neos is probably easier.</li>  	<li>1x Topaz Tiger, 1x Emerald Tortoise, 1x Cobalt Eagle, 1x Amethyst Cat, 1x Amber Mammoth - Hey these cards aren't very good. You could probably drop them from the side deck for more tech cards. I just included them in case you want to add them for your second Ultimate Crystal Magic.</li>  	<li>1x Neos Fusion - Could probably be dropped for more tech cards, just include if you want a back up for the first one getting Ashed.</li>  	<li>2x Infinite Impermanence - Great card, great negation, really good if you go second.</li>  	<li>1x Twin Twisters - More back row removal</li>  	<li>1x Solemn Warning - You wanted to summon that monster? Damn bro, that sucks.</li>  	<li>1x Dark Ruler No More - this lets you deal with pesky effects and annoying monsters like Dragoon.</li> </ul> <strong><span>Extra Deck:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>1x Rainbow Overdragon - Good boss monster, not as good as Rainbow Neos</li>  	<li>1x Rainbow Neos - Really good card. Great removal that doesn't destroy or target. Very easy to get out with Verte Anaconda. This card is so good and could probably be bumped up to two.</li>  	<li>1x Daigusto Emeral, 1x Tornado Dragon, 1x Abyss Dweller - Generic rank 4 XYZ monsters that let you have various utility like back row removal or drawing cards.</li>  	<li>1x Gossip Shadow - Rank 3 for the few times you want to and can go into those. Great monster negate that lets you draw.</li>  	<li>1x Utopia, 1x Utopia the Lightning, 1x Zeus - You can evolve Utopia into Lightning, attack, then summon out Zeus with 4 materials. Zeus is great, you can shuffle out whatever your opponent puts out.</li>  	<li>1x Knightmare Cerberus, 1x Knightmare Phoenix, 1x Knightmare Unicorn - You basically have to run these cards in any deck. They're easy spot removal that you can get out for basically nothing.</li>  	<li>I:P Masquerena - Good interruption. Great card, easy to get out.</li>  	<li>Verte Anaconda - Kinda the backbone of this deck. Get it out as fast as possible and get out Rainbow Neos.</li> </ul> <strong><span>Example 2 Card Combo </span></strong>  Imagine you draw Crystal Bond and Crystal Beacon. This has the possibility to be an OTK. Either of these cards could also be a Rainbow Bridge. Anyway, start with Crystal Bond and search out a pegasus and put whatever in your back row. Normal summon Pegasus, put another pegasus in your back row. Use beacon to special summon Carbuncle from your deck. Use carbuncle's effect to summon up the pegasus and the other crystal beast. You now have two pegasus, a carbuncle, and another crystal beast. on your field. Link off the carbuncle and other crystal beast into Verte Anaconda, use it to summon Rainbow Neos, then tribute your Verte Anaconda to wipe your opponent's monsters. Now you have 8100 Attack points, just barely enough to OTK. This combo gets even better if you can add a promise into the mix."

Pure Ancient Warriors are nice and all but Tri-brigade gives the deck the extender it really needs. The synergy between the two is also great.  One good interaction is that you can activate 3 visits, then summon Double Dragon with the eff of a tribrigade and still proc the eff of 3 visits to search any ancient warriors.  The deck is good going first or second. I play a single revolt that can be search off the new tribrigade link which gives me more possibility going first or in the grind but you can remove it and try a full going second build."

U may bait your opponent negation by putting in cards like mind control or infinite impermanence or even photon hand.

Claw of Hermos side deck for fun/casual play. Sort of meta since the main card is Dragoon.","This is a pure red-eyes deck with a hermos side deck for fun. If you are playing casually I recommend siding in Hermos (or side him in whenever you want).  if you don't draw Red-Eyes fusion there is still a way to get Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon on the field; Predaplant verte anaconda. Just pay 2000LP, send Red-Eyes fusion, DM and REBD to the grave. It's not easy to get Anaconda on the field as you need 2 monsters to link summon it, but its still a decent back-up plan if you don't draw Red-Eyes Fusion.  <strong>Main Deck</strong> and <strong>Side Deck </strong>(40 cards) (15 cards)  I put more monsters than spells/traps mainly because the Red-Eyes archetype has many monsters but not too many good spells/traps. This deck is also gemini, so say hello to Phoenix Gearfried! Gemini ablation is for getting Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon and Phoenix Gearfried on the field (as well as the other gemini's). Gemini summoner is for when you can't fusion summon but you have a powerful gemini card in your hand.  8x Fusion cards: Claw of Hermos x3 (In the side deck), 3x Red-Eyes Fusion and 2x Polymerization for fusion summoning the fusion dragon cards.  I added 3x Ash Blossom (side deck) and 2x Ghost Ogre because I couldn't find enough spells/traps, so instead I chose handtraps. Luckily Ghost Ogre is quite reliable.  <strong>Extra deck </strong>(9 cards but 4 cards in the side-deck)  The extra deck contains powerful cards which are part of the Red-Eyes archetype. Clearwing is just for taking full advantage of the handtraps (the handtraps are tuners)."

I honestly just change it every time I hit a losing streak and then post it on here if it successfully breaks my los,"This is my third Endymion deck. I honestly just like posting it on here every time I update my deck.  I started using Chronograph Sorcerer and Timegazer Magician. I can not believe I did not use them before. Chronograph is a free spell for counters, and makes Timegazer a free special summon (I think this might have been common knowledge but keep in mind I started playing Yugioh like late-December of 2020). Not only that, but if you have a second Chronograph in hand, and you pop Chronograph to bring out Timegazer, then that activates Chronograph's effect to special summon itself from your hand, as well as any other monster from your hand that you want to special summon. That's an instant Crowley for the spellbook engine and you haven't even normal summoned yet (also if you want to keep 'em there, Timegazer has low atk/def values but acts as additional protection for your scales). If you can activate instant fusion to get out Millennium-Eyes Restrict, or activate Servant of Endymion to bring out Jackal King before you link into Crowley then you are basically free to run to grab more counters and also thin out your deck a bit more.  There is also one copy of Super Polymerization. From what I understand, most people say to run 3 or none at all, but honestly with this you are drawing into your deck so much that you either get your ideal board of negates or you draw into Super Poly anyways. This is here because I am tired of going against a first turn Dragoon with a mediocre hand. This way, I usually either have a solid hand that can play around Dragoon's negate and then finish my combo to get accesscode or something and just walk over Dragoon anyways, OR I'll have Super Poly and just take him out for Starving Venom.  Speaking of the extra deck, I took out Day-breaker and Bagooska for Starving Venom and Mudragon. I usually will always try to go for Starving Venom, especially against monsters like Dragoon and Borrelend, but if can't, Mudragon is a good way to interrupt plays as well, especially because if I activate its effect to prevent the targeting of a specific attribute, I can actually stop a surprising amount of combos (though usually if they are able to, they will just go into battle phase and walk over your Mudragon-- it still makes them waste a battle phase and saves you from a potential OTK that turn). I also added in Underworld Goddess of the Closed World from Blazing Vortex. This is also just an amazing card to out boss monsters that ""can't be destroyed by card effects/battle and can't be targeted"" (Dragoon/Borrelend/etc.), and she has a pretty nice effect too.  Also just wanted to put it out there because I sometimes forget: but if the opp. has monsters like Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds or Vanity's Ruler, you can use Archfiend Eccentrick to destroy them."

Then you have either marincess pascalus or marincess mandarin for summon marincess crystal heart after summon marincess coral anemone and use its effect to reborn a monster to have two link-2 monster on the field and use them for marincess wonder heart.  then you equip three link monster to your link-4 for raise its attack at 4400 and it would be unaffected by your opponent effect because he was summon with marincess crystal heart.  the only marincess trap you need is marincess wave that is a monster negate and can be activated from the hand if you control a marincess monster link-3 or higher, the other trap and monster are useless and take place for handtrap, backrow extender like sea archiver and kaiju."

It can put out a lord turn 1 with the right cards to have them start with -1  feel free to replace torrential tribute with whatever you want, I find torrential tribute and royal decree the most useful sides, Dark law also pretty good to disrupt...

Dragon link build!! Dragon link stays strong and is still one of the best decks of the format. Some decks like Drytron, Virtual World and Zoo-Eldlich are clearly better but dragon link is not out of the game yet. A mere linkross ban cannot keep this deck from going down tiers. If I were to rank dragon link in the current metagame, I would give it a solid tier 1.5 (Tier 1 would be Drytron, VW and Eldlich). Another thing to consider is that Dragon link Took 1st in the 3v3 LCS 10!! There were more than 300 players participating in this tournament and dragon link still found it’s way to the top (Insert Sam saying “I TOLD YOU!!!” Here). 1st place was taken by Gabriel Netz and his team and this build I have today is inspired off of his build but has differences. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Before Doing the deck explanation, I just wanted to thank everyone here at YGOPROdeck for all the support. This is deck #30 for me and I have already hit over 115,000 total views for my decks here on YGOPROdeck!! To me this means a lot and I feel like it is amazing being able to communicate with so many people. Thanks for the support!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Just a quick reminder that the deck explanation, All the combos and explanations on ways to best use your resources are ALL on my Youtube video. Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me and the channel!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the video - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxoVkis44ng</a></span>  &nbsp;  <b>Changes I am making to my build (compared to my older versions)</b><span> - </span> <ol>  	<li> <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>I am not playing VFD</b><span> - this is not a deck revolving around using VFD as the main negate/win condition. It uses several different kinds of interruptions to disrupt the opponent. It uses specific interruptions designed to counter the top tier decks of the current metagame. For example, Heradic seal and Dragonmaid Tidying are used to bounce back cards to the opponent’s hand - this is an amazing way to counter Zoodiac (very reliant on normal summon) and Virtual world (gets rid of the card targets for the VW monsters) and is also a high impact interruption which can be used to get rid of walls like Dragoon and Final Sigma as well (bounce does not target or destroy) and Number 68 completely exodia obliterates Drytron and is also effective against eldlich and other graveyard reliant decks. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>I am playing a 40 card deck </b><span>- To increase consistency this was needed. This deck is also not playing bricks (except PSY-Driver which does not count) so it is completely ok to play 40 cards because the main reason Dragon link played bricks in the first place was to reduce the risk of drawing bricks, but since this deck plays only 1 brick, it is fine to play 40. The 1st place deck also played 40 cards.</span></li> </ol> </li> </ol> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>I am not running black metal <span>- Again, I needed to make the deck 40 cards and there wasn’t space for this. Also, since decks like Drytron are in the metagame, the popularity of skull mister is gone up and Black metal is a skull mister target. I just felt like Seyfert and Chaos space were more than enough. Seyfert and space also have the protection of GAMMA.</span></b></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">I am running Chamber Dragonmaid and Dragonmaid Tidying <span>- This was because Tidying is such a strong trap and is very high impact. Chamber can serve as the normal summon and since the deck just plays so many extenders, the deck can afford to play Chamber as a normal summon instead of something like seyfert. Normal summoning Chamber is better than normal summoning something like rokket tracer. Chamber can also be summoned off of elpy if not drawn. Tidying also serves as a monster reborn for the following turn and that will allow chamber to search another tidying if you need to play the grind game.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <b>Composition of the deck</b><span> -</span>  &nbsp; <table>  <tr> <td><b>Starters </b><span>(cards you usually normal summon to get the combo going - there are ones that do not require the normal summon but almost all the starters get you into a romulus)</span></td> <td><span>For starters (get it? Starters? Nvm) I am playing 3 Chamber Dragonmaid, 3 Seyfert, 3 Chaos Space, 1 Black Dragon and 1 White Dragon. Chamber does not get you into a romulus and requires an extra extender to work with but is a great card since it increases the disruptions on the endboard by 1 in the form of a very high impact trap card - Dragonmaid tidying. This is well worth the extender and chamber is also something’s summoned off of elpy. Seyfert and chaos space (the best starter) are to search the chaos dragons and can be protected from ash blossom with gamma. If one of the chaos dragons are drawn, with any normal summon of the other attribute (light or dark) it is basically a starter on its own. Chaos space can also search lavineer and if you manage to not banish seyfert, you can even mill lavineer with ravine, use seyfert to add back lavineer and search anything else with Brotaur!!</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Extenders</b><span> (cards that extend your plays and help if you get hit with handtraps)</span></td> <td><span>The extenders are - 3 Quick launch, 3 World Legacy, 3 Noctovision, 1 brotar and 1 Lavineer. No explanation needed for those, all of those will help you extend plays.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Combo extenders </b><span>(cards that extend your combo, put up additional disruptions and are good to see in hand but cannot help you if you get handtrapped in most cases)</span></td> <td><span>They are - 3 Tracer, 2 synchron, 1 recharger, 1 absorouter and 2 Tidying. All of these cards help your plays and combos in setting additional interruptions - watch my video for knowing how these help the combo, you need to actually know the combo to understand why these cards help.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Handtraps</b></td> <td><span>I am running 3 ash and 3 gamma, very self explanatory.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Soft Bricks</b></td> <td><span>They are (one each) PSY-Driver, Boot Sector and Dragon Ravine. Soft bricks simply mean a -1, nothing too dangerous.</span></td> </tr>  </table> &nbsp;  <b>Cards in this deck that counter the current meta </b><span>-</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Notice that cards from the side deck are also included. The stuff in parenthesis is what the card counters in that deck, if there is no parenthesis, it means it counters the deck in general. Ash is not in this list since it counters literally everything. Basic interruptions such as seal, savage, and tidying are not mentioned unless they specifically counter a certain deck - they also counter literally anything but I choose not to add them in. And yes Tri-brigade and rocks are meta now. </span>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Drytron</b><span> - number 68 (hardcounter), droll (hardcounter), nibiru, droplet (ruler and ultimateness)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Eldlich</b><span> - hfd and cosmic cyclone (backrow removal), lancea (side deck), lavineer (can pop backrow), unchained (pops) and basic removal cards, number 68</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Zoodiac</b><span> (all to counter zeus) - dinowrestler, kaijus, nibiru, droplet, tidying and seal (zoo is very relient on normal summon)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Virtual World</b><span> - droplet (VFD and shenshen), gamma(VFD), cosmic cyclone (banishes chuche - makes them unable to combo), nibiru (not always useful since number 75 is in VW), seal and tidying (get rid of the targets for the VW monsters), kaiju (shenshen), dinowrestler (shenshen), droll, lancea </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Bird up!

It is definitely not the best deck or anything, in my opinion Drytron, Virtual World and Eldlich outrank it (tier 1 decks) but Dragon link is still a great meta choice. If you want to win more, I would recommend playing one of the other 3 decks but Dragon link can also win duels - just that the other 3 decks are a little better. If you are like me you would play dragon link anyway!! The deck can easily go anti meta and fares fairly well against the top 3 meta contenders but loses easily to NIBIRU. I think in the end it all comes down to how familiar you are with the deck, if you are confident and familiar with this deck - I saw go for it beat all the other meta contenders and show them who’s on top!!! Dragon link best deck lets goooo!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Just a quick reminder that the deck explanation, All the combos and explanations on ways to best use your resources are ALL on my Youtube video.

So how does this deck achieve it's goal? devote the entire thing to specialing zombie monsters. What archetype can shit out zombie monsters like it's nobody's business? Mayakashi, specifically the synchro cards + Dakki. Dakki is a tuner that special summons itself from the graveyard when used for a synchro summon. but with practically no protection that either of these cards have, this is where Zombie World comes in. You see, Bone Tower doesn't specify YOU summoning a zombie monster, but EITHER PLAYER. Zombie World, the field spell that turns every monster on both fields and graveyards zombie type essentially limits how many summons your opponent can do before milling their entire deck themselves."

DESTROY THE CITY TO SAVE THE CITY!!!  There is not much to say, it is a strange and perhaps unnecessary combination but hey I thought about it because of the concept of Kaijus vs Heros and in the end hey it works it is not spectacular but it works, you have fun and you confuse people.  <strong>KAIJUS</strong>  <strong>Big boys: </strong>Thunder King and Dogoran are normally used to summon them and kick butts or to save the little ones and their negations  <strong>Little boys: </strong>Gameciel and Kumongous easily tribute enemys or you can keep them and have a negation (HERO has no negations :1)  <strong>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber: </strong>You all know the power of this card, you take away the easy field, you settle in with the Kaijus you want and also look for the next turn  <strong>Kyoutou Waterfront:</strong> Needed on anything Kaiju based  <strong>HERO!!!</strong>  <strong>Well I promise to do this, I think that an explanation of everything HERO is unnecessary since I think it is common knowledge to know how they work and if not, they are tremendously intuitive</strong>  <strong>Honest Neos: </strong>Extra ATK  <strong>Malicious:</strong> Go easy to GY and look for another  <strong>Faris-Vyon-Increase: </strong>Easy Combo just with Faris in hand  <strong>Adusted: </strong>Searchable search engine  <strong>Stratos: </strong>Incredibly good card from HERO  <strong>Liquid Soldier: </strong>Good draw ability, in addition to being part of Absolute Zero  <strong>Solid Soldier: </strong>Extra Body  <strong>Shadow Mist: </strong>Great card, can search in any sense  <strong>Emergency Call: </strong>Search for any Elemental (Usually Stratos)  <strong>Dark Calling: </strong>Summon Malicious Bane  <strong>Miracle Fusion: </strong>Sunrise card, in addition to summoning Zero normally  <strong>Mask Change: </strong>Access to all Masked HERO  <strong>Malicious Bane:</strong> Adusted makes him so easy to summon and he's also a monster of destruction.  <strong>Escuridao:</strong> Take off dark stuff  <strong>Absolute Zero:</strong> He is a great hero, easy to summon, destroys field  <strong>Trinity:</strong> He win games  <strong>Sunrise:</strong> Help your heroes, look for Miracle Fusion and it is also easy to summon  <strong>Masked Acid:</strong> Combo with Absolute Zero to clean field  <strong>Masked Dark Law</strong>: One of the best Heroes  <strong>Masked Blast:</strong> Something niche but it works many times  <strong>Xtra Dread Decimator:</strong> Although it may not seem like it, it is easy to summon, in addition to helping the OTK  <strong>Xtra Wonder Driver:</strong> Extend combos  <strong>Xtra Cross Crusader</strong>: With malicious it is easy to invoke in addition to looking for any necessary HERO  <strong>Other Things</strong>  <strong>Triple Tactics: </strong>Very good versatility  <strong>Polymerization: </strong>Vyon card  <strong>Reinforcement: </strong>ROTA  <strong>Terraforming: </strong>Search the kaiju field  <strong>Reborn: </strong>Super Staple  <strong>Exciton Knight: </strong>It's not necessary at all, I just like it :)  <strong>Unicorn and Phoenix: </strong>Best Generic Links  <strong>Other Options</strong>  <strong>Kaiju:</strong> Jizukiru is a good Big Boy and Anti-Kaiju makes the deck even more Kaiju  <strong>Destiny:</strong> Destiny Fusion + Drawhand + Malicious = Dystopia, is a good combo unfortunately you can only play dark, which breaks all this but hey, if you like it you can add Radian to help... oh and Dynatag helps... sometimes  <strong>HERO:</strong> Dian helps Solid Soldier to stand out, in addition to perhaps increasing the copies of him, Favorite Hero synergizes well with the deck through the kaiju field, but in the end I did not like it, although it is a very good option, Form Change to greedy plays  <strong>Super Poly:</strong> The Superpoly Engine is quite good although I am still not convinced  <strong>Staples:</strong> Called is hell of a card and Droplet helps OTK or negations normally  <strong>Thing you should Know</strong>  Think well which Kaiju you want to use to tribute and which one to keep, this could decide the.  Normally Wonder Driver is in most HERO recipes, because it is quite good but if you are not a great HERO player or a great combo planner you will hardly ever use it so in that case it would be fine to change it  Speaking more of the other options, the Superpoly Engine is seriously good, it fits good with the deck and it can also make the Kaijus take advantage even when you gave them to the rival, on the other hand Favorite HERO is great on the deck I mean it with the field, with the other attack that is very good,only that something in me does not finish seeing it, even so I think that the indicated thing would be to be able to the card in the deck to 2 copies.  <strong>Upcoming decks?</strong>  <strong>Abhyss:</strong> Well maybe I lied about the sphinx, in the end I did not like it but haha memories instead this new archetype of Reptiles... well I will only say that in this one if I have a couple of ideas.  <strong>Galaxy Control:</strong> It sounds crazy but when I saw some cards of the archetype I liked the idea, even so I continue in that because of my low knowledge of the archetype (By the way I think that more than Galaxy is Photon, what should i call the deck?)  <strong>True Draco Crystal:</strong> I continue with the idea of the Deck, it is already done but its a little lazy even so, the most probably thing is that I will upload it soon.  <strong>Remake of the Best Fusion Deck:</strong> Well, the Remake goes there, the bad thing is that it doesn't really add anything good, but that's fine, it's not like I have to change the deck completely. The important thing is to bring it back and explain why is a good deck.  &nbsp;  If you would like to see one of this deck, dont forget to comment and share"

Other Tech Cards for this Deck are one copie of <em>""Rose Girl""</em> (free summon you can use for Link/XYZ/Synchro summons or as a fodder for <em>""Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy""</em> or <em>""Aromaseraphy Jasmin""</em>), two <em>""Rose Lover""</em> (mainly for Link/XYZ/Synchro summon and will help you special summon from hand) and three <em>""Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood""</em> (a handtrap many players dont even realize exists which helps you gain an LP advantage for your own effects).  <em>""Aromage Bergamot""</em> + <em>""Teardrop the Rikka Queen""</em> + <em>""Aromaseraphy Rosemary""</em> for the offensive.  Other Tech Cards I am still experimenting with are: <em>""Copy Plant""</em>, <em>""One for One""</em>,<em> ""Gigaplant""</em>, <em>""Fairy Archer Ingunar""</em>, <em>""Solemn Warning/Judgement""</em>.  &nbsp;  Edit: I am aware that ""Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light"" is a must have for any plant based strategie but since I try to develop this deck on a budget I havent included her.

Its the reason why this archtype became a fan favorite since its launch. You can play controll, stun, combo, 40 cards, 60 cards. Throw pots in, or throw them out ones you see that there is no money left after buying 3 Hospitality. Orrrr you are here for the waifus. Hey I dont judge, aslong as we agree that Drident is best maid.  Lets go over it card by card and talk about the goal we have with this deck.  The dragonmaid core :  3 Chamber : Searches you the fusion spell, hospi to extend, tidying to extend if you have ravine or to set for controll. She is one of the 1 card sphere maker and what is really important, she is the only one able to summon the fusion maids from grave at the start of the bp.  3 Parlor : Basically works the same as chamber and does almost all the same. Only difference she can send tidying directly for combo, but cant gets its controll eff. However if you already have extender in hand she is a good way to get nurse or any other maid you may need later to grave. Also a 1 card sphere  1 Kitchen : Just a free monster send or if you are lucky and have a big maid in hand which bricks you, also another way to get a new starter like chamber or parlor to hand. Sometimes you may hear a bell ring that you should play none. But look at her and tell me you dont want to have atleast one around.  1 Nurse : She is one of the cards holding the deck together. Overworked nurses are sadly also part in a fantasy card game, thats why you want to use her every turn to extend and summon more maids. She is basically a flat +1 or +2 everytime you summon her ones the grave is set.  2 Changeover : Your fusion spell to go into the gem of the deck Dragonmaid Sheou/Strahl, or House when you are lead down the dark path of VFD. Important to remember for the gy effect, even if the target leaves the board, you still add changeover to hand.  3 Hospitality : Probably one of the most broken extender to ever be printed. Set up your grave, non target summon from hand and gy. Searchable and one activation a turn no use. Sadly the price tag is justified, but dont buy it if you can avoid. Dont let people sky rock the price and gate people out. the reprint is coming !  3 Tidiyng : Looping cards back to hand and in best case triggering your House is always good, but non target summon from hand or gy in etiher players turn while being searchable by two cards ? This card should be the 40$ one~  &nbsp;  Rokket :  2 Tracer : Its tracer, it summons another rokket for a free Chaos ruler or Savage Dragon, and can be summoned by quick launch. Yeah, I dont know how quick launch and this can exist at the same time.  2 Absoruter : As we play Ravine we love discarding things that also give us free cards back so this card is already good for us, but it can also work as a mini noctovision dragon if we have a rokket on board. Dragon, free summon and search? Sign me up  1 Silver : Wont come up often but the banish eff can be nice  1 Recharger : target for quicklaunch and tracer, but also can work with striker dragon eff to recycle a tracer back to hand and summon 2 of boot sector <ol>  	<li>Boot Sector : Summon striker, search this spam rokkets. Simple</li> </ol> Dragons :  Noctovision : Make striker = free summon. Simple. gives you a extra draw and protects your set tidying when in grave, this card is basically a dragonmaid. Since its release its been probably the most played card which isnt part of the archtype.  Odd-eyes : High level dragon for fusion, which can search Emperor who we talk about in a bit. Can also summon fusion Monster from grave, and in 1 of a Million, can set up a pendulum scale. Its fun to use but can be cut.  Emperor : Recycles your banished dragons , is a high level dragon for fusion and can nuke the board in emergencys when you need non target removal. If you cut odd-eyes also cut this one  3 Nibiru : Big rock vs combo deck go token  3Gamma and 1 Driver : One of the strongest hand traps in the game with only little downside. You can use it to stop the opponent of going full combo or you can use it in your turn to protect a search spell / stop vfd / Zexel. And if you can do it in your turn you also get a free Chaos ruler. I see that as a absolute win.  1 Miradora : Situational and not to good currently. But we can search it of Tempest + its a high level dragon for fusion.  1 Dragons Ravine : Search of Romulus and dumb extender and send extender.  1 Tempest 1 Gold Sako : Simple combo to search Miradora or Parlor  All in all this deck is just learning which card leads to which combo, but the end board you should aim for is usually Sphere + Sheou or ones you know the cards a little better you can end on  Borrel Savage + Sphere + Sheou + Rampage/ Vfd  If wanted I can later add a few replays to show combos and how the deck performs against meta / ranked on DB"

It's sooooo budget, but you can extend it by adding <a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World.</a>  Here I will show you the 2 main combos for the strategy. The first combo is only by having <a data-name=""Unchained Twins - Aruha"">Unchained Twins - Aruha</a> and any Unchained spell/trap  - the set card is destroyed and you special summon <a data-name=""Aruha"">Aruha</a> - you trigger the set card's floating effect to special summon <a data-name=""Unchained Twins - Sarama"">Unchained Twins - Sarama</a> from your deck - use <a data-name=""Sarama"">Sarama</a>'s effect, targeting the spell/trap in your GY - that card is set to your field then you destroy <a data-name=""Sarama"">Sarama</a> - Sarama's floating effect special summons <a data-name=""Abominable Unchained Soul"">Abominable Unchained Soul </a>(you can trigger it's effect if you want) - link the 2 monsters you have on the field into <a data-name=""Unchained Soul of Rage"">Unchained Soul of Rage</a>  Now you have a Link-2 monster on your field, who can link itself with an opponents monster during their Main Phase.

The whole point in this deck is to get out 3 negates and possibly a disruption. Only down side is no ""monster reborn"" or ""pot of aiverice"" during that time (April 11, 2016 banlist/format)/ With a multitude of combo-lines, adaptability, consistency, and low investments for high rewards; synchrons are full of fair yet broken plays and boards that (for the time) was really hard to out. Making a Quasar and maybe even another piece of interaction, to outright mind gaming your opponent with 1 hand trap (Maxx ""C"") made some games not even last past turn 1. This deck is my personal build I played with for my locals in my area at the time. I was considered a degenerate player for summoning 4 negates at one point. In this deck, you will find a somewhat irregular choice of main deck, extra and even side which was crafted to take on what I was dueling against on a regular basis where I was. Over all, this is a casual deck, that loves negations and hates being graveyard locked. Your game-plan is a tad linear with almost all your combos starting the same exact way and is easily telegraphed. In modern time, this deck would need to chew through multi-negates, disruptions and even possibly a Nibiru. This deck is not to be taken overly seriously, but on a casual level with friends, could fetch you a game or two."

This is a total casual build (<a data-name=""Spellbook of Judgment"">Spellbook of Judgment</a> is banned for a reason), made for fun and intent to use for fun, I’m not responsible for any friendship lost by this deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Witchcrafter,  Artificers of magic!!</i></b></span>  <span>The Witchcrafter archetype is adorable in all artwork that is presented, linking the lore of the spellcaster universe ( Endymion, Spellbook, Invokeds), making a third force to  balance power between them. They don't store knowledge like  Prophecy-Spellbook or  use knowledge for power and war like Endymion, instead they use for  (like the name says) craft magic artefacts  that which one of the Witchcrafter are responsible for one process (pottery , glass, jewelry, etc).

Their primary goal is to use their banishing effects combined with zombies inherent graveyard synergy to OTK the opponent. This Variant opts to go second to take advantage of shiranui’s OTK playstyle and use powerful cards such as <a data-name=""Ghost Meets Girl – A Shiranui’s Story"">Ghost Meets Girl – A Shiranui’s Story</a> and the new <a data-name=""Laval Salamander"">Laval Salamander</a>. The deck also uses A small Shaddoll engine as a method to send cards such as <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a>, <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a>, or a Shiranui combo piece to grave.  <strong>Extenders</strong>  General Advice for playing the deck can be given as follows: Make <a data-name=""Lavalval Salamander"">Lavalval Salamander</a> as often as possible ass he is both the decks best extender and functions as removal. Hold the effects that lock you into summoning only zombies until as late into the combo as possible (ie: <a data-name=""Ghost Meets Girl – A Shiranui’s Story"">Ghost Meets Girl – A Shiranui’s Story</a>, <a data-name=""Shiranui Spectralsword Shade"">Shiranui Spectralsword Shade</a>, <a data-name=""Shiranui Squire"">Shiranui Squire</a>).  <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a> is an extra spell that lets you set up combos and give your cards protection. By sending <a data-name=""Shaddoll Hedgehog"">Shaddoll Hedgehog</a> and <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a> to grave you can summon <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a> which can convert a spell resolving to a free monster negate and draw with an extender in grave.  The most basic Shiranui Play is to summon <a data-name=""Shiranui Solitare"">Shiranui Solitare</a>, Tribute Solitare, summon <a data-name=""Uni-Zombie"">Uni-Zombie</a> use <a data-name=""Uni-Zombie"">Uni-Zombie</a> to send<a data-name=""Mezuki""> Mezuki</a> to the graveyard banish <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a> from the graveyard to summon back <a data-name=""Shiranui Solitare"">Shiranui Solitare</a> from the grave. Then use the two monsters to make a level 8 or 7 synchro. This is the core combo for a lot of other Shiranui combos and this combo is used in ost zombie decks.  <a data-name=""Shiranui Spiritmaster"">Shiranui Spiritmaster</a> provides an additional special summon to get out more shiranui’s on board, but more importantly it provides a banishing outlet for what ever you special summon using its effect. For example, if you summon <a data-name=""Shiranui Solitare"">Shiranui Solitare</a> off of <a data-name=""Shiranui Spiritmaster’s"">Shiranui Spiritmaster’s</a> effect you can perform the basic <a data-name=""Shiranui Solitare"">Shiranui Solitare</a> combo tributing <a data-name=""Shiranui Spiritmaster"">Shiranui Spiritmaster</a> instead to have <a data-name=""Shiranui Solitare"">Shiranui Solitare</a>’s when banished effect live for later.  <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a> is one of the best combo extenders. He can be sent off of <a data-name=""Uni-zombie"">Uni-zombie</a> to banish a zombie in grave to summon a zombie in hand, while also functioning as a Uni-zombie on field.  <a data-name=""Shiranui Spectral Shade"">Shiranui Spectral Shade</a> is a final extender as it locks you into zombies but provides insane recursion.  Fun to note <a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus </a>triggers any Shiranui’s banish effect. It can be a destroy one, Summon a banished or a draw one discard one.  <strong>The Math and Consistency</strong>  73.57% chance to open at least one handtrap.  82.00% for at least one starter and extender  ~93.54% chance for at least one starter  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  The relevant Shiranui Package consists of <a data-name=""Shiranui Sunsaga"">Shiranui Sunsaga</a>,<a data-name=""Shiranui Shogunsaga""> Shiranui Shogunsaga</a>, <a data-name=""Shiranui Squiresaga"">Shiranui Squiresaga</a>, and last and least<a data-name=""Shiranui Samuraisaga""> Shiranui Samuraisaga</a>. <a data-name=""Shiranui Shogunsaga"">Shiranui Shogunsaga</a> and <a data-name=""Shiranui Squiresaga"">Shiranui Squiresaga</a> are the two main OTK Enablers and extenders, both banish a card to gain attack. <a data-name=""Shiranui Sunsaga"">Shiranui Sunsaga</a>, lets you reset your banished or in grave zombie synchro monsters for some removal while grandting protection. <a data-name=""Shiranui Samuaisaga"">Shiranui Samuaisaga</a> is only run as a target for <a data-name=""Shiranui Spectralsword"">Shiranui Spectralsword</a>, its not good and should only be used as a forced steppingstone. This package lets the player grind out games as the Shiranui engine loops itself very well.  <a data-name=""Lavalval Salamander"">Lavalval Salamander</a> is insane Shiranui support and you can’t convince me otherwise. He draws you two cards and then puts two in grave. He banishes your Shiranui monsters in grave for removal.  The other synchro monsters and XYZ monsters are situational tools. <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> is for spell and trap removal. <a data-name=""Psy-framelord Omega"">Psy-framelord Omega</a> is crazy in grindy games. <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a> is a backup plan for going first. Lastly, <a data-name=""Beelze of the Diabolic Dragon"">Beelze of the Diabolic Dragon</a> is a great pressure tool for decks that struggle with non-destruction removal.  The zombie link package is mostly for extending off of cards such as <a data-name=""Shiranui Spectralsword Shade"">Shiranui Spectralsword Shade</a> and <a data-name=""Shiranui Squire"">Shiranui Squire</a>. Its also generic link value for zombies. The Shaddoll extra deck package just covers all the possible options for what you could need. <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a> is the recommended choice.  <strong>Side Deck</strong>  <strong>            </strong>Ironically the side deck is mostly used for going first. <a data-name=""Shiranui Style Swallow’s Slash"">Shiranui Style Swallow’s Slash</a> is an insane stuttered pop 3 that can mess with your opponent’s timings. By destroying two then banishing <a data-name=""Shiranui Spiritmaster"">Shiranui Spiritmaster</a> to pop another, your opponent can be left at severe disadvantage. <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a> helps get <a data-name=""Shiranui Style Swallow’s Slash"">Shiranui Style Swallow’s Slash</a><a data-name=""Shiranui Style Swallow’s Slash""> out but can also get </a><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a><a data-name=""Shiranui Style Swallow’s Slash"">.</a> <a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos</a> and <a data-name=""Dimensional Fissure"">Dimensional Fissure</a> might seem counter intuitive but if they are used after you set up going first they have little effect on you compared to the dramatic stun effect they have on the opponent. <a data-name=""Psy-framelord Omega"">Psy-framelord Omega</a> is crazy here. <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> works similarly.  <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> helps control combo decks. <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> stops Trap decks. <a data-name=""Harpies Feather Duste"">Harpies Feather Duste</a>r helps stop backrow deck. <a data-name=""Called by the Grav"">Called by the Grav</a>e helps stop handtraps going first.  &nbsp;"

The deck functionally goes first since <strong>Stardust</strong> has many options to put up negates nowadays. You can get a pretty good endboard with a two card combo of just <strong>Junk Converter</strong> and <strong>Stardust Synchron</strong>. But you will get more out of it if you have <strong>Doppelwarrior </strong>as well.  Main Deck includes 3 <strong>Ash Blossom</strong>, 3 <strong>Quickdraw Synchron</strong>, 3 <strong>Stardust Synchron</strong>, 1 <strong>Stardust Trail</strong>, 3 <strong>Junk Synchron</strong>, 3<strong> Junk Converter</strong>, 3 <strong>Doppelwarrior</strong>, 1 <strong>Stardust Xiaolong</strong>, and 1 <strong>Wish-Converging Dragon</strong>. <strong>Quickdraw Synchron</strong> is just <strong>Tzolkin</strong> fodder and I guess you can use it as a target for <strong>Shooting Riser Dragon</strong> if you decide to play things like <strong>Shooting Star Dragon</strong>, <strong>Stardust Warrior</strong>, or <strong>Satellite Warrior</strong>. <strong>Stardust Synchron</strong> is a level 4 <strong>Synchron</strong> tuner which is very good already and it searches basically most of your much needed Spells/Traps, but its sad that it doesn't search <strong>Synchro Chase</strong> but that is understandable. If you discard it off of <strong>Converter</strong>, its essentially a free extender from grave.<strong> Stardust Trail</strong> is a decent card since it is a level 4 extender, but its the primary target for <strong>Stardust Illuminate</strong> other than <strong>Xiaolong</strong>. <strong>Junk Synchron</strong> is bonkers of course. <strong>Junk Converter</strong> is grave set-up, a searcher, and it gives you an extender. <strong>Doppelwarrior</strong> is just here since it makes tokens. <strong>Xiaolong</strong> is another<strong> Illuminate</strong> target. <strong>Wish-Converging Dragon</strong> gets you to <strong>Majestic Star</strong> and <strong>Shooting Majestic Star</strong>.  Spells and Traps aren't surprising. 3 <strong>Tuning</strong>. 3 <strong>Stardust Illuminate</strong> which is a <strong>Foolish</strong> and level modulation. 3 <strong>Synchro Chase</strong> since it makes sure your effects go through. 1 <strong>ROTA</strong>. 1 <strong>Reborn</strong>. 3 <strong>Arriving Miracle</strong> which is just to get you to your <strong>Majestic</strong> monsters. 1 <strong>Called By</strong> since every play in this deck is just asking to be handtrapped. 2 <strong>TTT</strong> for the same reason. 1 <strong>Black Garden </strong>to either go with <strong>Garden Rose Maiden</strong> or <strong>Garden Rose Flora</strong>. Finally, 1 <strong>Majestic Mirage</strong> since it essentially makes your <strong>Shooting Majestic Star Dragon</strong>'s 1 negate into 3 interruptions.  Extra Deck. 1 <strong>Ultimaya Tzolkin</strong> since it brings out either <strong>Moonlight</strong> or <strong>Crystal Wing</strong>. 2 <strong>Shooting Majestic Star Dragon</strong> which is an interruption going first and your OTK enabler going second. 1<strong> Blood Rose Dragon</strong> since its a thing going second or you can take something like 1 of your <strong>Junk Speeder</strong>s out and replace it with a normal <strong>Black Rose Dragon</strong> to use <strong>Blood Rose</strong>'s second effect as another form of disruption probably. 1 <strong>Majestic Star Dragon</strong> which is just insane and it doesn't need to return to the ED if you have <strong>Arriving Miracle</strong> face-up. 1 <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong> and 1 <strong>Blackrose Moonlight Dragon</strong> as <strong>Tzolkin targets</strong>. 1 of the original <strong>Stardust Dragon</strong> and 1 <strong>Stardust Spark Dragon</strong>. 1 <strong>Stardust Charge Warrior</strong>. 1 <strong>T.G. Hyper Librarian</strong>. 2 <strong>Junk Speeder</strong>. 1 <strong>Garden Rose Flora</strong> which is just <strong>Tzolkin</strong> fodder and a thing for <strong>Blood Rose</strong>, but you can switch it for <strong>Accel Synchron</strong> if you value the level modulation. Finally, 1 <strong>Garden Rose Maiden</strong> which is more <strong>Tzolkin</strong> fodder and it revives a Dragon Synchro from grave. It also searches <strong>Black Garden</strong> which can be used as an extender of sorts.  Side Deck is meh. 2 <strong>Nibiru</strong>. 3 <strong>Belle</strong>. 3 <strong>Majestic Absorption</strong> which is really only here for the equip effect going second. 3 <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>. 2 <strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong>. 2 <strong>Starlight Road</strong> because its a<strong> Stardust</strong> deck so why not."

However by itself it does much less, and also you have to hard draw more pieces of the majestic support to get that combo going  Dragon link is not really using the support so I don't like it.  Different speeder, in my opinion might be the better way to approach it. The goal of my deck is end on a few monsters that interupt your opponent but come back after their turn so that you can reccur advantage. Different speeder focuses much more on turboing negates to the field and opressing your opponent so they can't even put you behind. Those decks generally use <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a>, <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a>, etc. You can add some of those elements to this deck by adding <a data-name=""Quickdraw Synchron"">Quickdraw Synchron, tzolkin, and abyss, and probably take out </a><a data-name=""Double Star Shaman"">Double Star Shaman</a> and <a data-name=""Cosmic Blazar Dragon"">Cosmic Blazar Dragon.</a>  But without further ado, my approach. Buckle up, it's a long ride.  There are several branches, so I will talk about the main combos the deck has.  First of all the keystone of the deck, <a data-name=""Junk Speeder"">Junk Speeder</a>.  The easiest way to summon it is with <a data-name=""Junk Synchron "">Junk Synchron and a lv 2 in grave (setup by </a><a data-name=""Junk Converter"">Junk Converter</a><a data-name=""Junk Synchron "">) or sometimes </a><a data-name=""Synchron Carrier"">Synchron Carrier + Junk Synchron or Synchron Carrier + </a><a data-name=""Cyberse Synchron"">Cyberse Synchron (cyberse synchron effect on carrier)</a>  I will cover the other easiest way to setup the first lv 2 in grave later.  &nbsp;  NOTE: Always have a monster in the EMZ if you can, it saves space  But essentially with speeder you summon every card you can (Cyberse, <a data-name=""Satellite Synchron"">Satellite Synchron</a>, Junk, Stardust)  And then <a data-name=""Stardust Synchron"">Stardust Synchron can get its search based on what is in your hand right now (In order of importance you search </a><a data-name=""Arriving Miracle"">Arriving Miracle, </a><a data-name=""Majestic Mirage"">Majestic Mirage, </a><a data-name=""Stardust Illuminate"">Stardust Illuminate</a><a data-name=""Majestic Mirage"">, </a><a data-name=""Majestic Absorption"">Majestic Absorption</a><a data-name=""Stardust Synchron"">) - only search absorption if you need to out a card or are going for game</a>  &nbsp;  Assuming you have nothing good in hand, stardust synchron searches arriving  Activate the arriving and stack <a data-name=""wish-converging dragon"">wish-converging dragon</a>  Next, synchro summon <a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon with Junk speeder, stardust synchron, satellite, and cyberse (5+4+2+1=12)</a>  Arriving draws a card, special summoning wish-converging who can special summon <a data-name=""Omni Dragon Brotaur"">Omni Dragon Brotaur</a>  Upon special summoning, Brotaur uses its effect to discard a card, targeting wish converging, add <a data-name=""Stardust Trail"">Stardust Trail </a>  Use stardust synchron in grave to tribute junk synchron  Use trail in hand to special itself  Synchro <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a> with trail and stardust synchron  Trail summons a token here  Summon <a data-name=""Shooting Majestic Star Dragon"">Shooting Majestic Star Dragon using the token, brotaur, wish-converging, and stardust</a>  &nbsp;  Thus your end board is 1 negate and 1 board wipe  &nbsp;  Now how does this get better?  Firstly if you used converter for the setup and used illuminate already to send trail to the graveyard  Converter can special summon junk synchron from the grave after you summon junk speeder  When your field consists of Red Supernova Dragon, Stardust Dragon, token, wish-converging, brotaur, and junk synchron (extra from converter)  Banish illuminate from grave to increase stardust dragon's lv by 1  Summon shooting majestic with Stardust, token, wish-converging  Summon <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light with brotaur and junk synchron</a>  Now we got 2 negates and a board wipe!  Note: If you didn't use illuminate, instead of banishing illuminate, continue with the combo as normal, but instead of shooting majestic star, summon normal <a data-name=""Majestic Star Dragon"">Majestic Star Dragon using the token, stardust dragon, and wish converging, then you can summon herald with brotaur and junk synchron</a>  &nbsp;  Now time for that other way to setup the lv 2  The obvious sore thumb in this decklist is <a data-name=""petite dragon"">petite dragon</a> right?  Now comes its use, if you opened junk synchron + <a data-name=""dragon shrine"">dragon shrine you can do the same as the non illuminate variation of the above combo by</a>  Activating <a data-name=""Dragon Shrine"">Dragon Shrine  (send petite dragon first, </a><a data-name=""guardragon promineses"">guardragon promineses second</a><a data-name=""Dragon Shrine"">)</a>  Normal summon junk synchron, special petite dragon  Summon speeder with the two cards  Speeder chain link 1, Guardragon chainlink 2  Summon all the tuners from deck (search arriving)  Use arriving to stack wish-converging  Summon supernova with stardust synchron, satellite, speeder, cyberse  Draw with arriving (use wish-converging to summon brotaur, use brotaur on wish-converging to search trail)  Stardust Synchron tributes guardragon  Trail specials from hand  Summon stardust dragon with trail and stardust synchron (trail summons a token)  Summon normal majestic star with Stardust, token, wish-converging  Summon herald with junk synchron and broataur  (Once again, having used illuminate means you can increase stardust dragon's level by 1 and can summon shooting majestic instaed of normal majestic)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Of course if you really want to have the shooting majestic, you can summon it with stardust, token, brotaur, and wish-converging instead of having normal majestic star + herald  &nbsp;  I think I should note incase someone doesnt know, Majestic Mirrage lets normal majestic star and shooting majestic star not be once per turn, so it is really good with shooting majestic because it keeps on coming back, but normal majestic star tributes itself permenantly, so after negating once you have to decide if it is worth negating and giving it up permanently  &nbsp;  There are many other paths this deck can go down but those are the main things you should keep lines you should keep in mind  HALP I GOT HANDTRAPPED:  Bait out hand traps with your searchers  Hope you have <a data-name=""crossout designator"">crossout designator, also add the handtraps you are scared of, I only have ash</a>  Also, if they stop speeder, you can still do the shooting majestic star combo by tributing speeder for stardust synchron and using trail  However, converter can chainblock for speeder to help protect from ash  Veiler/Imperm on Junk Synchron or Junk Speeder can be cirucmvented with the majestic combo  If you made Speeder with converter and they veiler/imperm speeder, converter summoning back junk synchron lets you go into crystal wing  &nbsp;  Why are you playing 43 cards git good:  I really should, once again this deck is a wip and I haven't decided which 3 cards to cut  &nbsp;  Why is your side deck so weird:  These are just cards I considered playing, not an actual side deck, put in cards you feel  are necessary  &nbsp;  Where is doppelwarrior:  If you are playing the other speeder variant it is probably more needed, but for me it was more of a brick. Whenever I could use its effect it didn't improve my end board by that much.  &nbsp;  Why is the extra bad:  I started with the base of a synchro deck I had from before jet synchro was banned, so it had some combos based on that. The cards in the extra I would recommend replacing if you want to change stuff up are:  Double star shaman  Martial Metal Marcher  T.G. Hyper Librarian ?  Stardust charge warrior  Satellite warrior  Cosmic Blazar Dragon  (That's a worryingly large amount of carsd in retrospect)  &nbsp;  Please let me know if you have any comments, any advice is appreciated!"

Just as good going second as it is going first. ,"Open Fraktall for Simorgh Lock. Use your other 4 cards to make linkuriboh or double dragon lord to protect the barrier statue. You can often also get out Abyss Dweller to make the first turn lock stronger Everything else is free value. You can often play through 3 interruptions (say Ash, Imperm, and Ghost Belle). If you lock your opponent out first turn with barrier statue, you should be able to do lethal if not close to it by the following turn. There are a lot of moving pieces with some interesting chain blocks so the interactions are interesting and the deck's grind game is very good.  One of the best parts is the revolt, which I think is extremely underrated. Use it to bring back nervall, kit, and any of the lower links (usually at least Ferrjit) to link summon Shuraig. This lets you non-target banish, search a tri-brigade, send a tri-brigade, and cycle a card in hand, all off of 1 card. If that doesn't sound too good, note that this comes up very often."

(Dupe frog can ""miss the timing,"" making some effects not allow Dupe Frog to activate at all.)  -Toadally Awesome is at 3 now. You don't have to bounce Toadally back to the Extra Deck after it leaves the field *every* time anymore. Try bouncing Swap Frog back when Toadally Awesome leaves to load your graveyard up with Ronintoadins and Frogs, which you can use to summon more Toadally Awesome's  -Use Sea Lancer to bring your banished frogs back to the field as equip spells. Link summon something using Sea Lancer as material to return these frogs to the graveyard, where Ronintoadin can banish them to special summon itself repeatedly.  -Avoid banishing Swap Frog from your graveyard for Ronintoadin's effect without either a Sea Lancer in your hand to return monsters to your graveyard from the banish zone or unless you really need a frog on the field.  -Transmodify will let you get Swap Frog on the field by sacrificing a level 1 Water/Aqua monster on the field to the graveyard. Using a level 2 Aqua/Water Monster (most frogs), It will also allow you to Special Summon Glacial Beast Polar Penguin, activating its exceedingly rude field removal effect (back to hand), Gora Turtle, which stops anyone from attacking with anything higher than 1900 ATK, or Graydle Alligator, which, when Destroyed by either Spell or Battle, allows you to take control of an opponents monster.  -Salvage Swap Frog and another Frog when it's convenient. Load your graveyard up.  -Build up to Accesscode Talker using link monsters of a lower link level and a single Ronintoadin bouncing itself back to the field repeatedly. This will allow you to give Accesscode Talker a metric shit ton of Link monsters to banish in order to activate its omni-removal effect."

Your main plan is too summon as many level 3 monsters as possible and xyz into Cicada King and Scaradiator. This deck prefers to go first since it allows it to play with a smaller chance of being disrupted.  <strong>Detailed analysis of every card:</strong>  <a data-name=""Digital Bug Centibit"">Digital Bug Centibit</a>: One of the Digital Bug cards. You can switch this card to defence position with cards such as stumbling in order to use its effect and go into a rank 3 monster. Very good card to have in your oppening hand if you have stumbling as well. Its xyz effect can allow easy otk's and destruction of the opponets monsters.  <a data-name=""Digital Bug Websolder"">Digital Bug Websolder</a>: One of the Digital Bug cards. Probably the best one depending on your situation. Its effect allows to special summon any level 3 insect from hand which makes it easy to summon any rank 3. It can also change other Digital Bugs to defence and trigger their effects. Its xyz effect is by far the best one and will give you a major advantage against your opponet. It changes all monsters they control to defence and also makes their attack 0 which makes them easy targets. It also gives you an easy way to summon Mother Spider.  <a data-name=""Digital Bug Cocoondedenser"">Digital Bug Cocoondedenser</a>: One of the Digital Bug cards. This one is great to have in the late game where you will likely have a Digital Bug in your graveyard. Other than that its xyz effect is good in order to counter any battle traps your opponet may have.  <a data-name=""Digital Bug LEDybug"">Digital Bug LEDybug</a>: One of the Digital Bug cards. Its good in order to add cards like Websolder or other combo extenders to hand. Other than that its xyz effect can give you some draw power which is always good.  <a data-name=""Mirror Ladybug"">Mirror Ladybug</a>: One of your combo extenders. While you only control one level 3 monster you can special summon this card and make it level 3 in order to summon a rank 3 monster. It is not the best combo extender since it requires for you to have only one monster which will likely only happen during early game however it is still good enough to run at 3 and make the deck more consistent.  <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Twinbow the Attacker"">Battlewasp - Twinbow the Attacker</a>: One of your combo extenders. This one is just insane since you can summon it for free with almost no draw backs and it is a level 3 insect. This card is great to have during any moment in the duel and it is also a good monster to search with LEDybug.  <a data-name=""Galaxy Worm"">Galaxy Worm</a>: All you need to do is normal summon this card and you have a rank 3 xyz. It is a very good card to have during your oppening hand but it can prove to be much less useful during the rest of the game.  <a data-name=""Kumootoko"">Kumootoko</a>: Its a level 3 insect normal monster. The only reason you play this at 3 is for Giant Ball Park. You just need to hope you dont draw it and everything will go well. You can also summon it with Giant Ball Park if it is in gy when a monster you control is sent to gy which is a nice addition to its primary effect.  <a data-name=""Mother Spider"">Mother Spider</a>: Very good card to ruin your opponets board. It is usually easy to resolve this effect with cards like Websolder and Stumbling so its a great addition to the deck. The only reason I play 1 is because it is a brick during your oppening hand.  <a data-name=""Speedroid Terrortop"">Speedroid Terrortop</a>: An easy special summoned which will give you a rank 3 xyz. When summoned make sure to add Taketomborg so that you can special summon it and go into a rank 3.  <a data-name=""Speedroid Taketomborg"">Speedroid Taketomborg</a>: A card which you dont want to draw ever. Its only use is being searched with Terrortop and going into rank 3. You can also special summon it if you control Cicada King which makes it more useful.  <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a>: This cards purpose is being sent to gy with Giant Ball Park or foolish burrial so you can add any insect you need at the time. You do not want to draw this.  <a data-name=""Giant Ball Park"">Giant Ball Park</a>: A very strong field spell and great addition to the deck. This card can special summon two Kumootoko's with its effect which gives you access to any rank 3. It can also summon Kumootoko from gy if a monster you control is sent to gy which is a nice effect to have.  <a data-name=""Stumbling"">Stumbling</a>: A very good card to have in this deck since your monsters gain alot of effects from changing their positions. Basically all the you have to do is just summon a card like Digital Bug LEDybug in attack position and then Stumbling will trigger which puts it in defence giving you the effect. It also slows down opponets plays and prevents them from otking you.  <a data-name=""Bug Signal"">Bug Signal</a>: You can use this card in order to summon your other xyz monsters. Normally a card like this will not be needed however it can be very useful in times where your opponet has the advantage. You can also activate it when your opponet would destroy an xyz monster you control in order to replace it with another one.  <a data-name=""Photon Lead"">Photon Lead</a>: Special summon monsters from your hand to extend comboes.  <a data-name=""Foolish Burrial"">Foolish Burrial</a>: To send Gokipole to gy.  <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>: To add Giant Ball Park.  <a data-name=""Digital Bug Scaradiator"">Digital Bug Scaradiator</a>: An easy negate and also change your opponets battle position. It also attached cards it destroys as materials. You will probably want to summon this after you have summoned Cicada. You can also use it to summon the <a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">Digital Bug Corebage.</a>  <a data-name=""Number 3 Cicada King"">Number 3 Cicada King</a>: The best card in the deck. This shoul be the first xyz you summon. It can negate a monster effect and also summon the insects that it detaches which makes it easy to summon other rank 3 monsters. If you manage to xyz summon this using Digital Bug Websolder then you will have a great advantage.  <a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">Digital Bug Corebage</a><a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">: Summoned with Digital Bug Scaradiator or Bug Signal. It is good for certain situations.</a>  <a data-name=""Digital Bug Rhinosebus"">Digital Bug Rhinosebus</a>: You will almost never summon this but it has destruction effect and could be used in situations where you need to kill your opponet fast. <div class=""page-header__main""> <div class=""page-header__main""></div> </div> <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a>: This card is great to have since it can practically negate a monster effect and also provides draw power.  <a data-name=""Inzektron Extra-Stag"">Inzektron Extra-Stag</a>: Your primary target for Bug Signal since it can easily get rid of your opponets monsters and also remove cards from their gy.  <a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse"">Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse</a>: Backrow removal.  Number 28 Titanic Moth: For the otks.  <a data-name=""Seraphim Papillon"">Seraphim Papillon</a>: The only decent link monster for this deck. This card can bring back alot of insects from your gy in order to make rank 3's but it can also be used as a beatstick"

Some starters for this deck include all of the <strong>Adamancipator</strong> <strong>Tuners</strong>, <strong>Doki</strong> <strong>Doki</strong> and <strong>Madolche</strong> <strong>Petingcessoeur</strong>. The most interesting monster has to be <strong>Petingcessoeur</strong> because has you probably know it has seen play in <strong>Adamancipator</strong> decks before but what has not seen that much play is <strong>Anjelly</strong> ,but it comes in useful in this combo. <strong>Petingcessoeur</strong> eff, special summon <strong>Anjelly</strong>, <strong>Anjelly</strong> eff, summon <strong>Petingcessoeur</strong>, overlay into <strong>Gallant</strong> <strong>Granite</strong>. Has you can see if you played <strong>Madolche</strong> before you'll know that they have a level five monster and since <strong>Petingcessoeur's</strong> effect reduces level why not play that monster, simple because I'm also playing <strong>Gigantes</strong> and its effect banishes 1 earth monster to special summon itself you can banish <strong>Anjelly</strong> to special summon it and since <strong>Adamancipator's</strong> like to swarm the field. Any way another oddity is why I'm playing 2 <strong>Adamancipator</strong> <strong>Crystals</strong> the reason is it makes <strong>Seeker</strong> much less bricky and its practically a plus 2 when you special summon it onto the field with an <strong>Adamancipator's</strong> effect another is that if you choose to play <strong>Toadally</strong> its also a great target for that. Finally here's a combo you will want to miss out on the up to 3200 Atk wall and a draw yay. This combo requires a level 4 monster plus <strong>Halq</strong> and it also has to be your opponents turn.  <strong>Halq</strong> eff, summon <strong>Formula</strong>, summon <strong>Nothung</strong> use on strong monster. I would like an opinion on this deck so plz tell me."

Arc V series.,"Fluffals are a strategy able to go both 1st and 2nd. Going 1st the deck can quite consistently summon 1 VFD using multiple Frightfur Cruel Whales. This can usually also be accompanied by a Toadally awesome and sometimes even more interruptions. The key to the deck is really in abusing the non-once per turn search cards and the ability to draw crazy numbers of cards each turn to fuel your fusion plays. Going 2nd: the deck can quite easily beat over large boss monsters using Cruel Whale, Sabre Tooth, Kraken and Tiger. To facilitate going 2nd, this list runs a total of 7 handtraps: 3 Ash, 2 Nibiru &amp; 2 Edge Imp Scythe which if drawn in addition to any Fluffal monster can quick effect fusion summon Cruel Whale to destroy cards on field (any more handtraps results in poor turn 1 consistency but that is a legitimate route to take if opting for a more Go 2nd oriented build)"

This sets the field up so that you can go for a Blood Rose Dragon (blow up field) or a Crystal Wing (negate) on your opponents turn using Halqifibrax's second effect to special summon a turner synchro monster such as Formula Synchron or Shooting Riser Dragon. The deck is very consistent at performing this set-up; here are few ways to do so:  I: Predaplant Scorpio <ol>  	<li>Summon Predaplant Scorpio and activate effect to summon Cobra from deck</li>  	<li>Cobra adds instant fusion</li>  	<li>Activate instant fusion to summon Theseus and go into Halqifibrax to get Red Rose Dragon</li>  	<li>Use Red Rose Dragon and left-over Predaplant to go into Marjoram</li> </ol> II: Witch of the Blood Rose and White Rose Dragon or Wheeleder <ol>  	<li>Summon Witch of the Blood Rose to add Witch of the Black Rose and stack Rose Fairy on top of deck</li>  	<li>Summon Witch of the Black Rose to draw Rose Fairy</li>  	<li>Rose Fairy activates to special summon itself</li>  	<li>Special summon Wheeleder and go into Halqifibrax. Alternativately, make Halqifibrax first, then special summon White Rose Dragon</li> </ol> III: Righty Driver and White Rose Dragon or Wheeleder <ol>  	<li>Summon Righty Driver to special summon Lefty Driver</li>  	<li>Use Lefty Driver's second effect to make itself level 3</li>  	<li>Special summon Wheeleder and go into Halqifibrax. Alternativately, make Halqifibrax first, then special summon White Rose Dragon</li> </ol> Lonefire Blossom makes it so you can pull Witch of the Blood Rose or Predaplant Scorpio out of the deck for added consistency. Rose Princess also allows you to save your normal summon to go for a more extended play or bait an Ash Blossom. With any of the set-ups listed above, you can end with 1 negate (Crystal Wing) and 1 pop (Crocodragon,) or 1 pop and 1 field clear (Blood Rose Dragon.) Lefty/Righty Driver can be removed and replaced with Ash Blossoms or other negate cards.

Hope you like it :D.,"A pretty simple Lunalight deck without tiger (sadly ._.) that aims to put big numbers on the field that the opponent can't do anything about.  The deck mainly follows these rules: <ul>  	<li>Try to get to Leo dancer using monsters on-field/in-hand first, then use wolf to make either panther dancer or sabre dancer, depending on the situation. It's important to banish chick when making that fusion, so you can win uninterrupted.</li>  	<li>Throw down wolf as soon as possible after baiting negations.</li>  	<li>Chick dumps either panther dancer or yellow marten for lunalight fusion. This is flexible, you might want to dump butterfly or emerald bird depending on the situation.</li>  	<li>Emerald bird usually dumps marten if it's in hand, otherwise dumps any monster. You don't want to get rid of a lunalight fusion unless you've already used it that turn, or have drawn into both. The more fusion spells the better since chick/tenyi can create so much advantage.</li>  	<li>Foolish burial usually dumps serenade dance and not perfume. All flexible, of course. Before getting leo dancer, this deck doesn't have a single linear plan to get there, you just have to use what you drew into.</li> </ul> I've seen some lists that run many blue cat's, but I've found it pretty uncommon to pull it's effect off, so I've decided to run it at one. Same with butterfly, it's effect isn't a necessity for most games. Emerald bird and/or yellow marten can help you go into tiger king, which has come in clutch a couple of times.  I've tried to put reasoning and foolish burial into this deck, but surprisingly have never drawn into them, so that might be something you'd want to put in by dropping an emerald bird if you want. You never really go into your link monsters except predaplant verde, they're just to prepare for different situations as the fusion monsters are the main bosses. I've found infinite impermanence is a great hand trap for this deck, as it also negates a spell/trap, but you can replace it with whatever hand trap you want, of course.  Edits: <ul>  	<li>Swapped out blue cat and the crimson foxes for another butterfly, another marten, and have moved the twin twisters to the side deck in favor of three lightning storms. Butterfly accomplishes what fox and cat are trying to do without targeting, and marten can bounce back a pendulum to go into an xyz. Cards like shaddoll schism with non-targeting non-removal can be a real pain.</li>  	<li>Took out the predaplant fusion for tornado dragon. The lunalights are good enough boss monsters, and tornado dragon is easy to bring out with marten for backrow removal in case you've already used tenki.</li>  	<li>Took out ghost ogre in favor of alpha in side deck. I'm not sure how kaiju's would be in this deck, I'll test that later.</li>  	<li>Added alpha into the main deck by taking out a polymerization and a lightning storm. It synergizes pretty well with marten in theory, but I have yet to pull that off in-game. Otherwise, it's a pretty good removal tool.</li>  	<li>Replaced the alphas missing in the side deck with a crimson fox and a raigeki. You can summon massive 4,000+ monsters and have removal, but if they have an even bigger monster, you surprisingly cannot do anything without crimson fox, so just in case it's there if you need it.</li>  	<li>Added foolish burial in the main deck. Literally have no idea why I wasn't running it before, it opens up perfume, white rabbit, extra material for wolf, or a free lunalight fusion by dumping marten. Before it would be more difficult to get perfume in the grave, one game I used butterfly on a marten in order to summon it with perfume and get a search, but now it's a lot easier.</li>  	<li>Discovered the droll &amp; lock bird wasn't in the side deck bc I had the alt artwork in the ydk file, so I added that.</li> </ul> &nbsp;"

Negate and banish Monsters with Balerdroch or go into Draglubion to summon your favorite Number-Dragons.  Most of the time you will end first turn with Zombie World, Vampire Sucker and some Traps on the field to then special Balerdroch in your opponents turn from your Graveyard to trigger Sucker and draw. At this point you just start playing Eldlich. Stop for opponent from playing with your favorite traps to then otk your opponent next turn. You can decide if you wanna go the rank 8 Draglubion rout with another Balerdroch to then summon Numero Dragon or go along with Eldlich. But remember! A lot of cards lock you into Zombies. READ the cards before thinking about going into any Ranks.  You can use Rivalery of Warlords and Zombie World to lock your opponent into Zombies after he summoned his first Monster.  Also Scarlet Sanguine lets you summon any Zombie if you already control Golden Lord.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm still testing some ratios and would be happy to get some tipps and suggestions especially for Draglubion targets or any other rank 8s that are good :)  &nbsp;"

Also was not able to add a third Mathematician because of some bug but it's supposed to be in there. Some people might also be asking why Gravedigger's Trap Hole is in here. Well it should be no secret at this point that a lot of monster effects nowadays are activated from the hand and from the graveyard. This is a really cool way to counter handtraps or disrupt a graveyard set up and also to deal some nice damage, which helps you to OTK quicker or might even win the game for you. For an example, when your opponent is clinging to his last couple of life points after a successful battle phase of yours and plans a comeback which involves a combo that either activates a monster effect in the graveyard or the hand (a lot of them do) and then BOOM. Not sure how well this does against tournament decks since I've not been able to try competitive play because of Skull Convoy but I've played against a couple of meta relevant decks and it actually does quite well. Try it out"

Advertencia: Puedes perder amigos UwU. Make an FTK with the legendary Ex,"Deck creado por: Darklab  Objetivo: Ganar con el efecto de Exodia en el primer turno OwO.  Link a la demostración del Deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV4Y33x7nxk  Extenders para iniciar el combo: <ul>  	<li>Tour guide from the underworld: Vale x3. Trae al campo a Graff o al Edge imp (el otro lo envías al cementerio usando a Cherubini). En todo caso, es el mejor normal summon del deck.</li>  	<li>Fiendish rhino warrior: Vale x2. Envía al cementerio el mismo target que la Tour guide, aunque no aprovecha el cuerpo extra. Necesita otro extender sí o sí.</li>  	<li>Junk forward: Se invoca de modo especial desde la mano si no controlas monstruos, por lo que si lo robas, debe ser el primero en invocarse.</li>  	<li>Kagemucha knight: Se invoca de modo especial cuando invocas otro monstruo de nivel 3 de modo normal. Ojo que puede perder timing.</li>  	<li>Psychic wheelder: Se invoca si ya tienes otro monstruo de nivel 3, aunque sólo es una vez por turno.</li>  	<li>Psychic tracer: Igual que el anterior.</li>  	<li>Gilasaurus: Se invoca casi gratuitamente. Ojo que el rival puede invocar algo del cementerio, aunque usualmente eso no es un problema.</li>  	<li>Fossil dig: Trae al Gilasaurus.</li>  	<li>Foolish burial: Puedes enviar a Cloak para robar a Boots, a costa de no acceder a la ruta no segura; o en su defecto enviar uno de los targets de la Tour guide.</li>  	<li>Emergency teleport: Trae a uno de los Psychic gratis.</li> </ul> Inicio del combo: <ol>  	<li>Primero, se debe traer a Cherubini y activar su efecto. No importa si es negado, ya que lo importante es el costo de enviar al cementerio a Graff para invocar del Deck a Cir (Ojo, si Cherubini mantiene sus efectos negados, Cir se destruirá si tenemos otros monstruos, así que cuidado).</li>  	<li>Hacemos link summon con cherubini y Cir, con lo que se activará el efecto de este último y así invocaremos nuevamente a Cherubini. El monstruo link que invocaremos dependerá de la ruta que elijamos, la cual a su vez depende de cuántos extenders tengamos disponibles.</li> </ol> Ruta segura (Número de extenders iniciales requerido: 4+. Monstruo: Apollousa): <ol>  	<li>Al tener 2 extenders extra además de los usados para invocar a Cherubini, usaremos un material link más para ir por Apollousa. Opcionalmente si hay más extenders, se le puede invocar con 4 materiales para tener las 4 negaciones, pero siempre dejando 1 para el siguiente paso. También es importante no poner demasiados cuerpos, ya que más tarde van a estorbar.</li>  	<li>Con el extender sobrante y el Cherubini revivido por el efecto de Cir, invocaremos por link a Codebreaker virus swordsman, colinkeado a Apollousa. Esto activará el efecto de invocar del Deck a Codebreaker zero day.</li>  	<li>Usamos los codebreaker para invocar a Isolde. Añadimos cualquier descarte e invocamos a Armageddon knight. Para los equipos a descartar, es importante enviar Phoenix blade (combo guerrero), Sword of sparkles (ya verán) y Cursed bamboo sword (para añadirnos una magia a la mano).</li>  	<li>Armageddon enviará a Plaguespreader zombie, el cual reviviremos con el descarte de Isolde, luego usaremos estos dos para invocar a Halqifibrax.</li>  	<li>Halqifibrax traerá a Vylon cube, y él junto con Armageddon invocarán por sincronía al Shooting riser dragon. Es importante NO ponerlo debajo de las flechas de Apollousa. Esto activará los efectos de Vylon cube (para traer un D.D.R.) y del Riser dragon (enviar al cementerio al World legacy - world chalice).</li>  	<li>Activamos el efecto del Phoenix blade para desterrar a Armageddon knight y otro guerrero cualquiera para añadirlo a la mano y lo descartamos como el coste del D.D.R. para invocar al mismo Armageddon desterrado.</li>  	<li>Con el efecto de Armageddon enviamos a Zephyr al cementerio. Activamos su efecto devolviendo a la mano el D.D.R. Armageddon irá al cementerio. Repetimos el paso 6.</li>  	<li>Esta vez enviaremos al cementerio al Summoner monk. Usaremos entonces a Zephyr y Armageddon para invocar a Dugares y revivir al Summoner Monk a la otra zona donde NO apunta Apollousa.</li>  	<li>Invocamos por Link al Flame swordsman usando a Dugares y Halqifibrax, y lo sacrificamos usando el efecto de Sword of sparkles. Con eso, todas las flechas debajo de Apollousa deberían estar libres. Usamos el efecto del Summoner monk descartando la Broken bamboo sword para invocar a Rescue ferret.</li>  	<li>Con Ferret traemos a Sangan, Lee y Spore (este último puede ser cualquier tuner de nivel 1). Dejando de lado a Lee, usamos los otros 2, además del Summoner monk y el Riser dragon (ahora de nivel 2) para hacer 2 invocaciones de sincronía: Ametrix (para invocar a Dewloren) y Rose maiden (para tener el Black garden).</li>  	<li>Con Sangan añadimos la primera pieza de Exodia: La pieza de efecto (por ser la más difícil de buscar)</li>  	<li>Activamos el Black garden y haremos una invocación link con Lee y Rose maiden, trayendo a Puzzlomino (su flecha debe estar libre)</li>  	<li>Activamos el efecto de Black garden para invocar al Summoner monk una vez más (no al lado de Puzzlomino)</li>  	<li>Activamos el efecto en el cementerio de la Rose maiden para traer al Riser dragon al lado de Puzzlomino y darle nivel 1 con el efecto de este último.</li>  	<li>Invocamos a Dewloren usando al Riser y Ametrix. Podemos traer el Phoenix blade a la mano una vez más para usarlo con el Summoner Monk por última vez para invocar al Treasure panda (es importante que esté en una zona a donde apunte Apollousa).</li>  	<li>Con el Treasure panda desterramos cualquier magia para invocar una pieza cualquiera de Exodia. Usamos esa pieza y a Puzzlomino para invocar a Lib y colocar el World legacy succession.</li>  	<li>Usamos a Lib y al Summoner monk para invocar a Tenyi y activamos el efecto de Lib para regresar al mismo Tenyi al Deck.</li>  	<li>Con eso, sólo debería quedar Dewloren y Treasure panda en la zona principal de monstruos. Usamos al panda para traer el resto de piezas de Exodia.</li>  	<li>Enviamos al Treasure panda al cementerio con el efecto de Lee y usamos el Succession para traer la pieza que enviamos al cementerio.</li>  	<li>Finalmente, devolvemos todas las piezas de Exodia a la mano con el efecto de Dewloren y GG.</li> </ol> Ruta parcialmente segura (Número de extenders iniciales requerido: 3. Monstruo: Tenyi) <ol>  	<li>A diferencia de la primera ruta, sólo tenemos un extender adicional que debemos guardar para el codebreaker, así que usaremos solamente a Cherubini y Cir para invocar a Tenyi.</li>  	<li>El resto va igual hasta llegar al paso 9 de la ruta segura. En este punto, en lugar de invocar al Flame Swordsman con Halqifibrax y Dugares, usaremos ambos junto con el Tenyi para invocar a Apollousa.</li>  	<li>El combo continúa igual hasta el final. En la parte que se invoca a Tenyi usando a Lib y a Summoner monk, en su lugar invocaremos al Flame Swordsman (ya que Tenyi ya fue usado).</li> </ol> Ruta no segura (Número de extenders iniciales requerido: 2. Monstruo: Rusty bardiche) <ol>  	<li>Esta ruta debería usarse como último recurso, en caso de tener una muy mala mano o que nos hayan destruido extenders. La ventaja es que no necesitamos a Cir, por lo que podemos ir directamente por el Edge imp sabres (para devolver un garnet al Deck, o a Brigandine si lo tenemos en la mano) con Cherubini, e ir por Rusty bardiche.</li>  	<li>Usaremos a Bardiche para enviar al cementerio a Cloak y colocar a Brigandine. Removemos a Cloak y robamos a Boots.</li>  	<li>Invocamos a Boots y Brigandine, yendo directamente a por Isolde (obviaremos a los codebreaker en esta ruta).</li>  	<li>El combo continúa igual que en la ruta segura, hasta llegar al paso 9.</li>  	<li>Ya que Bardiche no puede ser usado para invocaciones link, lo sacrificaremos con el Sword of Sparkles y usaremos a Dugares y Halqifibrax para invocar a Tenyi.</li>  	<li>Seguimos igual hasta el paso 17 (Phoenix blade puede volver a la mano sin problemas, ya que reemplazamos a los codebreaker por los phantom knights en esta ruta, que también son guerreros).</li>  	<li>Usamos entonces a Lib, Summoner monk y Tenyi para invocar a Apollousa, tras lo cual sigue todo igual hasta el final.</li> </ol> Tips: <ul>  	<li>Apollousa es útil para sacar del juego casi cualquier handtrap, aprovechando que Impermanence ya no se usa mucho y que Called está a 1 copia (por ahora 7w7)</li>  	<li>Edge imp sabres y Plaguespreader zombie pueden usarse para enviar garnets en tu mano de vuelta al Deck. Algunos garnets que debes devolver serían los targets de Rescue Ferret o Armageddon Knight y alguna carta de equipo (en caso de robar 3 con nombres distintos y que no sean D.D.R.)</li>  	<li>Si tienes el Sword of sparkles, puedes descartarlo en el primer uso del Summoner monk, o si tienes el Phoenix blade, equípaselo al Armageddon knight cuando lo invocas por primera vez para que vaya al cementerio.</li>  	<li>Si tienes al Armageddon knight en tu mano, puedes invocar en su lugar al Dark grepher y usar su efecto para descartar al Armageddon knight, a la vez que envías al Plaguespreader zombie al cemenerio.</li>  	<li>Si robas a Sangan, puedes usarlo como normal summon, añadir a Exodia cuando se vaya al cementerio, y más adelante reemplazarlo por cualquier otro monstruo de nivel 3.</li>  	<li>Si robas el Black garden, puedes usarlo como coste del Summoner monk, ya que el efecto de Rose maiden lo añadirá del cementerio a tu mano más adelante.</li>  	<li>No es posible realizar el combo con sólo 1 extender, pero las posibilidades de que sólo saques 1 o ninguno son cerca del 1% (sí, saqué las cuentas)</li> </ul> Pros: <ul>  	<li>Deck extremadamente consistente, sólo brickea alrededor del 1% de las veces.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Se adapta fácilmente a los recursos que tengamos en mano.</li>  	<li>Protegido constantemente por Apollousa, por lo que es difícil de contrarrestarlo una vez toca el campo.</li>  	<li>No depende del burn, por lo que no le afectan cartas como Ghost sister u otras que le permitan ganar LP al oponente.</li>  	<li>No requiere demasiados recursos para realizar el combo. Con 2 extenders es suficiente, y tener más solamente lo hace mejor.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps tempranas con los extenders suficientes.</li> </ul> Contras: <ul>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, tiene muchos garnets, por lo que es posible comenzar con 3+ garnets en mano, en cuyo caso es un gg automático.</li>  	<li>Debe ser efectuado al detalle. Si se falla en un pequeño detalle, muy probablemente el campo se llene de monstruos inútiles. Una parte importante del Deck es por eso, deshacerse de lo que estorba con Sword of Sparkles, Lib y Lee. Además, las posiciones donde se invoca algunos monstruos son muy importantes.</li>  	<li>Aún teniendo protección, el Deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Impermanence y Called by the grave si son usados correctamente.</li>  	<li>Si destruyen a Cherubini antes de activar su efecto y no hay forma de invocarlo del cementerio, también es gg.</li> </ul>"

Pretty standard stuff, but Raider's Wing going second and Revolution Falcon give this deck the oomf it sometimes lacks.  Monsters: The first line of cards are your extenders, you want to see at least one in your opening hand (Torn Scales obviously the best). Cloak is the first card to get in your GY, and Boots is usually your last and usually not a target for Rusty or Torn Scales. Gloves is a decent extender off of Rusty's effect. Kagemucha Knight, Psychics and E-Tele (even Boots) are going to be your special summon after your starter. The six hand traps are flexible.  Spells/Traps: E-Tele gets an extender or during your opponent's turn is a free disruption (using Ghost Ogre). RUMF goes into <strong>Revolution Falcon</strong>. PK Wing is an extender. Fog Blade puts in work and ROTA and Foolish start plays.  Extra Deck: <strong>Cherubini and Rusty</strong> are cards you want to go into every time, and then Leviair if you have the resources. Break Sword goes into Dark Rebellion or Nightmare. Use your Cherubini bringing it back with Cir to go into Verte most of the time and then Dragoon. Falcon for RUMF and free pop. Accesscode Talker is your main means of OTK. Masquerena package for extra negates or to spin cards if you can't get an ideal board. Link Spider is pretty nice as it can link for Shade Brigadine to get an effect monster on field for further Extra Deck stuff and also to save you if you get Nibiru'd.  My favourite combo (ideal hand) off this deck goes Normal Torn Scales, discarding Cloak and sending Raider's Wing. Get extender on field (any Lv 3) and link into Cherubini, send Graff and Special Cir (Libic, if you drew Cir) and link away Cherubini and Cir for ya boi Rusty, sending Gloves and setting a Fog Blade. Banish Cloak adding Boots and use Torn effect to Special him. Special Boots and overlay into Levinair, detaching to special Cloak in attack, activate and target Rusty. Activate Gloves, sending PK Wing and banish Wing to Special Boots again. Overlay Boots and Cloak into Break Sword to a Rusty zone, use either his own (activate Raider's Wing first) or Rusty's effect to self-destroy and activate, bringing back any two of you PKs. Overlay them into a. Nightmare to basically deny your opponent next turn or b. Dark Rebellion to punch in for damage. Your <strong>Nightmare</strong> is basically broooooken if you use your <strong>Raider's Wing</strong>. Link away your Leviair and Cherubini to Anaconda and the next is obvious. Main 2 you banish Boots to set RUMF (one Fog Blade is usually enough, using it more than once a turn causes trouble next turn). You cause a Nightmare for your opponent their turn and once it's out of gas, you activate RUMF, banishing your Malebranche's and go into Revolution Falcon, popping your opponents only face-up or any monster.  <strong>Accesscode for game</strong>, almost 80% of the time.  You can take out the Masquerena package for the Raider's Knight to Arc Rebellion Combo and also add Almiraj in for added consistency in getting out Dragoon. <strong>Almiraj</strong> is probably the best change if you're looking to make the deck a lil' more consistent.  All in all, an insanely fun deck."

Make the best use of Abhyss archetype, Snake","First of all, you NEVER want to go first. Your endboard will most likely suck. This deck has way more power going second. You might have seen versions with viruses and other weird lair-related stuff, it makes the deck inconsistent while having an okay-ish endboard. Sure, going first IF you can assemble all 3 of the Abhyss boss monsters, you have a decent board, but nothing crazy and you need to open some disgustingly good hand to assemble it (which this deck could as well). The payoff for going first is really low, but you can consider siding some viruses if you know your opponents is going to make you go first.  The idea is to injure the opponents board with strong equalizers before spamming your field with reptiles and accessing your Xyz 8 toolbox. Curse and Aleth make it easy with snake rain so you can end game quickly with Numeron Dragon. If you can't otk that turn, then setup your Aron and Amunesia to disrupt your opponent's follow up.  Lair of darkness is insane in this deck and so is Darkest Diabolos. You can tribute your opponent's monster to summon yours from the graveyard , which bypasses almost every kind of protection. It's one of the easier ways to get rid of problematic cards. Even Arima is nice, not only because it searches Lair, but it's effect is actually useful : you can search Nihil, Nessie, Jackalope or Diabolos depending on what you need.  Lamia, Echidna and Hydra are nice little engine that clears boards and gives you cards to work with. It doesn't interact well with targeting protection though. Be careful with Echidna, as her search effect prevents you from going into your Rank 8.  Dangers are here for ""consistency"" and they open up Xyz play. Its weird to speak about consistency with danger!s but that's what they actually do here, kind of how they did in Thunder dragon back in the days. There is just no better equivalent to ""extenders that load the graveyard and cycle through the deck"" and you need all of that. Tsuchinoko is searchable with King of the Feral Imp or Echidna, which is actually very relevant because one more monster can be crucial to tribute for your Abhyss graveyard summons.  If you don't open your equalizers, try baiting as much negates as you can, you will see that you can go through much.  The side deck is just good going second cards, but you can put whatever you like as long as you can break boards. Careful with the barrier statue of the wind, as you will need the wind insect kaiju to out it as Gameciel don't work. Be sure to pack Backrow hate as that kind of deck can become akward to deal with. As I said before, viruses can also be considered in the side for going first.  Weakness to droll&amp;lockbird,  Skullmeister, Ghost Belle and backrow heavy decks.  Some edit after more playtest : added Number 23 Lancelot and AA-Zeus, super good if you can't otk.  Let me know in the comments if you would make any changes or if you disagree with my point of view. Hell you can comment if you like the deck as well ! I truly believe this is the good route ! Enjoy !"

If ""bird up!"" (lyrilusc Tri-brigade) is considered competitive, then I don't know how the heck this one isn't. But people never cared about Simorgh cards...  The litte simorgh chickens act as your normal summons AND free extenders (if your opponent' BR is empty, which is always the case going first) to go into Chicken of Sovereignty. Bringing searches a simorgh card on normal summon, and Calamity foolishes one. Calamity is actually a one-card Chicken of sovereignty if your hand is poor.  Bringing can search multiple cards depending on what you need :  -if you open Both him and Calamity, or Elborz : search the other piece, activate the field spell and foolish the chicken of protection on calamity norm and bang! you have the setup for the infamous ""infinite negate combo"" without even going into your tri-brigades yet. If you open Bringing, elborz and something to discard, search Onslaught instead.  -if you open him and nerval : search the field spell, normal nerval and go into linkuriboh so you can search Kerass and do your Tri-brigade plays.  -if you open him and fractaur ( and no other mentionned pieces ) : search sky battle for extra protection.  -you can side-in the big chicken Simorgh of Ancestry going second, for example against Vanity ruler or Winda. Then you need to open Bringing and Elborz, Ancestry or Onslaught : you can use both effect of elborz to tribute summon the big chicken to out up to 2 cards, without targeting, destroying or even special summoning.  &nbsp;  Onslaught is very good as it searches 2 cards and loads your graveyard. The two big dark chickens are enablers for it but you card also end on Dark simorgh if you're going against a backrow heavy deck. The other one can be summoned during the Bird of ancestry shenanigan.  Now for the BIG DEAL : Harpie's feather storm. This card is NOT OKAY. Effectivly Azathot in a trap card, unfair by nature. It is sooooo good that trap trick made it's way into the main deck. Even if your whole turn was negated by handtraps or if you get Dark ruler no mored or Forbidden Droppleted, as long as you have a wind winged beast one the field and HFS set, your opponents will most likely end his turn as he won't be able to play Yugioh. Even ""normal summon barrier statue, set HFS"" is a sick turn. Pair it with Sovereignty and you have a really oppressive board. That is why that's is a mandatory 6 of. You will most likely side out your traps going second but HFS can be use as a dark ruler no more like effect when harpie conductor is on the field, in very niche scenarios.  Be careful to summon your tri-brigades before summoning back your simorgh chickens, as they lock your into winged-beast when summoned this way.  &nbsp;  Compared to ""bird up!"", this deck can't go into Zeus but compensates by having an easier access to one of the most unfair trap cards ever, the deadly ""infinite negate combo"" with union carrier and mist valley thunderbird and much more value from normal summons. Aside from this, things are pretty similar. You also get to use The bird of sovereignty's protection effect.  Let me know in the comments if you would change anything ! Enjoy chickens !"

Your dose of dumb decks is here! Are you bored of good draong links ? do you wish to play Gaia the fierce knight in your deck ? Then ask no more! Here's a boneless dragon link with a gaia touch.  If you just want to know the objective of the deck, You do guard dragon combos, basicaly with the hieratic stuff and some dragon shennanigans, until you get apo, borreload . BUT SOMETIMES, yes sometimes... remenber it's boneless, you can get to Gaia the magical knights of dragon, easy to make with any Gaia monster and a LVL 5 Dragon monster, with the fusion spell Spiral fusion it gets 5200 atk, 2 attacks, and if you used Curse of dragon, The cursed dragon you get a negate of all effects on your opp monster who have under 5200 atk :) so just another borrelsword, yes. 2 borrelsword. If you go second Gaia the magical knight can let you SS any, well most of the hieratic LVL 5 dragons, letting you use the effect of other to get the normal monsters on the field and get started from there.  BAsic combo is .. guardragon i guess. But well here's one :  normal summon Gaia the magical knight and ss any hieratic ( preferably eset ) then tribute with another hieratic to get the normal monster + hieratic + gaia, then romulus into guardragon plays, for ravin or lance, elpy pisty, i mean it's just gurardragon after that. with maybe a bonus fusion on the board with Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons.  Not much to say, most hand gets a good combo, you can play throught handtraps, but not always, a bit worst than Dragon links but without the option for your opponent tot say '' YoU pLaY dRaGoN LiNk "".  i will soon try to build a ""The Armed dragons of Gaia"" deck but still trying to figure it out :) HF"

The deck has only 6 hand trap cards or impermanence and ash blossom, creating a balance to avoid not drawing too many heavy cards. I decided to play 6 magic cards including 3x of Pot of Extravagance, since in this deck the extra deck is not so important you can also banish some cards to draw others; 2x of Pot of Duality to spin the deck, this card later avoids special summoning but this deck the special summon executes it during the opponent's turn so it's quite useful. 1x of the card that cleans up spells and trappings. As trap cards I decided to play the usual cards used in the altergeist but I also used the warning point card that I am testing and I must say that it is a very good card. then otherwise it is quite normal. I recommend in the Side to choose between the 3x of Rivarly I have the summon limit.</span> </span></span>"

Japanese dub)","  Wow, I am one lazy mother****er. Anyways...this here is my new @Ignister deck, using their new support cards from Lightning Vortex.  Keeping with the pun theme of the deck's backrow, this deck is named ""A.I.bou"", after the Japanese word for ""partner""(Aibou). What makes this even more appropriate is that Ai was Yusaku's partner in Yu-Gi-Oh VRAINS, and some of Yusaku's cards work excellently in @Ignister decks. Also, Yami Yugi calls Yugi Muto this a lot in Yu-Gi-Oh!'s Japanese dub.  &nbsp;  Dark Infant @Ignister gives a massive boost to this deck's consistency, because it can search @Ignister A.I.land upon summon, can move to a Main Monster Zone it points to, and change its attribute. This makes summoning The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister easier, and Dark Infant's search effect means you don't need to run Terraforming or 3 copies of A.I.land.  When A.I. first met you is the best Normal Spell in the deck, because it can search an @Ignister monster, and your only cost is that you must reveal a Cyberse monster in your hand or Extra Deck that has 2300 ATK. And @Ignister has those Extra Deck monsters in spades! So 3 of this and 3 Cynet Mining gives @Ignister S-class consistency!  &nbsp;  As for this deck's strategy, it works fine going first or second. If you're going first, your goal is to summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister, preferably with Danmari @Ignister in your Graveyard so you can negate one of your opponent's cards. If you're going second, your goal is to go on the offensive with your Extra Deck monsters. You can OTK your opponent with Dark Templar, Wind Pegasus, and Light Dragon. Or you can summon Accesscode Talker with Update Jammer, leaving you with a 4300 to 5300-ATK board wipe that can attack twice."

That said, you need to draw <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong> or the deck literally won't function and you would rather choose to go second. At best, you can pass your turn with <strong>Artifact Durendal</strong>/<strong>Constellar Peliades</strong>, <strong>Dragonic Utopia Ray</strong> with 3 or more<strong> ZW</strong> cards attached to it including a <strong>ZW - Dragonic Halberd</strong>, and 1 other <strong>Utopia</strong> monster which you can choose to equip with <strong>ZW</strong> cards as well.</span>  <span><strong>ZS - Ascend Sage</strong> and <strong>ZS - Arms Sage</strong> are the heart and soul of this deck. They are your only play starters and they provide the most consistent searching in the entire deck since <strong>ZEXAL Construction</strong> is still a neg 1. Another important playmaker in this deck is <strong>Summoner Monk</strong> as it functions as a play starter and extender. You rarely normal summon in this deck and <strong>Monk</strong> can get you material for another xyz summon.<strong> ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber</strong> and <strong>Eagle Claw</strong> may provide things like monster and trap negates, but they are here since they bolster your board with Rank 5 access.<strong> Lightning Blade</strong> is the most important card in the deck when you are going through with summoning <strong>Durendal</strong> since it protects your ZW equips from being destroyed and hardly anyone reads cards. <strong>Tornado Bringer</strong> is just another name and it provides targeting protection.<strong> Asura Arms</strong> makes your <strong>Utopia</strong> into a<strong> UCT</strong> (or an actual one if you decide to play <strong>Phoenix Bow</strong>).</span>  <span>You need to see your combo pieces in this deck and things like <strong>ROTA</strong>, <strong>Desires</strong>, <strong>Generation Shift</strong>, and <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong> all get you there. You need to see <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong> or else you will actually be passing on 1 monster turn 1. <strong>ZEXAL Entrust</strong> provides much needed recycling and extending for the deck. <strong>RUM ZEXAL Force</strong> easily searchable in this deck and it stacks a <strong>ZW</strong> or <strong>ZS</strong> so that you draw what you need with <strong>Tactics</strong>. <strong>ZEXAL Construction</strong> is a neg 1, but you need to play it since it searches like half the deck. Also 1 <strong>Double or Nothing!</strong> to make use of <strong>Utopia Double</strong>.</span>  <span>Extra Deck:<strong> Zeus</strong> is a staple in xyz decks. <strong>Gaia Drake</strong> just gives <strong>Zeus</strong> more material. <strong>Constellar Pleiades</strong> &amp; <strong>Artifact Durendal</strong> are your Rank 5 targets, but you can choose to play something like <strong>Volcasaurus</strong> over <strong>Pleiades</strong> since you usually won't have 2 lights since <strong>Eagle Claw</strong> is a wind. 1 <strong>Dragonic Utopia Ray</strong> to OTK. 1 <strong>Leo Utopia Ray</strong> since its a negate and it equips from ED also. 1 <strong>ZW - Dragonic Halberd</strong> for more OTK potential. You can also choose to play his brother,<strong>  ZW - Leo Arms</strong>, if you want another Rank 5 target. 1 <strong>Utopia the Lightning</strong>. 1 <strong>Utopia Ray V</strong>. 1<strong> Utopia Ray</strong>. 1<strong> Utopia Prime</strong> (don't sleep on this one). 1 <strong>Utopia Double</strong>. And 3 <strong>Number 39: Utopia</strong>.</span>  <span>All you need to know about the side deck is that <strong>V Salamander</strong> gets you back advantage later in the game,<strong> Xyz Encore</strong> counters xyz decks and it is searchable off of <strong>Generation Force</strong>,<strong> Shining Draw</strong> is like an okay card, and<strong> ZEXAL Alliance</strong> is another way to gain back advantage despite making you vulnerable to <strong>Sparks</strong>.</span>"

Ability to switch to different styles depending on side deck  The deck has a lot of extenders, allowing for options in play depending on the situation.  Cons:  Prone to Handtraps.  Poor recovery after disruptions; you will possibly use the whole hand to reach the primary board and +2 draw on the opponents turn with Formula Synchron and Vampire Sucker  Typically will need to use all in-hand extenders to reach the end board.

There are many ways to play with this deck, and you use it any way you like, but this is my way: You start off with alternative dragon, rage with eyes of blue, or a photon monster (photon thrasher, crusher, sabre tiger, etc.), and then photon lead to summon another sabre tiger, or other photon monster. Once you've got out those guys, either photon dragon, xyz or fusion summon and then get out neo blue eyes, or neo galaxy eyes, and then bust the enemy with some tricky traps or spells and attack directly, and win the duel."

This deck aims to handloop for 2 while still ending on Borreload Savage, it means we already took care 3 cards out of 6 cards opponent has. There are 2 lines of combo to achieve that, watch the video. If from Paradox Gear, we can handloop for 2 every turn because Paradigm Dragon will still be on field unlike using Machina Redeployment as starter.

The idea is here, and you can do what you want with this. This is not even close to the full potential this deck could obtain. I know this isn't the best deck to come back with after months of inactivity, but it's the most original idea I have at the moment.  Okay, with that disclaimer out of the way, here's the premiss.  I've been a longtime fan of Tenyi builds. They can play around Nibiru, Gamma and Impermanence with relative ease and don't use up your Normal Summon. For this reason, things like Lava Golem, Invoked and other normal-summon heavy engines work quite well with it. The Tenyi normal deck monsters are also all different Attributes, lending itself pretty well to both Shaddoll and Invoked fusion monsters. So, I thought, why not? Lets make a Tenyi Invoked deck.  Some things right off the bat: you almost always want to used your invoked engine AFTER your done with Tenyis. That way, you can use whatever Tenyi's you want in your fusion summons. There's also a neat little combo you can pull off with the Tenyi search spell, any Tenyi monster and a way to get Aleister (I'll detail that later). You won't be normal summoning Aleister until late into your turn, after all your Tenyi plays. Even when Nibiru is played, you should be able to end on a Sahasrara and/or an Invoked monster, if you get either Aleister or the field spell.  A few problems with the deck as it is: there are hardly any negates (you typically won't be getting SAVAGE first turn, if ever, and Mechaba is only 1), feeble draw power (someone will figure out that one, also I'm lazy and didn't imput Desires, so that is a viable option. Prosperity is only useful because you can choose what to banish, but generally your Extra Deck is necessary), lack of removal, and a lack of viable floodgate bypasses (pretty much anything will kill it). The power of the deck is underwhelming as it is, but this can be ammended in future installations. Let me know what you think!  Here's the combo for you: <ol>  	<li>Special Summon whatever Tenyi you have</li>  	<li>Link to Monk</li>  	<li>Activate <a data-name=""Vessel for the Dragon Cycle"">Vessel for the Dragon Cycle</a>, mill Mare Mare, add Ashuna or Adhara or Mapura (depending on what Invoked you want)</li>  	<li>Special Summon the Tenyi you have</li>  	<li>Link to Shaman</li>  	<li>Special Summon Mare Mare from grave using Shaman. Use Mare Mare to get 2 (or 3) tokens.</li>  	<li>Link Shaman and 2 (or 3) tokens to Ashuna</li>  	<li>Use Mare to get another token to make him Lvl. 4 if you haven't already</li>  	<li>Normal Summon Aleister, adding Invocation (if necessary, get the field spell to search him out)</li>  	<li>Synchro Summon Draco Berserker using Mare Mare and Aleister (SAVAGE won't activate because of Shaman)</li>  	<li>Use Invocation to bring out appropriate Invoked (you usually want to go for Mechaba, since it's a negate).</li> </ol>"

Go with the flow!,Final Edition!  After several playtest against all kind of decks this is the best I can put together.  1. Invoked Purgatory because of Urara(Ash).  2. Freeze Bell because some time Glass Bell will bricked your hand. Use her and Glass to get Clear Wing.  3. Invoked Raidjin because he can be play with Windbitch.  4. Do not forget to use Aleister ON THE FIELD to get other things out before going to Invocation.  5. Magicians' Soul to get Mana or DMG to GY then use them as u like.  6. Magicians' Soul to recycle Meltdown after u get your fusion.  7. Always Silent Magician on Aleister.  8. Quintet Magician is your go-to trump card.  9. Fortune Lady Every because she is cute.  10. If u have all 5 Windwitches on your board it can end up with 1 Clear Wing and 1 Diamond Bell.  11. Artemis purpose is to link away for Invoked Mechaba.  I would love to add 1 Magi Magi * Magician Gal but she is not available in TCG (but I play her in my physical copy deck anyway.)  Magicians' Soul is dirt cheap in OCG. Damn You Konami!!!  PS. Everything is better just add Dragoon.

Use Great Sand Sea to XYZ summon Ship, attach the Springans as material per their effect, detach them to target a zone, and boom! Board broken. The Scrap engine helps with consistency. Using it to send Springans to the graveyard is helpful because they can attach to Ship from the GY. It's also useful to spam out effect monsters as Anaconda mats for the Dragoon engine, if you choose to main that. Zeus works with mostly every XYZ strategy, and adds another board wipe."

Are you a Yugi-Boomer (like me) who just want simple unga bunga smackdown caveman Yu-Gi-Oh? This dec,"Tried of boring combos and brain numbing dueling? Are you a Yugi-Boomer (like me) who just want simple unga bunga smackdown caveman Yu-Gi-Oh? Excited to break your opponent's board that they so lovingly crafted the last 10 minutes with their ridiculously long cardplay (zzzZZZzzz)? Wanna obliterate your opponent with an oldschool 15 year old card in one single attack? Gren Maju OTK is the perfect deck for you!  &nbsp;  Popularized by the venerable <em>Yishan McNabb</em> nearly two years ago by gaining second place in YCS August 2019 during the infamous control heavy ""TOSS"" format, this Gren Maju OTK made a surprising splash as a rogue meta contender ever since.  &nbsp;  This deck focuses on the straight forward strategy banishment into one shot kill with a ridiculously OMEGA-POWERFUL high attack <span><strong>Gren Maju De Eiza</strong></span>, who gains 400 attack from everyone of your banished cards. This deck is best-tailored with cards and engines best enable this simple strategy.  &nbsp;  <span>This deck features <span><strong>3 packages that feature level 8 monsters</strong> </span>that pair nicely with Trade-In (Discard lvl8 for +2 draw) and allows rank 8 plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong>Danger! Package</strong> are composed of absolute chonkers that special summon themselves from the hand and a +1 draw if special summoned successfully with their effect - given if you're lucky. If they get discarded with their own effect, they destroy a card on the field. <strong>Danger! Bigfoot</strong> destroys face-up cards, while <strong>Danger! Thunderbird</strong> destroys face-downs. They have incredible synergy with Trade-In, not only you get a +2 draw when you discard a Danger! monster, you get to destroy a card on the field!  <strong>Golden Castle Package</strong> features the field spell <strong>Golden Castle of Stromberg</strong>, which simultaneously destroys attacking monsters for burn damage and special summons from the deck <strong>Hexe Trude</strong> (level 8 with 1 destruction per turn) and <strong>Glife the Phantom Bird</strong> (Golden Castle searcher and backrow destruction). Golden Castle also banishes 10 cards from your maindeck everyturn, additionally boosting Gren Maju's attack! Funnily with Golden Castle on the field, opponents usually never read the additional card text on it and still foolishly attack with their monsters - blowing up their monster for delicious burn damage!  <strong>Kaiju Package</strong> are one of your ultimate board breaking tools! Tribute away their invincible towers (I'm looking at you Dragoon &gt;:c) or their annoying quick effect monster (I hate you Altergeist Silquitous)! Our monsters of choice are the level 8 <strong>Gameciel</strong> (chosen for its relatively low 2200 attack, making OTKs slightly easier) and <strong>Gadarla</strong>. <strong>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</strong> clears an entire field of monsters as long as there is a copy of Gameciel and Gadarla in the still in the deck. Try to use this before you banish your main deck so you don't accidentally banish your kaijus!  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>Field Equalizers</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  As a dedicated going second deck, deck features field equalizers that obliterate your opponent's field to wipe away all opposition, so that Gren Maju De Eiza can annihilate!  <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> is The most expensive card in the deck (About $100 each as of this writing) and it is incredibly powerful. It can wipe either backrow or attack position monsters given the player using it doesn't have face-up cards. This is useful going second and the gren maju player will have plenty of opportunity to use this card because their field will mostly be empty. This card can be replaced by a cheaper alternative like Twin Twisters or Dark Hole (still not quite the same or as powerful unfortunately, hope this card gets reprinted soon).  <strong>Raigeki</strong> is a great card and requires no explanation, smash your opponent's monsters!  <strong>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</strong> clears an entire field of monsters as long as there is a copy of Gameciel and Gadarla in the still in the deck. Try to use this before you banish your main deck so you don't accidentally banish your kaijus!  <strong>Dinowrestler Pankratops</strong> is the only non-spell card featured in the board breaking line-up. It is a dedicated going-second card that puts a free body on board, and it can tribute itself to destroy any card on the field.  For backrow heavy decks, exchange cards in your deck like<strong> Twin Twisters</strong> or <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>. (For example, you won't need kaijus as much vs. Mystic Mine, so replace the entire kaiju package with backrow hate like this.) Other cards like Gizmek Orochi and Hexe Trude provide singular card destruction as well to assist with board breaking. If something is particularly difficult to get rid of, Dingirsu can send a card from the field to the GY.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Banishment Enablers</strong></span>  &nbsp;  Gren Maju feeds on the souls of the banished to boost his attack by 400 for every banished card! We have several cards that banish en masse in this deck to serve their Banished Emperor, Gren Maju.  <strong>Pot of Desires</strong> is almost a free +2 draw for Gren Maju players, boosting his attack by 4000 everytime this card is used. Careful about banishing important parts of your packages, it may render some cards like Golden Castle of Stromberg or Interrupted Kaiju Slumber un-useable.  <strong>Eater of Millions</strong> in addition to having a badass name, it also is a force to be reckoned with for every monster it battles. Its attack features non-targeting banishment, serving as a out to meta threats like Dragoon! It has unusual protection too, and it cannot be used as material for fusion so it cannot be removed with Super Poly! It can get pretty big, gaining+100 attack for every facedown banished card so it can hit over big targets. A favourite play of mine is banishing my entire extra deck, netting +6000 attack for Gren Maju!  <strong>Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher</strong> functions as an excellent banishment tool because it banishes cards as a cost for it's effects, further boosting Gren Maju De Eiza's attack. It can also serve as a body shield when you're in a pinch, because it can summon itself from the graveyard as a quick effect. Orochi assists with rank 8 plays. If this card is XYZ material for a rank 8, detach it first so it can resurrect itself for the GY! To top it all off, Orochi can destroy a face-up monster on the field for the low cost 3 banished extra deck cards!  <strong>Dimension Shifter</strong> is arguably the strongest and most underrated hand trap, shutting off graveyard access for both players by banishing every card sent to the graveyard until the end of next turn it is activated. Almost every deck is reliant on the GY nowadays, and Dimension Shifter effectively shuts them down. If you see this guy in your opening hand, the duel's momentum is yours for a while, giving you plenty of space and time to OTK with Gren Maju!  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span>  &nbsp;  The extra deck serves not only as fodder to summon Eater of Millions, it is full of toolbox options for your rank 8 plays, as well as link plays as you swarm the board with a ton of special summons.  The terrific trio of the ""Number Dragons"" <strong>Number 97: Draglubion, Number 38: Hope Harbinger</strong> and <strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon</strong> provide a lot of utility and usage of the multiple level 8 monsters in this deck. Draglubion also enables the easy summon of Hope Harbinger and Numeron Dragon. Hope Harbinger is terrific going first, as it allows for a spell negate. An even more powerful play going second is clearing the board then summoning Numeron Dragon off Draglubion and hitting for 9000ATK! If Gren Maju is inaccessible, Numeron Dragon is this deck's secondary way to OTK.  <strong>Number 68: Sanaphond</strong> is also another going first option, shutting off GY summons until the end of the opponent's turn. Personally, I hardly ever make this card. It may serve to stifle the occasional deck that loves GY summons like Salamangreat or Zombies.  <strong>Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</strong> is simultaneously a great removal option and blanket protection from destruction. A good play I like to do with this guy is protecting Golden Castle of Stromberg by using Hexe Trude + another level 8 as material just to stall until I draw the perfect card.  The link monsters<strong> Knightmare Unicorn/Phoenix</strong> provide target removal. The Topologic duo of <strong>Zeroboros</strong> and <strong>Trisbaena</strong> provide banishment removal, and is best triggered by summoning Gizmek Orochi during your opponent's turn. <strong>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</strong> is a great way to make use of the high level monsters on your field to provide his extra protection and is a great boss monster.  &nbsp;  Link 1 monsters <strong>Linkuriboh</strong> and <strong>Relinquished Anima</strong> provide a way for level 1 Eater of Millions more utility. A great way to use Relinquished Anima is to suck up the kaiju you summoned to your opponent's field to further clear their field.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Side Deck</strong></span>  &nbsp;  The side deck features cards that destroy the current meta. Change it according to how the meta changes. The best cards to switch out of this deck are the Kaiju and Golden Castle packages. Switch them out as needed verses particular decks. For example vs. combo (ex. Virtual World), you switch in <strong>Nibiru</strong>. Verses decks that love to banish (ex. dino) you switch in <strong>Artifact Lancea</strong>. Against decks that use heavy backrow (ex. Eldlich) trade in <strong>Twin Twisters</strong> and <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster.</strong> The <strong>Psy-Frame Gamma Package</strong> also provides a lot of utility with this deck as well, especially when you want to negate + destroy an important choke point (ex. Halqifibrax/Isolde).  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>Final Comments</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  This deck is definitely strong, but it does have it's weaknesses. It really has no strong going first play, and you can only hope that your opponent does not OTK you on the following turn. If you don't manage to OTK your opponent, this deck has little to no ability to grind out a game - once you run out of resources, you deck yourself out because you banished everything you own.  This deck is super fun and easy to play. It has highly potent board breaking capabilities, it is very consistent, and high game-ending attack on board is easy to achieve. Games are finished quickly, it is relatively stress free, and it's pretty straightforward. I highly recommend bringing this if it is your first time in locals and you are worried you may misplay from nervousness or something. There is something super satisfying beating your opponent to a pulp with one singular attack with a super-powerful monster, which hearkens memories of simple caveman Yu-Gi-Oh from ancient times.  &nbsp;  Good luck have fun duelists! o7"

No importa si es negado, ya que lo importante es el costo de enviar al cementerio a Graff para invocar del Deck a Cir (Ojo, si Cherubini mantiene sus efectos negados, Cir se destruirá si tenemos otros monstruos, así que cuidado).</li>  	<li>Hacemos link summon con cherubini y Cir, con lo que se activará el efecto de este último y así invocaremos nuevamente a Cherubini. El monstruo link que invocaremos dependerá de la ruta que elijamos, la cual a su vez depende de cuántos extenders tengamos disponibles.</li> </ol> Ruta segura (Número de extenders iniciales requerido: 4+. Monstruo: Apollousa): <ol>  	<li>Al tener 2 extenders extra además de los usados para invocar a Cherubini, usaremos un material link más para ir por Apollousa. Opcionalmente si hay más extenders, se le puede invocar con 4 materiales para tener las 4 negaciones, pero siempre dejando 1 para el siguiente paso. También es importante no poner demasiados cuerpos, ya que más tarde van a estorbar.</li>  	<li>Con el extender sobrante y el Cherubini revivido por el efecto de Cir, invocaremos por link a Codebreaker virus swordsman, colinkeado a Apollousa. Esto activará el efecto de invocar del Deck a Codebreaker zero day.</li>  	<li>Ahora procederemos a invocar a Codebreaker berserker usando los dos codebreaker, siempre en el medio para invocar de vuelta los otros 2 a ambos lados usando su efecto.</li>  	<li>Usamos a los codebreaker link para invocar a Isolde. Añadimos cualquier descarte e invocamos a Armageddon knight. Para los equipos a descartar, es importante enviar Phoenix blade (combo guerrero), Sword of sparkles (ya verán) y Cursed bamboo sword (para añadirnos una magia a la mano).</li>  	<li>Armageddon enviará al cementerio a Summoner monk, y usaremos a Armageddon y Codebreaker zero day para obtener a Dugares y así invocarlo de vuelta. Es importante que ambos monstruos sean invocados donde NO apunta Apollousa.</li>  	<li>Activamos el efecto del Phoenix blade para desterrar a dos guerreros cualquiera para añadirlo a la mano y lo descartamos como el coste del Summoner monk para invocar al Rescue ferret.</li>  	<li>Nos deshacemos de Isolde con el efecto de Sword of sparkles en el cementerio y activamos el efecto de Ferret para traer a Speedroid red-eyed dice, Plaguespreader zombie y a Edge imp sabres o Phantom knights of silent boots (dependiendo si ya hemos usado uno o el otro, si no cualquier otro no tuner estará bien, pero tendremos un cuerpo menos para sacrificar más adelante)</li>  	<li>Invocamos por sincronía a Rose maiden con el Plaguespreader y el monstruo de nivel 3 que elegimos para obtener el Black garden. Traemos nuevamente el Plaguespreader con su efecto para invocar nuevamente por sincronía al Shooting riser dragon.</li>  	<li>Con el efecto del Riser dragon enviamos al cementerio el World legacy - world chalice en nuestro Deck (en realidad cualquier World legacy de nivel 6 o menor está bien) y activamos el Black garden.</li>  	<li>Invocamos a Flame swordsman usando a Summoner monk y el Speedroid dice, tras lo cual activaremos el Black garden y traeremos de vuelta al Summoner monk.</li>  	<li>Usamos el efecto de Phoenix blade para traerla a la mano por segunda vez (debería quedar por lo menos un guerrero en el cementerio todavía) y la usamos como coste del Summoner monk para traer el Pathfinder.</li>  	<li>Activamos el efecto del Pathfinder para traer a la mano el Lair of darkness (el cual activaremos) e invocamos a Lib usando al Summoner monk y el Flame swordsman.</li>  	<li>Con el efecto de Lib colocaremos el World legacy succession y nuevamente traeremos al Summoner monk.</li>  	<li>Traeremos por última vez el Phoenix blade desterrando el guerrero que quedaba y el Flame swordsman, y lo usamos de costo para el Summoner monk para traer a Shadowpriestess of ohm.</li>  	<li>Usando el efecto de Ohm nos desharemos de Lib y Dugares (1600) y usaremos al Summoner monk junto con el Riser dragon para invocar a Halqifibrax.</li>  	<li>Con Halqifibrax traemos al Speedroid den-den y usamos a ambos para invocar a Auroradon y activar su efecto, con lo que tendremos un link y 3 fichas para sacrificar con Ohm (1600 + 3200 = 4800).</li>  	<li>Para el resto, usaremos el efecto de Rose maiden para traer el Riser dragon, el efecto de Speedroid den-den para traer al Speedroid dice y el efecto de la carta de nivel 3 que elegimos (si es Sabres, se invoca solo; si es Silent boots, traemos a Brigandine y lo invocamos) (4800 + 800 + 800 + 800 = 7200)</li>  	<li>Para el último monstruo podemos usar a Apollousa o a la misma Ohm (7200 + 800 = 8000). GG. Si por alguna razón usaste a Sabres y Boots al inicio y te faltan 2 sacrificios, puedes usar ambos (Apollousa y Ohm).</li> </ol> Ruta parcialmente segura (Número de extenders iniciales requerido: 3. Monstruo: Tenyi) <ol>  	<li>A diferencia de la primera ruta, sólo tenemos un extender adicional que debemos guardar para el codebreaker, así que usaremos solamente a Cherubini y Cir para invocar a Tenyi.</li>  	<li>El resto va igual hasta llegar al paso 7 de la ruta segura. En este punto, en lugar de activar el efecto de Sword of sparkles, usaremos a Isolde junto con Tenyi para invocar a Apollousa.</li>  	<li>El combo continúa igual hasta el final.</li> </ol> Tips: <ul>  	<li>Apollousa es útil para sacar del juego casi cualquier handtrap, aprovechando que Impermanence ya no se usa mucho y que Called está a 1 copia (por ahora 7w7)</li>  	<li>Edge imp sabres y Plaguespreader zombie pueden usarse para enviar garnets en tu mano de vuelta al Deck. Algunos garnets que debes devolver serían los targets de Rescue Ferret o Armageddon Knight y el monstruo World legacy.</li>  	<li>Si tienes el Sword of sparkles o el Phoenix blade en la mano, puedes descartarlo en el primer uso del Summoner monk.</li>  	<li>Si tienes al Armageddon knight en tu mano, puedes invocar en su lugar al Dark grepher, usando como coste al Armageddon knight.</li>  	<li>Link spider ayuda a Brigandine a ser usado para invocar al Codebreaker swordsman.</li>  	<li>Si robas el Black garden, puedes usarlo como coste del Summoner monk, ya que el efecto de Rose maiden lo añadirá del cementerio a tu mano más adelante.</li>  	<li>No encontré cómo hacer el combo con 2 extenders, ya que es necesario ir por los codebreaker y no tenemos a Halqifibrax disponible porque lo usaremos luego (si encuentran una forma quiero saberla 7w7).</li> </ul> Pros: <ul>  	<li>Deck extremadamente consistente, tiene pocos bricks y/o garnets.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Se adapta a los recursos que tengamos en mano.</li>  	<li>Protegido constantemente por Apollousa, por lo que es difícil de contrarrestarlo una vez toca el campo.</li>  	<li>No requiere tanta exactitud, varias invocaciones pueden hacerse con otros materiales link, por ejemplo, y de cometerse pequeños errores es posible volver al camino.</li>  	<li>No requiere demasiados recursos para realizar el combo, con 3 es suficiente para iniciar.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps tempranas con los extenders suficientes.</li> </ul> Contras: <ul>  	<li>El Deck depende del burn finito, por lo que si el oponente activa cartas como Ghost sister u otras que aumenten sus LP, será gg.</li>  	<li>Aún teniendo protección, el Deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Impermanence y Called by the grave si son usados correctamente.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, se requieren 3+ Extenders para funcionar, lo cual puede no pasar a veces.</li>  	<li>Si destruyen a Cherubini antes de activar su efecto y no hay forma de invocarlo del cementerio, también es gg.</li> </ul>"

The only downside is that it's kind of difficult to shuffle such a big deck lol. Running the Dragoon package of course, because it's a powerful boss monster. Same with Ulimate Conductor Tyranno. With Double Evolution Pill you just need one Dino in your hand or GY, and Misc/Archosaur can help you get there consistently. Eldlich is overall a strong archetype, and all the spell cards makes it easy to summon Golden Lord. Ten Thousand Dragon is great for OTK'ing your opponent in one attack. Catches your opponent off-guard, and is very satisfying to pull off! Dogmatika is good at disrupting your opponent. Invoked lets you get to Mechaba for more negates, and there are plenty of light-attribute targets in the deck. Dragonmaids are an interesting tech option I've been exploring to unbrick if you aren't able to summon 10k Dragon. Similarly, the Evil HEROs are quite powerful and difficult to deal with. Aside from the main archetypes, some solid competitive staples are included because you can't really go wrong with them.  The extra deck is mostly straightforward, with the fusion monsters being associated with the above archetypes. Gustav Max is easy to go into with Golden Lord, UCT, and 10k Dragon all being level 10. From there you can burn and go into Liebe for massive damage, and if they're still alive somehow you go into Zeus! Underworld Goddess is a great removal option since linking your opponent's monsters gets around pretty much all forms of protection. Accesscode, BLS, and Anaconda are insane. Anima is good to go into from Archosaur, and stealing your opponent's monster is pretty cool.  Overall, I think this is a very powerful deck that pretty much anyone can afford. It is a highly unpredictable deck that can switch from slow control style to fast-paced OTK. It has outs for any situation I could think of. The only thing is I wanted to incorporate Drytrons as well, but the special summon restriction makes it hard to work. Regardless, I could see this becoming a Tier 1 or maybe even Tier 0 deck in the near future!  If this deck is still a little outside your price range, feel free to swap Infinite Impermanence for Effect Veiler."

Featuring an omni-negate boss monster (Sheou), and various starters to gain access to your fusion spell and 30 million extenders, this deck is probably the main deck to make use of the Hieratic link monster. The deck can make use of dragon link-esque guardragon combos, as well as various interruptions in the form of the hieratic link, and the trap Dragonmaid Tidying.  tl;dr dragon maid waifus gain advantage every turn because of their angry boss monster who turns into her normal self after saying no as well as going +2 every standby phase.

The deck needs its entire hand to function, so if your board gets broken you're SOL When handtrapped you might still have some wiggle room to squeeze out a Dragoon or I:P + Dragoon for some basic interruption.  This deck can't go second. Win the die roll.  The side deck is format dependent, but the Gameciels and Dark Rulers have stuck around for a while in an attempt to mitigate the going second problem. If you really wanna make going second not suck, you can side in the cards to swap your Dragoon engine for a Rainbow Neos engine in game 2."

You want to get Mara on board with joy to grab Oneiromancy or Black Knight, if you cant then you go fully into chaos combo's.  Dangers are their to help get extra monsters on board and to add extra Allure of Darkness targets, I suggest only using them once you use all your important cards unless you have Effect Veiler in hand.  If you are able to keep you normal summon by getting one for one, you can extend with Effect Veiler to make Halqifibrax which can then climb into Selene or Unicorn, depending on if you have enough spells in grave and on field.  More optional cards are: <ul>  	<li>Chaos Daedelus unless you want to add Hypnagogia.</li>  	<li>Dream Mirror Disciple as its just an extender for Phantasms if you are unable to get the correct field spell with Mara although it does make using Set Rotation alot safer as you can return the field spell back to hand.</li>  	<li>Effect Veiler, Halqifibrax and Selene if the cost is too high or you would rather run some other extra deck options and alternative hand traps (preferably light/dark).</li> </ul>"

As noted, this is a very casual deck I experiment with to play with friends  Other ideas: * Haven’t added 1.5-card Spheres engines (to dilute the combo pieces) since these combo pieces so far aren’t horrible in-hand… and Dragunity Remus w/ Guisarme could be a nice discard engine * Hieratic Seal of Creation: Personally reallllly like to send it to the GY (Foolish Burial Goods/Brotaur) because it can revive Spheres...&amp; Hieratic+Brotaur+Spheres is a fast Apollusa * Rose Dragons are really powerful fun (&amp; Roxrose is a 1-card Spheres!), but for consistency, I’d likely add a copy of each Dragonmaid instead...? * Armed Dragon LV7, LV3, &amp; Flash with Twin Triangle are powerful but VERY clunky (fun tho) * Pile Armed Dragon is good but doesn’t seem to have enough unique advantages over Darkflare in this build (currently. Will keep in mind) * Avoided Rokkets for a deckbuilding challenge, may optimized with it again soon * Removed Seyfert since this deck has plenty of normal summons &amp; already likes to search the small chaos dragons with Tempest, may consider 1 copy * Abhyss: could replace Halqi-Auroradon as a Nibiru back-up plan if drawn into * Stardust Synchron: could replace Halqi-Auroradon as a Nibiru back-up plan if drawn into, currently looking for ways to make &amp; destroy Chaofeng to search it (not necessary, just for curiosity) * Been thinking about adding Dogmatika+Shadolls * If anyone wants to shrink this deck size, I’d recommend removing some of my combo pieces to build your deck with a Codebreakers and Phantom Knights engine  Hieratic Discord link: <a>discord.com/invite/rmdXrbX</a>  EXTRA DECK combo order: right-to-left for playtesting in EDOPro"

Uses Halq, Selene, Acesscode to end games. Doe","This is not a particularly optimized deck list for competitiveness, but it avoids alot of my feels bad moment like drawing 2 copies of the handtrap or some garnet and it doesnt play floodgates.  &nbsp;  3x Raye: It starts your engine and keeps it going.  3x Roze: Its extra copies of Raye that can occasionally help steal games. Can be bricky, but I prefer opening it with Raye then not having link access at all. It also helps in outing Dragoon by running over Verte and negating Dragoon, and then using Zeke/Afterburner to delay/remove threat.  3x Area Zero: Helps even out your hands, and a goodextender to close games.  3x Shark Cannon: Its graveyard disruption helps alot, and revive can leads to interesting game states.  3x Window Anchor: Disruption, and help close out games by attacking with the monster you steal.  2x Afterburner: Removal for chunky monsters. Feel free to use it as a way to pop Area Zero or using it on your own monster to get rid of a backrow.  1x Jamming Wave: Remove unknown backrow, but the non targeting destruction is also good.  1x Drone: Consistency Booster, might be used as a extender to link climb, but it haven't came up for me.  1x Eagle Booster: A really funny one-of, I use it to protect Shizuku in the end phase or Accesscode against Nibiru(Selene summoning veiler is the 5th summon tho) and during your opponents turn.  1xMultirole : Help clean up your MMZ, clear the way for your spells, and get tons of advantage.  2x Foolish Burial Goods: 3 is a bit too much since its HOPT, and it allows you to use Kagari without using Hayate. It also helps with the spell count in grave.  1x Metalfoes Fusion: There are a lot of ways to pop this, so drawing it doesn't hurt too bad, and it makes Foolish Burial Goods another way to draw Raye, and Area Zero into a +1  2x Pot of Desires: It's a really good card, but since the decks has 4 cycle cards, I feel comfortable with how much I see it. Also, its HOPT, and I dont like banishing 20 cards.  2x Forbidden Droplets: Dragoon out, and can fulfil the 3x spells in grave cost by sending the activated spells on the field as cost. The half attack is really neat. I play 2 because widow anchor does the same thing most of the time.  2x Ash Blossom: Disruption  2x Ghost Ogre: Disruption  2x Belle: Disruption  2x Veiler: Disruption, but also needed for the halq selene combo  1x Reinforcement of the Army: Find Raye or Roze  Terraforming: Extra Spells in the grave  Ice Dragon Prison: Dragoon out #3  Upstart: Free Spell  &nbsp;  Turn 1:  Objective: Not Die  Try to get a Sky Striker link on board, and set up your disruption.  Foolish Burial Goods to get a Anchor or a Shark Cannon, or Multirole if you can benefit from the resetting during the EP.  *If you have multirole, you can search Anchor during EP with Shizuku and use it on her to reset using multirole.  Turn 2-3:  Objective: Establish Parity and 3+ Spells in Grave  If you went first, try to disrupt your opponent so that that you will have Raye during the EP.  If you went second, try to break the board while making sure Raye stays in rotation. If you manage to establish 3+ spells in grave, use the additionally effects of Window Anchor to go into Zeke to remove 2 monsters. Make sure to chip in extra damage, since Accesscode can't kill them from 8000.  &nbsp;  Turn 3-4:  Objective: Establish a winning position  If its your turn, use the empowered effect of your spells to accelerate in card advantage or look for ways to get end the game. Look for stray tuners, and some combination of Window Anchor, Raye and Roze with Area Zero.  If its your opponent's turn, evaluate your cards in hand and consider saving cards like Widow Anchor and Shark Cannon to end the game. Acesscode talker can usually clear 4 cards easily, so letting them build a field might not be the worst idea if your Window Anchor and Shark Cannon can be used more aggressively.  &nbsp;  Turn 5+:  Objective: Win  At this point, multirole should likely be in play, and with 3+ spells in grave, each of your spells generate +2-3 card advantage. However, Sky Striker links are likely almost depleted, so make sure at all point to look for ways to kill your opponent. At I find 6 thousand life is my standard reach in most games. I can clear the board, Summon Raye and Roze, and pop Area Zero to get the 3rd copy, and deal 6k with Raye summoning the last striker link during combat.  &nbsp;  <strong>Cards to not run:</strong>  Scissor Cross: Its a neat card to play since it helps you end games way easier, but your most important objective is to survive turn 1-2 and let your cards out advantage your opponent. You can maybe consider cutting Roze for this Shizuku search as insurance, but it feels bricky and win more.  &nbsp;  Hercules Base: This gives the deck a great amount of grind, Kagari can recur this ad infinitum, but it doesn't help me survive when I need to, and I should be winning when Hercules Base is getting value.  &nbsp;  Utopia Double: I don't like Double or Nothing, loses to ash and desires.  &nbsp;  Pot of Avarice: It bricks turn 1, and it bricks when you don't have Raye. This is when you are most vulnerable, so I don't run it. It feels great when it resolves though.  &nbsp;  Toon Table of Content: Might be okay when it was MR4 with Toon Cyber Dragon and Engage, but getting 3 spells early isn't worth it for it.  &nbsp;  Dragoon: Its not fun for me or other people, and its bricky.  &nbsp;  <strong>Cards to Consider:</strong>  Cosmic Cyclone: Its difficult to get rid of face up spell and traps without waiting a few turns.  &nbsp;  Handtraps: They are mostly flex spots except for veiler, so feel free to swap those anytime.  &nbsp;  Borrelsword/Generic Link: Sometime I find myself with awkward amount of materials to link climb with.  &nbsp;  Relinquished Anima : Turns a level one into a spellcaster for Selene. It can be useful if you find yourself with crow in your hand or opponent's graveyard.  &nbsp;  Called by the Grave: Its good, but people really like playing Gamma.  &nbsp;  Triple Tactical Talent: Maybe for going second, but I am not sure how I feel about this.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Anyways, this is a Scrap Kaiju deck featuring Scrap Raptor, one of the best cards that Scraps have gotten in a long time. When I read Scrap Raptor's effects, I figured out that it plus Interrupted Kaiju Slumber or Scrap Factory can lead to an OTK. By himself, Scrap Raptor is a 1-card Avramax that was Link Summoned with I:P Masquerena!    &nbsp;  Anyways, this deck's whole goal is to go second and OTK. Because of Scrap Raptor's effects, you wanna draw this card or a card that searches it as often as possible. But if you have to go first, use Scrap Raptor's effects to summon Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax with I:P Masquerena.  &nbsp;  As for this deck's name,  I named it after ""Godzilla Interception Operation Awaji"", a real-life tourist attraction on Awaji Island, Japan. Godzilla Interception Operation Awaji is part of the Nijigen No Mori theme park on said island. It comes with 4 main parts:   1. A theatre playing a short exclusive film. To keep with the theme of GIOA, those who come to it will be sent to the theater, where they will watch a 7-minute short film explaining why Godzilla is on Awaji Island. It also explains what the other parts are.   2. A Godzilla zipline and statue. Inside GIOA, there is a 65-foot/20-meter tall, 180-foot/55-meter long statue of Shin Godzilla with his mouth open. There are two ziplines which allow guests to actually glide in Shin Godzilla's mouth!   3. A shooting game. There's also a game in which people can pick up fake guns and shoot at Godzilla's cells.   4. The official Godzilla Museum. Godzilla Interception Operation Awaji has the world's first-ever permanent Godzilla-themed museum. The Godzilla Museum features dioramas of scenes from the films, as well as figures of the monsters, and material involving the Godzilla movies in general!  So if any of you plan on going to Japan once the COVID-19 pandemic is over, BOOM! Now you have a good reason to!"

You just need to summon <strong>Halq while having lv2 non-tuner in GY</strong>. Both Revealer of the Ice Barrier and Deep Sea Diva accomplishes it by ss-ing Hexa Spirit which then sends Prior (lv2 non-tuner) making us have 9 starters with Medallion Ice Barrier RotA.
