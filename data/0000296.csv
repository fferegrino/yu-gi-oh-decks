There are many Dark Magician and Branded Fusion searches and the goal is to get Dark Magician and any other fusion material you need into the grave yard so you can fusion summon the various Magician fusions with Lubellion. Dragoon as always is a good going first option, while I've had good luck with Master of Chaos as a going second card due to his mass monster banish effect (which sets itself up if you summon him with Lubellion)."

Noble knights are a combo based deck that have a lot of flipping through the deck, in return you can quickly dump out things like xyz monsters. Sadly it’s usually a little underwhelming. But it’s the thought that counts, right?  You see, noble knights may have recycling sources but the only way they have a follow up play is Isolde’s typical search, gearfried. So what happens now? You can’t just dump one negate on your second turn and expect to win.  Here’s where poker knights come in, not only are they effective at their job they got a lot of synergy with noble knights in they way they work.  A: though they lock your extra to light warriors noble knights themselves will lock the extra to noble knights, and most of them are light warriors with a couple exceptions.  B: they recycle the light warriors in your graveyard and refresh your hand, pretty good if you ask me  C: the queen knight s a normal, this allows it to be of use with gawayn, see where I’m getting here?  And D: they usually don’t get in the way of Noble Knights from my experience so far.  Though the usual endboard is a little underwhelming the deck has a follow up most of the time."

This was submitted for the Novakin Membership Anime Tournament.,"We want to get Supernova out as soon as possible.  Crimson Resonator and Wildwind can special summon themselves to the field. Step 1 is to always go into Red Rising Dragon which will get back your resonator from the GY. Crimson Resonator can activate his effect and bring 2 other resonators to the field. From here you can go straight into Supernova Dragon. Friendly Reminder: His Quick Effect to banish everything will get him back to you next turn, but the opponent's cards won't return.  If you want, since you didn't use your Normal Summon, you can bring another 4 star to synchro with one of the resonators.  This opens up more plays as you can go into other synchros like Beelze who has a lot of protection or Hot Red Abyss for a free  Effect Negate."

The U.A. playstyle of constantly switching out monsters with offensive capabilities with monsters with defensive capabilities after the battle phase allows for multiple plays depending on your starting hand. Some cards, like <a data-name=""The Warrior Returning Alive"">The Warrior Returning Alive</a>, ROTA, <a data-name=""Planet Pathfinder"">Planet Pathfinder</a>, and <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> are added to allow you to more consistently get your level 4 monsters in your hands and the field spells which allow you to get a decent amount of card advantage for normal summoning those level 4s. <a data-name=""Witch's Strike"">Witch's Strike</a> has also been added to disrupt your opponent should any of your defense line monster's effects get negated, but you could also swap this out with backrow removal as I've found most decks don't run nearly as many negates as other formats. The best way to learn this deck is to play around with combos on your own, though if you need some tips to get started, you want to have as at least 2 of your level 4s in your hand as soon as possible, but if you have the option to create your starting offensive line (Mighty Slugger and Dreadnought Dunker are fantastic options for this), your starting defensive line (Block Backer and Perfect Ace are good choices for this), and your ""waiting bench"" line (These are cards whose effects activate/are most effective when summoned during your opponents turn, namely Player Manager for easy board control or Rival Rebounder for swarming), then you should get that set first and do everything to make sure you have at least 1 of your level 4s in hand by the end of your turn, or some way to protect it on the field or return it to the hand during your opponents turn. If you're having trouble getting over tricky monsters like Machina Ruinforce and the level 10 Floowandereeze, we run 3 U.A. Penalty Boxes for that exact reason. My current win/loss ratio with this current version during this event is 11/8, though the addition of Adventure or backrow destruction may help if you find yourself stuck often. Enjoy fantasy football as you've never played it before!</p>"

Proceed with the Synchro Summon.  c) If any <strong><b>Naturia Plant Monster </b></strong>and <strong><b>Naturia Sacred Tree</b></strong> are in Hand:  Normal Summon/Set that Plant monster, and set the <strong><b>Nat. Sacred Tree</b></strong>.  This method is kind of similar to method a), though riskier, but still rewarding when it works.  d) If <strong><b>Double Summon</b></strong>, a Lvl 2/3 Tuner, and another monster are in Hand:  The Level combination you can expect here are [Lvl 2 Tuner &amp; Lvl 3], [Lvl 2 Tuner &amp; Lvl 4], [Lvl 3 Tuner &amp; Lvl 2], [Lvl 3 Tuner and Lvl 3], and [Lvl 3 Tuner &amp; Lvl 4]. Whichever the combination may be, you’ll be able to summon one of the three Naturia bosses.  &nbsp; <p>When taking <strong><b>SECOND TURN</b></strong>:</p> <p>(When you don’t have any cards mentioned in the NOTE)</p> e. If <strong><b>Naturia Cabbage </b></strong>and another Tuner are in Hand:  You can immediately Summon an Naturia Boss with this method. And since, this is already the second turn, your opponent might have set several trap cards in their field, so I recommend trying to summon <strong><b>Nat. Barkion</b></strong>, but it still depends on the play.  f. If <strong><b>Naturia Cabbage </b></strong>and <strong><b>Naturia Ladybug</b></strong> are in Hand:  This might happen at some point where you still cannot Special Summon from the Extra Deck, but your opponent has one monster whose ATK/DEF is 2400 or lower. Use <strong><b>Nat. Cabbage</b></strong>’s effect to Special Summon <strong><b>Nat. Ladybug</b></strong>; use Ladybug’s effect to boost Cabbage’s ATK, then eliminate that monster.  g. If <strong><b>Double Summon</b></strong>, <strong><b>Naturia Marron</b></strong>, and a Tuner are in Hand:  Normal Summon and use <strong><b>Nat. Marron</b></strong>’s effect to send<strong><b> Nat. Ladybug</b></strong> to the GY. Then Normal Summon a Tuner to Summon a Naturia Synchro monster. Then, use <strong><b>Nat. Ladybug</b></strong>’s effects; special summon it, then tribute it to boost the Naturia Boss monster’s ATK."

They do work together and have potential to grow better, but this is one of the first versions of the deck. After I get enough recommendations on how to make it better, and figure out myself how to make it more consistent, it will be updated. If this looks different, its because I updated it today, So if you end up enjoying this build, be sure to check back sometime for a more consistent version.  &nbsp;  I'm back with another Frankenstein that manages to work! Branded with a Simorgh engine and Despia support. So a few days ago I bought some Albaz strike structure decks, and remembered all it takes is Artifact Scythe or D-Barrier to shut them down entirely. So I took to the abyss of cards that is my dresser to see what I had that could fix it, and I stumbled across an old favorite Archtype of mine, Simorgh! More specifically, Dark Simorgh. It's first effect allows it to summon itself from the hand or gy by banishing both a WIND and DARK monster from the opposite. Branded Despia were all dark, and Simorgh were wind, so it's summoning criteria immediately checked out. But it's second effect is what initially caught my eye, ""Your opponent cannot set any cards on the field."" This meant that If I got it out, Branded wouldn't have to worry about Scythe Baronne, D-Barrier, Eldlich, Swordsoul blackout, or having their Mirror match use a Super polymerization on your turn. So, With that weakness so effortlessly covered, it was time to mash these decks together until they worked. This deck focuses on getting Mirrorjade, El Shaddoll winda, Dark Simorgh, and Dramaturge out while pressuring your opponent with cards like Lorpar, Sauravis, Super polymerization, and Mercourier. And so while it's end game is almost the exact same as its other variants, it's a whole lot more fun to play. The deck ended up a Pricey at roughly $138, but about $93 of that come from some easily replaceable cards, albeit it makes the deck less efficient, but $45-$62 instead. So I'll be going  over how the Simorgh engine works, And what to replace if you want the cheaper version:  &nbsp;  <b>What you'll need to buy-</b>  <span> </span>  <span>Three Albaz Strike structure decks will grant you a sizeable chunk of your deck for just $30, but you won't be playing all three copies of most the cards you do get from them, So you could Buy two structure decks and the few cards needed from the third on the side for cheaper. </span>  <span>3 Super Polymerization, 2 Aluber the Jester of Despia, 3 Branded Opening, and 1 Dragonmaid Lorpar. These are the cards that make the deck Pricey and add up to Roughly $82 on their own. These can be bought individually, or from the Dawn of Majesty set, where you also have the chance of getting the $15 fusion monster I didn't include in the decklist. Later I'll explain replacement cards for them if you're looking for a cheaper version.</span>  <span>Your entire side deck comes from Albaz Strike. Those are the big two points you need to be notified about, the rest of the cards are under a dollar with the exception of three cards under three dollars. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Simorgh engine and how it works-</b>  <span> </span>  <span>The Simorgh engine consists of  3 Dark Simorgh, 3 Simorgh bird of bringing, 2 Simorgh bird of calamity, and 3 Simorgh Onslaught. And cards that expand the engine, but aren't Simorgh cards are; 1 Dragonmaid Lorpar, 1 Tempest dragon ruler of storms, 1 Sauravis the ancient and ascended, and 2 Dragon Ravine with a Terraforming. </span>  <span>In this build, your normal summon is always used on either Aluber, Albaz, or Bird of Bringing. So the usual play goes normal summon Bird of bringing to add Onslaught from your deck to your hand. then activate Onslaught to discard a Simorgh or Tri-Brigade Mercourier to add a Bird of Calamity and Dark Simorgh from your deck to your hand. Now from here there are different ways to Discard the second monster needed to summon Bird of darkness:</span> <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Use Branded fusion to Send Albaz and Dogmatika/Shaddoll monsters from the deck to the gy to fusion summon Albion, then Banish Albaz and a Dark monster to fusion summon Lubellion. now you can use Lubellion's effect to discard the other monster to fusion summon either Mirrorjade or El Shaddoll winda. Then banish your wind and Dark monster from the GY to summon Dark Simorgh.</span></li> </ol> <ol start=""2"">  	<li><span> Use Branded Opening to Discard the second monster and add your Despia monster. Now you can already summon Dark Simorgh.</span></li>  	<li><span> You can use Dragon Ravine to Discard a dark monster to send Tempest, dragon ruler of storms from your deck to your gy. Now banish both from your gy to summon Dark Simorgh. For being banished, Tempest can add Dragonmaid Lorpar from your deck to your hand.</span></li> </ol> <span> </span>  <span>And Those are the common plays for Dark Simorgh, though there are others. So onto how each card in the engine fits into the deck.</span>  <span>Starting with Dark Simorgh, It prevents your opponent from setting ANY cards, nullifying one of Branded's biggest known weaknesses. Furthermore, its both a dark monster and has over 2500ATK, so it can be used as fusion material. Lastly, banishing triggers the effects of cards like Tempest, Mercourier, and can banish monsters for its summon that Lubellion can shuffle right back into the deck.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>Dragon ravine has several uses. Discarding triggers Despian tragedy effect, and cards like Dramaturge and Albion make no impact on your end game, keeping your hand in good shape. Next, it can Dragons from the deck to the gy. This includes Tempest, Albion, and Albaz. Albion can then send branded opening from your deck to your gy to give your fusion monsters protection. Tempest can be banished from the gy to add Dragonmaid Lorpar from your deck to your hand, or can banish other monsters from the gy to summon itself. And Albaz is fusion material, and this helps you use Branded in red if you put it in the build(I personally didn't yet, but this is only day one of me having the deck).</span>  <span> </span>  <span>It sucks when you go first in a tournament and brick, it could cost you your spot in top cut. Bird of Bringing helps prevent Bricking on turn one by giving you a backup play. The backup play is Normal summon Bird of Bringing to add your needed Simorgh card( Onslaught if you don't have a way to get Dark Simorgh out, or, Dark Simorgh if you can already get a dark monster into your gy.). Now link summon Salamangreat Almiraj with bird of bringing, then link summon Secure Gardna with Salamangreat Almiraj. Now you can summon Dark Simorgh. and if you drew them, you can Summon Dogmatika Maximus by banishing Salamangreat Almiraj from your gy, and activate its effect to send two cards from your extra deck to the gy to add Albaz cards to your hand at the end phase to set up your fusion plays next turn, Dogmatika can be searched with Nadir servant. and Lastly set your D-Barrier/Super Polymerization/There can be only 1. Ending your turn 1 Brick with a Bang. Bird of Bringing is also your Simorgh engine starter as explained previously. It's last use is after all your plays are over, if it's in your gy, you can special summon it as a small defense during the battle phase.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>Tempest has a few uses. As stated previously, it can add Dragonmaid Lorpar from your deck to your hand when banished, Lorpar can discard itself to negate a Face up monsters effect or force bait a negate. Tempest can discard itself and a wind monster(usually the second material needed to get out Dark Simorgh) to add Lorpar, Albion, Sauravis, or Albaz from your deck to your hand. Keep in mind that Tempest can only use one of its three effects per turn. Sauravis is viable fusion material, and can negate pesky cards like Effect Veiler.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>Lastly, Bird of Calamity. It can send Dark Simorgh from the deck to the gy, and can revive itself at the end of your play like Bird of Bringing. Really I just needed another WIND Simorgh in the deck and it was the best option.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>And that's how the Simorgh's fuel the deck. I'm sure there are other ways to make this engine even more efficient, but this is the best I have right now. </span>  &nbsp;  <strong>Why use this variant over others?-</strong>  &nbsp;  Of course you have the question of what makes this variant better than the others. And being a mirror match, not much. It prevents set cards, and Can make more efficient use of it's hand traps like Mercourier, Lorpar, and Sauravis, and because of typing's, Dark Simorgh can stay out if you have There can be only one out. This variant also has a small backup play to make a complete brick even rarer. Consistency wise, This deck is good. So the only one ups your Mirror match will have are  Better more expensive fusion monsters.  Being able to make better comebacks.  Better consistency depending on the build.  But other than that, This deck can do the same things they can but with a major weakness covered.  &nbsp;  <strong>Making your deck cheaper-</strong>  &nbsp;  I said this deck was supposed to be budget, and its at least half to a third the price of a top tier Branded deck. but its still $138. Lucky for you, the Albaz Strike structure decks come with some replacements for these pricy cards. so who gets replaced with what?  Branded in red ends up being $6 for a little extra consistency, but, the structure decks come with Branded in White, which you can use to replace them.  Super polymerization ends up being $15, but the structure deck comes with kaiju's, so if you want to remove those monsters for less money, use the kaiju's. and if you have some spare change, you might want to look into buying Galdara the Mystery Dust Kaiju. It's a cheap kaiju all the same, but can be used as material for Dark Simorgh. Super poly can also be replaced with your side decked cards and they deck's consistency will stay the same.  Aluber the Jester of Despia comes out to $12, but can be replaced for Springans Kitt who comes in the structure deck. It lets you add the branded fusion, but you have to sacrifice a card in your hand, and it doesn't have the same synergy a Despia booster would. It does however gain a new Synergy with Dogmatika Maximus. At full first turn brick combo, Between Nadir servant Kitt and Maximus, you'll have 4 Albaz based cards ready to go next turn.  Branded Opening comes out to $45, and can't truly be replaced. So mix in whatever fills in the empty space. Without you Despia engine, the deck focuses a little more on having backrow to hold your opponent down. One idea is Anti-Spell fragrance. Since your opponent is forced to set spells, and Dark Simorgh prevents cards from being set, together they shut off both spell and trap cards entirely. And Alongside Winda, that's a job only a Kaiju could hope to take on, and not everyone plays a kaiju.  &nbsp;  In the end, if you replace all the expensive cards, you end up spending $61 instead of $130, and without Lorpar &amp; nadir servant, your down to $45.  &nbsp;  <strong>How to shut down an</strong> <strong>opponent-</strong>  &nbsp;  Eldlich/Trap stall- These decks need Traps to survive, Dark Simorgh just crushes them. So get Dark Simorgh out turn 1 and unless your opponent has a way to destroy it/tribute it, they're gone without a fight, and cards like Mirrorjade and Mercourier  help prevent your opponent from removing Dark Simorgh. If you go second though, Stall decks could hurt you for a few turns before you can finally get you're able to destroy it. Dogmatika Maximus can handle these if you added the fossil monsters to your extra deck. I don't think you can Play over skill drain though, you'd just have to attack over whatever's out with no effects. Twin Eldlich will definitely overpower you unless you can get Dark Simorgh and/or there can be only one, or a well timed Super Polymerization.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Baronne Scythe- I meant it when I said Dark Simorgh made that big difference to the deck, because yet again, Scythe can't be set. breaking that whole gimmick. If you go second though, You can use Lorpar to force bait Baronne, Clash with Dramaturge, or remove it with fossil/N'tss using Dogmatika Maximus/Nadir Servant. and set a super poly to keep them down next turn.  &nbsp;  Have fun fighting that 4-Negate Apollousa.  &nbsp;  Swordsoul- I doubt you'd be seeing these in Locals much, but, there can be only one stops them from doing anything with their monsters, and Dark Simorgh keeps them from setting Swordsoul Blackout. They can only use 1 Vishuda effect per turn, And between Dark Simorgh, Mirrorjade, Dramaturge, and there can be only one, Vishuda isn't enough. oh and D-barrier too I guess. If you go second though, force bait with Lorpar, Super Poly to remove the threat, And do your thing from there. Dark ruler no more and called by the grave are going to help a lot here.  &nbsp;  oddly enough, I don't think there's much you can do against Dragon Link. And P.U.N.K are shut down with Super Poly and D-Barrier and Ghost Ogre. I think called by the grave can negate foxy tune and ogre dance as well. That about covers decks I know to expect at locals.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well that's all for Branded Simorgh, as always I hope you enjoyed, and even more than ever, Feedback is highly appreciated.  &nbsp;  PS- Guardian chimera, Despian Quaeritis, Virtual world Kyubi- ShenShen, Anti-spell fragrance, Alba-Lenatus, and Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer can all be mixed into the deck/side deck to make it dramatically better."

Wyrm Synchro is a variant of Swordsoul Tenyi/Tenyi Synchro/Based. The goal is basically to pile in all of the best Wyrm synchro enablers into a single deck - it is all here, the Adventurers, Rose Dragon, Yang Zing, Tenyi, and Swordsoul, plus all the best generic synchro enablers. The list Farfa was running was really focused on comboing off down a pretty specific line, which I left in, but I also adapted the list to be a little bit more of a free-wheeling combo deck, with a lot of enablers and back-up plans, and many hands featuring multiple lines of play. I like flexible combo decks, and I wanted to further shore up the deck's plan vs handtraps by running more Swordsoul lines.  So, into the card by card. For interruption I wanted to be really greedy on this one, and aim towards going first. With the Adventurer pile and early Baronnes we're shored up against a lot of hand traps, but Maxx ""C"" rules the format still, and is the one interruption that might kill us going first. As a result, we're on 2 Maxx ""C"" so you can Crossout Maxx ""C"" even if you see one copy, 3 Ash, and 2 Called By with 2 Crossout. Crossout is weaker here, but it's almost exclusively for Maxx ""C"" and people run Ash. The deck is also brimming with ways to turn it into value if you don't need it. Needing 7 Maxx ""C"" answers and 2 Maxx ""C"" leaves us with no room for backrow hate, so go first against Backrow. Like I said, greedy.  Pretty standard Adventurer package here. The unusual thing about this deck is it uses the Gryphon Rider for material more often than not, but there are plenty of available lines that leave a Gryphon Rider up the whole time as well. Like I said, flexible. I'm definitely on Foolish Burial, much needed with Blue Girl and Rites semi-limited out the gate.  The whole Rose Dragon package is pretty standard. The goal here is to make Baronne before Needlefibre, but with Striker Dragon in the list your ""brick"" Roxrose goes into Halq by itself, or even helps make Baronne before Needlefibre.  Vishuda is a rad interactive card, but also helps put up the 7 you need for Galaxy Tomahawk and Baronne combos. Ashuna serves the same role, but is also a combo piece, summoning either a 7 or a 1 later into your combo to put up massif boards. Adhara is occasionally a target of this summon, and with Monk helps make Halq without your normal summon.  The big difference between the list I was sniping and my list is a beefed up Swordsoul package. With Mo-Ye and Sacred Summit the ROTA (which is normally reserved for summoning Protos) can also enable easy (and resilient) lines that end on 2 8s and a 10. This is also an option over Protos in some hands. The Sacred Summit can also help summon back monsters to extend plays in normal combo lines, it's strange people find Monster Reborn bricky. There are hands where I'd consider summoning Mo Ye instead of making Halq, especially if it preserves a Gryphon Rider and ends on a similar board.  So, the list has Protos for Darks and Chaofeng for Lights. Seems fair and balanced. Nope, nothing broken in this list.  The list can abuse Denglong, so it runs Nine Pillars. This helps round out the interruptions. The free level 1 tuner that summons itself back out is key to the combos, and well worth the brick, but there are lines that don't even need it, so I'm considering finding a line that lets me cut this. On the other hand, there's no kill like overkill.  In the Extra Deck is an Almiraj, so our Jet Synchron is now full combo (actually, there are multiple lines from just NS Jet).

Here's my take on HEROs for Master Duel.  <strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong>  Do you love GX? Do you think Jaden is cool af? Do you hecking love HERO's?  But no, seriously, as expensive as this deck is, this is probably one of the most coin flip decks that I've played ever. If it pops off, it pops the fuck off, and I mean it. If it gets interrupted enough, it falls fucking hard flat on the floor, face first. It's so strange because as oppressive as this deck can be offensively, it's also very fragile, since only a select few of their boss monsters have relevant protection, and their combo lines are so prone to interruptions and negations.  <strong>The Main Deck:</strong>  • <strong>The HEROs</strong> - <span>The heart, soul, meat, potatoes, bread, and butter of the deck. You literally can't play a HERO deck without HERO cards. Starting with the starters, then the half-starters/extenders.</span> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Elemental HERO Stratos</a> - <span>The progenitor of every archetypal searcher nowadays. Upon its Normal or Special Summon, searches a ""HERO"" monster, which includes himself. It also misses timing when used as Fusion Material with <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Solid Soldier"">Elemental HERO Solid Soldier</a>, fun fact, which is why I've decided to cut him. I figured that out when I was deliberately finding a way to intentionally make Stratos miss timing when I realized that he has a ""When... You can"" effect.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Vision HERO Faris</a> - <span>Your second primary starter, although it costs a discard of a ""HERO"" monster for its Special Summon, which isn't really a big deal, most of the time. You summon him to place a <a data-name=""Vision HERO Increase"">Vision HERO Increase</a> to your S/T Zone for purposes to be discussed soon.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Vision HERO Increase"">Vision HERO Increase</a> - <span>Not a primary starter nor an extender, but he's a vital part of your <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Faris</a> line, and the reason why I run two despite it being a hard brick, is that drawing a one of Increase hurts significantly more than drawing one out of two of your Increases, because the former scenario essentially turns off your Special Summon starter/extender in <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Faris</a>, in which you play three of. I understand the logic behind playing only 1 Increase, but that could also mean three to four dead cards, which mean you don't want to have in your hand or Deck, especially if you don't have a way to fuse. It's good to have situational cards that is there when you need them but in testing HEROs, one of the combo decks that are heavily prone to interruption, I've learned that you always want the cards that you have access to, to do something when you have them.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Vision HERO Vyon"">Vision HERO Vyon</a> - <span>Your least ideal starter and most important extender. Ideally you wouldn't really wanna start with him, but when push comes to shove, there's still a possible line with him.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Elemental HERO Shadow Mist"">Elemental HERO Shadow Mist</a> - <span>For now, she's just a one of searcher as the primary target for <a data-name=""Vision HERO Vyon"">Vyon</a> to search a ""HERO"" monster, but as further support gets released in MD, there will be a line that allows you to search a ""Change"" Quick-Play Spell, most likely <a data-name=""Mask Change"">Mask Change</a>, essentially allowing you to only play it at one safely.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier"">Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier</a> - <span>I'm playing this because of <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Sunrise"">Sunrise</a>, and Normal Summoning him does come up, especially in bad hands. Plus, there's no reason not to have the usually free +1.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a> - <span>You want this dude out of your hand if you drew it and into the GY as soon as possible, both for Fusion Summoning and Link Climbing.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Denier"">Destiny HERO - Denier</a> - <span>Great extender that recycles your copies of <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Malicious</a>.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Evil HERO Adusted Gold"">Evil HERO Adusted Gold</a> - <span>Allows you to summon <a data-name=""Evil HERO Malicious Bane"">Evil HERO Malicious Bane</a>, one of your better boss monsters, by searching <a data-name=""Dark Calling"">Dark Calling</a>.</span></li> </ol> Hand traps are x2 <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Veiler</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru</a>, &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Imperm,</a> with Nibiru only being used for the purposes of <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>, usually.  <strong>Non-Staple Spells</strong>  • <a data-name=""A Hero Lives"">A Hero Lives</a> - <span><a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a> for HEROs, at a very cheap cost of just half of your LP. It's a great Ash bait, and it's not once per turn in case it gets negated. <span>• <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a> - <span>DPE is legal, and despite this deck being able to make him without this Spell anyway, you'd still better have it than not.</span> • <a data-name=""Mask Change"">Mask Change</a> - <span>Your only access to your Masked HERO Fusion Monsters. As of now, it's still unsearchable, that's why I chose to play two of it. Three is fine if you feel like it.</span> • <a data-name=""Dark Calling"">Dark Calling</a> - <span>Your only access to <a data-name=""Evil HERO Malicious Bane"">Evil HERO Malicious Bane</a>. <span>• <a data-name=""Miracle Fusion"">Miracle Fusion</a> - <span>Your target off of <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Sunrise"">Sunrise</a>, usually how you'd wanna trigger <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier"">Liquid Soldier</a> to make <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Absolute Zero"">Absolute Zero</a>.</span></span> </span></span></span>  <strong>The Extra Deck</strong>  • <a data-name=""EVIL HERO Malicious Bane"">EVIL HERO Malicious Bane</a> - <span>Your only boss monster that has a protection against anything, against destruction by battle or card effect in particular. Has a once per turn monster board wipe, and can also scale up his ATK upon doing so.</span> • <a data-name=""Vision HERO Adoration"">Vision HERO Adoration</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Vision HERO Trinity"">Vision HERO Trinity</a> - <span>The former is just a generic Fusion monster that you can easily make for the grind, and the latter is there to make OTKs easier, if it wasn't easy enough. None of them are mandatory, but I'd cut Trinity over Adoration if I have to.</span> • <a data-name=""Masked HERO Acid"">Masked HERO Acid</a>, <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dark Law"">Masked HERO Dark Law</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Masked HERO Blast"">Masked HERO Blast</a> - <span>Your Mask Change targets. You'll usually make Acid with Absolute Zero to nuke both your opponent's monsters and back row, Dark Law with either Malicious or Shadow Mist to act as a one-sided Macro Cosmos, and Blast with Stratos to cut down high ATK but targetable monsters and as a Quick-Play back row removal. <span>• <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Great Tornado"">Elemental HERO Great Tornado</a>, <a data-name=""Elemental HERO The Shining"">Elemental HERO The Shining</a>,  <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Absolute Zero"">Elemental HERO Absolute Zero</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Sunrise"">Elemental HERO Sunrise</a> - <span>The Omni-HEROs. Great Tornado to cut down all of your monster's ATK/DEF to half, The Shining as a late game beatstick and can also recover banished ""Elemental HERO"" monsters when sent from the field to the GY, Absolute Zero to act as a board wipe as discussed earlier, and Sunrise to facilitate either set-up or extension through Miracle Fusion.

They're like the Salamangreat of Fusion Summoning, and by that I meant they can easily Fusion/Link Climb and lose hard to Nibiru, but unlike Salads, they can easily close out games when given a chance to do so. Although I'm not gonna lie, it kind of gave me a sense of analysis paralysis when it comes to which ""HERO"" deck do I want to build at first. Overall, it's a protagonist deck, like Dark Magician, Synchrons, Utopia, Odd-Eyes, and Code Talkers. Its performance is as expected, and its price astronomical. From the core to the hand traps and staples, much like Dinos but more archetype specific, I wouldn't really recommend building this, unless you really don't have anything else to build in Master Duel and only want to have fun. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can."

Gunkan Suship is a competent deck that can be built incredibly easily on a budget with the core of the deck consisting of 6 - 12 SRs and the rest of the deck being up entirely to personal preference. You can cut on of the Gunkan traps for the 3rd Maxx ""C"" i just haven't gotten around to crafting it. Forbidden chalice can be swapped out for either Dark Ruler No More or Effect Veiler but Chalice works on a budget and I also enjoy the flexibility of it compared to those two. When building the deck i recommend prioritizing crafting Zeus + Gaia Dragon and Bagooska as these cards can carry you in games without much commitment. Blizzard is probably the best flex slot for this specific list, i personally like blizzard as hitting those equalizers if you're forced to go first is a life saver but it could be replaced with just about any meta pick you want. Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops, Time Thief Redoer, Abyss Dweller and the Draco Future package are also up to personal preference depending on what you prefer in your Rank 4 tool box. Rescue Rabbit is also a viable option in the main deck but i don't like that it can end your turn if your opponent has any hand traps, i prefer not to rely on the normal summon."

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.  Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.  1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.  2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!  3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions  4) Other than Xyz, Pendulum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a Tier List You can only have 3 Cards on the A Tier List 5 Cards on the B Tier List 10 Cards on the C Tier List In your deck. https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList  5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.  6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.  7) Cards that have a (this card is always treated as ""card name"") can be ignored. Example Harpie Lady 1, 2. And 3 are always treated as the original Harpie Lady. In normal ocg/tcg you would have to choose the ratios from amongst them to play. But here you can run the 3 original and then 1 of each other effect harpie.

Maxx C and Nibiru will end your turns if you do not have the proper ways to stop them. Adventure primarily handles Nibiru, but the only way to stop Maxx C is with Crossout, Called by the Grave, or Ash Blossom. Maxx C cannot go off against this list unless you want to give your opponent 20+ cards. Other than that, this deck has a variety of ways to play past the other handtraps, as long as you open multiple starters.  The endboard of one of Sunseed Genius Loci will always be a Sunavalon Dryatrentiay, Teardrop, Benghalancer, a set Sunavalon Bloom, and a Sunvine Shrine."
