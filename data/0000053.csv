This deck might not be the PUREST of decks like I suggested up above, but it's SOOO hard to build a 100% Guardragon deck that's good. I had to add in some things. Basically what this deck does is sending Justiacia to the gy along with background Drag via dragon shrine, then SS Background along with 1 lvl 4 or lower frmo your hand (you should have a level 4 or lower.). Once you SSed the Background and the Lvl 4 or lower, send Promeneses from your hand to the GY (If you have Promineses) to trigger it's effect WHEN a nomal monster leaves the field. Then linking into hieratic spheres. Afterwards, if you didn't send Promineses to the GY via it's OWN effect, you should have Crusadia Draco (Ik, here's a crusadia, But honestly, it's against the law to not add it in, SOrry :3), or quick launch or whatever that'll summon a dragon. From there on it's just linking into Elpy, then if you have the following cards in your hand, follow the following precedures:

Draco (If you didn't use it's effect to summon itself to link into Elpy,) SS it next to a link monster's zone. Link using the draco and hieratic into agarpain. Agarpain's effect Summons Crystal wing. (Also, there's an alternative,) After you SS draco, Normal Summon a dragon, as I don't think you have normal Summoned yet, then use hieratic, draco and the normal summoned monster to link into saryuja. You won't get the draw effect, but it's good. Activate Elpy, Summoning Red-Eyes Darkness Metal from your hand/deck, then SS 1 dragon from your GY or hand using Darkness Metal's effect. Then use Darkness and the SSed dragon (Darkness Metal summoned) to link into agarpain, afterwards, agarpain summoned Crystal Wing, Then you can go for a Link Summon of a Link 4, then if you have the right cards and if you play the right cards in the right way, you SHOUL be able to summon at least 1 more Synchro monster. SHOULD!!!

World Legacy Guardragon, activate it, summon a dragon if you want to, then move Elpy to the zone DIRECTLY BENEATH Hieratic to trigger it's effect, which will summon Darkness Metal, then activate Darkness to SS a drag from hand or gy, then, either: 1) Use all 4 monsters to Link into Saryuja. 2) Use every monster except Elpy. Both will work, for No.1, Saruja will draw 4 cards, then shuffle 3 into the deck (Also!!!! I would not suggest using all monsters, except Elpy for the link summon of Saryuja if you do not have a monster in your hand that can be SSed by Saryuja's effect.) | (If you have no monsters you can SS using Saryuja's effect before the draw, and you draw a SS-Able monster, shuffle the not needed cards into the deck), No.2 Saryuja SSes a monster from your hand, if you can, if not, you're stuffed.

Alright, that's about it, also if you get a really lucky hand, you SHOULD be able to summon Crystal Wing, Borreload Savage/F.A. Dawn Dragster (""/"" because I don't think you can Summon both, I've tried, and I could only Summon 1 of them) and a Link 4. Good Luck! Thank you for viewing my deck!"

I usually try to get a polymerization in hand to start fusing into Frightfur Kraken or Tiger as they aid in monster or card removal and work my way up to sabre tooth.

Now, lets just jump into my deck

&nbsp;

From the lyrics you saw there, it is also this deck's concept. We will go crazy, transport at high speed until we knock our opponent off the rail. This deck is the Earth machine Xyz Otk type. So you can see a lot of floodgate and chain card. Lemme show you most of the cards

&nbsp;

Train monster: Kind of main combo pieces in this deck, to make a good Xyz monster

Handtrap: To stop the opponent from making board, because we will going second and will Otk him.

Damage card(Limit removal, equip spell): To make your monster Atk become double, that will make us beating him easier on turn 1

Field spell: It's first effect will stop us from Otk, so don't use it. Instead, the second effect is powerful too.

Red reboot: To Otk, nothing much."

This deck is one of my favorites of all time due to my love for ojamas and THE CHAZZ. That being said, however, it most certainly isn't the most competitive deck out there but it sure as hell is fun.

The main goal of the deck is to turbo out <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=A-to-Z-Dragon%20Buster%20Cannon&amp;_ga=2.216582614.1589360001.1563839975-1429640211.1542477317"">A-to-Z Dragon Buster Cannon</a> with as many cards as possible in your hand so you can negate everything your opponent does. The most important card in the entire deck is <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a>. It was like it was made to be played in this deck. Without it, this deck would be GARBAGE. That being said, this deck cannot play through negation much at all. If Saryuja or other combo plays get negated and you have no response (called by the grave), you're donzo. The three easiest ways to get this bad boy out are the <a data-name=""Ojamatch"">Ojamatch</a> + <a data-name=""Ojamagic"">Ojamagic</a> combo, <a data-name=""Tri-wight"">Tri-wight</a>, and <a data-name=""Ojamassimilation"">Ojamassimilation</a> on <a data-name=""ABC-Buster Dragon"">ABC-Buster Dragon</a>.

The best opening hand you can hope for is the first combo. By using <a data-name=""Ojamatch"">Ojamatch</a> on <a data-name=""Ojamagic"">Ojamagic</a> you are able to search for <a data-name=""Ojama Red"">Ojama Red</a> and <a data-name=""Armed Dragon LV3"">Armed Dragon LV3</a> and able to normal summon the dragon immediately after for free. <a data-name=""Ojamagic"">Ojamagic</a>'s effect then activates, enabling you to add <a data-name=""Ojama Yellow"">Ojama Yellow</a>, <a data-name=""Ojama Green"">Ojama Green</a>, and <a data-name=""Ojama Black"">Ojama Black</a> directly to your hand. Bam, you just got four monsters to your hand and one on your field without your normal summon. How is that fair? Well it doesn't even end there. You can then normal summon <a data-name=""Ojama Red"">Ojama Red</a> and activate it's effect to special summon your other three ojamas from your hand to the field. Link away your four ojamas to summon <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> to draw four cards. The main cards you are looking for are <a data-name=""Ojamassimilation"">Ojamassimilation</a>, <a data-name=""Tri-wight"">Tri-wight</a>, and <a data-name=""Ojama Pajama"">Ojama Pajama</a> (if you dont have one already). Situationally, there can be many cards you want depending on what you already have. The main cards you want to get rid of are first off any of the six union bricks you play in the deck, any original ojama cards you need in the deck in order to activate <a data-name=""Ojamagic"">Ojamagic</a> (if you dont have one of each yellow, black, or green ojamas in your deck, ojamagic cant activate), and possibly hand traps if you already have enough ojama's/ojamassimilations to make <a data-name=""A-to-Z Dragon Buster Cannon"">A-to-Z Dragon Buster Cannon</a> (precicely two <a data-name=""Ojamassimilation"">Ojamassimilation</a> and six ojama monsters in your hand/field/graveyard).

Since Saryuja is a broken card and isnt once per turn (actually, almost every single card in this deck isnt once per turn), you can use it's draw effect again by summoning another! After Summoning Saryuja there are two cards that can extend your plays even more by summoning YET ANOTHER Saryuja. First off, <a data-name=""Tri-Wight"">Tri-Wight</a> can summon <a data-name=""Ojama Yellow"">Ojama Yellow</a>, <a data-name=""Ojama Green"">Ojama Green</a>, and <a data-name=""Ojama Black"">Ojama Black</a> back from the grave directly to the field, allowing you to easily summon YET ANOTHER Saryuja by linking off the three ojamas and the <a data-name=""Armed Dragon LV3"">Armed Dragon LV3 </a>you summoned earlier. The other method of summoning YET ANOTHER Saryuja is by using <a data-name=""Ojamassimilation"">Ojamassimilation</a> on ABC-Dragon Buster by banishing the three original ojamas from the graveyard to special summon A-Assault Core, B-Buster Drake, and C-Crush Wyvern. You are then able to link off the three union monsters and the aforementioned Armed Dragon to make YET ANOTHER Saryuja. You see, the reason you are able to do this is because you can special summon <a data-name=""ABC-Dragon Buster"">ABC-Dragon Buster</a> by banishing the three union monsters from the field OR the graveyard, which I didn't know when I first started playing this deck and when I found out, MORE SARYUJAS!!!!

Normally, The deck can't consistently pull off this combo right away every game so two important cards to open so you can search out the combo starters are <a data-name=""Ojama Blue"">Ojama Blue</a> and <a data-name=""Ojama Pajama"">Ojama Pajama</a>. If you are going first and brick (which lets be honest is going to happen most of the time), just set one, or if you have two, both of these cards face down and pass. If your opponent runs over and destroys your <a data-name=""Ojama Blue"">Ojama Blue</a> by battle (and only battle, nothing else) you are able to add TWO ojama cards from your deck to your hand. The main two cards you want are the obvious <a data-name=""Ojamatch"">Ojamatch</a>/<a data-name=""Ojamagic"">Ojamagic</a> BUT if you already have one, or both, <a data-name=""Ojamassimilation"">Ojamassimilation</a> is your next priority or <a data-name=""Ojama Pajama"">Ojama Pajama</a> if you dont already have one. Another really handy card you can search out is <a data-name=""Ojama Delta Hurricane"">Ojama Delta Hurricane</a> which can really come in handy to just wipe your opponents board completely. Activate <a data-name=""Ojama Pajama"">Ojama Pajama</a> on your opponent's turn to search out <a data-name=""Ojamagic"">Ojamagic</a> and discard it to get the three ojamas. If you already have <a data-name=""Ojamagic"">Ojamagic</a> in your hand, FANTASTIC. You can instead search any card you need (<a data-name=""Ojamassimilation"">Ojamassimilation</a>) and discard the <a data-name=""Ojamagic"">Ojamagic</a> already in your hand to +4. You Can then use <a data-name=""Ojama Pajama"">Ojama Pajama</a>'s again on your turn (this is one of the only once per turn cards but you can use it on either player's turn so its NICE).

I dont have the card, but <a data-name=""Apollousa Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa Bow of the Goddess</a> basically has the same requirement as <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> and is basically the same card as <a data-name=""A-to-Z Armed Dragon Cannon"">A-to-Z Armed Dragon Cannon</a> so if you have it I think you need to include it. I guess you can include <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> too if you also include 2 other <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> and a <a data-name=""Missus Radiant"">Missus Radiant</a>. When you normal summon your red to summon the other 3 ugli bois you can make 2 link spiders then link those two into the missus then link another spider THEN make the dragon. I dont have a sword dragon.

Dont play this deck if you don't have at least 2 Saryuja's.

If you want to play a more casual/fun/cheaper deck, play the Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon version. Not as good but more CHAZZ.

Pros of the deck:
<ul>
 	<li>cool as hell</li>
 	<li>ojamas</li>
 	<li>fun</li>
 	<li>big brain</li>
 	<li>no one expects the ojama</li>
 	<li>the chazz</li>
</ul>
Cons of the deck:
<ul>
 	<li>Potentially EVERY card in the deck can be a brick. ALL OF THEM. They need each other to survive. This deck emphasizes the power of teamwork and friendship.</li>
 	<li>Luck based mostly</li>
 	<li>Cant fight through negates well</li>
 	<li>If your pieces get banished other than your own effects, you best hope you can just beat over your opponent with saryuja's</li>
</ul>
THANKS FOR READING MY EXPLANATION IF YOU DID. If you have any questions about my explanation or dissagree with me please let me know, I love learning new things about yugioh and getting better.

I know a lot of you guys would really enjoy playing this deck because it is a lot of fun to play and disrupts your opponent constantly. This deck likes to go second but it can also go first, the goal of the deck is to use Mystic Mine to stall your opponent until you get enough banished cards to get Gren Maju's attack up to 10,000 or up so you can attack into one of your opponent's monsters for game. What really locks in your win is waiting for your opponent to make a link monster that way next turn you can use Mystic Mine to stall and attack for game with Gren Maju when you have enough banished cards because link monsters can't go into defense and your opponent most likely won't be able to get rid of the link monster so you can just kill them with Gren Maju. The deck did really well in testing and when going second is also to easily disrupt your opponent's plays with <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> and hand traps. The extra deck is composed of mainly <a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries</a> targets since it is a very strong card when it resolves. The reason for two of each of most of the extra deck cards is because of <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>. It is most likely that you will banish only one of each and not two which could potentially screw you over from not having the right Cherry targets left in the extra deck. I hope you guys enjoy this one, and stick around for more!"

","Hello my friends, my name is Mohamed This is my group to call three of the zarc based on the pendulum call and I will give you some tips to use the full powers of this group
1 - It is better to call monsters of the type of pendulum If you destroy the monster can be returned from Extra Duck
2 - Use in the field of Bandalium Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver
So you do not need Odd-Eyes Fusion
3. Call Clear Wing Fast Dragon instead of Clear Wing Synchro Dragon
4. Do not use Supreme Rage when you have one zarc in the field
5 - Do not sacrifice zarc in order to call your other visitor, it is only due to the paper Smile Universe
6. If you want to call Clear Wing Fast Dragon, call Performapal Odd-Eyes Synchron and then use the Kuro-Obi Karate Spirit or Kai-Den Kendo Spirit from the Pendulum to the Monster
This is all you will need in order to use this group and to meet

A review of the gameplay is available here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFOVMBVQ","<span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEFOVMBVQug</span>

2019 is definitively the year of heroes, at the time I post this deckAirman came back to 2 and we had Vision Hero support that add a lot of consistancy and more spam power to the deck to play more easily under hand traps and negations. So actually Hero can play excellent disruptive monsters if starting first and have a great facility to OTK the opponent thanks to it's ability to search into the deck and summon incredible beatsticks like Trinity Hero Vision.

The other big boost comes from new Hero Vision Faris And Hero Vision Increase that can set up the Graveyard while making a board of 3 monsters without consuming the normal summon and only starting with 1 Faris in hand. Faris will of course be at 3 being the best starter of the deck, and Increase at 2 to limit chances of having it in the starting hand and prevent the loop from being broken if having one. A little complicated sentence but in fact a logical ratio. The discard cost of Faris's effect can be a good point to send a Malicious to the graveyard since we absolutely don't want to have it in the starting hand, or trigger the tuto effect of Shadow Mist in some situations.

Main deck we'll of course play 2 Elemental Hero Airman to search the integralty of the deck's monsters and eventually clean the backrow if the starting hand allows to go without it's principal effect. Elemental Hero Solid Soldier, Hero Vision Vyon and Elemental Hero Shadow Mist are at 2 too, because more could be bricky, knowing that we now have 2 more tutos in the presence of Airman. We play a package of destiny heroes with Malicious, Celestial, Dynatag and Plasma respectively at x2 and x1 to gain spam potential with Vyon and abuse Dystopia effect while having a stable draw power if there is a second turn. Plasma here is more playable than ever due to the facility of spam and consists on a good floodgate-like to finish your turn while starting first, especially if you can summon Dark Law during opponent's turn. Finally Elemental Hero Honest Neos can bring a +2500 Atk boost to bypass almost every beatsicks and easily and perform solid OTKs.

Ash Blossom and Called By The Grave are almost recurring today and prevent opponent from breaking a crucial loop or slow him down by striking a starter or a key effect in the middle of a combo.

On the side of spells, we play a fusion package with 1 Polymerization and the 3 Mask Change, 1 will be sufficient since it's searchable and having one in hand is often a deadweight since we have less cards to conduct loops and this is used in the last plays of the Main Phase. Fusion Destiny is an amazing stater due to its capacity of sending the fusion materials in the graveyard directly from the deck (be aware, it can be stopped by Ash Blossom) and is useful to summon a Dystopia and send Malicious or Dynatag regarding your hand, to have an instant link 2 (mostly Xtra Hero Cross Crusader than can resurrect the Dystopia previously used as link mterial or a malicious to sacrifice it and trigger the tuto effect). Destiny Draw is another way to discard a dead Malicious, Dynatag or Celestial that are not needed and far better in the graveyard, and is generally a good way to draw. Finally A Hero Live and E are good free summon to instantly chain a tuto effect or a way to search specific pieces of combos.

&nbsp;

The extra deck runs a specific tech adapted to the actual metagame with Abyss Dweller that hits hardly a good number of decks preventing effects that trigger in the graveyard, and may be used as material to go on Masked Hero Acid that can clean an entire backrow and facilitate otks with it's little dropping effect. Besides we have a classic Xtra Hero package with Wonder Driver to recycle Mask Change, Cross Crusader to assemble combos with more consistance and revive key monsters like Destiny Hero Dystopia, and lastly Dread Decimator that can simply give a great stats boost to itself and pointed monsters (max. 3) to bust OTKs and break through beatsticks more easily. Is an important monster, especially if starting first, thanks to it's ability to be summoned by Destiny Fusion and revived by Cross Crusader to quick destroy opponent's cards while it's attack differs than it's original one, thing that is easily to set up thanks to Dynatag and Dread Decimator. Destiny Hero Dominance is used to send 3 monsters to the graveyard in specific cases and can defend or support battle phases with its revive-like effect. Vision Hero Adoration is a monster that can easily reduce ATk's monsters to 0 to blow your opponent's LP with Vision Hero Trinity that is a great OTK generator since your opponent has monsters, because during the summon turn it's Atk goes to 5000 without boosts and it can perform 3 attacks on monsters (Dread Decimator can easily bring a +1000 and Neos a +2500). Masked Hero Anki can finish the opponent with a direct attack and tuto Mask Change if destryed a monster by battle to instantly trigger it and fusion a Masked Hero Dark Law on Anki to continue attacking the opponent. Dark Law is an excellent anti meta card to summon while going first, having a Macro Cosmos-like effect and punishing the opponent's tutos by banihing a random card from his hand. Dian may be summoned on Solid Soldier to trigger it's effect and spam the board while being able to summon low level Heroes from the deck. Lastly Tornado Dragon is a way to deal with opponent's backrow to ensure some OTKs."

My 60 Card Theory: Phantasm Spiral OTK is a 43 card deck. Tenyi+Draw Card Engine is 27 cards. Combine them and u get the consistency of both of them. With so many 1 ofs and 1 <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> you have a smaller chance of banishing them. If you do Who cares? You don't want to draw them! You want them to be in the graveyard. There is a reason why you have one of them and not 2 or 3 of them.

The reason why I run Number <a data-name=""S39: Utpoia the Lightning"">S39: Utopia the Lightning</a> is because people know to <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> the <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double "">Number 39: Utopia Double </a> so you are stuck with a 0 ATK monster that can do nothing. Turn the <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a> into <a data-name=""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"">Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</a> just so you have OTK potential and so you have 2500 ATK instead of 0.

Hope that makes sense."

Orochi is mainly for banishment and stalling (though it can also be used with Hexe Trude to Xyz Summon a Rank 8.). Eater of Millions for easy removal and high ATK late game. The rest is mostly negation or draw cards.

Megafleet Dragon is in the ED in case you go against a Cyber Dragon deck.

&nbsp;

(note: despite the goal of using Gren Maju for high ATK, I find myself winning with Hexe Trude much more often, due to the inconsistencies of Gren Maju. Don't be afraid to simply swarm with Hexe Trude to win.)"

I put only one Crusadia Krawler to give you the krawler support cards and combo with XYZ/Links without bricking your draw. <a data-name=""World Legacy Survivor"">World Legacy Survivor</a>  can dump cards that you seriously need in your next DP and <a data-name=""World Legacy - World Armor"">World Legacy - World Armor</a> can easily brick your hand alone (your opponent will attack in the most cases at his very beginning and flipping by battle doesn't trigger the armor. Also the world legacy pawns doesn't trigger the armor too).

I already used survivor with worm bait before, its very sinergizing and recommended but too vulnerable for most newer decks. And recently I removed the lightning kaiju because it was bricking/ drawing it and when I use it, make things hard once the field spell is not active.

The deck is focused on removal, this way its possible to win without swarming, otherwise make sure to use <a data-name=""Krawler Glia"">Krawler Glia</a>, <a data-name=""Krawler Ranvier"">Krawler Ranvier</a> and <a data-name=""X-Krawler Qualiark"">X-Krawler Qualiark</a> asap.

<a data-name=""Deep Dark Trap Hole"">Deep Dark Trap Hole</a>, <a data-name=""Network Trap Hole"">Network Trap Hole</a> and <a data-name=""Black Horn of Heaven"">Black Horn of Heaven</a> can disrupts your opponent's field even more with compulsory and recall on the main deck. Also you can avoid some hand traps or any other special summoned monster with <a data-name=""Chain Hole"">Chain Hole</a>/ <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>. <a data-name=""Grave of the Super Ancient Organism"">Grave of the Super Ancient Organism</a> stops all level 6 higher monsters on the field from working, deus krawler passively negates all other monsters making a complete match with this one. <a data-name=""Dark Bribe"">Dark Bribe</a> Totalizes with the others spell/ trap destroyers in the main deck.
