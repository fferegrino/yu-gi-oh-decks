Combined with Snake-Eye, this fire deck is nigh unstoppable. If you want to reach high levels on Masterduel ladder with a reliable deck that can either 1st&nbsp;or 2nd and can cram a ton of staples while being consistently powerful, Rescue-ACE is a good deck to play!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><em>&nbsp;</em></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-weight: 400;"">All fire decks that feature a level 1 fire starter has recieved an unbelievable power boost with the release of the ""Snake-Eyes"" cards from the ""Ride Into the Future"" pack in Masterduel! Not only is there enhanced consistency with the Snake-Eye and Diabellestar cards, the power ceiling of RESCUE-ACE has dramatically increased as well, since the new additions to the deck allow it to link spam like no tomorrow! Powerful link bosses like Heatsoul, Amblowhale and Promethean Princess are easily made with a singular Snake-Eyes Ash, on top of your Turbulence's 4 set backrow!</span></div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-weight: 400;""><em>&nbsp;</em></span></div><p style=""text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

A reduced RESCUE-ACE core is included because of the consistency boost the Snake-Eye cards give, and now they number 16 cards. 2 hydrant rather than 3 is used since the card can now be seached/summoned from deck with the Snake-Eye cards. 3 EMERGENCY! are included since they function as ""emergency teleport"" and are effectively 1-card playstarters. 4 Rescue-ACE spells/traps are included as targets for Turbulence to set from deck. REINFORCE! isn't included since the card seems fairly inconsequential compared to the other quick-play spells and traps. One for One is included since it's an additional copy of any level 1 fire you need summoned from deck.&nbsp; <br /></span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Thanks to the consistency boost from Snake-Eyes and Bonfire, a whopping 15 STAPLES is included in the strategy, including 14 handtraps (RESCUE-ACE Impulse is actually a handtrap!). This means you're always going to interrupt your opponent, no matter what turn it is! The usual ""Maxx C"" package is included so the pilot can win the Maxx C minigame. <br /></span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Unlike earlier iterations of this deck, the Extra Deck is now used a lot since the Snake-Eye cards grant this deck immense link climb ability. Linkuriboh + Sunlight Wolf summon Heatsoul, I:P Masquera can be summoned from the backrow during your opponent's turn with Flamberge Dragon, etc. The Extra Deck is a toolbox for answers to specific game states. Since many monsters in the Extra Deck aren't required, they can be banish fodder for Pot of Prosperity.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; color: #d6d6d6;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Rescue-ACE functions as a control-centred midrange deck. Usually, the deck summons Turbulence, sets 4 spells/traps from the deck (two interruptions and two follow-up cards). Combined with the Snake-Eyes cards, this strategy has become much more aggressive since it is able to link climb quickly to Accesscode for an OTK. The hand also may have Rescue-ACE warriors that function as handtraps to net further advantage from deck, hand or GY.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Here is the deck's main combo:&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><em><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Snake-Eyes Ash + Rescue-ACE Turbulence/Extender = 4 set Rescue-ACE spells/traps (interruption and follow-up) + Promethean Princess in GY (monster destruction) + Amblowhale (link-monster summon and 1 card destruction) + Heatsoul (draw 2) + follow-up for next turn in hand</span></em></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><ol start=""1"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; list-style-type: '1.

Magical Musketeer has been a tier 3 and lower deck due to the sheer amount of power creep in the last decade. Its only strength is the spell/trap handtraps that interact with the opponent by negating cards, destroying face up cards, and banishing cards from grave. Its best matchup in the current format is stun since you can pick off fossil dyna more consistently than they can open judgment. (A testament of how slow a deck needs to be in order for the deck to dominate).</p><p>The Fiendsmith support provides the consistency that Musketeer has longed for because you can now search Caspar, Starfire or whatever Musketeer you need. Basically, you are now running 9 copies of Caspar/Starfire and 7 copies of Doc, Calamity, Wild and Kidbrave without taking up the deck space. You could run a similar Small World Package consisting of Ash, Effect Veiler and Nibiru as Small World bridges, but you always had to a) draw no Musketeers and b) needed one of the aforementioned drawn with Small World for the package to be worth it. Fiendsmith works as both a way to get to Starfire/Caspar and as a way to proc them. Its just an efficient searcher for Musketeers. Also, fi you are set on Musketeers, Lurrie is searched and dumped to become the second body needed to make Sequentia.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fiendsmith combo lets your go first endboard be more than Caspar + Starfire pass, converting into Apollousa or High King Caesar with a Musketeer on board that can't be targeted. Prior to Fiendsmith, if you didn't open Caspar or Starfire going first, you were in a bad spot. Going second, if Max got negated, you just passed, now you can convert it into Fiendsmith stuff, making cards like Ash only stop the Musketeer side of the deck, requiring 2 negations minimum to stop the entire combo. Overall, the Fiendsmith engine is a welcome addition and should be run moving forward in every Musketeer deck.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As for the the power cards of the deck, Super Poly, Link into the Vrains, and Ultimate Slayer all have the clause: your opponent cannot respond, making them 'guaranteed' against most meta decks. The idea is to ensure your Muskets can hit the field and these cards generate advantage through denying negation. Super Poly eats a minimum of 2 cards, Ultimate slayer does the same without the discard, and Link into the Vrains guarantees Max resolving his mass search effect or summon effect. If any of light fiend links get destroyed, it recurs 1 light fiend from grave (per copy of LITV). Also, it serves as an extender, so if you get Nibbed, you can just normal summon to continue your plays.&nbsp;</p><p>Extra deck is running the bare minimum to do Musketeer and Fiendsmith combos because it works with the assumption you will just be shuffling everything back. If people start playing D.D. Crow in a format, bump ratios to 2 so you won't get stifled by a banished Lacrimosa or something. (That also means Super Poly or Ultimate Slayer will have to cut their engine size). Ultimate slayer runs the best of each summon type, allowing you to pop with N'tss, bounce with Malong, and negate with Aggregator. Garura is there because of the Super Poly Engine, but you can always just draw a card against fusion decks.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Side deck can be tailered to the event you are going to, so this is by no means fixed. Run more s/t removal if your locals is all stun, run more anti Snake-eyes (or whatever is tier 1) cards if you are going to a YCS. Make adjustments to have a better matchup against the most popular decks.&nbsp;</p><p>Final Notes:&nbsp;</p><p>Runick Fiendsmith Musket is a build I was contemplating but after thorough testing with Runick Muskets in TCG and MD, there are far too many weaknesses to warrant running it with Fiendsmith Musket. You cut Musket S/t to 1 make space for Runick cards, the power cards are (unsurprisingly) more powerful than any of the Runicks, the draw 3 effect of Fountain requires you to draw into Runicks to keep that engine going, and the no BP clause makes the game artifically longer. If Fountain never goes up OR if it goes down, Runick stops working on your opponent's turn. Fiendsmith puts up a lot of damage on board on behalf of the otherwise weak Musketeers, so you can close out games quicker with the non Runick variant. Quicker games, means you grind less in every game, and mitigate the risk of going into time. Also longer games take its toll on you as a player for 9+ round events.&nbsp;</p>"

Small World helps a lot with getting channeler as often as possible. Trap Trick, which probably should be at 3 copies (swap for 1 Hysteric Party or 1 Small World), is to help get Feather Storm as often as possible, as it is the card that wins you most of your games because of its insane negate effect.<br /><br />All of the hand traps, aside from Nibiru, that I chose work with Small world since they all only share 1 Type/Attr/Lvl/ATK/DEF with any of the Harpies. So, you can banish the hand trap from your deck to get to channeler. Nibiru is kind of insane with Cyber Slash and could probably be main decked, because you can just bounce the token on the following turn and go in for game, but opted for Droll and Lock Bird for going first. For the extra deck, I don't actually have S:P but if I did I would run it. If you don't have S:P, I would maybe run either Knightmare Unicorn or Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax (which is what I am running).</p>"

You get Tearlament Lightsworn - the ultimate combination in milling technology! As we near the 2nd&nbsp;anniversary&nbsp;of the release of Tearlaments, we have yet another incredible Tearlament variant.&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">With the release of Legacy of Destruction, new life has been breathed into the Lightsworn strategy. Dragonling and Archfiend add extra gas and consistency by giving more mills, foolish burials and GY summons. Synchro Minerva offers more targeted ""foolish burials"" and milling power by banishing up to 4 lightsworns in GY - which by the way makes Punishment Dragon live. Finally, Lightsworn has been gifted by an omni-negate multi-target trap - Lightsworn Aegis!&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Add on to the new Lightsworn cards the usual GY fusion milling shenanigans of Horus + Tearlament, and you have an incredible GY powerhouse with enough gas to play through any interruption, handtrap and boardstate! While playtesting this deck, it feels like it is so consistent, powerful and contains so much gas that it feels like playing tier 0 Ishizu Tearlament all over again. If you've missed the thrill of full power ""Tear 0,"" I highly suggest giving Tearlaments Lightsworn a try!

Fenrir is simultaneously a combo piece (since it searches for Tear Kash) and a boardbreaker, but only two are used in this deck, since they don't really do anything when milled.</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">You may have noticed that there are hardly any handtraps or generic staples in this deck. The theory behind this build of Tearlaments is that it has so much gas that it can play through all of your opponent's interruptions just fine, as long as your graveyard is accessible and you aren't floodgated to death (most relevant floodgates are at 1 or banned anyways).&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">40 cards are used to ensure this strategy is as consistent and compact as possible. In addition to bricking less, the mills will have much better results than bigger Tearlaments variants because of the deck's compact size.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">As usual, Tearlaments' gameplan is to mill as much as possible to trigger graveyard effects. Like every Tearlaments strategy, this deck aims to mill as much as possible and gain beneficial effects from those mills. The reliance on mills makes this strategy unpredictable and luck dependant, meaning that there are hardly any straightforward combos.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">There are no straightforward ""combos"" for Tearlament Lightsworn due to the random nature of the deck. Combos are hand/mill dependent - leaving the rest of the game up to the duelists individual skill, decision making and mental fortitude (that's the Tearlaments is considered as a difficult to pilot deck). Tearlaments are also infamous for requiring a great deal of skill, since the pilot has to be aware of the various interactions they have in the GY and the amount of cards left in their main deck.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">What differentiates this version of Tearlaments from the others are the Lightsworn cards. Lightsworn allows for more mills, extension, bodies on board, negates, interruption, etc. In short, Lightsworn makes Tearlaments vastly more powerful and consistent than ever before! Try to resolve both of the Synchro Minerva's effects, since her targeted ""foolish burials"" + mill for 4 adds a lot of momentum and resources to this milling strategy.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Generally, endboards consist of any combination of 2-4 negate Apollousa, S:P Little Knight, Lightsworn monster (typically Minerva) + Lightsworn Aegis, Grapha, Rulkallos, Scream and Sulliek. Depending on your mills (which are often very good thanks to new Lightsworn cards), you can get about 2-10+ interruptions/negates!</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></p><ul style=""text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Horus cards are incredible at cracking established boards and can out powerful boss monsters that have negates/interruption.

Be sure to leave the middle MMZ and side MMZs clear for Cross-Sheep's arrows.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">You can also synchro summon Visas Amritara to search ANY Tearlament spell/trap, thanks to the Lightsworn cards. All Lightsworns are light monsters and you have plenty of tuners, so summoning this main character is a breeze, adding extra consistency in this deck.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Any Tearlaments strategy is infamous for requiring a great deal of skill to pilot, since the duelists is required to know all the various interactions that goes on in the GY, and to remember how many cards are left in their deck - the while considering how the opponent will react to the plays. This deck is not easy, so practice makes perfect with Tearlaments.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Very new to the game and like Yusei. Right now I'm only really on 2004 meta ideas so its probably old looking</p><p>Just a basic deck that can lead with a starting combo to Junk Speeder/Warrior with some basic all around negation/removal spells and traps. There's some searchers in the deck too in case of a bad starting hand. The extra deck is lacking because I just don't know of alot of synchro cards. I also aimed for being able to buy this in real life without selling a arm and a leg.</p><p>Future improvements hopefully: Better tuner composition. Better extra deck. More precise usage of spells and traps. A clearer win condition.</p>

Wanna know what Domain Format is?&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""color: #ffffff; font-family: Roboto, Noto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; white-space-collapse: preserve; background-color: #282828;"">DISCORD LINK https://discord.gg/E9GU5YpW Domain Format requires your deck to have 60 cards in the main deck instead of the usual minimum of 40. You can only run 1 copy of each card in your deck (So you can't play 3 Blue-Eyes White Dragons for example), and you must have a Deck Master, a Monster that exists outside of the Main or Extra deck, meaning it doesn't count to the 60 card main deck limit or 15 card extra deck limit. Your Deck Master determines what other monsters you can play in your deck, depending on it's Type, Attribute, and affiliations with Archetypes aswell as specific cards listed in it's text. If it mentions a Type, Attribute or specific ATK/DEF line (Like 2400ATK/1000 DEF for example) in it's text, you can also include those kinds of monsters in your deck. Deck Masters can be summoned from the Deck Master Zone using their appropriate mechanic (Normal Summon, Tribute Summon, Synchro Summon, etc...) or by using their Inherent Summon effect if your chosen Deck Master has one (An inherent summon is any kind of monster effect that allows the card to special summon itself to the field without starting a chain, easily identifiable by the lack of a "":"" or "";"" in the effect). Deck Masters can be returned to the Deck Master Zone if they get sent from the field to any other zone, like the graveyard or banishment. You must pay a cumulative cost of 500 life points to summon your Deck Master for each time it has returned to the Deck Master Zone. (1st: 500 LP, 2nd: 1,000 LP, 3rd: 1500 LP, etc...)

The result was this deck. This deck IS interruption, you play against this deck you WILL sit and wait while i have 7 activateable effects on your main phase. It never stops, you will sooner run out of cards than you will things to do. Make SURE you run as much of the white woods line as you can before beginning centurion, even though cards like asteria directly synergize with the main starter of centurion. Synergy IS this deck, centurion runs monsters as spell and traps, while being an even number synchro deck, white woods doesnt discriminate with their effects to destroy spells and traps, and with centurion having GY effects hits only makes it better. Small runick package for support, you can see theres a bunch of interesting little lines and parts where you can meld the two decks mid combo. I got a little lucky with some of the draw effect, but so can you! The combo potential is limitless thanks to level 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 sychros. Learn whitewoods before you learn centurion :)</p>"

Crow on Ruinforce or even Wakaushi or Unclaspare starves the combo of the resources it uses - I guess it's a good thing it has so many extenders, but that also turns a lot of First-Turns into coin-flips.</p><p>- The nature of the deck heavily limits your tech options; a deck that's as combo-heavy as this desperately needs strong tech to help with going second and dealing with interruptions, but the Superheavy Samurai engine means no Called by the Grave or Crossout Designator to stop Hand Traps, no Triple Tactics Talent/Triple Tactics Thrust to punish Hand Traps, no Forbidden Droplet, Dark Ruler No More, Lightning Storm or Evenly Matched to break the opponent's Board - sure, we have Hand Traps of our own, and there are a couple of Monster Board Breakers like Kashtira Fenrir, Dinowrestler Pankratops, and Kaiju Monsters, but such a heavy limiting of options will radically affect the type of meta a deck like this can perform in, and other combo decks do the sort of degenerate things that this deck does without that sort of handicap. That doesn't mean I'll stop playing the deck, nor does it mean that you should, it's just a pretty heavy concession to take on when building around this combo. If a Gear Gigant X search that's less restrictive and more potent than Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi gets released, I'll re-visit this point.</p><p>- An extension of the second problem this deck has is the problem the deck has with going second. While it can easily pull off an OTK and the Hand Traps usually provide it with what it needs to prevent the opponent from setting up a board (just remember that most Hand Traps are low-impact by themselves, try to use them in conjunction with one another and be selective about when and how you use them, don't mindlessly throw your Ash Blossom away - Ash Blossom is used specifically to counter Maxx ""C"" in the OCG, so in any given match-up, try to figure out the opponent's Maxx ""C"" you're holding your Ash Blossom for), this is a ""Weaknesses"" section so I'm trying to emphasise the difficulties the deck can experience. This isn't the Top Meta Deck, it's not even a footnote, you can't be mindless in 90% of match-ups and expect to win anyway.</p><p>Alright, that's enough negativity.</p><p>Highlights:</p><p>- The combo uses Gear Gigant X's effect <em>four</em>&nbsp;<em>times</em> and&nbsp;Qliphort Genius' effect <em>three times</em>. ""Once per turn"" is just a mindset.</p><p>- The combo starts with Machina Gearframe or Superheavy Samurai Motorbike, but can't do it with one card if you start with Machina Redeployment or Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi; ironically, the stronger starters are ""weaker"" in the context of this particular combo.</p><p>- My goal was the find a way to make Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star so that I could recover Infinitrack Tunneler, all without having to start with more than Machina Gearframe. I have succeeded in that goal.</p><p>Combo Notes:</p><p>- The ""standard"" version of this combo ends on Therion ""King"" Regulus, Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora (with Heavy Freight Train Derricrane attached), Double Headed Anger Knuckle and Gigantic ""Champion"" Sargas (with Infinitrack Goliath attached), as well as the standard draw two from Infinitrack Tunneler, and Machina Citadel in the GY, which you can pre-emptively set up with Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora and Gigantic ""Champion"" Sargas if you commit one more Monster (any monster will do) to the combo. Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale is a poor substitute for Machina Citadel, but I'll take the trade-off of Gigantic ""Champion"" Sargas and Machina Citadel for Ampibious Swarmship Amblowhale and Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star&nbsp;<em>and</em> a recycled Infinitrack Tunneler, at least for now while I try to find ways to clean up the combo.</p><p>- Machina Irradiator is the progenitor of this version of the combo. Essentially each enabler in the combo has a sort of ""break-point"" where I determine exactly what I can do and what would be best to do in order to achieve my goal (in this case, ending on the ""standard"" board but with Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star to recycle Infinitrack Tunneler). Machina Gearframe and Machina Unclaspare interact with a ""Machina"" Monster, Qliphort Genius interacts with Level 5 or higher Machine Monsters, and Infinitrack River Stormer interacts with EARTH Machine Monsters (Infinitrack River Stormer, sadly, did not make the final cut of the current build; it's too inefficient without Infinitrack Brutal Dozer, and Infinitrack Brutal Dozer locks you into EARTH Machine Monsters, and getting out Infinitrack Tunneler <em>without</em> Infinitrack Brutal Dozer&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>getting Dingirsu, Orcust of the Evening Star <em>and still</em> getting out Infinitrack Brutal Dozer,&nbsp;<em>while also</em> having any space in the Extra Deck, is very hard, at least while committing to the stipulations of the thought experiement). I kept coming across Machina Irradiator as a result of looking at cards within these filters, and regularly dismissed it because I held that it was a bad card. I still do, to be honest, but in addition to its role in the combo, I've found it to be a useful search for Machina Gearframe when you open Machina Unclaspare, or even just opening with Machina Unclaspare in general.</p><p>- There are many, many,&nbsp;<em>many</em> cards that I have considered in the process of assembling this combo, the most obvious being the Orcust cards themselves, but in addition to having to run too many cards that could easily be bricks, locking you into Machines so early means that you can't make I:P Masquerana for Orcust's big Turn-Two play. I'll keep toying with things though, this is a work-in-progress.&nbsp;</p><p>If you've come this far, you might enjoy a little story about my journey with Machina (I guess if recipes can have them, deck recipes can have them too).</p><p>The reason I started working on this combo is because Machina Fortress is my favourite combo of all time and, by extension, Machina Gearframe is my favourite card to Normal Summon.</p><p>Machina was the first deck I ever topped a tournament with back in 2013, during Dragon Ruler Format; don't worry, it was the second phase of Dragon Ruler Format, after the babies were banned, I was using Redox myself, I only faced/defeated one Dragon Ruler player in Swiss, and I immediately lost in Top Cut, it just sounds more impressive when I reduce it to ""I topped a tournament with Machina during Dragon Ruler Format""... something I also did with Battlin' Boxers, but that's a story for another time.</p><p>The point is that I have a long history with Machina. Even after I dropped out of the game in 2014 with the introduction of Pendulum Monsters (I don't have a particular bias against the Pendulum mechanic, I was just already losing enthusiasm in the game and the introduction of a new mechanic made that transition out of the game easier), I still held deep in my heart the sheer joy I found in the degeneracy of Machina Fortress being able to discard itself as part of the cost of its own summon by its own [unclassified effect], and being able to repeatedly revive it by discarding level 8 Machine Monsters (like I said, this was Dragon Ruler(-adjacent) Format, being able to summon Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack was the name of the game, detaching a Fortress only to revive it again hit different in 2013 - sidebar: Does anyone else say ""Machine Monster"" in their head like Joey did in his duel with Bandit Keith?).</p><p>When I got back into the game in late 2020/early 2021 (between Phantom Rage and Blazing Vortex) the only deck I was interested in was ""the best deck that runs Machina Fortess."" Obviously my attention was turned to Earth Machines and the then-dead Orcust. While I was happy to be playing my favourite card again, the base Earth Machine build at the time was little more than Anger Knuckle Turbo; it wasn't the deck's fault, so to speak, the cards just weren't there yet for a truly combo-heavy Earth Machine deck to emerge. Then the new Supherheavy Samurai support came out, and after playing it to death until the banning of Superheavy Samurai Scarecrow, I realised that Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi/Superheavy Samurai Motorbike were able to produce a Gear Gigant X without using your Normal Summon. The fact that you can start there and get to Machina Gearframe, or start with Machina Gearframe and get to Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi/Superheavy Samurai Motorbike, is just gravy for me - I love combos that flow into each other like that, for a while I tinkered with a Libromancer P.U.N.K. deck because I worked out a combo that could start either with the Libromancer side or the P.U.N.K. side and it would inevitably develop into the other, though I haven't revisited it since the banning of Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights, but I digress.</p><p>If you read this far, I thank you for your time. If you have any advice on more optimal routes I could take to still end up with a recycled Infinitrack Tunneler (which itself was the whole point of getting to Dingirsu, not just recycling it but having it back immediately) and/or more threatening End-Board that I haven't already mentioned, let me know.</p><p>Good luck and Godspeed to anyone who tries this degenerate insanity.</p>"
