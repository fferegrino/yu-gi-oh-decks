Combined with Snake-Eye, this fire deck is nigh unstoppable. If you want to reach high levels on Masterduel ladder with a reliable deck that can either 1st&nbsp;or 2nd and can cram a ton of staples while being consistently powerful, Rescue-ACE is a good deck to play!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><em>&nbsp;</em></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-weight: 400;"">All fire decks that feature a level 1 fire starter has recieved an unbelievable power boost with the release of the ""Snake-Eyes"" cards from the ""Ride Into the Future"" pack in Masterduel! Not only is there enhanced consistency with the Snake-Eye and Diabellestar cards, the power ceiling of RESCUE-ACE has dramatically increased as well, since the new additions to the deck allow it to link spam like no tomorrow! Powerful link bosses like Heatsoul, Amblowhale and Promethean Princess are easily made with a singular Snake-Eyes Ash, on top of your Turbulence's 4 set backrow!</span></div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-weight: 400;""><em>&nbsp;</em></span></div><p style=""text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

A reduced RESCUE-ACE core is included because of the consistency boost the Snake-Eye cards give, and now they number 16 cards. 2 hydrant rather than 3 is used since the card can now be seached/summoned from deck with the Snake-Eye cards. 3 EMERGENCY! are included since they function as ""emergency teleport"" and are effectively 1-card playstarters. 4 Rescue-ACE spells/traps are included as targets for Turbulence to set from deck. REINFORCE! isn't included since the card seems fairly inconsequential compared to the other quick-play spells and traps. One for One is included since it's an additional copy of any level 1 fire you need summoned from deck.&nbsp; <br /></span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Thanks to the consistency boost from Snake-Eyes and Bonfire, a whopping 15 STAPLES is included in the strategy, including 14 handtraps (RESCUE-ACE Impulse is actually a handtrap!). This means you're always going to interrupt your opponent, no matter what turn it is! The usual ""Maxx C"" package is included so the pilot can win the Maxx C minigame. <br /></span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Unlike earlier iterations of this deck, the Extra Deck is now used a lot since the Snake-Eye cards grant this deck immense link climb ability. Linkuriboh + Sunlight Wolf summon Heatsoul, I:P Masquera can be summoned from the backrow during your opponent's turn with Flamberge Dragon, etc. The Extra Deck is a toolbox for answers to specific game states. Since many monsters in the Extra Deck aren't required, they can be banish fodder for Pot of Prosperity.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; color: #d6d6d6;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Rescue-ACE functions as a control-centred midrange deck. Usually, the deck summons Turbulence, sets 4 spells/traps from the deck (two interruptions and two follow-up cards). Combined with the Snake-Eyes cards, this strategy has become much more aggressive since it is able to link climb quickly to Accesscode for an OTK. The hand also may have Rescue-ACE warriors that function as handtraps to net further advantage from deck, hand or GY.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Here is the deck's main combo:&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><em><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Snake-Eyes Ash + Rescue-ACE Turbulence/Extender = 4 set Rescue-ACE spells/traps (interruption and follow-up) + Promethean Princess in GY (monster destruction) + Amblowhale (link-monster summon and 1 card destruction) + Heatsoul (draw 2) + follow-up for next turn in hand</span></em></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><ol start=""1"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; list-style-type: '1.

Magical Musketeer has been a tier 3 and lower deck due to the sheer amount of power creep in the last decade. Its only strength is the spell/trap handtraps that interact with the opponent by negating cards, destroying face up cards, and banishing cards from grave. Its best matchup in the current format is stun since you can pick off fossil dyna more consistently than they can open judgment. (A testament of how slow a deck needs to be in order for the deck to dominate).</p><p>The Fiendsmith support provides the consistency that Musketeer has longed for because you can now search Caspar, Starfire or whatever Musketeer you need. Basically, you are now running 9 copies of Caspar/Starfire and 7 copies of Doc, Calamity, Wild and Kidbrave without taking up the deck space. You could run a similar Small World Package consisting of Ash, Effect Veiler and Nibiru as Small World bridges, but you always had to a) draw no Musketeers and b) needed one of the aforementioned drawn with Small World for the package to be worth it. Fiendsmith works as both a way to get to Starfire/Caspar and as a way to proc them. Its just an efficient searcher for Musketeers. Also, fi you are set on Musketeers, Lurrie is searched and dumped to become the second body needed to make Sequentia.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fiendsmith combo lets your go first endboard be more than Caspar + Starfire pass, converting into Apollousa or High King Caesar with a Musketeer on board that can't be targeted. Prior to Fiendsmith, if you didn't open Caspar or Starfire going first, you were in a bad spot. Going second, if Max got negated, you just passed, now you can convert it into Fiendsmith stuff, making cards like Ash only stop the Musketeer side of the deck, requiring 2 negations minimum to stop the entire combo. Overall, the Fiendsmith engine is a welcome addition and should be run moving forward in every Musketeer deck.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As for the the power cards of the deck, Super Poly, Link into the Vrains, and Ultimate Slayer all have the clause: your opponent cannot respond, making them 'guaranteed' against most meta decks. The idea is to ensure your Muskets can hit the field and these cards generate advantage through denying negation. Super Poly eats a minimum of 2 cards, Ultimate slayer does the same without the discard, and Link into the Vrains guarantees Max resolving his mass search effect or summon effect. If any of light fiend links get destroyed, it recurs 1 light fiend from grave (per copy of LITV). Also, it serves as an extender, so if you get Nibbed, you can just normal summon to continue your plays.&nbsp;</p><p>Extra deck is running the bare minimum to do Musketeer and Fiendsmith combos because it works with the assumption you will just be shuffling everything back. If people start playing D.D. Crow in a format, bump ratios to 2 so you won't get stifled by a banished Lacrimosa or something. (That also means Super Poly or Ultimate Slayer will have to cut their engine size). Ultimate slayer runs the best of each summon type, allowing you to pop with N'tss, bounce with Malong, and negate with Aggregator. Garura is there because of the Super Poly Engine, but you can always just draw a card against fusion decks.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Side deck can be tailered to the event you are going to, so this is by no means fixed. Run more s/t removal if your locals is all stun, run more anti Snake-eyes (or whatever is tier 1) cards if you are going to a YCS. Make adjustments to have a better matchup against the most popular decks.&nbsp;</p><p>Final Notes:&nbsp;</p><p>Runick Fiendsmith Musket is a build I was contemplating but after thorough testing with Runick Muskets in TCG and MD, there are far too many weaknesses to warrant running it with Fiendsmith Musket. You cut Musket S/t to 1 make space for Runick cards, the power cards are (unsurprisingly) more powerful than any of the Runicks, the draw 3 effect of Fountain requires you to draw into Runicks to keep that engine going, and the no BP clause makes the game artifically longer. If Fountain never goes up OR if it goes down, Runick stops working on your opponent's turn. Fiendsmith puts up a lot of damage on board on behalf of the otherwise weak Musketeers, so you can close out games quicker with the non Runick variant. Quicker games, means you grind less in every game, and mitigate the risk of going into time. Also longer games take its toll on you as a player for 9+ round events.&nbsp;</p>"

Small World helps a lot with getting channeler as often as possible. Trap Trick, which probably should be at 3 copies (swap for 1 Hysteric Party or 1 Small World), is to help get Feather Storm as often as possible, as it is the card that wins you most of your games because of its insane negate effect.<br /><br />All of the hand traps, aside from Nibiru, that I chose work with Small world since they all only share 1 Type/Attr/Lvl/ATK/DEF with any of the Harpies. So, you can banish the hand trap from your deck to get to channeler. Nibiru is kind of insane with Cyber Slash and could probably be main decked, because you can just bounce the token on the following turn and go in for game, but opted for Droll and Lock Bird for going first. For the extra deck, I don't actually have S:P but if I did I would run it. If you don't have S:P, I would maybe run either Knightmare Unicorn or Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax (which is what I am running).</p>"

You get Tearlament Lightsworn - the ultimate combination in milling technology! As we near the 2nd&nbsp;anniversary&nbsp;of the release of Tearlaments, we have yet another incredible Tearlament variant.&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">With the release of Legacy of Destruction, new life has been breathed into the Lightsworn strategy. Dragonling and Archfiend add extra gas and consistency by giving more mills, foolish burials and GY summons. Synchro Minerva offers more targeted ""foolish burials"" and milling power by banishing up to 4 lightsworns in GY - which by the way makes Punishment Dragon live. Finally, Lightsworn has been gifted by an omni-negate multi-target trap - Lightsworn Aegis!&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Add on to the new Lightsworn cards the usual GY fusion milling shenanigans of Horus + Tearlament, and you have an incredible GY powerhouse with enough gas to play through any interruption, handtrap and boardstate! While playtesting this deck, it feels like it is so consistent, powerful and contains so much gas that it feels like playing tier 0 Ishizu Tearlament all over again. If you've missed the thrill of full power ""Tear 0,"" I highly suggest giving Tearlaments Lightsworn a try!

Fenrir is simultaneously a combo piece (since it searches for Tear Kash) and a boardbreaker, but only two are used in this deck, since they don't really do anything when milled.</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">You may have noticed that there are hardly any handtraps or generic staples in this deck. The theory behind this build of Tearlaments is that it has so much gas that it can play through all of your opponent's interruptions just fine, as long as your graveyard is accessible and you aren't floodgated to death (most relevant floodgates are at 1 or banned anyways).&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">40 cards are used to ensure this strategy is as consistent and compact as possible. In addition to bricking less, the mills will have much better results than bigger Tearlaments variants because of the deck's compact size.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">As usual, Tearlaments' gameplan is to mill as much as possible to trigger graveyard effects. Like every Tearlaments strategy, this deck aims to mill as much as possible and gain beneficial effects from those mills. The reliance on mills makes this strategy unpredictable and luck dependant, meaning that there are hardly any straightforward combos.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">There are no straightforward ""combos"" for Tearlament Lightsworn due to the random nature of the deck. Combos are hand/mill dependent - leaving the rest of the game up to the duelists individual skill, decision making and mental fortitude (that's the Tearlaments is considered as a difficult to pilot deck). Tearlaments are also infamous for requiring a great deal of skill, since the pilot has to be aware of the various interactions they have in the GY and the amount of cards left in their main deck.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">What differentiates this version of Tearlaments from the others are the Lightsworn cards. Lightsworn allows for more mills, extension, bodies on board, negates, interruption, etc. In short, Lightsworn makes Tearlaments vastly more powerful and consistent than ever before! Try to resolve both of the Synchro Minerva's effects, since her targeted ""foolish burials"" + mill for 4 adds a lot of momentum and resources to this milling strategy.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Generally, endboards consist of any combination of 2-4 negate Apollousa, S:P Little Knight, Lightsworn monster (typically Minerva) + Lightsworn Aegis, Grapha, Rulkallos, Scream and Sulliek. Depending on your mills (which are often very good thanks to new Lightsworn cards), you can get about 2-10+ interruptions/negates!</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></p><ul style=""text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Horus cards are incredible at cracking established boards and can out powerful boss monsters that have negates/interruption.

Be sure to leave the middle MMZ and side MMZs clear for Cross-Sheep's arrows.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">You can also synchro summon Visas Amritara to search ANY Tearlament spell/trap, thanks to the Lightsworn cards. All Lightsworns are light monsters and you have plenty of tuners, so summoning this main character is a breeze, adding extra consistency in this deck.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Any Tearlaments strategy is infamous for requiring a great deal of skill to pilot, since the duelists is required to know all the various interactions that goes on in the GY, and to remember how many cards are left in their deck - the while considering how the opponent will react to the plays. This deck is not easy, so practice makes perfect with Tearlaments.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Very new to the game and like Yusei. Right now I'm only really on 2004 meta ideas so its probably old looking</p><p>Just a basic deck that can lead with a starting combo to Junk Speeder/Warrior with some basic all around negation/removal spells and traps. There's some searchers in the deck too in case of a bad starting hand. The extra deck is lacking because I just don't know of alot of synchro cards. I also aimed for being able to buy this in real life without selling a arm and a leg.</p><p>Future improvements hopefully: Better tuner composition. Better extra deck. More precise usage of spells and traps. A clearer win condition.</p>

Wanna know what Domain Format is?&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""color: #ffffff; font-family: Roboto, Noto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; white-space-collapse: preserve; background-color: #282828;"">DISCORD LINK https://discord.gg/E9GU5YpW Domain Format requires your deck to have 60 cards in the main deck instead of the usual minimum of 40. You can only run 1 copy of each card in your deck (So you can't play 3 Blue-Eyes White Dragons for example), and you must have a Deck Master, a Monster that exists outside of the Main or Extra deck, meaning it doesn't count to the 60 card main deck limit or 15 card extra deck limit. Your Deck Master determines what other monsters you can play in your deck, depending on it's Type, Attribute, and affiliations with Archetypes aswell as specific cards listed in it's text. If it mentions a Type, Attribute or specific ATK/DEF line (Like 2400ATK/1000 DEF for example) in it's text, you can also include those kinds of monsters in your deck. Deck Masters can be summoned from the Deck Master Zone using their appropriate mechanic (Normal Summon, Tribute Summon, Synchro Summon, etc...) or by using their Inherent Summon effect if your chosen Deck Master has one (An inherent summon is any kind of monster effect that allows the card to special summon itself to the field without starting a chain, easily identifiable by the lack of a "":"" or "";"" in the effect). Deck Masters can be returned to the Deck Master Zone if they get sent from the field to any other zone, like the graveyard or banishment. You must pay a cumulative cost of 500 life points to summon your Deck Master for each time it has returned to the Deck Master Zone. (1st: 500 LP, 2nd: 1,000 LP, 3rd: 1500 LP, etc...)

The result was this deck. This deck IS interruption, you play against this deck you WILL sit and wait while i have 7 activateable effects on your main phase. It never stops, you will sooner run out of cards than you will things to do. Make SURE you run as much of the white woods line as you can before beginning centurion, even though cards like asteria directly synergize with the main starter of centurion. Synergy IS this deck, centurion runs monsters as spell and traps, while being an even number synchro deck, white woods doesnt discriminate with their effects to destroy spells and traps, and with centurion having GY effects hits only makes it better. Small runick package for support, you can see theres a bunch of interesting little lines and parts where you can meld the two decks mid combo. I got a little lucky with some of the draw effect, but so can you! The combo potential is limitless thanks to level 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 sychros. Learn whitewoods before you learn centurion :)</p>"

Crow on Ruinforce or even Wakaushi or Unclaspare starves the combo of the resources it uses - I guess it's a good thing it has so many extenders, but that also turns a lot of First-Turns into coin-flips.</p><p>- The nature of the deck heavily limits your tech options; a deck that's as combo-heavy as this desperately needs strong tech to help with going second and dealing with interruptions, but the Superheavy Samurai engine means no Called by the Grave or Crossout Designator to stop Hand Traps, no Triple Tactics Talent/Triple Tactics Thrust to punish Hand Traps, no Forbidden Droplet, Dark Ruler No More, Lightning Storm or Evenly Matched to break the opponent's Board - sure, we have Hand Traps of our own, and there are a couple of Monster Board Breakers like Kashtira Fenrir, Dinowrestler Pankratops, and Kaiju Monsters, but such a heavy limiting of options will radically affect the type of meta a deck like this can perform in, and other combo decks do the sort of degenerate things that this deck does without that sort of handicap. That doesn't mean I'll stop playing the deck, nor does it mean that you should, it's just a pretty heavy concession to take on when building around this combo. If a Gear Gigant X search that's less restrictive and more potent than Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi gets released, I'll re-visit this point.</p><p>- An extension of the second problem this deck has is the problem the deck has with going second. While it can easily pull off an OTK and the Hand Traps usually provide it with what it needs to prevent the opponent from setting up a board (just remember that most Hand Traps are low-impact by themselves, try to use them in conjunction with one another and be selective about when and how you use them, don't mindlessly throw your Ash Blossom away - Ash Blossom is used specifically to counter Maxx ""C"" in the OCG, so in any given match-up, try to figure out the opponent's Maxx ""C"" you're holding your Ash Blossom for), this is a ""Weaknesses"" section so I'm trying to emphasise the difficulties the deck can experience. This isn't the Top Meta Deck, it's not even a footnote, you can't be mindless in 90% of match-ups and expect to win anyway.</p><p>Alright, that's enough negativity.</p><p>Highlights:</p><p>- The combo uses Gear Gigant X's effect <em>four</em>&nbsp;<em>times</em> and&nbsp;Qliphort Genius' effect <em>three times</em>. ""Once per turn"" is just a mindset.</p><p>- The combo starts with Machina Gearframe or Superheavy Samurai Motorbike, but can't do it with one card if you start with Machina Redeployment or Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi; ironically, the stronger starters are ""weaker"" in the context of this particular combo.</p><p>- My goal was the find a way to make Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star so that I could recover Infinitrack Tunneler, all without having to start with more than Machina Gearframe. I have succeeded in that goal.</p><p>Combo Notes:</p><p>- The ""standard"" version of this combo ends on Therion ""King"" Regulus, Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora (with Heavy Freight Train Derricrane attached), Double Headed Anger Knuckle and Gigantic ""Champion"" Sargas (with Infinitrack Goliath attached), as well as the standard draw two from Infinitrack Tunneler, and Machina Citadel in the GY, which you can pre-emptively set up with Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora and Gigantic ""Champion"" Sargas if you commit one more Monster (any monster will do) to the combo. Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale is a poor substitute for Machina Citadel, but I'll take the trade-off of Gigantic ""Champion"" Sargas and Machina Citadel for Ampibious Swarmship Amblowhale and Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star&nbsp;<em>and</em> a recycled Infinitrack Tunneler, at least for now while I try to find ways to clean up the combo.</p><p>- Machina Irradiator is the progenitor of this version of the combo. Essentially each enabler in the combo has a sort of ""break-point"" where I determine exactly what I can do and what would be best to do in order to achieve my goal (in this case, ending on the ""standard"" board but with Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star to recycle Infinitrack Tunneler). Machina Gearframe and Machina Unclaspare interact with a ""Machina"" Monster, Qliphort Genius interacts with Level 5 or higher Machine Monsters, and Infinitrack River Stormer interacts with EARTH Machine Monsters (Infinitrack River Stormer, sadly, did not make the final cut of the current build; it's too inefficient without Infinitrack Brutal Dozer, and Infinitrack Brutal Dozer locks you into EARTH Machine Monsters, and getting out Infinitrack Tunneler <em>without</em> Infinitrack Brutal Dozer&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>getting Dingirsu, Orcust of the Evening Star <em>and still</em> getting out Infinitrack Brutal Dozer,&nbsp;<em>while also</em> having any space in the Extra Deck, is very hard, at least while committing to the stipulations of the thought experiement). I kept coming across Machina Irradiator as a result of looking at cards within these filters, and regularly dismissed it because I held that it was a bad card. I still do, to be honest, but in addition to its role in the combo, I've found it to be a useful search for Machina Gearframe when you open Machina Unclaspare, or even just opening with Machina Unclaspare in general.</p><p>- There are many, many,&nbsp;<em>many</em> cards that I have considered in the process of assembling this combo, the most obvious being the Orcust cards themselves, but in addition to having to run too many cards that could easily be bricks, locking you into Machines so early means that you can't make I:P Masquerana for Orcust's big Turn-Two play. I'll keep toying with things though, this is a work-in-progress.&nbsp;</p><p>If you've come this far, you might enjoy a little story about my journey with Machina (I guess if recipes can have them, deck recipes can have them too).</p><p>The reason I started working on this combo is because Machina Fortress is my favourite combo of all time and, by extension, Machina Gearframe is my favourite card to Normal Summon.</p><p>Machina was the first deck I ever topped a tournament with back in 2013, during Dragon Ruler Format; don't worry, it was the second phase of Dragon Ruler Format, after the babies were banned, I was using Redox myself, I only faced/defeated one Dragon Ruler player in Swiss, and I immediately lost in Top Cut, it just sounds more impressive when I reduce it to ""I topped a tournament with Machina during Dragon Ruler Format""... something I also did with Battlin' Boxers, but that's a story for another time.</p><p>The point is that I have a long history with Machina. Even after I dropped out of the game in 2014 with the introduction of Pendulum Monsters (I don't have a particular bias against the Pendulum mechanic, I was just already losing enthusiasm in the game and the introduction of a new mechanic made that transition out of the game easier), I still held deep in my heart the sheer joy I found in the degeneracy of Machina Fortress being able to discard itself as part of the cost of its own summon by its own [unclassified effect], and being able to repeatedly revive it by discarding level 8 Machine Monsters (like I said, this was Dragon Ruler(-adjacent) Format, being able to summon Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack was the name of the game, detaching a Fortress only to revive it again hit different in 2013 - sidebar: Does anyone else say ""Machine Monster"" in their head like Joey did in his duel with Bandit Keith?).</p><p>When I got back into the game in late 2020/early 2021 (between Phantom Rage and Blazing Vortex) the only deck I was interested in was ""the best deck that runs Machina Fortess."" Obviously my attention was turned to Earth Machines and the then-dead Orcust. While I was happy to be playing my favourite card again, the base Earth Machine build at the time was little more than Anger Knuckle Turbo; it wasn't the deck's fault, so to speak, the cards just weren't there yet for a truly combo-heavy Earth Machine deck to emerge. Then the new Supherheavy Samurai support came out, and after playing it to death until the banning of Superheavy Samurai Scarecrow, I realised that Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi/Superheavy Samurai Motorbike were able to produce a Gear Gigant X without using your Normal Summon. The fact that you can start there and get to Machina Gearframe, or start with Machina Gearframe and get to Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi/Superheavy Samurai Motorbike, is just gravy for me - I love combos that flow into each other like that, for a while I tinkered with a Libromancer P.U.N.K. deck because I worked out a combo that could start either with the Libromancer side or the P.U.N.K. side and it would inevitably develop into the other, though I haven't revisited it since the banning of Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights, but I digress.</p><p>If you read this far, I thank you for your time. If you have any advice on more optimal routes I could take to still end up with a recycled Infinitrack Tunneler (which itself was the whole point of getting to Dingirsu, not just recycling it but having it back immediately) and/or more threatening End-Board that I haven't already mentioned, let me know.</p><p>Good luck and Godspeed to anyone who tries this degenerate insanity.</p>"

Having only 14 engine cards leaves a lot of room for handtraps and boardbreakers. I opted for Cosmic Cyclone in the main to deal with Runick Stun, which I saw none of, but it also helped against decks like Centurion and Voiceless. I don't think there's too much in the main deck I would alter at this moment.<br /><br />In the extra deck I'd definitely want to add in Timelord Progenitor Vorpgate, since it can handle the potential boards that yubel can end on.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the side, I think I'd look for a way to squeeze in Crossout Designator and Dimensional Barrier. A lot of players chose to go first when losing game 1 at the event just to try and dig for a copy, and it was the biggest detriment I ended up having to deal with through most of my matches, when it showed up.</p>"

This one's for you.,"<p>The long story short is that Branded in High Spirits, Golden Swordsoul, and the Vestals help make up for what Tear has lost by providing easy Tuner and Follow-Up Access. This is one of the smoothest functioning Tear builds I've been able to make since Merrli was banned, and the brick rate is extremely low. Trivikarma is a fantastic mill, but too often do I find it losing me games in my hand. Easy access to Amritara through the Vestals convinced me that I could cut it.</p><p>The main goal was to make the collective Kitkallos &amp; Tearkash mills just as explosive and consistent as before the deck was hit hard on the banlist. While this goal was certainly unachievable, it's the best solution I've found to this problem and can still open and unlock extremely oppressive plays on the opponent's turn after a Kitkallos-Sulliek pass Maxx ""C"" turn, let alone when left to free-play.</p><p>Golden Swordsoul can banish from field or GY to summon a Vestal from GY or hand. Eccelsia can also tutor one out, and triggering this effect is extremely natural by way of Shufflers, Malicious, Redoer (detach Golden or Golden already in GY) and Link a self-revived Reinoheart for Cross Sheep. You can also Special Summon it going second using your Battle Phase and a Normal Summon if things get dire (this is usually how Golden ends up under Redoer), and sometimes you get lucky and a Fader is just enough to survive to the next turn, recycle GY effects and top deck for game. The second one does come up, and it comes up quite often. I've rarely found myself wanting a third.</p><p>Quem, Cartesia &amp; Cross Sheep generate ludricrous amounts of advantage. As an example, if you can link summon Cross Sheep with Quem on board, you can revive Cartesia, summon Granguignol (Dump Malicious), Cross Sheep to revive Quem and end with the ability to revive Cartesia on the opponent's turn to trigger Cross Sheep at a moment's notice. Cartesia also lets you get double value for your Tear names, sending them to the GY for effect while summoning a Fusion herself (Typically Granguignol or Dragostapelia)</p><p>High Spirits can send Rullkalos with a Tear Name (or Nessie, though this rarely is worth it) to fusion Kitkallos and can send any Spellcaster and Granguignol to fetch any of the Vestals. The preferred Vestal changes depending on the current hand, field, GY and even opponent's board and chains, most notably because Granguignol can banish itself to tutor Quem from the deck making it better to grab Golden or Ecclesia.</p><p>Cartesia, Ecclesia, and High Spirits all recycle themselves if a Fusion is sent to the GY. Maximize this interaction for best results. In long games, Cartesia and Ecclesia can make Amritara on their own.</p><p>The ratios in this deck are extremely fragile, and the only card that I think is up for debate in my opinion is the third Scream. It could conceivably be Bystial Aluber to Special Summon Cartesia or Fairy Tail Snow, though you recycle resources so much in this deck that there's not much fuel for Snow to banish. My argument against Aluber is that if I'm playing a card I exclusively want to mill, I should re-insert Trivikarma; Though this argument isn't fully valid as you can still pitch Aluber for cards like Scheiren and Cryme and dump it with Saronir. My argument against Druiswurm is that it's only useful if you draw exactly it or Magnamhut and it is more likely going to get used against you by your opponent's Dharc lines. There is an argument to play Psy-Framelord Omega to close out games and recycle important resources in long, stalled-out games or in games where your cards are getting banished by monsters like Kashtira Fenrir &amp; Unicorn, but I just don't think there's anything in the Extra that you can cut to include it.</p><p>I recognize that this deck takes a LOT of UR investment, but in my experience so far it works and works <em>well</em>. If you need to make some budget cuts to work your way up to it, here are some changes that will make the deck worse but a more affordable investment/transition:</p><p>Shaddolls Beast, Squamata, and Hollow can help you fill out 40 and give you Winda access if you have her already, and are more Spellcaster pitches for High Spirits. However, I don't know if Winda is necessary. <br />Play another Droplet and/or 1 Triple Tac if you have them<br />Amritara mostly comes up in specific hands and grind games, feel free to craft it last and use cards like Dharc and Knightmare Phoenix in the meantime<br />Some other cards that can fill the Extra if you have them are Chaos Angel, Garura, Exciton Knight<br />If you're really strapped for Extra deck cards, you can play one of the 2500 Atk SR Hero Fusions as a High Spirits target for Reinoheart and Malicious<br />Craft Cartesia &amp; Granguinol before Quem<br />Card Destruction if you've pulled it from the Legacy packs<br />Gammeciel is a funny Aqua if you're running into a mass of Purrely and/or unable to craft Goddess<br />If you already have Trivikarma, feel free to play it if you think you need it or just need to fill out 40 cards<br />Throw your Ash Blossoms in if you're REALLY strapped for cards</p>"

It is play-tested in my locals scene, with some success beating SE or Tenpai (set Albaz -&gt; Lenatus). It has some recovery options and there's a small bystial package in the side deck if needed. the staples are very much META dependent, but the core doesn't change as much. Whatever you do with this list, DO NOT take out ash and imperms, UNLESS you already have the TTT package. I'd like to lean more towards a 40 card profile, since I hate 50+ profiles.

Go for it I guess.,"<p>You may be looking at this list and thinking that this guy is insane. I am but combining the subpar Roids and the competent Machinas has actually been pretty fun.</p><p>The main starter is either Gearframe or Redeployment (To search Gearframe), searching Unclaspare to dump a Machina while going into Gigant to search typically a Roid. From there you kind of just say good luck. The deck mostly wants to utilize the combination of Machinas and Roids to generate resources, get some fusions in, and hit hard. The Roids definetely do hurt the Machina part more than help, but the deck has a couple of neat interactions that can actually snag a few games. Despite everything, Machinas are able to help with constant field presence and interruption (Citadel) while helping with big numbers and access to big Rank 10s. The Roids can actually pull of neat plays in their own right as well, Mixeroid can help facilitate rank 4 plays, Dragonroid adds consistency, and Express can help recoup recources and lead into fusion via adding back discarded materials. The deck is pretty simple and is 100% not going to have any chance against the meta, but it's a pretty fun deck to mess around with if you have a soft spot for Roids.</p><p>Funny Stuff- Dragonroid can help facilitate constant materials to summon Ruinforce by being Level 9 and being easily discardable for Roid searches. Having a Mobile Base on board is good for having a massive body, but also can lead to an easy Rank 10 play. Megaroid City's search affect can help trigger Citadel if you pop an EARTH machine for cost, it's a neat combo. Mixeroids second effect combined with the massive amount of machines that end up in grave can clutch games, it's a funny card. Since Vehicroid Connection Zone prevents destruction, you can target a fusion summoned with Connection Zone with Citadel to nuke the field without loosing your fusion (This same logic applies with Overdrive because the pop effect isnt cost)</p><p>Other Stuff- You can alter the build to stray away from fusions adding in different roids like Armoroid to fuel Fortress and to make way for more generic staples. You can swap out Submarineroid and Steamroid for Stealthroid and Truckroid to make the main fusion Stealth Union, you can also remove Jumbo Drill for another Extra Deck slot. Honestly its probably the better option giving you access to equip removal, but I like the Drill because its funny.</p><p>Good Luck and Have Fun playing Machina Roids.</p>"

Since Apolluisa is a wind we can get around most of the wind limits on the cards and I:P can work around that as well. Main thing to say to focus out would be Symphoinc Warrior Rockks as you can get a card from your deck and continue the combo. If your hand bricks a bit, you can attempt to focus out the Hi-Speedroid Rubber Band Shooter and at least get the banish off and combo with other cards you have to get certian cards in the graveyard or to get a specific card to your hand. You are not limited to synchro wind cards unless you normal summon with the card effect so you can work around that downside pretty easily.<br /><br />Feel free to let me know of anything you find that works better or if you have any complaints about the deck that doesn't work all that well together.</p>"

Although I'm not playing it anymore, I'm keeping the other deck profile up and making this new one. There is a lot of space for hand traps in this deck which is really great.</p><p>One thing thats kind of nice, is that if you don't open any of your 1 card combos, and you open Fusion Armament with Bradamante, you can still Fuse into Ultimate Flame Swordsman or Fighting Flame Dragon.</p><p>By the time I had finished the main deck, I realized that I had a lot of tuners, so I tried to throw in some random Fire Synchro monsters in that are relatively easy to summon. Black Rose can either be summoned off of Ash plus Flame Swordsman, or Roland plus Salamandra. Ruddy can be summoned off of either Gearfried plus any of the 1 star tuners, or Black Rose, plus Ash. Roland can be summoned off of Flame Swordsman plus any 1 star, or Salamandra plus Ash. Could also cut 1 of each Flame Swordsman Fusion monster for 2 more link monsters potentially. Maybe a Knightmare Phoenix, or another generic fire link monster like Pitknight Earlie or one of the Salamangreat link monsters, or even I:P.</p><p>Promethean is great. Also running only Fire types in the extra deck so you never get locked out of any special summoning, aside from Nibiru in the side deck. Could run any other 3 instead of Nibiru, because there are quite a few ways to break your opponent's board, I just chose Nibiru because I couldn't think of another side option. Maybe could try Fire Recovery? Not sure.</p>"

Paladin of the Cursed Dragon & Honest,"<p>Zombie World deck using Paladin of the Cursed Dragon ft. Thunder King Rai-Oh and Honest.<br /><br /></p><p>* Deck has a ton of synergy if you can get the field spell to stick. Paladin can steal opponent's monsters, very useful if you Creature Swap your Goblin or Turtle to the enemy's side and attack into it with Paladin, getting your special summon and Goblin/Turtle back.<br />* Thunder King is fantastic with Zombie World up, able to negate any special summons then be brought back/reused with Book of Life/Zombie Master/Mezuki to keep your opponent out of Special Summons.<br />* Honest and Chalice are great combat tricks with Paladin or Thunder King, even if Paladin's effect gets negated, it isn't turn specific, so if you use Chalice during your opponent's turn, once it gets back to your turn his effect will return and you can use it to grab whatever was destroyed during combat.<br />* Book of Moon helps Paladin get over more things and can also be useful with Doomkaiser as flipping the monster you stole face down will remove the destruction effect.<br />* Summoner Monk can use extra spell cards like Terra/Zombie World (or non-live Book) to bring out key cards.</p><p>________</p><p>Still testing cards, Side deck certainly isn't optimized/is just housing a few cards I'd like to try.<br /><br />Marionette Mite is a cool card once Zombie World is up, however struggled to find deck space for it and not enough cards to convert off it (e.g. would need more tuners, tributes or sac outlets to make use of the stolen card before the end of turn). If I did find space though, it would also open up access to Underground Arachnid which I might consider, as it's a very strong card.<br />Card Guard can be a useful summon of Summoner Monk, allowing you to protect your Zombie World (or a monster/synchro) you don't want destroyed, otherwise Field Barrier is good against other decks that run Field Spells.<br />Rivalry can be a fun side in card, if Zombie World is up and they control a monster on field, basically locks them down, unable to summon anything else (barring the mirror).<br />Imperial Iron Wall is handy against GY hate, but also a really fun mini-engine with Plaguespreader.<br />There's also the idea of running Everliving Underworld Cannon as each steal/special summon would cause a considerable amount of burn damage, but might be a little too gimmicky/not enough space.<br />I'd like to find room for a single Gale, great effect that synergises with out gameplan, gives us another Tuner and opens up the extra deck to some Blackwing Synchro's.<br />Would love Threatening Roar in the main deck to help against speedier decks, but again, deck space.<br />Finally, Caius sure would be nice. But yeah, not sure where I'd fit him.</p>"

This deck has so many staples in it while being consistent that duelists sometimes say the Tenpai player is using a OTK engine in a handtrap deck!</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>TENPAI </strong>cards are a potent, compact and consistent OTK strategy composed primarily of 1-card starters. Almost every Tenpai card has as much potential and gas as ""Branded Fusion"" and ""Snake-Eyes Ash!"" This deck core uses 3 Sangen Summoning (searcher field spell), 3 Sangen Kaimen (emergency teleport), 3 Tenpai Chundra (summons from deck), 3 Tenpai Paidra (spell/trap searcher) and 2 Fadra (quick efffect synchro summon - the only non-starter). Terraforming and Pot of Prosperity count as additional 1 card starters, effectively granting this deck 16 1-card starters.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The funny twist with this strategy is that the Side Deck is composed entirely of <strong>CENTUR-ION</strong>&nbsp;cards. These 15 cards in the Side Deck give you incredibly consistent access to a Calamity Lock, essentially giving you 16 1-card starters just like Tenpai. The 3 Primera, 3 Trudea, 3 Stand-Up, and 3 Emblema Oath combined with the Main Deck's Terraforming and Pot of Prosperity allow this deck incredible access to it's strategy.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The rest of the deck are <strong>STAPLES</strong>! The board breakers consist of x3 Kashtira Fenrir, x2 Droplet x2 Lightning Storm and x1 Harpie's Feather Duster. These board breakers disproportionately eliminate your opponent's resources to make a breakthrough and OTK with Tenpai much easier. There are handtraps aplenty in this deck - so much so that your opponent will most likely have a sub-optimal board facing down your OTK juggernaut.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>GAMEPLAN</strong>&nbsp;with this deck is straightforward &ndash; Slowdown your opponent with handtraps, break their board with boardbreakers, then OTK/FTK with your many 1-card starters!</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">You'll always win the die-roll since you want to go second.

Worry not! Your Centur-Ion deck has 25 staples/handtraps/boardbreakers to slow down your opponent so you can still play a regular grindgame with their simplified gamestate with the Centur-Ion cards.

Slifer is my favorite nostalgia card. He's super easy to summon in this deck. Numeron is super budget and puts a lot of bodies on board to tribute to Slifer. If you don't have Slifer though, your Numeron monsters can win you the game anyway.</p><p>I put a bunch of board breakers into the side deck, like Nibiru, Thunderforce, Cyber Jar, and Mirror Force. Mirror Force and Infinite Impermanence work well with Trap Trick so I went with those as side deck options instead of other hand traps. Cyber Jar is great because it's a board wipe/draw 5 that can also put a couple of extra bodies onto the board if you draw into your non-Slifer monsters.&nbsp;</p><p>You can probably cut 1 each of Numeron Calling, Planet Pathfinder, and Numeron Wall for 3 of the side deck options, as drawing more than 1 of any of them feels bad. Then maybe swap in some other hand traps into the side deck. This is what I stuck with though.</p>"

This list is much more streamlined into getting access to you're mainline combo whether or not you have access to ositnato.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously this deck can still put up a formidable endboard with ostinato ending on vortex, masq, Exceed the pend, and a live Soul of the Supreme celestial king that translates into a Z-arc pop. I wont go over everything i did in the last list(just go look at that for the main stuff.) So for this I will just explain some more specific details.</p><p>1.Z-arc is worth it to play around some specifics. The original lists endboard was countered by DRNM but now you can retain access to a board wipe with the trap. Plus I have noticed that Tenpai has some serious issues getting around Z-arc conventionally.</p><p>2. This builds ED space is extremly tight. You have basically 2 free spots to use for tech. I choose Underworld Goddess to deal with potential Towers and I choose tapier in awkward hands that can only put 2 bodies but no scales on board. Everything els is, imo, Mandatory.&nbsp;</p><p>3. The reason for the Odd-eyes pend dragon is cause its material for Z-arc. You need to banish Dragons specifically off the trap to get Z-arc online so using the pend magicians that are always treated as each dragon doesnt work. And because the ED space is tight having 1 of the dragons maindecked gives some space to work.</p><p>4. Realistically it doesnt matter if you go with the original or the Normal Pendulum dragon, both are just material for Z-arc. The only notable differences are that Pendulum dragon can search out Gate Zero, Couplet, or Luisworm in VERY awkward hands whereas Arc Pend Dragon can be foolished for dragon shrine to still send Druisworm and has favorable High scale. They aren't bricks per say but that doesnt mean its fun to draw them.&nbsp;</p><p>5. This deck can realistically play through most handtraps. D-shifter is where Baguska comes in since most decks on shifter have problems with the sleepy boi. Nibiru can be annoying but opponents will have to fire it early to prevent you from getting your vortex dragon online, Usually you will still have the Pendulum summon left after they nib early. You dont have to search AS much if you get drolled but obviously you will have a weaker endboard but it will still be a competent endboard.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have questions or comments, let me know below.&nbsp;</p>"

The strategy is still pretty one-note, but they have access to Colossus with their banished assets being shuffled with Nemeses. Magnamut can search for either more Bystials or the Starry Dragon itself if need be. Any Bystial + Fairy Knight is a free Chaos Angel. Zeus is pretty much a last resort if you can't keep field advantage. Starring knight is a great loop extender for the Dragon allowing a special summon without using the baackrow and also being able to act as Bystial fodder in grave or specialing back out to pitch specific Knights in the grave for their own banishing effects, manage them wisely.</p>"

Las cartas Sangen, como Sangen Kiman y Sangen Summoning, son cruciales para proteger e invocar monstruos de forma especial. El mazo tambi&eacute;n incluye cartas de coherencia como Pot of Prosperity, Set Rotation y Terraforming. Adem&aacute;s, hay ""Rompe campos"" como Harpy's Feather Duster, Lightning Storm y Forbidden Droplet, as&iacute; como trampas de mano como Ash Blossom, Ghost Belle e Impermanence para interrumpir.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>El Extra deck incluye Synchros como Sangan Pai Bident Dragon, Trishula y Black Rose Dragon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>El objetivo de este mazo es establecer un campo fuerte con cartas Tenpai Dragons y Sangen, proteger a tus monstruos con trampas de mano e interrumpir las jugadas de tu oponente con cartas de destrucci&oacute;n de campo. Luego, usa tus monstruos Synchro para abrumar a tu oponente y asegurar la victoria.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Combo para el primer turno:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dos Dragones Tenpai:</strong> Invoca normalmente una copia de Blanco, usa su efecto para agregar una carta de Hechizo del mazo a tu mano. Invoca de forma especial a Rojo, controlando un monstruo Drag&oacute;n de Fuego. Usa Blanco y Rojo como materiales de Link para invocar Esferas del Drag&oacute;n de Hielo. Esto te permite hacer rebotar una carta en el campo a la mano durante el turno de tu oponente y convocar a un Drag&oacute;n del mazo usando el efecto de Esferas en el cementerio.</p><p><strong>Sangen spell, Verde + 1:</strong> activa Sangen para agregar Blanco del mazo a tu mano. Invoca normalmente a Blanco, usa su efecto para agregar el hechizo con nombre diferente del mazo a tu mano. Activa el hechizo para agregar Rojo del mazo a tu mano. Activa Rojo para convocarlo de forma especial al campo. Usa Blanco y Rojo para convocar por sincronizaci&oacute;n al Drag&oacute;n Hada Antiguo. Usa el efecto del Drag&oacute;n Hada Antiguo para convocar de forma especial a un monstruo de nivel 4 o inferior desde tu mano (Verde), luego usa su efecto para agregar campo. Usa Ancient Fairy Dragon y Rojo para convocar en sincronizaci&oacute;n a Shooting Star Dragon. Coloca Secret Village of the Spellcasters desde tu mano. Con el efecto de Shooting Star Dragon, manda tenpai Rojo y sincroniza con Ancient Fairy Dragon para invocar Nirvana High Paladin.</p><p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Combo para el segundo turno:</strong></span></p><p><strong>Dimension Shifter OTK:</strong> activa Dimension Shifter en el turno de tu oponente. Usa Sangan Kimman para agregar Rojo o Blanco. Ataca con Rojo y Blanco, luego usa el efecto de Rojo para convocar verde, luego ocupa el efecto de Blanco para convocar por sincronizaci&oacute;n a Senpai Bident Dragon y ataca. Realiza una sincronizaci&oacute;n r&aacute;pida con Verde y Senpai Bident Dragon para convocar a Trident Dron. Usa el efecto de Trident Dron para destruir el hechizo de campo boca abajo, duplicar su ataque y obtener un ataque adicional. Ataca dos veces para causar 6000 de da&ntilde;o cada uno.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Black Rose Dragon Board Breaker:</strong> Invoca normalmente a Blanco, usa su efecto para agregar a Kimman del mazo a tu mano. convoca de forma especial a Rojo desde el mazo, ataca y usa el efecto de Rojo para convocar Verde. Activa el efecto para Invocar por sincronizaci&oacute;n a Black Rose Dragon, destruyendo todas las cartas en el campo, incluida tu invocaci&oacute;n Sangan. Activa Kimman para invocar Verde y renacer Rojo. Ataca directamente con Verde, Rojo, realiza Sincronizaci&oacute;n para Sangen y renace Black Rose Dragon.</p><p>Estos combos te ayudar&aacute;n a maximizar el potencial de Tenpai Dragon tanto en el primer como en el segundo turno, permiti&eacute;ndote romper tableros, OTK y controlar el juego. Recuerda adaptar estos combos seg&uacute;n la situaci&oacute;n y las cartas que tengas en la mano.</p>"

This is my ideal way to run vaalmonica post LEDE.&nbsp;</p><p>I found that although this variant doesn't have a huge turn 1, it can quickly, and consistently gain massive advantage on turn 3 and over.</p><p>Since the vaalmonica engine doesn't really need its normal summon, the invoked engine feels pretty good and it provides you with an omni negate + a discard for your pendelum monsters to scale themselves.</p><p>A typical combo with Magical Meltdown + a Vaalmonica scale and a spell would go: Magical Meltdown -&gt; Normal Summon Alister -&gt; add invocation -&gt; Link into Artemis -&gt; Fusion Summon Mechaba -&gt; Add back the Alister -&gt; Activate one of the vaalmonica pendelums discarding Alister (Ideally you want to discard Selettrice to add itself back or a trap to use the effect from the graveyard via Zebufera later) -&gt; Set scales (At this point in the combo you want a Selettrice in your hand so you can go through your vaalmonica spells, the main ways to do this are the field spell, invitare or drawing it. Note: Invitare locks you into vaalmonica monster effects so if you have it, use it after you link off Alister so that you can still get to Mechaba. You can also link off the Artemis + Selettrice into I:P Maquerena if you've set your scales already) After you set the scales, pend summon selettrice to get the effect and add vaalmonica scelta -&gt; scelta effect using the take damage effect to grab disarmonia -&gt; disarmonia effect adding back scelta (by now you have 3 resonance counters on dimmono so you can make zebufera -&gt; Link off selettrice to summon zebuferra, set any traps and pass. With this you'll end on selettrice + scelta in hand, mechaba with a free monster negate via selettrice, zebufera to protect your cards and use spell effects in grave, and whatever else was in your opening hand. The following turn you should easily be able to get your field spell + 3 resonance counters on angello to make duralume which pops 3 monsters and can attack 3 times. If you get the 3rd counter while the field spell is on the board, you can steal an opponents monster. By this point you can do basically anything.</p><p>Non engine can be whatever you want, i went with some standard cards.&nbsp;</p><p>The second invocation can be cut.&nbsp;</p><p>For budget options, replace some of the sidedeck with alternatives like pankratops and wait for rarity collection 2 to reprint accesscode talker and apollousa.&nbsp;</p><p>S:P can obviously replace the knightmares if you're balling like that. This also gives you room to add more invoked fusions, links or rank 4s.</p><p>Overall, the deck isn't spectacular and can't accomplish a lot turn 1 but it has a fun gimmick that can work well at against other rogue decks. And if you're lucky, your opponent wont read your cards.</p>"

Paladin of the Cursed Dragon & Honest,"<p>Zombie World deck using Paladin of the Cursed Dragon ft. Thunder King Rai-Oh and Honest.<br /><br />* Deck has a ton of synergy if you can get the field spell to stick. Paladin can steal opponent's monsters, very useful if you Creature Swap your Goblin or Turtle to the enemy's side and attack into it with Paladin, getting your special summon and Goblin/Turtle back.<br />* Thunder King is fantastic with Zombie World up, able to negate any special summons then be brought back/reused with Book of Life/Zombie Master/Mezuki to keep your opponent out of Special Summons.<br />* In the same vain, you can bring back Honest with Book/Master then return it to hand with it's effect to reuse again and again.<br />* Honest and Chalice are great combat tricks with Paladin or Thunder King, even if Paladin's effect gets negated, it isn't turn specific, so if you use Chalice during your opponent's turn, once it gets back to your turn his effect will return and you can use it to grab whatever was destroyed during combat.<br />* Book of Moon helps Paladin get over more things and can also be useful with Doomkaiser as flipping the monster you stole face down will remove the destruction effect. (You can also use Chalice to negate Doomkaisers effect on destruction allowing you to keep the stolen monster).<br />* Summoner Monk can use extra spell cards like Terra/Zombie World (or non-live Books) to bring out key cards.</p><p>________</p><p>Still testing cards, Side deck certainly isn't optimized/is just housing a few cards I'd like to try.</p><p>Marionette Mite is a cool card once Zombie World is up, however struggled to find deck space for it and not enough cards to convert off it (e.g. would need more tuners, tributes or sac outlets to make use of the stolen card before the end of turn). If I did find space though, it would also open up access to Underground Arachnid which I might consider, as it's a very strong card.<br />Card Guard can be a useful summon of Summoner Monk, allowing you to protect your Zombie World (or a monster/synchro) you don't want destroyed, otherwise Field Barrier is good against other decks that run Field Spells.<br />Rivalry can be a fun side in card, if Zombie World is up and they control a monster on field, basically locks them down, unable to summon anything else (barring the mirror).<br />Imperial Iron Wall is handy against GY hate, but also a really fun mini-engine with Plaguespreader.<br />There's also the idea of running Everliving Underworld Cannon as each steal/special summon would cause a considerable amount of burn damage, but might be a little too gimmicky/not enough space.<br />It's a LOT worse, but could always swap out Caius for Zaborg for another Honest target.<br />Would love to find Threatening Roar in the main deck to help against speedier decks, but again, deck space.<br />Finally, Trap Dustshoot would be nice, powerful disruption card and can put key cards in the GY for Doomkaiser to steal later on.</p>"

Chimera Branded is now a waifu deck.,"<div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">With Legacy of Destruction, the entire Illusion archetype has received it's universal searcher - Nightmare Apprentice! Relatively free to summon extender that searches any Illusion monster from deck is a gigantic buff to the Chimera strategy. She also is an enabler for Chaos Angel in Chimera with the perfect attribute, dark - lining up with Mirror Swordsknight's light to make an unaffected towers Chaos Angel!&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Legacy of Destruction also bestows a honourary guest to the Chimera strategy - Diabellze. She is a mini ""Anti-Spell"" floodgate on legs, and now she's searchable and summonable with Chimera!<br /><br />These two vixens grant Chimera a respectable boost in power - perhaps allowing the deck to compete with other tier 1 threats like Snake-Eye, Voiceless Voice and Tenpai. In addition to the immense card advantage, relentless fusion summons and giant boss monsters - Chimera now has a massive consistency buff and a backrow floodgate!&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>Want to see the deck in action?

One smaller support archetype is also utilized. Within two compact fusion engines lies a plethora of powerful plays that are highly searchable 1 card combos!</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>CHIMERA </strong>is fusion oriented deck core capable of overwhelming your opponent with sheer resources! For example, one Mirror Swordknight is a whopping +7 in card advantage! Chimera &nbsp;is a simple and solid gameplan in itself with it's boss monsters - Chimera the King of Phantom Beasts and Berfomet the Mythical King of Phantom Beasts. While they are on the field, their names are ""Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast."" In the GY, Mirror Swordknight and Cornfield Coatl (sent to the GY as part of the combo) offer some targeting protection (Coatl) and monster effect negation (Swordknight). Berfomet and Gazelle nab resources from deck when summoned and used as fusion material. The deck's fusion card, Chimera Fusion, recurs itself from the GY if Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast is on the field or GY (which is always the case). Everything in this archetype grabs resources and recurs itself in this deck so you can keep fusion summoning and interrupting your opponent!</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>BRANDED </strong>in this strategy isn't the main focus - it is merely a support engine designed to increase the consistency and power of the Chimera cards. Branded Fusion is primarily used to fuse into Rindbrumm using Albaz and Gazelle the King of Mythical Claws, netting you an Illusion monster from deck. This starts your Chimera combo! A mini Despia engine is included with 3 Branded Opening, and 2 Aluber for a total of 8 direct ways to access Branded Fusion. Thrust can also fetch Branded Fusion from deck in certain gamestates. If you already have access to your Illusion cards, you can use Branded Fusion to go into the usual Branded Fusion combo lines to set up Mirrorjade or Dragoon.</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>FRIGHTFUR </strong>cards are a mini package in this deck to further enable fusion plays and to assist with card advantage. The strategy needs ample amounts of resources in hand for discard fodder and fusion material, and the package provides ample&nbsp;resources specifically for those uses.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">This deck opts to play boardbreakers since it lacks space for mass handtraps. The boardbreaker line up are 3 Talents, 3 Thrust, 3 Droplet and 1 Evenly. Thrust also has an added bonus to search a starter like Branded Fusion.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">50 cards are used in this deck since the starters for both decks are highly searchable and are 1-card combos. 50 cards also makes it less likely that the garnets like Albaz, Gazelle and Berfomet are hard drawn.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Branded Chimera's usual strategy is deploying multiple fusion boss monsters backed by a robust gameplan and grindgame. Post Legacy of Destruction, the deck also sets up Diabellze to limit your opponent's spell/trap plays.</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><br />Here are Branded Chimera's main combos:&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><br />You may notice in the side deck there are various fiend and fiend floodgates. End of Anubis shuts down decks like Snake-Eye and Tearlaments. Barrier Statue of the Abyss destroys strategies like Tenpai and Fire Kings. The newly available Diabellze renders spell/trap stratgies like Runick near unplayable. Now with a singular Mirror Swordknight or Nightmare Apprentice, these floodgates are easily searchable and summonable!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><em>Mirror Swordknight = Floodgate of choice (Lets use Diabellze for this example)&nbsp;+ a lot of resources/follow-up&nbsp;+&nbsp;Berfomet the Mythical King of Phantom Beasts + 1 hand-rip + monster negate (Swordknight in GY) + targeting protection (Cornfield Coatl in GY).&nbsp;</em></div><ol style=""text-align: left; list-style-type: decimal; flex-direction: column; display: flex;"" start=""1"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Normal summon Mirror Swordknight.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Activate Mirror Swordknight's effect to summon Big-Winged Berfomet from deck.</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">On summon, Big-Winged Berfomet searches for Chimera Fusion and Gazelle the King of Mythical Claws.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Activate Chimera Fusion to fusion summon Chimera the King of Phantom Beasts using Big-Winged Berfomet + Gazelle the King of Mythical Claws.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">CL1&nbsp;Big-Winged Berfomet to summon from GY Mirror Swordknight, CL2 Gazelle the King of Mythical Claws to search from deck any Illusion monster, CL3 Chimera the King of Phantom Beasts to send a random card from opponent's hand to the GY in the End Phase.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Activate Chimera Fusion in the GY to add it to your hand.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Activate Chimera Fusion to fusion summon Berfomet the Mythical King of Phantom Beasts by fusing Chimera the King of Phantom Beasts + any Beast, Fiend or Illusion.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">On summon, Berfomet the Mythical King of Phantom Beasts sends to GY your target of choice (for this example let's use Diabellze).&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">During your end phase, resolve Chimera the King of Phantom Beasts' effect to send 1 random card for your opponent's hand to the GY.<br /></span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">During your opponent's draw phase (or whenever you feel like it's best), activate Chimera the King of Phantom Beasts' effect to summon Diabellze from the GY.

From being able to summon Gearframe off Regulus or Giantrainer pairing perfectly with a heavy-monster SHS strategy, this deck is capable of some truly terrible things. The side and extra are works in progress based on cards I already own so I know they can be improved, but the main deck is plenty potent and really only needs ratio revisions to personal taste. I could see going up one Regulus, but there's enough lines into it to not be an issue.<br /><br />This would probably be meta if not for its weakness to certain hand traps that are prevalent thanks to Snake Eyes- an unanswered Dimension Shifter is a lot harder to get out of even with the variety of starters you have access to. Since you can't easily answer it without spells, a few made it into the sideboard. It might be worth risking the SHS package going offline, but it's so hand-dependant that I wouldn't risk running more than you absolutely need. Experiment and see what feels right.</p>"

The old Spinny + Gazelle ends on the same thing, but with both traps.

The goal overall is to constantly acquire resources to dump down threat after threat each and every turn until you eventually smash through your opponent's defenses and win the duel.</p><hr /><p><strong>GOING FIRST:&nbsp;</strong>Going first, you generally want to build up an end board consisting of <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=49032236"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/49032236.jpg"" data-card=""49032236"" data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora</span></a> and <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=10604644"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/10604644.jpg"" data-card=""10604644"" data-name=""Therion"">Therion ""King"" Regulus</span></a>.

However, we can further abuse this quick effect in combination with <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=13647631"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/13647631.jpg"" data-card=""13647631"" data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Heavy Freight Train Derricrane</span></a>, which upon being detached from an Xyz monster, allows you to destroy any card on the field. This is your main form of disruption.</p><p>Your second best form of disruption comes in the form of <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=10604644"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/10604644.jpg"" data-card=""10604644"" data-name=""Therion"">Therion ""King"" Regulus</span></a>! Because after so many years, Earth Machine finally has an omni negate! If you've already comfortably summoned Number 81 and have the means to extend into another search, you'll be searching for Regulus to give you another point of disruption.&nbsp;</p><p>The third piece to our trifecta of awesomeness is <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=87074380"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/87074380.jpg"" data-card=""87074380"" data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</span></a>! Which you can easily summon with the trap card <a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=59741415"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/59741415.jpg"" data-card=""59741415"" data-name=""Machina Overdrive"">Machina Overdrive</span></a>! The downside of Overdrive can easily be avoided thanks to Number 81's ability to become immune to everything. The ideal strategy is chain 1, use Overdrive, then chain 2, use Number 81. So now, Number 81 won't be destroyed by Overdrive, but you'll also get to special summon Citadel from the deck! What makes Citadel so good and worth summoning? His ability is a spell speed 2 Raigeki! And we can yet again use Number 81's immunity to our favor. Activate Citadel, target Number 81, and then watch the magic! Now all monsters your opponent controls with 3200 or less attack are nuked and you've got 2 terrifying boss monsters still on the field.</p><p>By the way, you can also search <a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=59741415"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/59741415.jpg"" data-card=""59741415"" data-name=""Machina Overdrive"">Machina Overdrive</span></a> with <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=86852702"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/86852702.jpg"" data-card=""86852702"" data-name=""Machina Redeployment"">Machina Redeployment</span></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Another awesome monster you can combo into and act as another piece of disruption is <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=24701066"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/24701066.jpg"" data-card=""24701066"" data-name=""Infinitrack River Stormer"">Infinitrack River Stormer</span></a>, specifically, River Stormer with <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=5205146"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/5205146.jpg"" data-card=""5205146"" data-name=""Infinitrack Road Roller"">Infinitrack Road Roller</span></a> attached to it as material. This is a very annoying floodgate that puts all your opponent's monsters in DEF mode, making it even harder for your opponent to fight back against your powerful trains.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong>GOING SECOND:&nbsp;</strong>If you win the coin toss, you should always choose to go first. Because your going first boss monsters are much more valuable, much safer and more resilient than going second. However, what makes Earth Machine so dangerous is that although it prefers to go first, it has no problem going second as you can easily setup an OTK on your first turn going second!&nbsp;</p><p>Under normal circumstances, you will usually want to setup an OTK by first summoning <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=56910167"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/56910167.jpg"" data-card=""56910167"" data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max</span></a>, which can burn your opponent for 2000, then rank it up into my favorite card: <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=26096328"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/26096328.jpg"" data-card=""26096328"" data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</span></a>! Who can boost itself up to 6000 attack points. And 2000+6000 = Checkmate!&nbsp;</p><p>To prevent any kind of disruption, (and believe me, they're gonna have something) be it a sneaky trap card or your opponent's own boss monster. We'll again be using <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=13647631"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/13647631.jpg"" data-card=""13647631"" data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Heavy Freight Train Derricrane</span></a>. When you detach Derricrane from Gustav, you can pop any card in play. Which further allows us to push forward into our glorious Juggernaut OTK.</p><hr /><p>As I previously stated, if given the choice, choose to go first. Because we can always just go for the Juggernaut OTK on our second turn, and it's much easier to do after the first few turns of the game.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong>COMBOS: </strong>Oh gosh, there's so much to explain here. As the combos of this deck are not as concrete or easy as they used to be. As I stated in the Overview, your main strategy is to continuously acrue resources and apply constant pressure. It's a unique Beatdown / Midrange hybrid that can only be properly understood after you've played with this deck yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>Your main turn 1 combo is to do 2 things with your opening combo: the first is of course, to summon <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=49032236"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/49032236.jpg"" data-card=""49032236"" data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora</span></a> , but the second mandatory thing you'll want to do is Draw 2 cards with <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=97316367"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/97316367.jpg"" data-card=""97316367"" data-name=""Infinitrack Tunneller"">Infinitrack Tunneller</span></a>.

This one has much greater variety, and there's so many more flashy and insane combos you can pull off once you fully get the hang of the deck. Its one of the many reasons I love this deck, there's just so much&nbsp;<em><strong>stuff&nbsp;</strong></em>you can do. Its awesome! &lt;3 However, no deck is perfect. And this deck definitely has many weaknesses, the biggest one is not being able to fit enough hand traps into the main deck. But I've put a bunch of other recommendations in the Side Deck that you can add to your own build of Trains. The cards listed in the Side Deck can help fix the weaknesses this deck has.&nbsp;</p><p>Your biggest weakness is <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=23434538"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/23434538.jpg"" data-card=""23434538"" data-name=""Maxx"">Maxx ""C""</span></a>.

The gameplan is to want to go second in round 1 using tenpai to break boards, throw out hand traps, and OTK. Your opponent will think you are playing tenpai so they will opt for you to go first. This is where you sided out all your tenpai/sangen AND lightning storms for your full kashtira engine.&nbsp;</p><p>These decks work great because of the overlap of some engine/non-engine cards like terraforming, fenrir, D-shifter (crazy). Meaning you can bait out interaction with pressured planet because your opponent wont know if you are getting a unicorn or a fenrir.&nbsp;</p><p>Pot of prosperity is insanely easy to use. Just banish the 6 cards of the engine you arent using.</p><p>If there are other decks that can do the same thing with tenpai lemme know Im trying to think of some.</p>"

Here's a breakdown of its core functionalities:</p><ul data-sourcepos=""5:1-5:82""><li data-sourcepos=""5:1-5:82""><strong>The Chaos Core:</strong> The deck utilizes ""Chaos"" monsters like ""The Chaos Creator"" and ""Chaos Witch"" alongside their support cards like ""Shell of Chaos"" and ""Core of Chaos."" This engine allows for searching and special summoning, facilitating explosive combos and access to strong monsters.</li><li data-sourcepos=""6:1-6:101""><strong>Bystial Legion:</strong> The deck incorporates the ""Bystial"" archetype with monsters like ""Bystial Druiswurm"" and ""Bystial Magnamhut."" These provide a strong search and removal engine, disrupting your opponent's plays while setting up your own.</li><li data-sourcepos=""7:1-7:273""><strong>Control Elements:</strong> Hand traps like ""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"" and ""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"" help disrupt your opponent's key plays. Additionally, powerful traps like ""Solemn Judgment"" and ""Called by the Grave"" offer protection and negation against threats.</li><li data-sourcepos=""8:1-8:37""><strong>Versatile Options:</strong> Cards like ""Necroface"" and ""Branded Regained"" provide graveyard manipulation, fueling combos and reviving powerful monsters. ""Allure of Darkness"" helps filter your deck and potentially discard combo pieces.</li><li data-sourcepos=""9:1-9:193""><strong>Fusion Power:</strong> With cards like ""Gold Sarcophagus"" and ""Foolish Burial,"" the deck can access powerful Fusion monsters like ""Elder Entity N'tss"" and ""Ultimaya Tzolkin"" for game-ending plays.</li><li data-sourcepos=""10:1-11:0""><strong>Extra Deck Toolbox:</strong> The Extra Deck offers diverse options for various situations. ""Chaos Angel"" can be summoned with ease thanks to the ""Chaos"" monsters, ""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"" offers negation, and ""PSY-Framelord Omega"" provides powerful resource advantage.</li></ul><p data-sourcepos=""12:1-12:237""><strong>Overall Playstyle:</strong> This deck aims to establish a strong board presence with powerful ""Chaos"" or ""Bystial"" monsters while maintaining control of the duel through hand traps and powerful traps. It can also delve into Fusion Summons for devastating effects.</p><p data-sourcepos=""14:1-14:238""><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> The deck relies on specific card combinations to pull off its strongest plays. Consistency can be an issue if you don't draw the necessary pieces. Additionally, some hand traps may not be effective against all strategies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p data-sourcepos=""16:1-16:265""><strong>Who should play this deck?</strong> This deck is ideal for players who enjoy a blend of combo and control, utilizing powerful monsters while strategically disrupting their opponent's plays. It offers a complex and rewarding playstyle, but may require practice to master.</p>"

Dimension Shifter works fine here. You can still swing for game under that. You don't <em>need</em> Heat Wave but it can be helpful if your in a match setting with being forced into going first round 2/3. However, the Black Wing Assault burn and Hieratic spin are nice. Plus you should side in 3 Crossout/1 Dimensional Barrier for extra precaution. Depending on what your up against, Necrovalley can really swing the game in your favor. Trident Dragion, Raging Phoenix, and Little Knight are great but way too expensive right now. (At the time of writing this, Dragion is ~$100, Raging ~$50, and Little Knight ~$120). Just don't run Pot of Prosperity and you will still OTK even after using Upstart Goblin. Maybe tech in Pot of Desires if your feeling lucky. Dimensional barrier sucks to play in to. You're still able to get Zealantis out without Phoenix either way, just not as powerful of an end board. Still pretty threatening. Zealantis wins games by himself.&nbsp;</p>"

I didn't want to just run a version of a deck I like, but now it sucks in the grind and is inconsistent. So I instead used a brand new toy I've grown fond of with some old engines I like. Presenting: Adventure Bystial Dogmatika Horus!</p><p>The basic game-plan is to just get into something. For Adventure, Rite/Enchantress is a 1 card combo into an omni. For Bystial, there's no outright 1 card combo but opening any Bystial is disruptio against the common Branded Tearlaments decks I've seen in the event. For Dogmatika, Ecclesia searches out Punishment, Fleurdelis, or allows you to do the Matrix into Alba Zoa line if your opponent has a monster on the field. For Horus, we run an effective 3 copies of King's Sarc, with Canopic acting as a 4th backup method to get Horus monsters onto the field.</p><p>Each of these engines are good at both forcing a grind game and winning in simplified game states. King's Sarcophagus represents a massive supply of bodies that can turn themselves into useful XYZ or Link monsters, in addition to being huge and having useful effects if your opponent gets any funny ideas, for example.</p><p>The Extra deck is a mish-mash of Rank 8s, Synchros to make using our level 4 tuners, Dogmatika Punishment targets, and a couple useful Links to fill things out. It's pretty flexible, our ED is not an especially strong focus here. Feel free to experiment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

This deck has a bunch of synergistic engines between tearlaments, horus, and kashtira, so you can flex into whichever engine you want based on your opening hand, though the strongest one is usually tearlaments. I've been using board breakers more than hand traps in the festival because Snake Eyes are really popular and 1 hand trap doesn't do anything to that strategy really. This deck is pretty consistent and has a bunch of searchers and mill, but it sometimes struggles playing into an established board.</p><p>Still, if you're looking for something to play that isn't Snake-Eyes, I think Tear is a pretty decent option.</p>"
