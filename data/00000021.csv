This deck has been thoroughly tested against all current meta decks and with the exception of maybe drytron (because it's drytron) it can comfortably break boards and deliver victory.  So the deck historically struggled with damage output due to low atk monsters so it had to rely on searching desperado or cross-domination every turn to try and get over something big, now with Destroy Phoenix Enforcer we don't have that problem anymore  For the Musketeer half of the deck you want to be going second usually your looking for a Musketeer + 1 or more Spell/Trap that's why we run so many, the aim is to use Max to generate card advantage against an established board, you can be flexible wether you need the monsters for extra deck plays or support cards for your board.  So for Destiny hero's we are trading the usual celestial + dasher for fusion destiny and instead running malicious and denier because we have the space. Ideally you are hard drawing fusion destiny then dump mali and denier, summon DPE then use mali's effect summon the copy from deck then use denier from the gy to summon itself, reset the banished mlai, link for cross crusader then summon mali back again and turn those into dread decimator and bingo you have the big bodies you've been lacking.  The rest of your extra are flex spots really fill it with what you think is best for the situation but I find break sword and redoer are great for grind games, utopia is good if you've got spare monsters after you've broken a board and accesscode and zeroboros don't really need explaining.  A great little interaction if you've set up a board with a Musketeer and DPE if you've got fiendish deal active you can just keep targeting the Musketeer for DPE's pop and it fiendish means it can't be destroyed so you aren't loosing anything.  &nbsp;  I'm still working on the deck so may update the list as the meta changes, hopefully at some stage I'll get to a point where its beating drytron too."

Drytron is probably the best deck in the meta right now, and the hit to 1 Eva doesn't even make me blink. It just really easily puts bodies on the board and is full of consistency cards, and while that does leave it a little weak to Droll, it's an amazingly powerful deck. Consistency isn't everything, but it counts for a lot, and the deck also is amazing at putting up end boards, and pretty good at breaking boards too.  So, 3 Alpha, 3 Zeta, probably never going to change. Your main combo starters are also consistency cards, that's what the deck does. You really want access to these names, and I think 3 is just essential, since seeing one of these is technically better than searching them. 2 Gamma. Gamma is good, but remember, we essentially run 11 Gamma with all of the searching, or send it with Mu-Beta Fafnir. Probably the best name, in the main combos you usually send this with Mu Beta Fafnir to make a second Fafnir, for access to Utopic Draco Future after using the 4 Fafnir materials for ritual summoning. The fact that it just makes the first Fafnir is pretty insane too, but again, we can search out copies of this card with our consistency cards, so 2 is fine. Delta is just here for the name, it comes up, and so does it being a level 1 Drytron monster, so you need to run this. The draw is good, mind you, so long as you don't see Red-Eyes Fusion.  The next pile of cards are consistency cards. Fafnir doubles up as Drytron Nova and the ritual spell, Drytron Nova gives you access to Drytron names and bodies. We run 3 Nova and 1 Fafnir even though we could run 3 Fafnir and combo off more often, because in practice it makes the deck stronger against Droll, a common side deck card currently seeing some main deck play. 1 Foolish Burial. This gives you access to a lot of cards, including Drytron names and ritual monsters, as well as Zombie World through Necroworld Banshee. Lastly, we run 3 Cyber Emergency, it's Rota for Drytron monsters, and the effect when it's activation is negated is all plus, since we can ritual summon and summon Drytron monsters from the GY. All this GY stuff does leave us a little weak to GY hate in addition to Droll, but that's Yu-Gi-Oh! If your opponent has a million interruptions you try and make Dragoon, boom, problem ""solved"".  2 Ritual Spell. I dunno, the deck recycles the 1 copy really well, so you don't strictly need a second in almost all of your combos. However, Dragoon requires a pitch so there are a lot of games where that 1 card represents an extra negate, and there are some combos that only work if you have a second copy. It is also good for the grind game to be able to search out a second copy, and I think for all those reasons 2 is correct. You shouldn't ever need 3. 1 Eva as well, helps fill your hand with Fairies, mostly for Ultimateness, but it also represents 1 negate off of a hand trap in the face of DRNM and Droplets. You typically send this with Beatrice on your opponent's turn or add it with Benten.  So, for the Ritual package - 1 Beneten, because the card is at 1, but we're effectively running 5. The full 7 was nice for giving you access to Benten to combo off with hands that appear lackluster at first glance, but it also resulted in too many bricky games where your hand was lots of access to ritual cards and no Drytrons. In addition you never wanted to see copies 2 and 3 of Extra-Foolish, so running just 1 makes sense on multiple levels. For other rituals, Idaten is important to your main combo (Dragoon + Beatrice + Draco Future + Ultimateness) and is just a good backup target to search with Preparation of Rights. It's okay to see sometimes but mostly you should think of this as something like a brick, so 1 is all we need. I've added one Natasha, because stealing monsters is good. The deck might not always put up it's big end board, or it might not go first, and Natasha helps break boards and contributes to the grind game. I run 1 Ultimateness. The ultimate plan of this deck in this form is just to rely on Ultimateness for most of our interruptions, you must run this card.  For consistency cards with our rituals I'm on 3 Preparation of Rites and 1 Extra-Foolish. The first copy of Extra-Foolish is probably better than Prep, but Prep isn't once per turn and recycles the ritual spell, which represents an extra negate with Dragoon in a lot of combo situations. These are mostly just your 5 cards to access Benten, but they help pull combos together even if you see them with Benten, provided you see some Drytron names and have access to the ritual spell.  The Dragoon package is obvious. You'll make this in your end board a fair amount, and it is necessary as a backup plan for when you get negated into oblivion.  3 Diviner of the Herald. The card is basically a level 6 Manju with extra steps. It's a combo piece, it's a starter, it's your 1 Normal summon and it is searchable. 3 of these are mandatory, if you don't need to search it up your combos get even better.  For hand traps, 2 Ash, 1 Lancea, 3 Herald of Orange Light. Ash is both incredibly generic and useful in rogue matchups, reasonably effective in most meta matchups, and specifically useful against Virtual World, so I'm maining 2 over Lancea. I still think you have to main 1 Lancea, you can just easily search it out in the deck, and it is highly effective against a lot of the meta, including several rogue decks that are still highly played, plus worst case it is a fairy for Ultimateness. Herald of Orange Light is also good, as the card can often represent a Gamma-like protection for your combo, only unlike Gamma it doesn't require your board to be empty, plus you search this easily with Eva and it is a hand trap in a lot of hands. I think you just have to play 3 of these cards.  Extra deck is virtually unchanged, but I'm back on Fucho over Assembled Nightingale. I miss the extra 2 materials, but I like the added protection, and I'd run both if I had the space. It's basically a way to make Zeus, the combo pieces necessary to get Ultimateness + Utopic Draco Future + Dragoon (or low-end 2 of those monsters) Accesscode for a thing to make with Natasha, and the Fairy package, for comboing off and a spot of disruption."

Illusion Of Chaos and Magicians Salvation add consistency to the deck that it desperately needed. Timaeus, is the all new fusion spell we all wanted and needed. being a searchable Timaeus via Illusion Of Chaos and Soul Servant. Of course, The deck had to include the REF package after it escaped the banlist! The main plays of the deck are still building your board of DMC, Eternal Soul and Dragoon if possible with added control themed cards such as Crackdown, Infinite Impermanence, Ash Blossom and so on. Any of these types of cards are fantastic additions to the deck.  And yes! i do still Run Bond Betweeen Teacher And Student with Dark Burning Magic waiting in the rear. It is still a great surprise move that can catch your opponent off guard, however I do understand if you disagree with this fact. If needed it can be replaced by other cards to aid the consistency of the deck with cards such as Up-Start Goblin or even more control themed cards. Dark Renewal as well as Dark Magic Veil are still waiting in the Side-deck to help when I need the Extra Revival of your main monsters.  Ratios is a hot topic at the moment with Dark Magician, however I maintain that having DM, DMC and Eternal Soul all at 3 is not a bad thing. Yes dropping to 2 can help but over all they are your man combo pieces which you do want to see as quick as possible, not that they are the only plays the deck an do anymore. However, I can confirm that the time you drop any of these cards to less then 3 will be the one time you will want the Extra Copies. That being said, if i was to drop ratios, I would drop Dark Magician to 2 copies, this being because if you can use one to get to dragoon you can often use the other to get the DMTDK, and he also counts to being a Dark Magician on the field and GY"

Long story short: it didn't work. For me, at least. So I tried to focus on Dark Magician, but then struck another problem. I realized after a few test runs with a pure Dark Magician test deck that this guy is <strong><em>fast</em></strong>. Very fast. And that's not fun. So how do I make my deck a little bit more fun? A quick comparison of multiple Dark Magician deck profiles led me to conclude that one of the core reasons that contribute to the deck's speed is the <em>multiple copies</em> of those support cards he's so famous for. Almost none of them have any sort of limitation whatsoever, with the exception of one particular Fusion Monster who's currently limited in the OCG. Simply put, I just cut them all to one copy each. All in all, I'm gonna stick with this deck for the foreseeable future, especially since the new wave of support cards for Dark Magician is starting to make even <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> look not so busted. <blockquote><div><span>EDIT: I just realized YGOPro tagged this deck as a Burn deck, even though I used absolutely no cards that inflict burn damage... oh well.</span></div></blockquote> &nbsp;"

So we play Dragoon 2500 def for spellcaster, Destiny Phoenix 2500 atk for warrior, Albion 2500 atk for dragon (Albaz), and Sprind 2500 atk for machine (Speedroids).  &nbsp;"

These are just my preferences, but I'd love to hear other peoples' thoughts and suggestions for improving it.  &nbsp;  Gizmek Orochi  is your bread and butter. It banishes cards for summon or to destroy an opponent's monster, is level 8 for XYZ summons, and is easily recyclable over multiple turns.  Both Danger! monsters are standard level 8s for XYZs and are pretty much free activations from the hand. they also make good discard fodder to take out a card or two from your opponent's field.  Glife is your Golden Castle searcher and can double as a normal/special summon if you need to destroy backrow if you happen to banish all your copies of Hexe Trude.  Hexe Trude pops your opponent's cards, can attack multiple monsters, boosts your other monsters' attacks, and is also level 8.  Eater of Millions is pretty obvious as a non-targeting banish and tribute immune card.  Gren Maju just smashes monsters. He can get big fast, especially if you can open Desires and Orochi.  Pot of Desires is self-explanatory and Golden Castle helps banish cards, summons Hexe or Glife, and if your opponent isn't paying attention can destroy a monster or two while taking a nice chunk of life points.  Hand traps are a personal preference, but Dimension Shifter is your king. It will shut down most every deck for a turn.  And finally Super Poly. Most decks will have at least one target you can make with it (plus you can discard one of your Danger! cards), and some will have several. This is your ultimate ""turn the tables"" card.  Extra deck is mostly Super Poly targets, BLS for untargetable and indestructible to card effects, and a general Rank 8 package plus Numeron Dragon for OTKs after clearing out your opponent's field. The Super Poly targets can be exchanged as meta dictates or some of the less likely ones can be changed out for other rank 8s or generic links.  &nbsp;  You lose pretty hard to Lancea and a couple other floodgates, and Ash Blossom can mess with your potential if you don't have a couple ways to try to bait it in your opening hand.  &nbsp;  Any feedback is welcome. Please enjoy."

I Think the super poly (and super poly targets) add a Little bit more to the deck having a possibility do deal with high attack monsters and problematic cards (the true weakness of the deck).  Ties od the brethren can be an useful tool to put more bodies on board but going first might not be a Great card.  Overall the deck is quite fun to play and can deal with a not of different strategies.  &nbsp;

Also you want cards like sunrise for easy access to miracle fusion and for extra ATK for Hero's.  Cards like Adoration allow you to destroy monster easier. Elemental hero Dark neos is a negate, and Air neos allows for clutch victories. Neos fusion at needs to be at 3 so that neos fusions are easier to get out. Also, Elemental hero Shadow mist needs to be at 3 for the best consistency. The best card that can start combo's though is either. 1. elemental hero solid soldier allows you to play into either elemental hero stratos(to get Vision Hero Farris in Hand) or Elemental Hero Shadow Mist (for dark law). Or 2. if you already have Vision Hero Farris in hand+1 Hero card, you can discard 1 hero card from you hand and special summon him, so that you can get vision hero Increase. Then you can sacrifice your Farris for increase (due to its effect.) then using increase you can special summon 1 Vision Hero Vyon which allows you to send 1 Hero monster from your deck to the graveyard (the best option being either Destiny hero Malicious for the special summon, or Shadow Mist for the Free search (search for Elemental Hero liquid soldier if not already in hand.) After that you can link summon your wonder driver and then use vyons 2nd effect (which allows you to banish 1 hero monster from your GY and then add 1 polymerization to your hand. Then use it on liquid soldier and something else to fuse for Elemental Hero Absolute Zero. Then use liquid soldiers effect to draw 2 cards then discard 1 ( is you happen to have 1 Malicious in the deck and 1 in hand then discard Malicious for this effect.

Fresh from the 2021 Ancient Battles Megatins.,"Dinosaurs with hand traps usually do a great job being the anti-meta strategy. Dinos can set up a pretty fearsome board with negates and UCT staring your opponent down. Nothing better than a good old ""Face Down, A** Up!"" effect to ruin your opponent's Synchro, Xyz, Link, and other based strategies. Your general strategy for them is to summon UCT and ""stronk"" Link monsters as quickly as possible using cards such as Double Evolution Pill. With the easily splashable ""Crossout Designator"", your deck will most likely stand a chance against those of today's meta."

Of course it survived a bullet to the chest like Teddy Roosevelt ,"New video out now. Link below  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=kfKozPMmAdE&amp;t=1s"">https://youtube.com/watch?v=kfKozPMmAdE&amp;t=1s</a>  One way to end off the competitive Yu-Gi-Oh season is to half-ass a banlist, and put more effort into making excuses; another is to assassinate the decks that attempt to keep pace against their biggest cash cows. This is where the Prank-Kids came right into the clutches of that same company. A mold of 80s/90s tropes that was hushed because it doesn't print money for Konami *(according to them at least;* However despite ""Meow-Meow-Mu"" being at limited status, it is not the end of the world. What was starting fodder is still starting fodder with extra steps; but what killed the momentum was for ""Battle Butler"" having to pay his rent without having to worry about forking over his Lamborghini. However the fancy steak dinners will still be available at the expense of Prank-Kids not getting anymore foreseeable banlist hits.  Nothing really changed for Prank-Kids since it's miraculous Remote Duel YCS win back in July. Sure this time I ran with ""Daigusto Emeral"" over ""Abyss Dweller"" for monster recovery options when ""Prank-Kids Pranks"" is around (or isn't); but usually you could play any Rank-4 you want (or even Rank-2 if you don't want Toadally Awesome). Thunder Dragon Fusion was added to make ""Battle Butler"" while recovering pieces back to your deck; ""Infinite impermanence"" + ""Effect Veiler"" also had pretty significant results; and Parallel eXceed has proven to be a decent Utility for quick Rank-4's, or Link Summoning extension. ""Knightmare Phoenix/Unicorn"" are still great generic link options to go through in case SHTF or to go into ""Accesscode Talker"" for finishers. Also included is ""Nibiru, the Primal Being"", ""Contact ""C"", ""Forbidden Droplet"", and ""Evenly Matched"""

You have easy starters, lots of consistency, and an insane grind game, and you can run lots of hand traps. The hand trap thing is what I like about this deck - it reminds me a lot of Dogmatika, where you can run a billion hand traps to slow your opponent down to the grind game, where you have an advantage. It's a little more comboish than Dogmatika, but generally just puts up a couple interruptions on the board, relying more on the searchable Trap and hand traps that a giant board. It's weird in that your ""high end"" board is just Apollo, but you search the trap and maybe DD Crow, and that's all you need.  The line-up is really simple. We're running 3 Rescue Cat because it is the best starter in the deck, and very needed now that Tenki is at 1. We play 1 Tenki to search Fraktall. Then we're on full playsets of Tris. The reason for this is simple, Fraktall is a 1 card starter, Kitt and Keras is a 2 card starter combo, and the extra Tri name in Nervall helps cheat out those link monsters. If I were to cut down on any of them it would be Nervall, because the Kitt + Keras combo is really good and means more of your hands actually go places, but I like just maxxing out on all my Tri names. There simply aren't enough Tri-Brigade monsters to skip on any of them. I also think you have to run 3 Revolt. Yes, you can search this card, but I think you need 3 for your grind game, and also you actually do want to see this card in your opening hand. Lastly, I run 1 Foolish. Foolish Burial full combo. Okay, admittedly, it's the weakest of your starters, but you have few enough starts in the archetype that I think if you're running pure Tri you should run this card.  Half the deck is interruption. That's the real appeal of this deck to me, that you can afford to run so many hand traps. DD Crow makes the cut despite being a little weak because it is searchable in your combos. Ash, Imperm, Veiler, and Belle are very generic hand traps that do just enough in most matchups, and double up as being the most common hand traps to hit with Crossout. Gamma is good offensively and defensively in this deck, and the deck can easily cycle through cards putting these on the bottom if you don't use them. It's just a good high-impact going second card that also protects a lot of your combos going first. Crossout is Crossout, if you're already running a suite of the most common hand traps I think this is obligatory, though I do contend not every deck wants to run this. (Yet. Maxx ""C"" would change that, theoretically).  The extra deck is pretty simple. 2 Barren Blossom, this is a combo piece and a consistency card in the extra deck, and I think you need 2. 2 Bearbrumm, you really need to search out the trap - this does lock you into Tris for the rest of the turn, so keep that in mind, but just use this to make Apollo at the end of your combo, you'll be fine. 3 Shuraig - you'll make 2 of these before your second turn sometimes, and so a third comes in handy for follow-ups. 3 also improves your grind game in a lot of situations where you only make 1 turn 1. 1 Silver Sheller - this lets you fire off your Trap in response to Cosmic or Twin Twisters and still get the interruption out of Shuraig, and comes up in some of your combos, but you really don't need a second. Apollo is your main boss monster going first, and we've also got Unicorn - Accesscode for going second. 1 Omega and 1 Lambda. You barely make Lambda, but Omega comes in handy since we're using Gamma defensively. Lambda does come up so I think it is worth the slot. We've got 1 Double Dragon Lords, you cheat this out for basically free in a lot of your combos and it puts up an interruption. If you're confused, you summon this card using your Tri-Brigade effects, so its link requirements aren't relevant. 1 Almiraj comes up in some low-end combo plays, I think you need this just to be able to play sometimes.  For the side deck, I'm running an artifact package. Lancea seems good right now, and also it hurts our deck pretty badly, so being able to send it with Crossout also feels good. It feels good enough in meta matchups that running the 6 with Artifact Sanctum makes a lot of sense, especially since it doubles as a Scythe, meaning you can lock out multiple types of decks going first, pretty sweet. Cosmic and Red Reboot are here for Backrow, and DRNM and Droplets are here for going second against combo boards."

However, a comment was made on that deck by a guy named ""Shiqui"". So, using the suggestion he gave, I made this new deck with some of the cards he suggested. I only play YuGiOh with my friend, and we play the game a tad bit differently. We don't exactly follow the rules of links. We still use links, but we both agree that it's just a hassle, as both of us have a lot of extra deck monsters. However, I put 2 Link monsters in this deck in the hope that it could possibly be used in actual tournaments. Best of luck on your next duel!"

Since Carrier is long banned by now, the only other ED solution I could find, was Reprodocus changing Nightingale into a Cyberse and then boost it by 2k with Cyberse Accelerator. This needs 4 materials on Nightingale, wich, however, is easier than ever with the introduction of Celeste Wagtail. If insufficient, ramming a leftover Starling into your opponents Dragoon usually does the job. The Appliancers make Starlings. That is their purpose.  The deck almost always kills if uninterrupted (then again, everything does these days…), and if not, Assembled Nightingale usually guarantees you a second shot.  It's honestly not worth memorizing all the restrictions and summoning lines to <em>not</em> lock yourself mid combo when you could just play a good deck. Unless you find this funny.  <strong>Components</strong>  Lyriluscs: Self-explanatory original core; I only run one of each of the new ones because Celeste does nothing by itself and is a hard OPT and Beryl Canary locks you out of Links. 3 Bird Call despite the hard OPT cause you always want it and 1 Sanctuary for the draw. Occasionally you can stack stuff under Nightingale to edge out a win.  Appliancer Engine: 3 Socketroll, Copybukkle and World + Terra and 1 Kappa in ED. The one Kappa enables you use Worlds recovery to get back a Socketroll, so World plus any of the other two equals 4 usable materials.  Generic LV1 Extenders: The new Slower swallow is searchable. Very nice. 2 Jester and Booster, just filler.  Other Spells: Where Arf Thou? (obviously), Instant Fusion 'cause Millennium-Eyes stops Ash and it can summon Independent, Foolish for Warbler and Canary setup as well as Wagtail, and Lightning Storm because going second. One of each of Requital and Jack cause dead cards suck.  Extra: Proxy to access Independent Nightingale in MP2, Robin and F0 if you can't OTK. Also 1 arrogant Bird, buys you a turn if needed. I'd throw in a Zeus if I was serious, but that doesn't OTK.  Side Deck: Handtraps + budget (searchable) Dark Ruler for going second. Harpie's Feather Storm for the same occasion, also shuts down all handtraps if it survives a turn."

This deck consists in using timelords to burn and stall the opponent and to make it more consistent i use only 4 timelords (sandaion, michion, raphion and zaphion), as well as time maiden to search the timelords alongside with cards like foolish burial and one for one to make maiden effects more consistent. This deck also uses a small mystic mine engine that focuses on searching and ativating mystic mine from deck like demise of the land, metaverse and terraforming, and on top of that i run spell/trap protection like solemn judgement and dark bribe to protect mystic mine and other important cards (and since i use mine, i theorically dont need to worry to much about monster effects since mystic mine will most likely be on the field anyways). Furthermore, i also run the trap timelord engine, and while its slow on their own, its pretty good on this deck because of how easy is to get mystic mine (and protect it) on the field, so basically you have empty machine that cannot be destroyed once per turn and lets either yyou discard alevel 10 monster to draw a card or if the card is the only one on your spell/trap zone you can return a timelord from gy to deck to set infinite machine from deck; then you have infinite machine that can only be activated by sending an empty machine you control, then it cannot be destroyed once per turn and lets you either . special a timelord from your hand during your main phase or return a timelord from your gy to the deck to set infinite light from your deck; and lastly you have infinite light, that can only be activated by sending an infinite machine you control to gy, then it cannot be destroyed at all and prevent your timelord from being targetted or from being returned to deck (and thats applies to your own timelords effects as well), then once per turn if you control no monster, you can special one timelord from each hand, deck and gy, ignoring their summoning conditions (if you get at this point, you most likely won the game). Other thant that we have some draw power, removals and the extradeck is either for toolbox or extravagance target."

Draco future actually has more protection than dragoon and imo has  a more impactful effect.  Not letting your opponents cards go to grave is actually very handy in the current meta. You can easily open 3 toad 1 draco future with hand traps to spare.  Desires is brick prevention as it does happen. Double summon because the deck is very fragile, double summon all but solves that. Soul rope is kind of a personal tech, where if they break my board through my negates I can potentially summon barrier statue from deck.  Main combo is :  Summon Lantern shark which summons buzzsaw shark from hand. Activate buzzsaw shark, which summons another fish from deck. Summon bahamut detach material for toad.

Exciton is situational baby zeus and very efficiently layers into zeus.|  All I can think of for now, I might update later, enjoy.  Ps. Play ghost ogre, this card has won me games.   &nbsp;"

The ratios for Frogs have never changed and while Toad is still crazy it’s not broken like it used to be. However, lightsworns give Frogs a much higher ceiling by being able to supply them will all the material they need to pop off. Currently, the biggest problem I’ve found is that the deck really struggles going second and when unlucky mills can end a turn. I know very little about Lightsworns and I would love any feedback I get about better engines or ratios for those or other ideas/theories in general. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Thank you for your time and I wish you the best. </span>  &nbsp;"

See the power a single new card gave the Deck to enable acces,"<span>Hello everyone, Dragon Soul here</span>  <span>So I've always been a pretty big Orcust fan, and Ogdoadic at first aided the Deck pretty well. They were fun to play together and also pretty decently strong, even if they worked pretty separately with a similar strategy in the end and Aleirtt combined with them well. That however has now been fixed. I found the tie that connects the two decks' strategies together, and its pretty freaking insane what the Deck does now.</span>  <span>The Deck was fixed with a single card released: <a data-name=""Reptilianne Coatl"">Reptilianne Coatl</a>. </span>  <span>It's currently in the OCG as of the writing of this however I don't expect it to stay there for much longer. It's a Level 4 DARK Reptile Tuner that freely Summons itself from the hand if you control a DARK Reptile. Simple, but effective. The reason this card is so good however is it allows Ogdoadic an easy way to Synchro Summon thanks to <a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a> and <a data-name=""Ogdoadic Water Lily"">Ogdoadic Water Lily</a> getting access to it easily. But...what do you Synchro Summon then? What 1 Synchro could you possibly make to tie these two decks much better together. </span>  <span>One of the most overpowered Level 8 Synchros to ever exist, <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a>.</span>  <span>On Synchro Summon, you mill 5 cards, and get to add a LIGHT or DARK monster amongst them to your hand. FIVE cards. This means that although sure, its not guaranteed you'll hit an <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a><a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">, it's pretty likely you'll hit something useful off it. It enables you to set up your Orcust plays and dump Ogdoadics while you're at it, plus add extenders to hand. That's already pretty solid, but that's not all it does. By banishing a LIGHT and DARK monster from your Graveyard, it can revive itself, so it gives you an extra body. Even though it banishes itself when it leaves the field, <strong>it doesn't matter.</strong></a></span>  <span>Since it is a Level 8 you can actually overlay it with either a <a data-name=""World Wand"">World Wand</a> or an Ogdoadic to Xyz Summon <a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu</a> normally, meaning it will go to the grave now. On top of that, even if it is banished, <a data-name=""Aliertt"">Aleirtt</a> can return it to your Graveyard and get back a LIGHT Ogdoadic you banished for more banish fodder to revive it again. This is where it gets kind of hectic, because now, Chaos Ruler is able to be used every single turn for a free body and board presence, meaning the Deck has higher recovery.</span>  <span>On the note of recovery though, this Deck's recovery outclasses literally every Deck in the game. Even Eldlich cannot recover and grind to the same level as this Deck. (I tested against Eldlich incase you were wondering. Even if they got me into a grind game I just kept playing and playing and playing and eventually I overwhelmed them.) It does take a bit to set up sure but that's fine honestly. Especially since each piece to the Deck only needs 1 card in the opening hand to get going most of the time. </span>  <span>Another strength is actually how both Decks cover each others weaknesses. So what are those weaknesses then? For Orcust, its 3 main things. One of them is Lancea, another is any form of Extra Deck lock (so for example you get Scythed), and finally, handtraps. Let's go through how Ogdoadic manages to override all 3 of these problems for the Deck.</span>  <span>1. Lancea. As anybody knows, if Orcust cannot banish, they just do not work. And Lancea proves this perfectly, it seals our Orcusts away almost entirely, as well as Chaos Ruler's revival effect. But Ogdoadic in contrast, will punish your opponent for activating it as quickly as they can. <a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu</a> can revive itself for free but banishes itself when it leaves the field, and whatever <a data-name=""Keurse"">Keurse</a> revives is also banished when it leaves the field. But due to Lancea...they won't get banished. Meaning if you Lancea the Deck, you are just allowing them to keep their Ogdoadic resources for next turn without needing to use Aliertt to get them back or needing to dump any more, plus the next turn will result in MASSIVE follow up. Plus, the Ogdoadics will give you that turn with their own board presence. Lancea still hurts for sure, but being able to flip it against them in some ways is not bad to see.</span>  <span>2. Extra Deck locks. Dragon Buster, Scythe, we all know that. And Orcust can't play without their Extra Deck, its their lifeline. No <a data-name=""Galatea"">Galatea</a>, no Dingirsu, not even Chaos Ruler, definitely it will hurt no matter what you do. But Ogdoadic again finds a way to counter and minimize the threat of it. Simply put it, Ogdoadic is <strong>not</strong> a Deck that actually needs its Extra Deck. It's more reliant on its Main Deck, and instead, you turn your Graveyard into your ""Extra Deck"", with bosses like <a data-name=""Amunessia"">Amunessia</a>, Aron and <a data-name=""Ogdoabyss"">Ogdoabyss</a>. They can take care of pretty annoying stuff, not to mention Ogdoabyss can remove a Buster Lock often times (meaning your Extra Deck is free and you can go off).</span>  <span>3. Handtraps. Orcust eats them, and can get stuck without the right extenders. Normal Girsu, get Impermed, your turn might as well be over if you don't have very specific extension. And Ogdoadic yet again counters this well. Ogdoadic can just force out handtraps and isn't reliant on a Normal Summon. So it can clear the way for your Orcusts to go through, or punish your opponent for waiting for your Orcusts. The Deck uses Spells and hand monster effects to get their cards in grave, so handtraps hitting those leave room for Normal Summon options, not to mention you still paid cost so tossing Nunu or anything useful in grave off Snake Rain (like Knightmare) gives you advantage despite the attempted handtrap. And since they play from the grave, their effects are very difficult to hit without specific handtraps like Ghost Belle or Skull Meister. Now why did I say they ""punish"" your opponent for handtrapping the Orcusts? Well you tend to have Amunessia out in your boards, and if your opponent has been waiting for that Knightmare in Grave to be activated so they can Ash it, they're not going to like what happens after. Ashing or Meistering the Knightmare will let Amunessia revive a LIGHT or DARK Reptile from your grave (only DARK if you do get locked under Orcust lock, but if Knightmare was the first then that will be negated there), and you can revive Aliertt to return Knightmare to grave for next turn. Or if you already used Aliertt, use the Summoned monster and another Level 8 (Chaos Ruler?) for Dingirsu, attach Knightmare for next turn, and suddenly that handtrap isn't looking so good.</span>  <span>So what about Ogdoadic's weaknesses? Can Orcust fix them? Well there's some issues with Ogdoadic definitely that Orcust has ways to mitigate.</span>  <span>1. End Boards. Ogdoadic is...not incredibly impressive with its end boards. King and Queen and cool to see but that's not very effective on its own. They can board brake with Ogdoabyss well but turn 1 plays are kind of weird. On 1 hand you don't give your opponent back free advantage from Aliertt and Keurse, but on the other, you don't do anything really. Orcust fixes this to allow them to make actual end boards turn 1 that can sit alongside a Queen or King sometimes, and then use the strong follow up plays to grind the game out or just OTK from there, depending on the matchup and how they do trying to break your board. You can often end on a triple material Dingirsu, an <a data-name=""I:P"">I:P</a>, a Queen or King (sometimes both), <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a>, and sometimes <a data-name=""Orcust Cresendo"">Orcust Cresendo</a> and <a data-name=""Galatea"">Galatea</a>. I say sometimes since it all depends on your hand and if you got enough extension to make those plays.</span>  <span>2. Board Presence. The Deck mounts great comebacks...if you can attain the board presence to make those happen. Water Lily is a great card with Ogdoabyss but its not going to always be enough, and sometimes you don't have it in hand and need to get <a data-name=""Nauya"">Nauya</a> to fetch it for you. But Girsu single handedly fixes that issue turn 1 anyway, and later on thanks to Babel you can put more bodies out from Cymbal Skeleton on your opponent's turn to use for both disruption (Dingirsu send) and Tribute fodder for the Ogdoadics on your next turn. The board presence also means Amunessia is easier to Summon, don't forget she is DARK so you can still have her Special Summon herself (in a Graveyard Link Summon kind of thing, that's how I like to think of it) under your Orcust lockdown effects. Also Chaos Ruler fixes the issue too since it revives itself for free every single turn, even if you are locked by Orcust effects.</span>  <span>It's fun, crazy, works together well, and is the all around most insane graveyard deck you'll ever find. Well...until you get Abyss Dwellered and it comes back to bite you lol. (The Deck dies so hard if your opponent manages to dweller you.) But yeah, regardless, that's the thoughts on the Deck and how it all works, list is down below. Seriously, try it out and experiment with the combos, you won't regret it. Have fun!</span>"

After being late for days due to college, I finally bring to you the <strong>Triple Structure Deck Challenge</strong> for the <strong>Shaddoll Showdown Structure Deck</strong>!</p> <p>Rules are still the same: A 40-card deck made using at least 30+ cards from the Structure Deck. The Extra Deck is free to edit.</p> <p><strong><span>Archetype Breakdown</span></strong></p> <p><strong>Shaddolls</strong> are, at least before this Structure Deck release, an archetype filled with DARK Spellcaster-Type Flip Monsters, having the peculiarity that they also have an additional effect if they are sent to the GY by a card effect; with the only downside that you must choose which effect to use for that card for the rest of the turn. While some of them, including the new support, has some great Flip effects, you most of the time will be using the GY effects due to their easiness to mill within this archetype, and those effects are also good. Their Extra Deck, which is mostly famous and infamous, consists of monsters that cover all Attributes in the game, except DIVINE. All share the same summoning condition of requiring a Shaddoll monster and 1 monster that shares the same attribute as the Fusion monster. This aspect has made Shaddolls since is dayview as very splashable archetype that would saw a lot of variants that would exploit their GY setups; with <strong>Lightsworns</strong>, <strong>Invoked</strong> and even <strong>Dinosaurs</strong> as examples.</p> <p>The new support coming from the Structure Deck alongside some new outside support granted it Shaddoll monsters of different Attributes in the Main Deck, making the idea of a pure-ish Shaddoll Deck possible while still being able to have access to their Attribute-specific Fusion monsters. Speaking of which, they also got a new generic Fusion monster giving that they now have more monsters with different Attributes in the Main Deck, and some backrow support for both the Fusion and Flip playstyle.</p> <p>The analysis of the Deck will start with the Shaddoll cards, including the outside support. And then I'll talk about the other cards used in. Due to the nature of the Shaddoll monsters, I'll breakdown their effects in this way: For Main Deck monsters I'll separate the Flip effect and GY effect, while with the Fusion monsters I'll list their effect on Summon (if any), their effect on the field and their GY effect. With that said, let's begin.</p> <p><span><strong>Shaddoll monsters from the Main Deck</strong></span> <strong>*Helshaddoll Hollow:</strong> This big boi is the FIRE Attribute monster (they only got one for each Attribute other than DARK, so I have to work with it) of the Archetype and is also the biggest monster from the Main Deck in terms of stat line, being a Level 9 FIRE Fiend with 2900 ATK/DEF. Flip Effect: Target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; send 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster with the same Attribute from the Extra Deck to the GY, and if you do, banish the targeted monster. If you haven't played or know about <strong>Shaddolls</strong> you might think this effect's cost is too much, but keep in mind that all Shaddoll Fusion monsters have a GY effect, can be used as material for Fusions with certain cards and the most popular Attributes in the game, those being EARTH, LIGHT and DARK, can be covered with <strong>Shekhinaga</strong>, <strong>Construct</strong>, <strong>Winda</strong> or their new Fusion monster. GY Effect: You can send cards from the top of your Deck to the GY equal to the number of different and original Attributes among the monsters on the field. If used normally it can lead to a 2-3 card mill, which it could be good if you're lucky. Even more, some of the new support gives the Deck more interacions with the GY so its good. Only run 1 though, it can be bricky due to his high Level.</p> <p><strong>*Shaddoll Beast</strong>: Flip effect: You can draw 2 cards, then discard 1. GY effect: You can draw 1 card. The only annoying thing about <strong>Beast</strong> is the fact that it is Level 5, other than that, he's pluses in any way you used him. Some new cards can recycle him a lot, and his Level can make him bricky, so running 1 is fine. 2 if you seriously need more draw power.</p> <p><strong>**Shaddoll Dragon</strong>: Flip effect: You can target 1 card your opponent controls; return it to the hand. GY effect: You can target 1 Spell/Trap on the field and destroy it. You might have seen this one in <strong>Lightsworn</strong> builds, whether they actually played Shaddolls or not, due to his backrow popping effect. While his bounce effect is also good but rarely used, he's still pretty good to use.</p> <p><strong>*Shaddoll Squamata</strong>: Flip effect: You can target 1 monster on the field and destroy it. GY effect: You can send 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card from the Deck to the GY, except another copy of itself. His Flip effect can catch someone by suprise and his GY effect can be used on any Shaddoll card, including the backrow (you'll later understand why). You could also run 2, but this build is quite tight already.</p> <p><strong>*Naelshaddoll Ariel</strong>: This is the WATER representative, with a heavy emphasis on banished cards. Flip effect: You can target 1 of your banished ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monsters and Special Summon it in face-down or face-up Defense Position. GY effect: You can target up to 3 cards in either GYs and banish them. She, alognside two more monsters that came in this Structure Deck, gives <strong>Shaddoll</strong> a way to swarm the field and placing them face-down if you want to use their Flip effects.</p> <p><strong>***Reeshaddoll Wendi</strong>: She is the WIND representative, focusing with the Deck. One of the reasons she's played at 3. Flip effect: You can Special Summon 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster from the Deck in face-up or face-down Defense Position, except another copy of herself. GY effect: You can Special Summon 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster from the Deck in face-down Defense Position, except another copy of herself. Now, choose: You want to Special Summon from the Deck or Special Summon from the Deck? I think you might want to Special Summon from the Deck.</p> <p><strong>***Shaddoll Hedgehog</strong>: Another <strong>Shaddoll</strong> monster that is quite famous for how good of a searcher he is for his archetype. Flip effect: You can add 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Spell/Trap from the Deck to the hand. GY effect: You can add 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster from the Deck to the hand, except another copy of itself. Run it at 3 as well, he's a really good searcher.</p> <p><strong>**Qadshaddoll Keios</strong>: The 3rd monster on the Special Summon Triad of new support, focusing on the hand; while also being the LIGHT representative. Flip effect: You can Special Summon 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster from the hand in face-up or face-down Defense Position. GY effect: You can send 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster from the hand to the GY, if you do, until the rest of the turn all monsters you control gain 100 ATK/DEF times the original Level of the sent monster. He can help if your starting hand is filled with Shaddoll monsters you want to use their Flip effects, while being LIGHT Attribute gives him access to <strong>Construct</strong>. The attack boost can also be helpful if you need an extra push in the damage aspect.</p> <p><strong>**Shaddoll Falco</strong>: Flip effect: You can target 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster in your GY except another copy of itself and Special Summon it in face-down Defense Position. GY effect: You can Special Summon this card in face-down Defense Position. He has some good interactions with the GY and with <strong>Ariel</strong>, <strong>Wendi</strong> and <strong>Keios</strong> they can give the Deck a lot of swarming potential. Also, he can be used as a Fusion material in your turn, bring himself back with his effect and then use the Flip effect later.</p> <span><strong>Backrow</strong></span> <p><strong>**Shaddoll Fusion, **El Shaddoll Fusion, *Nephe Shaddoll Fusion</strong>: This 3 cards are Fusion Spells for the <strong>Shaddoll</strong> archetype. <strong>Shaddoll Fusion</strong> allows the Fusion of a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Fusion monster using monsters from the hand or field as materials. However, if your opponent has a monster Special Summoned from the Extra Deck, you can use monsters from the Deck as well. <strong>El Shaddoll Fusion</strong> can also Fusion Summon a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Fusion monster using materials from the hand or field as material; with the added fact that it is a Quick-Play Spell. The last one, <strong>Nephe Shaddoll Fusion</strong> is an Equip Spell that can only be used on a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster and by declaring 1 Atrribute. The equipped monster is treated as having that Attribute and it can Fusion Summon 1 ""Shaddoll"" Fusion monster using materials from the hand or field, including the equipped monster. All of them should be played but the issue has always being the ratios. Some will favor playing more copies of El Shaddoll Fusion than Shaddoll Fusion and vice-versa; while Nephe fell a bit since now Shaddoll has monsters with different Attributes. I decided to play 2-2-1, since each one of them have their uses and <strong>Nephe</strong> can help out if you didn't open with the needed Attributes.</p> <p><strong>***Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</strong>: This is their new Trap Card, which has 2 effects. The first one targets 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster in your GY and Special Summon it in face-up or face-down Defense Position. The other effect can be activated from the GY: you can banish it alongside 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card from the GY to either change 1 face-down monster you control to face-up Defense Position or change 1 face-up monster you control to face-down Defense Position. Is a realy good revival card, can make the Flip effects easier to access if the monster you want to activate happens to be set that same turn or to activate the effect of the monster you just revived.</p> <p><strong>**Shaddoll Core</strong>: This is a Continuous Trap that can Special Summon itself as a Level 9 DARK Spellcaster with 1450 ATK/1950 DEF. If it was Summoned this way, it can be treated as any Attribute for the Fusion Summon of a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Fusion monster. Also, if this card is sent to the GY by a card effect you can target 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Spell/Trap in your GY except itself and add it to your hand. Before the new monsters, this was the main access to other Attributes if you played a pure build, while his recycling effect is helpful to bring back the Fusion Spells. Keep in mind that it can recycle cards even when used as a Fusion material.</p> <p><strong>**Shaddoll Schism</strong>: This is new outside support, being a Continuous Trap. During the Main Phase only, you can Fusion Summon 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Fusion monster by banishing its materials from the field or GY, and then you can send to the GY 1 monster your opponent controls that shares the Attribute of the Summoned monster, this is without targeting. However, the Summoned monster cannot attack directly. This Trap Card grants you a way to still use your <strong>Shaddoll</strong> monsters from the GY besides <strong>Falco</strong> and <strong>Incarnation</strong>, and even<strong> Ariel</strong> can bring back one of them if you need so. Is pretty good, but since requires setup to use, I don't recommend maxing it. 2 has worked fine with me.</p> <strong><span>Shaddoll monsters in the Extra Deck</span></strong> <p><strong>**El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</strong>: Finally starting with the Extra Deck, we'll start with the EARTH Fusion. Is a Level 10 EARTH Machine with 2600 ATK/3000 DEF that requires a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster + 1 EARTH monster. On the field: When a Special Summoned monster activates their effect but you have a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card in the hand, as a Quick Effect, you can negate the activation, destroy that monster and then send 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card from the hand to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY: You can target 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Spell/Trap in your GY and add it to the hand. As a note, all except the new Fusion monster share the last effect. For its summon, I used <strong>Mathematician</strong> due to how helpful he is for mill decks while also being an EARTH monster, and if you ask: yes, they also have a new EARTH representative called <strong>Nehshaddoll Genius</strong>, but the decklist was a bit to tight to add it. Run 1 of it if you like so. Shekhinaga is one of your largest walls and can net some effect negation. Run either 1 or 2.</p> <p><strong>**El Shaddoll Construct</strong>: The main boss monster of the Deck, while also being the most splashable of them alongside Winda since it is the LIGHT Fusion monster, needing 1 Shaddoll monster + 1 LIGHT monster. On Summon: You can send 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card from the Deck to the GY. On the field: At the start of the Damage Step, if this card battles an Special Summoned monster: Destroy that monster. Also has the recycle effect. This monster has seen its time on the Limited list just for how good it is in general. There are, even to this day, many LIGHT monsters that could benefit from being used as a material giving that <strong>Shaddoll Fusion</strong> can use materials from the Deck if the conditions are met. It also makes her, and pretty much every Attribute-exclusive Fusion monster to be a good target for <strong>Super Polymerization</strong> plays.</p> <p><strong>*El Shaddoll Grysta</strong>: This one is the FIRE Fusion monster, which has an effect kind of similar to <strong>Shekhinaga</strong>. It requires 1 Shaddoll monster + 1 FIRE monster. On the field: When your opponent would Special Summon a monster but you have a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card in the hand, as a Quick Effect, you can negate the Summon, destroy that monster and then send 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card from the hand to the GY. It also has the recycle effect. This one is a bit less played, since their are some conditions in which you can and cannot activate his negation due to rulings. That doesn't mean it isn't good to have it around if needed.</p> <p><strong>**El Shaddoll Apkallone</strong>: This is their new Fusion monster, which requires any 2 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monsters with different Attributes. On Summon: If this card is Special Summoned (not just by Fusion): You can target 1 face-up card on the field and negate its effects while it remains there. On the field: Cannot be destroyed by battle. If it is sent to the GY: You can add 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card from the Deck or GY to the hand, then discard 1 card. Its on Summon effect can be used many times since its not limited to only Fusion, providing the lockdown of 1 face-up card on the field; which is great against floodgates or continuous effects. Its GY effect differs from the rest, since it works with any card. The discard downside can be used in your favor to trigger the effect of the ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monsters.</p> <p><strong>**El Shaddoll Winda</strong>: Lastly, we have the DARK representative requiring 1 Shaddoll monster + 1 DARK monster. She alongside <strong>Construct</strong> and <strong>Apkallone</strong> are their most accesible Fusion monsters while also being very splashable in <strong>Winda</strong> and <strong>Construct's</strong> case. On the field: Both players can only Special Summon monsters once per turn. It also has the recycling effect. Due to her low level (being 5), it can be Summoned with Instant Fusion. That being said, is one of the most hated floodgates due to how easy is to summon and how much it can slow the pace of a duel.</p> <p><strong>*Shaddoll Construct</strong>: Their only Link monster, being a Link-2 monster with 1200 ATK pointing Left and Right. During the Main Phase, you can Fusion Summon 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Fusion monster using monsters from the hand or field as materials. If this card is in the GY, you can send 1 ""Shaddoll"" card from the hand or face-up in the field to the GY to Special Summon this card. It can also work as a constant Fusion enabler, giving that it can use itself as material, recycle itself and being a LIGHT monster gives it access to <strong>Construct</strong> or <strong>Apkallone</strong>. Run 1 if you like. The Extra Deck is pretty tight though.</p> <p>Now, let's talk about the non-Shaddoll cards: <strong>*Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning</strong>: I think this card doesn't require introduction since how much of a powerhouse he still is today, after all these years. Since this deck runs a fair share of LIGHT monsters, any Chaos monster with reliable effects can be pretty much added here. BLS is pretty much the best option, but if you need more than just on-target banishing or double attacking; <strong>Chaos Dragon Levianeer</strong>, <strong>The Chaos Creator</strong> and <strong>Chaos Grepher</strong> are also pretty solid.</p> <p><strong>*Timaeus the Dragon of Destiny</strong>: This one is the odd pick, coming way into the future with the new Dark Magician support from the Battle of Chaos set that was announced recently. Is a Level 8 LIGHT Dragon that can be Special Summoned from the hand by sending 1 Spellcaster monster OR 1 Spell/Trap that lists ""<strong>Dark Magician</strong>"" in its text from the hand or field to the GY. While it might look confusing at first, the Spellcaster monster doesn't need to list ""<strong>Dark Magician</strong>"", and most of the Shaddoll monsters are Spellcasters; so it can become a large body while also triggering the sent Shaddoll monster. On the field, it can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster using materials from the hand or field as materials, including at least 1 Spellcaster monster. It can grant you more Fusion Summons while its LIGHT Attribute can help to bring <strong>Construct</strong> faster. I only put 1 for test purposes, and I can safely say its pretty good and running 2 might not be a bad idea.</p> <p><strong>*Electromagnetic Turtle</strong>: Its a Level 4 LIGHT Machine that during your opponent's Battle Phase can banish itself to end it. This effect is a once per Duel effect, but is often milled or used for a Fusion Summon due to its Attribute and good defensive effect.</p> <p><strong>***Mathematician</strong>: Is a Level 3 EARTH Spellcaster monster that when it is Normal Summoned you can send 1 Level 4 or lower monster from the Deck to the GY. When this monster is destroyed by battle and sent to the GY: you can draw 1 card. Its mill effect is its most used effect, helping you trigger the <strong>Shaddoll</strong>'s GY effects. The draw effect is a nice plus too.</p> <p><strong>*Magicalized Fusion</strong>: This one is an interesting tech. Is a Spell card that allows the Fusion Summon of a Spellcaster Fusion monster by banishing its materials from the field or GY, pretty much how Dragon's Mirror works. Since they are many Spellcasters in the Deck, I though adding 1 copy of it and 1 <strong>Quintet Magician</strong> as a Plan B.</p> <p><strong>**Pot of Avarice</strong>: This Deck can consume a lot of resources due to how much milling and searching can do. Pot of Avarice can help to recycle your used monsters and giving you 2 cards.</p> <p><strong>***Super Polymerization</strong>: Is a Quick-Play Spell that requires to discard 1 card to activate. You can then Fusion Summon 1 Fusion monster by using materials from both fields. Also, neither player can activate cards or effects in response to it. Since the <strong>Shaddoll</strong> Fusions are kind of generic in terms of their materials, <strong>Super Poly</strong> can easily remove from your opponent's field a problematic monster and give you a Fusion, without your opponent being able to stop it.</p> <p><strong>*Quintet Magician</strong>: Is a big Level 12 DARK Spellcaster with 4500 ATK/DEF and requires 5 Spellcaster monsters to be Fusion Summoned. If those 5 Spellcaster monsters had different names between each other, on its Fusion Summon, you can destroy all cards your opponent controls. While on the field, it cannot be destroyed by card effects, can't be used as a Fusion Material and it cannot be Tributed. Being one of the few monsters in the game that cannot be <strong>Kaiju</strong>'d, his nuke effect and big statline paired with tolerable protection makes him an impressive optional boss monster.</p> <p><strong>*Mysterion the Dragon Crown</strong>: This one is also a tech choice, giving that I'm using <strong>Timaeus</strong>. Is a Level 8 LIGHT Spellcaster with 3000 ATK/1500 DEF that requires a Spellcaster monster and a Dragon monster. It cannot be used as Fusion material and loses 100 ATK for each of your banished cards. If a monster uses its own effect to Special Summon itself or any monster(s) with its same original Type, you can target 1 of those monsters: banish it and banish all monsters on the field with the same original Type. Decks that focus on only one Type of monster (like Spellcasters, Dragons, Cyberse, Rocks, Beast-Warriors, etc.) are pretty common both casually and in the Meta and monsters that can Special Summon more of them are pretty common as well, even <strong>Shaddolls</strong> have a few share of them. <strong>Mysterion</strong> can provide an easy wipe of said monsters, although watch out to now blow yourself up the process.</p> <p><strong>*Accesscode Talker</strong>: Another card that doesn't need that much introduction for how heavily it is played online. Emphasis on online since +$100 dollars is a very high price to most players. Still, it currently is one of the best finishers. If you want a budget option, <strong>Borrelsword Dragon</strong> is always there.</p> <p><strong>*Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</strong>: Is a Link-3 LIGHT Spellcaster with 1850 ATK and points all Bottom (Bottom-Left, Bottom &amp; Bottom-Right). It requires 2 or more monsters, including at least 1 Spellcaster monster. On its Link Summon, you can place 1 Spell Counter on it for each Spell Card in your GY. During the Main Phase, as a Quick Effect, you can remove 3 Spell Counters from your field to Special Summon 1 Spellcaster monster from the hand or GY in Defense Position to a zone it points to. Is mostly used as an extender for more Fusion plays and for link climbing into <strong>Accescode/Borrelsword</strong>.</p> <p><strong>*Subterror Behemoth Fiendess</strong>: Even though it was design for <strong>Subterrors</strong>, it is the best Link monster to play with <strong>Shaddolls</strong>. Is a Link-2 EARTH Wyrm with 2000 ATK, points Bottom-Left and Bottom-Right and requires any 2 Flip monsters. It can send 1 Flip monster from the Deck to the GY to Special Summon 1 monster from your hand in face-down Defense Position. Once per turn, if one of the monsters this card points to is flipped face-up, you can add 1 Flip monster from the Deck or GY to the hand. Since <strong>Reincarnation</strong> can flip your Shaddoll monsters and <strong>Schism</strong> can use materials from the GY for Fusion Summons, this is an overall nice card to have at disposition.</p> <p>And that's it for this Deck.</p> <p>I'll have to make an announcement: Since school started again a month ago, I'll upload decks probably more late than ever. At least except 2 or even 3 decklist per month, but not on a consistent schedule. Since tomorrow is the beginning of October, although the website posts this as the next day idk, the next decklist will focus on the Zombie-themed Structure Decks that had been released in Yu-Gi-Oh!, with those being the <strong>Zombie Madness</strong>, <strong>Zombie World</strong> and <strong>Zombie Hoard Structure Decks</strong>; in which I'll implement a new rule for the remaining Structure Decks for this series.</p> <p>Oh, btw, I'll post the <strong>Starter Deck: Yugi</strong> list later, just as a throwaway.</p>"

For the extra support I went with direct <strong>Dark Magician</strong> support, using two of his new support cards and two already exisiting ones:  <strong>***Timaeus the Dragon of Destiny</strong> can easily be summoned since a ot of the normal monsters are Spellcasters and the Extra Deck is packed with generic Fusion Monsters for <strong>Dark Magician</strong> and some of the Normal Monsters. Your usually main goal is to summon <strong>Dark Magician the Dragon Knight</strong> to protect <strong>Eternal Soul</strong>.  <strong>**Magician's Salvation</strong> is their new Field Spell, setting a <strong>Eternal Soul</strong> directly from the Deck upon activation. It has a second effect regarding <strong>Dark Magician</strong> and <strong>Dark Magician Girl</strong>, but is mainly used for the first effect here.  <strong>**Magicians' Souls</strong> and <strong>***Eternal Soul</strong> are added to turbo out Dark Magician more faster on the field."

I play a heavy handtrap lineup but you can cut the <a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a> for <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a> , <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> or <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a> if you have it.  If you miss <a data-name=""Gravity Controller"">Gravity Controller</a> consider cutting one <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>. You can play one Dogmatika Maximus in the main but then consider playing one <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</a> in the extra aswell.  In my opinion its one of the best decks this format because nothing got hit on the banlist.  Tell me what you think and have fun with it!"

You have access to a few key specific floodgates, as well as powerful tools that help break boards and set up interrup","Sword Soul deck. The draw of the deck is the powerful Synchros it can make, in particularly Cheng Ying's ability to be 2ish interruptions provided you can proc him. So why Tenyis? A few reasons. Firstly, I'm partial to more tribal decks, and having a general Wyrm engine appeals to me. Secondly, I suspect it increases consistency, and it certainly increases explosiveness, playing more like the combo decks I am used to. Lastly, running this package enablers me to play more floodgates in the Extra Deck. Lastly, being far less Normal Summon reliant means the deck plays Sphere Mode quite well. This version of the deck is very good at cracking boards, even just using engine cards and the maindeck staples. The side deck particularly emphasizes this - we'd prefer to go first, but if you make us go second you might actually have a worse time in some circumstances. Let's go over the list.  Long Yuan is one of the most important Sword Souls monsters, since it by itself makes Baroness De Fleur or more importantly Cheng Ying. It also doesn't conflict with Sphere Mode. Mo Ye is powerful, getting to draw a card is great and our main extender out of the Extra Deck is a Synchro 8 that counts as an interruption, very beautiful. I think you have to run 3 of both of these. Tai A is less important, but you want to play 2 so that you're less likely to banish it with Desires, since it is a common search off of the Rota, and leads to Synchro 8 Spam. While these are normal summons, neither have to be normal summoned, and you will start your plays sometimes by resurrecting them with the Monster Reborn of the archetype, or the Shaman of the Tenyi, and yes, this is actually a lot more realistic than you might think. We play a lot of Tenyi monsters and any 2 of them into Shaman is totally believable, and in fact you'll often get some other value off of Tenyi plays in the process. The Rota is obligatory, it's the Rota, the field spell is this one card you can search to spam out 8s and is just good enough as an engine card to run 1 of it IMO. I'd consider cutting it, but the Synchro 8 Spam is a neat option that merits use in some matchups anyways, because of Dragite, and because of having a larger full combo.  For Tenyi monsters, we run 2 of the most important Tenyi monsters, Vishuda. You could honestly bump this up to 3 and be happy, it is the most valuable of the Tenyi cards. Like Alpha, this can bounce a monster, including bouncing a Kaiju back into your own hand. You can break some pretty mighty boards with this deck, because including this card you're running as many as 13 board breaking cards vs hefy boards, meaning when you know (or smell) that you're going second you come in with a great chance to actually bust some boards before making Wyrm plays. It's also an engine card. Adhara gives you access to Level 9 Synchro plays and refills your hand for Long Yuan, helping you say search it or the trap, for making those Level 9s is particularly noteworthy. Ashuna + any other Tenyi is full combo. Okay, not quite, but it's a good enough starter to combos that you want to see Ashuna. And Vessel just increases your chances of seeing the right Tenyi's, the card is either dead or a must negate generally speaking. I think it's worth it to run, because you have so many Tenyi cards, and this makes your big Tenyi combo plays way more common.  1 Gold Sarc. Hate the card, but we're on 3 Adhara, and it has other utility. In fact this and Called By The Grave are both run in this list primarily to proc Cheng Ying, hilariously enough, but obviously Called might make the cut anyways.  3 Pot of Desires. Banishes barely matter to this deck, you'll sometimes gimp yourself but more often than not it is free consistency, and you can afford to run the numbers to almost never feel this. I still struggle a little bit to understand why Pot feels better here than in some other homes, but it does, though that perception could simply be my own luck changing. The more I test the more I see, in this archetype you want the cards more than to see 1 specific engine card, so Prosperity is probably worse.  Forbidden Droplet is live often enough going first, and necessary often enough going second, and actually makes the cut on the merit of making us lose going second significantly less. Tenyi monsters actually like being in the GY sometimes, so even if you pitch 3 cards a lot of the time you'll still have solid plays to make after that to break boards. Tactics, in turn, is better going first, being either a consistency card or a way to make hand traps worse. It makes the main deck because going second against Dragoon, it is just GG for the Dragoon player, and Dragoon will be important to handle until it is banned. Solemn Strike is an amazing going first card that stays in whenever we are going first. However, like the rest of this package is is good going second as well, an actual hard negate at Spell Speed 3 that also negates summons is very good.  So, for the extra deck. 2 Chi Xiao, because this is like the archetype's Needlefibre, and it is also on of your main bosses and your main way to trigger Cheng Ying at the right time. You need 2 for your grind game. 1 Cheng Ying, you must also run this, this card is the reason to play the deck. A little bit tricky to activate its effect and time it for the right disruption, but very powerful on the face of it. 1 Draco Bersker. You're often locked into Wyrm monsters because of Ashuna, and this gives you the very important second rank 8 to make in those situations, and as a bonus it it good going first or second and trigger's Cheng Ying. 1 Yazi. You can make this with level manipulation, but you also make this with Long Yuan and a Adhara. It pops a card before summoning out Tai A and is fuel for Tai A, and is good going second, but I rarely actually make it. You need a level 7 for some boards (to not waste resources) and this is the only Wyrm, but it is pretty good in the deck. 2 Baxia - shuffling cards into the deck is good going second, even if it does target. You make this into Chaofeng in some of your combos. giving you an amazing Floodgate against Light attribute based decks. With the help of level modulation, you can occasionally make Yazi into Chaofeng locking decks out of Dark monsters, similarly if not more broken. Dragite is a generic backrow negate, but you turn him on with Mo Ye naturally and it contributes to the ability to actually put up real negates. Baroness De Fleur is a way to break boards that is also one omni-negate and a monster Reborn. I don't know if this will be legal at the same time as Sword Soul, at least right away, but for now I'm being an optimist and hoping we get it. I'm on 1 Shenshen. Not only is this a reasonably floodgate against a lot of decks, but you make it easily throughout your combos, and you make it off of Chi Xiao and then revive it in some Tenyi combos, so it isn't going without support. It seems good to have as an option. Lastly we run 1 Omega, because we need generic and powerful Synchro 8s and yeah, Omega still makes the cut. I find myself never making this, but it is strictly better than any of the alternatives. Lastly we have some Tenyi monsters, these make the Tenyi engine go Brr, and Shaman makes Sphere Mode kind of a breeze.  So the side deck. The deck seems powerful enough at putting up interruptions and pressure going first that I wanted to lean on a side deck built around breaking boards. The idea is that if we can pretty consistently break even the beefiest of boards we can decide to go second, maybe shake up somebody's siding plan, but also I don't think the deck needs a lot more going first. You're usually siding out some number of the pots, as well as TTT (which stays in over Sphere Mode in matchups that swing down to Dragoon). So here are the numbers. 3 Sphere Mode. Yes this eats up your normal summons, but this isn't as relevant as you might think. It also immediately solves a lot of problem boards, and again helps enable us to eat even really beefy boards. Because it can't be targeted you can't return this to your hand with Vishuda, but you can with Alpha, meaning this + Alpha if they have a 6 monster board, but in practice if they do they have an interruption to prevent this anyways, so it isn't as relevant as it is with the Kaijus. Speaking of 2 Gadarla, 2 Alpha. Gadarla tributes over Wind Barrier Statue and is level 8, and you can bounce it with Alpha or Vishuda to get an extra tribute. Did I mention this deck was good at breaking boards? Alpha is Alpha, it is the new Pankratops, and is just as broken. 1 Pankratops because even though it doesn't play into the loops, it doubles as spell and trap removal, making it still slightly more valuable than Alpha despite lacking the synergy. Also the more different names we run the more of these effects, again you're bringing in whichever 13 board breakers are most relevant including many different names and effects that synergize. You also aren't obligated to bring them in. If Sphere Mode is bad, leave in Tactics, it is as simple as that. I wanted some ways to handle backrow beside Pankratops, so I went with Twintwister. I just noticed that a lot of the decks you would bring it in against getting the banish isn't as relevant as getting that second set card. Then Red Reboot, because it is Red Reboot. Goodbye trap deck. For my last option I had space to play going first cards, and I tested a lot of Solemn Judgement. But in thinking about the meta, both now and in the future, I'm expecting the top decks in the current meta will stay powerful, and that this deck and Flundereeze become contenders, and I'm seeing a lot of overlap in the decks that are weak to this card. Against Flundereeze it stops tributing, against Drytron it stops ritual summoning, against Rokkets it stops seal, it stops Romulus, it stops Darkness Metal, it basically neuters a lot of plays. Sure in the mirror and against Prank Kids it does nothing, but in Tribrigade it shuts down their whole mechanic, against any Isolde abuse no Isolde. So you've got like Phantom Knights, the Mirror, Prank Kids, and Sky Striker, and a myriad of decks this doesn't hit that hard, but it does hit a whole swath of them a lot harder than it hits you, especially going first. Now game 3 they have to side in that backrow removal and you might've already pulled em out if you're going second. It basically lets me hit a swath of decks, including some of the threats I expect to still be relevant and some newcomers, so for theorycrafting it seems like a good place to start, since it just hits all the best decks but the mirror, with a couple notable exceptions, and there wasn't space to have 3 specific hand traps to bring in for every random combo matchup. Against a lot of those decks Sphere Mode is fine, Desires is fine, or Tactics is fine, and will generally be higher impact than any hand trap."

They also captur,"Fluffal and Edge Imp monsters are used to fusion summon Frightfur fusion-monsters. Both Fluffal and Edhe Imps have effects which allow them to summon others, send them to the GY or add them to the hand. Frightfurs themself have rather low attack power but most of them have effects which improve the strenght of themself or other Frightfurs. So most main deck cards make it possible to add a lot of material for fusion summoning while the fusionmonsters themself make the most damage."

That's in theory is easy, but in practice will be hard to go first, since King of the Skull Servants has no negates or protection, also will be hard to go second, since your enemy probably has at least one negate or disruption in his field, but i love skull servants.  'The Chaos Creator' is to recycle the combo and for XYZ summon.  Because of the deck don't having any good negate, i added Solemn Judgment, but it's not completely necessary and aslo can be replaced by some hand trap like Infinite Impermanence or ash.  GLHF"

Look I love the color blue, blue cards are awesome, and not these knock off dollar store blue cards called ""link"" monster... even if they do dominate the meta.  This deck runs 3 engines: <ol>  	<li>Drytrons: Purely to search out ritual monsters, spells, and summon Mu Beta Fafnir to help with ritual summoning with Meteonis Drytron.</li>  	<li>Nekroz: These are the blue cards we're looking for. Nekroz monsters are power crept in the game, although their search power and consistency is still unmatched my most deck and should not be overlooked. Unicore is a skill drain for all extra deck monsters. You see that Dragoon? What's that it can't be targeted or destroyed by battle? With my homie Nekroz of Unicore Dragoon is just a 3k beat stick that my blue bois can steam roll over.</li>  	<li>Fairies: Look, Herald of Ultimatness is amazing, but popping off with Drytrons and having him on the field with 4 fairies in your hand as omni negates isn't fun for me. I like to play with my opponent, not stop them from doing anything fun. If you want meta go play any of the meta Drytron Fairy deck and make people hate you at locals. Now for what we play. Benten needs to be banned but until it is run him, Diviner, Orange Light, and Eva. I would run 3 Diviners but I'm making this profile for someone who doesn't have 3. All of these are good cards and with diviner being able to become a level 6 when sending arc light with her effect and is a tuner means you can actually synchro level 8 monsters. More on that later.</li> </ol> This deck has one main goal: <ol>  	<li>Get Unicore on the field alongside your strong ritual monsters (Draconids, Valkyrus, Areadbhair). Non of your monsters are extra deck monsters meaning Unicore only effects your oppenent. All of your strong monsters can still use their effects because their rituals.</li> </ol> How do we achieve this goal?: <ol>  	<li>Drytron comes in handi for this. In my mind they are the fuel for the entire decks engine. The most important ones, in this order, are Alpha, Zeta, Gamma, Delta. As long as all 4 exist in your hand/field/GY you can cycle through them all each turn. If you have all 4 available, go through them in this order: <ol>  	<li>Start with Alpha: Get any ritual monster you may need</li>  	<li>Zeta: Get a ritual spell. Meteonis can summon all ritual monsters including the harder to summon Nekroz ones (Areadbhair/Valkrus/Trishula) as long as their in the GY (so dump them to the GY for a Drytron effect). I always want a Meteonis before the Nekroz specific rituals. Nekroz Kaleidoscope is the next best, followed by Cycle, then Mirror.</li>  	<li>Delta: Reveal that ritual monster or spell that you will always have in your hand and get a free draw card.</li>  	<li>Gamma: Instant Mu Beta Fafnir summon, materials can be used to ritual summon, dump Draconids from deck, use meteonis drytron to ritual Draconids from grave, lower Mu beta fafnir attack to bring back Meteonis to hand, profit.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>The Nekroz monsters are really good at searching themselves but for the most part I just use them as tribute fodder for the Drytrons then bring them back from grave, use their in hand effects, or straight up summon them.</li> </ol> The extra deck contains some creatures they are not meant to be summoned but instead meant to be sent off of Kaleidoscope. What this means is you can trade these out for any other extra deck Synchro of Fusion with the same levels and they will serve the same purpose, although I picked these for a specific reason and will note them below. These include: <ol>  	<li>Herald of Arc Light (also sent to grave with Diviner of Herald). I would keep this becuase its synergy with Faries is too good.</li>  	<li>Elder Entity N'tss (I've personally made a Meta Dragoon player at locals scoop because I destroyed their $100 dragoon with this with the Unicore play I describe below. I will always run this. That's what you get for playing a meta deck against actual 12 year olds trying to have fun at locals you ass. As an adult I feel responsible to right these poor kids when someone is trying way too hard to win. We need new people to be in this game to keep it alive and it's our responsibility to make sure they have a good experience and teach them nicely. Laughing at them when you beat them with a $1,000 deck against their structure deck their parents bought them is not cool. Ok, rant over).</li>  	<li>Stardust Dragon is a good level 8 to send or summon with Herald. I would keep this as a level 8.</li>  	<li>Trishula is just a level 9 to send for a Brionac and Clausolas summon, replaceable with another level 10.</li>  	<li>Ruddy Rose is a level 10 for a Brinac and Unicore summon, replaceable with any other level 10. I just think the secret rare of this looks beautiful and I happened to pull one.</li>  	<li>2 Stardust Divine Sifr. 2 level 12's is very smart because with Kaleidoscope you can summon: <ol>  	<li> 2 Brionacs (6+6)</li>  	<li>Valkyrus and Unicore (8+4)</li>  	<li>Trishula and Clausolas (9+3)</li>  	<li>Not to mention when this card is in the grave due to Kaleidoscope you can resummon a properly Synchroed Stardust Dragon from the Grave. This card does a lot of work in this deck</li> </ol> </li> </ol> It's hard to lay out any one specific combo because this deck has so many ways to get to the same end board. I mean half your cards say something along the lines of ""search desired card"". This deck is more about what you're trying to do and less about how you get there, because you almost always get there. Just don't get Droll and Lock Bird'ed.  Some fun things this deck can do in situations: <ol>  	<li>From hand Nekroz of Valkyrus can end the battle phase instantly. Many times when you have Unicore on the field people try to attack over him so their monsters have their effects back; this tells them no.</li>  	<li>If you're able to get 2 Brionac in your hand, play Nekroz Kaleidoscope to send a level 12, special summon both the Brionacs, then XYZ into Gauntles Launcher for the memes of destroying stuff on the field.</li>  	<li>If your oppenent summons the dreaded Dragoon and doesn't negate the Kaleidoscope while you attempt to summon Unicore you're in for some fun.  Play Kaleidoscope to send Elder Entity N'tss to summon Unicore. Unicore on summon shuts off all extra deck monster effect, meaning Dragoon is just a sad dragonborn sorcerer with no spell slots left (D&amp;D reference for those who don't understant). That Elder Entity N'tss that you sent to the graveyard can now target the Dragoon and destroy it. LOL.</li>  	<li>If you send Arc Light off Diviner of the Herald to make him a level 6 you can synchro with a level 2 to actually summon stardust dragon which is fun. Then if you Kaleidoscope the Stardust Sifr you can banish Sifr  to resummon stardust dragon since you were able to properly synchro startdust. Pretty cool imo.

The goal is to slow your opponent down with savage preventing otk and then on your turn use bsl field spell in tandem with dillingerous ef in grave to pop off into borrelend.  What to do when board is broken: recover with furious ef; attack using link 2 go into stronger monster by using rokket recharger ef to recover link4/5 in grave; excharge dragon comeback  Explaining several deck choices:  Why no hieratic heavenly spheres? spheres is good for control but this is a combo deck maxed out meaning we keep extending with dillingerous always plus spheres cannot be recovered with furious  why 3x furious dragon and 3x dragon's mirror? answer: furious is my favorite borrel card with recovery and interruption ability you can cut 1 dragons mirror and furious so you are less likely to brick with double dragon's mirror, however I don't recommend it since you can use it on the following turn for recovery  Why no ritual Borrel Riot dragon or Duelweil dragon?  answer: elpy was banned so now duelweil is not practical to summon since you have to hard draw it.  riot is ritual so pre-prep of rites works with it but it takes on field monsters which hinders link plays alot and you have to run the 2 bricks 1 ritual spell and 1 riot dragon.  3x  pot of desires why? answer: mandatory draw power use after searching with striker dragon for bsl love draw power  Conclusion:  GL have fun and combo off into explosive victory!!!  &nbsp;"

Once your deck is mostly banished, summon Gren Maju da Eiza.  With enough banished cards this should function as a 1-shot kill.  Failing that there is also beatdown with either Hexe Trude, or Eater of Millions, both of which benefit from Golden Castle in their own ways"

Vylons aren't terrible and have seen a few semi competitive variants through the years, but only one of those is even remotely playable, that being omega turbo. A weird sacky deck that takes a large amount of setup, but puts up some insane boards if it pops off.  The Combo (element, Kay-est, vylon equip spell, non-tuner vylon):  Element summons a tuner from deck whenever an equip spell is destroyed (not once per turn ), kay-est pops cards equipped to the card it's equipped to, and the vylon equips all float into another one when the are sent to grave. This gives you a shit ton of link material (or synchro, or xyz) to do basically whatever you want. the issue comes from the fact that this is a four card combo that takes two specific cards that aren't really searchable.  This version of the deck is mainly just to shit out a ton of links to do shit. This is most likely not the optimal build of the deck, but it can be funny"

Below is a link showing of an example combo.  https://www.duelingbook.com,"This deck specializes in making a very strong first turn board using just two cards with up to 5 or more interactions. I will both explain the combo and post a replay showing a general first turn combo <strong>in the deck summary</strong>.  Step 1: All you need to do the combo is <a data-name=""Ready Fusion"">Ready Fusion</a> and any normal summonable monster. Step 2: You must special summon <a data-name=""Allvain the Essence of Vanity"">Allvain the Essence of Vanity</a> and normal summon a monster. Step 2: Link summon <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> and activate its effect. Step 3: Summon <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> from deck using Halqifibrax effect. Step 4: Make <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Aurorado"">Mecha Phantom Beast Aurorado</a>n +3 tokens and Summon Deskbot 001 using it's effect. Step 4: Synchro summon <a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a> using 2 tokens and Deskbot 001. With Shooting riser's effect you must send a level 2 monster to the grave for the next step of the combo. (Ex: <a data-name=""PSY-framegear Gamma"">PSY-framegear Gamma</a>). Step 5: Synchro Summon <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> and PROFIT. The combo can continue in many paths from here but for the sake of efficiency I will end it here.  Siding: You may side <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> into backrow heavy decks or decks that make a stong turn one board. <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> and the other sided fusion monsters may also be good into certain first turn board decks. <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> is good into hand trap decks but locks you out of your bread and butter combo.  Notes: If you want to make this deck 100% TCG I would recommend a second copy of Allvain. If it's more readily available in the future, <a data-name=""Master Flare Hyperion"">Master Flare Hyperion</a> can be used as an alternative to <a data-name=""Baroness De Fleur"">Baroness De Fleur.</a>"

This is how the King duels!,"This is my current build for Red Dragon Archfiend, Resonators, Red Supernova Dragon turbo, whatever you want to call it. The idea of the deck is to get to our Synchro Monsters as consistently as possible, using Resonators and our Level 4 Monsters to Synchro Summon Red Rising Dragon, then bringing back a Resonator with its effect to use the two Monsters to Synchro Summon once more. The main gameplan is as follows: Special Summon Crimson Resonator with its effect, followed by Normal Summoning a Level 4 Monster, preferably Witch of the Black Forest, or Special Summoning Wandering King Wildwind. Then, Synchro Summon Red Rising Dragon, and use its effect to bring back Crimson Resonator. Use Crimson Resonator's effect to Special Summon two Resonators from our deck whose Levels add up to 4 (preferably Synkron Resonator and Creation Resonator for reasons I'll go into later, but two Red Resonators also works) and use our three Resonators and Red Rising Dragon to Synchro Summon this deck's strongest Monster, Red Supernova Dragon. Red Supernova Dragon combats many Monster-focused strategies by waiting to banish the opponent's field in just the right moment to remove problem cards and stop the opponent's plan in its tracks, and ending games quickly with its extremely high attack power.  The ideal Level 4 Monster to perform this setup with is Witch of the Black Forest. This is because she can search any Monster in our main deck after she's sent to the Graveyard, so using her in a Synchro Summon is excellent. In the above setup, using Crimson Resonator and Witch of the Black Forest to make Red Rising Dragon would allow us to search a Monster, such as Red Familiar. Then, using Synkron Resonator as one of the Tuners for Red Supernova Dragon allows us to add a Resonator from our Graveyard to our hand, such as the Creation Resonator we also used. Because Red Familiar can tribute itself to bring back a DARK Dragon Synchro from the Graveyard, and Banish itself to change that Synchro's Level, then combining it with the Creation Resonator (Special Summoned, assuming we still have Red Supernova Dragon) allows us to access most of our other Synchros, Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss. In short, this means if we have Crimson Resonator and Witch of the Black Forest in our opening hand, we have the setup for not only Red Supernova Dragon, but also for another powerful Synchro Monster the following turn. Alternatively, if we open with Crimson Resonator, Red Familiar, and Wandering King Wildwind, we can achieve something similar by Special Summoning Crimson Resonator and Wandering King Wildwind with their respective effects, Synchro Summoning Red Rising Dragon and Red Supernova Dragon as normal, but then Normal Summoning Red Familiar and Special Summoning Creation Resonator. Tribute Red Familiar for its effect to bring back Red Rising Dragon, then use it and Creation Resonator to make Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss, similar to the above setup with Witch of the Black Forest, but on the same turn we Summon Red Supernova Dragon. Regardless, when Abyss deals battle damage we can bring back Synkron Resonator and make Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane. This would normally deprive us of Abyss's amazing negation effect for the following turn, but Synkron Resonator lets us add Creation Resonator back to our hand once more, which we can then Special Summon and tribute for Bane's effect to bring back Abyss. Afterwards the main use of Bane will be using it to make Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity, either through Bane's own effect, or, if we have two level 1 Resonators in the GY already, we can use Red Rising Dragon to bring them back and make King Calamity before the Battle Phase. This is the general gameplan, of the deck, but Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons and Void Ogre Dragon, provided we can empty our hand of cards, provide a solid backup plan for different scenarios.  Unfortunately, there will be times where we don't have Crimson Resonator available, despite having three copies of it and three copies of the two cards we can use to search it (Resonator Call and Resonator Command) in which case we need to improvise. If Red Resonator is available, along with a Level 4 Monster, we can still go into Red Rising Dragon, but you'll have to stop on a Level 8 Synchro, being Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend, or Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon, as neither Void Ogre Dragon nor Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons can be summoned this way. (Both require a DARK Tuner). Scarlight is good for clearing the field or simply being ""Red Dragon Archfiend"", while Chaos Ruler can be more helpful going first as it can dig through the deck to help further our plays next turn, or ideally, find a Synkron Resonator we can use to make Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss, the ideal monster to have if Red Supernova Dragon isn't an option. If not, we may be forced to fall back on Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth, or Black Rose Moonlight Dragon, or, the worst case scenario, nothing at all. This is where we get into the deck's weaknesses; if we can't Synchro Summon on our first turn, there isn't really anything we can do. It's tempting to add Link Monsters to circumvent this, but I couldn't find any that were good enough to justify the space they'd take, and even if we decided to run the Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon engine, it would hurt the deck's consistency and we wouldn't even always be able to have two Monsters we could Summon to make Predaplant Verte Anaconda anyway. Another issue is the deck struggles to play through hand traps; Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermanence in particular can stop us in our tracks, leaving us on a Red Rising Dragon we can't do anything with. Fortunately, this is something we can address with Called by the Grave, which we include in the Main Deck to give us a shot at shutting these cards down. The final weakness worth mentioning is the deck doesn't have much for dealing with Spells and Traps, though Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss, Infinite Impermanence, and Red Reign can help circumvent this, as can the Side Deck.  The Side Deck contains two six-card packages: a Kaiju package, and a Crossout Designator package. The idea here is we can decide which one we need, and take out the same six cards from the Main Deck for either one; the three Red Sprinters, the two Resonator Engines, and the one Chain Resonator. This is the most painless way I've been able to think of to fit these packages in without hurting the deck's consistency too much. The Crossout Designator package is designed for combating hand traps, specifically Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring, Effect Veiler, and Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion. These are the ones that I've found tend to foil our plans the most, but Nibiru, the Primordial Being, is also a significant threat. Depending on the current climate of the game it may be wise to use that to replace one of the other targets. In fact, in some contexts it might be better to simply have this package in the Main Deck by default, but as this is a non-meta deck I've designed it with the assumption it will usually be used against other non-meta decks, which may or may not be using hand traps at all. The Kaiju engine, however, is simple enough to use, as its main purpose is simply monster removal when going second. However, in this deck specifically there's enough possible interactions that I think it's worth going into in more detail. I've always been fond of Kaijus, as unlike most other outs to dangerous cards, Kaiju Monsters can interact with the rest of your deck in fun ways, with their varied Types, Levels, and Attributes. This deck plays Dogoran, the Mad Flame Kaiju, Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju, and Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju, along with three Interrupted Kaiju Slumber, as a package to clear out problematic Monsters and possibly enable our Synchro Monsters in one swoop. For example, if we use Interrupted Kaiju Slumber to give ourselves Dogoran and our opponent Gameciel, we can Banish a Red Rising Dragon in the Graveyard to Special Summon two Level 1 Resonators from our Graveyard and use those along with Dogoran to Synchro Summon Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend, or if we have Radian we can use a single Level 1 Resonator to make a Level 8 Synchro Monster. Of course, we can also keep our Kaiju on the field as means of preventing our opponent from using their own Kaijus to out our Synchro Monsters, particularly Red Supernova Dragon. As for the three Lightning Storm, they're a good safe option if we expect to go second and don't think either the two six-card packages are necessary, in which case we simply side out Chain Resonator and the Resonator Engines.  This deck is subject to change and improvement. It's currently my main focus as far as Yu-Gi-Oh is concerned. I may edit this list in the future to keep it up to date, or as further playing reveals improvements to be made. Let's kick this duel into overdrive!"

I wanted to make a Cybernetic Horizon-less build because that card kills the deck with its Extra Deck lock into Machines (seriously Konami what's the point of stopping Cyberdarks from accessing Verte Anaconda and Buster Whelp?? And you didn't even release a good Link or fusion spell to make up for it. I hate you). It's a simple build really, similar decks already exist, I just swapped handtraps for extenders. It's still not rogue tier but is better than what Konami calls 'Cyber Style', in my opinion.  *This deck has lots of starters and extenders and can actually play through interruptions, except Droll &amp; Lock, Dimensional Shifter and Nibiru. But depending on your hand you should be able to make Dragoon anyway, as opposite to the ""Cyber Style"" build which just dies.  *Dragoon is sadly not only way better than Cyberdarkness and Dark End, but also easily accessible so there is no point in not using it -- best win condition of the deck. What does Dragoon gain from protecting Cyberdarks? Well for starters, the buster lock completely invalidates Super Polymerization. And the resource recycling game pretty much guarantees Dragoon will always have something to discard. Plus Cyberdarks add lots of destruction removal so it's not like they do nothing  *The second win condition is the Cyberdark themselves equipped with Dragon Buster Destruction Sword. Try to equip it with Cyberdark Invasion rather than with the effect of the Cyberdark itself; this way, the little dragon will stay equipped even if Keel, Edge and Horn get their effects negated. Even without Dragon Buster, the Cyberdark trio can hold their own with Invasion and Inferno support  *Magicians' Souls lets you draw into your extenders to make Link plays and is a prime Link material itself. It can also fix your hand in a pitch. Send the equips to gain easy card advantage over your opponent. Shuffle REF back in the deck with Illusion of Chaos.  *Add Revsystem with Core when your starting hand lacks extenders.  *Ningirsu The Wold Chalice Warrior should be put over Fossil Warrior Skull Knight to out some troublesome cards but eh, I never needed it so far. BLS + Pegasus + Megafleet should be enough.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Making a dinosaur trap control deck is a little bit ambitious with the fact that they float, giving them the go ahead with torrential, support traps, letting them play a ton of cards, are Dinos which you get why, misc and tons of searchers, have no regard for life points giving them more traps, particularly rebirth for a free summon of a counter trap searcher, arc rebellion shake, and even enabling cyber stein as an extremely viable option!  That’s what I played in this build but there’s more, below is some ideas that I had  &nbsp;  Playing primarily on opponents turn and built in such a way you can run the dogmatika engine shaddoll winda engine as well.  Play with sky strikers.  Dragoon turbo, it’s stupid but effective  Play floodgates, they can just do that  Combine with a lot of midrange decks that are capable of pumping out bosses every turn and still sitting behind traps  Play with Paleozoic, I think you can understand this one  Run so many different kinds of cards for generic searchers  eldlich, because people are somehow managing to shove eldlich into anything  ns alister, for instant content  buster blader lock with counter traps be like  True king actually works here  lost world will trigger these guys floating effects apparently  Evil eye helps you reach your goal  when under 2000 LP you don’t have to pay the cost for ANY trap, if I’m correct then imperial order won’t ever be able to leave but this one I could be wrong on.  This archetype is actually too good, Konami why did you make this? This was written way too poorly, they float, protect from damage, and do everything you could ask for from a control deck and stun deck combine.  What this deck is capable of doing is easily meta potential."

This is why Needlefibre needs to be banned. Okay, Auroradon is actually a card you could maybe hit instead, or you could be stupid and ban Deskbot and every other Tuner Needlefibre can summon, but broken stuff keeps popping up with Needlefibre.  So, this is a shell for that combo. So why this combo, and why this shell? Well for starters, the combo is real. Yes, it can lose to handtraps - in fact you're doing literally everything the most common hand traps hit, searching, summoning, summoning from the GY, activating effects from the GY, activating effects on the field, even making tokens - the combo requires you to dodge or play through hand traps. This is exacerbated by playing Dinosaur, since 1 Lancea is a huge swing in the matchup. Crossout helps but isn't perfect. But the reward for taking that risk is real, a couple serious boss monsters and Herald, which is an omni-negate and a floodgate. And Lost World helps a lot by protecting your monsters from targeting.  So why Dinosaur for this combo? As mentioned above there are cons, mainly that you now lose to basically every hand trap if you don't draw Crossout. Well, the reason is partially for consistency, and partially for power, and partially to mitigate the risks of the combo. It does none of these exceptionally well, but it does all of them well enough. Running 3 Rotas and 3 starters means you're more likely to put up the start without running excess bricks or multiple 1 card Needlefibre packages. Running Lost World helps mitigate the inherent weakness to hand traps. You can also just make Dinosaur plays in the event of hand traps, and my basic mentality when it comes to dinosaur is consistent UTCs are pretty good. That means we have nice consistent 1 card starts, and Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon + Archosaur will also start you into the combo, so we have multiple ways into it with cards we want to see. Also, Jurrac Aeolo isn't really a brick - not only is it not a Garnet, it isn't a Taketemborg either, since seeing it alongside Oviraptor is the exact same result as seeing Oviraptor + Babycerasaurus, one of your common starts (you can Rota for. That means we can keep it down to 1 Garnet and 2 Taketemborg. Just don't draw Coltwing and you'll be fine. It is also powerful, since you can easily fill those 2 remaining monster zones with good high-quality interruptions in UTC and Pankratops.  So, I started by putting in the bricks and the combo. I hadn't even decided on Dinosaur at that point, I was just looking at easy 1 card Needlefibres and trying to find a home. That became Dinosaur because of Oviraptor, Fossil Dig, and Misc. Misc doesn't really help with the combo the way Lost World does, but it is good nonetheless. Jurrac Aeolo was my next card, a necessary card for going into Needlefibre, but again not really a brick so much as a combo piece. 3 Lost World and 1 Terraforming, this is a big part of the reason to play the combo in this deck. I put in 1 Giant Rex, because you can still make some ordinary Dino plays and the deck wouldn't feel right without him. Sometimes, your combo gets interrupted and you've got to have a backup plan. 2 Archosaur and 2 Pill. You do want to see these, there just isn't space to run 3 each. 3 Babycerasaurus because it is strictly better than Petiteranodon in this deck, but I still want 2 Petiteranodon so you'll occasionally see this and get an extra Pankratops off of your UTC. 2 Tyranno, this is typically your 4th interruption throughout your normal combos, and it is your main back-up plan. Good to see, good to search, good to summon off of pill. 3 Prosperity. This does sort of kill a lot of your backup plans, but all of your main cards leave just about 6 spaces of ""filler"" and I think having that consistency boost is important. It is also Ash bait, which is really its main purpose, since we're vulnerable to a well-timed Ash. 1 Pankratops, this is a good going second card, but it is also the 5th interruption you put up with Petiteranodon or Pill. You need another high-level monster to summon in your combo. I mean, need is going a little far, but it definitely helps. I like filling all of my monster zones. The rest of the deck is Crossout and random 1 ofs that disrupt the combo if timed right.  This deck goes through the usual Auroradon / Cupid Pitch combo to put up Baroness + Savage + Herald, with Auroradon in the extra monster zone. However, if you have a Baby in your hand or start with a Archosaur + Baby, or just have Pill or UTC in your hand, you add a UTC to that board. You can search UTC to make that even more consistent, and will sometimes add a Pankratops to that board, either by using pill when you have UTC or popping Petiteranodon with UTC. You run 1 Barricadeborg Blocker just to clear up zones so that you can use the Archosaur, Linkuriboh into Secure Gardna for more easy UTCs, and Dollka and Laggia as mascots. For my final cards, I went with I:P into Goddess for a going first option, and Lyna into Accesscode for a going second option, but these slots could be anything and are basically banish fodder (you decide whether you need Dolka/Laggia or Linkuriboh/Gardna).  Getting real LinkFibre era vibes from this combo. One plan I considered was running more Backrow, and the Solemn Judgment in the side deck still seem good, especially vs DRNM, but I felt the combo loses to hand traps badly enough that Crossout was obligatory in the main.  Reprodocus has become the generic link 2 of choice, because it being a Dinosaur is relevant for some hands. I cut Giant Rex. In this combo-focused version it became another brick we couldn't afford. One notable thing about the deck is you can use Baroness to pop the Jurraegg token to summon Pankratops before you make the Herald. So you're using Baroness's pop to get an extra spell-speed 2 interruption."

It's mostly solved now so I felt like posting the decklist that I use. This deck has great ability to play through cards and can catch people off guard. The win condition is to make your opponent waste resources and then decimate them on turn 2. Sorry if the text is weird in some places, it won't let me put the names of the spells.  <strong>@Ignister monsters -</strong>  Bururu @Ignister (1) - Searchable by cyberse wicckid. Foolishes a card (usually your negate, or something to be revived by splash mage for a meet you only hand), then when used as synchro material you can special summon the other monster used as material. Very important for combo, but is searchable and doesn't help otherwise.  Pikari @Ignister (3) - Starter, searches any AI spell or trap, which is incredibly useful. No reason not to play at 3. Plus it makes light dragon which is funny sometimes.  Achichi @Ignister (3) - It's Stratos.  Doyon @Ignister (3) - This card is absolutely nuts. When it's summoned, you can add 1 of your monsters from your grave to your hand, which is great for the field spell's gimmick. And that's not all - When it's sent to the graveyard as link material for a cyberse monster, you can add 1 of your A I. s/t from your graveyard to your hand. It's both achichi and pikari in one if your graveyard is loaded, which is why i play 3 and not 2. Drawing it is ALWAYS good.  Danmari @Ignister (1) - banish from grave for HRDAA negate while you have arrival. Sent during combo.  Gatchiri @Ignister (1) - Negate the effects of one Cyberse monster you control to special summon it. When it's sent to the graveyard, you can give your cards immunity. Nice for making safe plays, plus protects on board as well. Great for 8300 attack unaffected accesscode.  Hiyari @Ignister (1) - Free special summon if you control an @Ignister monster, searches gatchiri by tributing one.  <strong>Engine Spells - </strong>  AI. Meet You (3)- LOCKS INTO CYBERSE EFFECTS! (Search by revealing an ED monster. Deals 2300 burn to you if you didn't special summon the monster you revealed). At 3 because you can still do combo off of starting with it.  Ignister AILand - (3+Terraforming) The focus of the deck. Special summons a mon from hand while there's nothing in your MMZ. Can come back from graveyard by its effect.  Cynet Mining - (3) More copies of starters. Can send combo pieces to GY sometimes.  AIdle Reborn - (2) Is a quickplay monster reborn. Can use on opponent's turn and then link off doyon to use it again, going very high in card advantage. Also can be helpful to extend.  AIContact - (0-1) Spicy draw 3 if you open an extra AILand. Can recycle it to go to the moon in card advantage.  <strong>Extra Deck -</strong>  Accesscode Talker(1) - I think you know why.  The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister- (1) The big man.  Transcode Talker (1)- Summons a link-3 or lower in your GY. Used on turn 2+ to go for a push  Update Jammer (1)- Makes OTK with Accesscode  Splash Mage (2) - Amazing card for cyberse, reborns any cyberse monster in defense position.  Cyberse Wicckid (1) - I love this card. Searches a tuner when a monster is summoned in a zone it points to, and offers protection to itself and monsters it points to. Sometimes you just pass on this guy and call it a day.  Dark Infant @Ignister (3) - Link 1, searches field spell. That's all you need to know.  Fire Phoenix @Ignister (1) - This card is only there for Meet You, it's 2300 and fire.  Dark Templar @Ignister (1) - Very important part of your combo, protect mr. soul charge at all costs.  Link Spider (1) - Solid rocks brother. Turns nib into a cyberse.  Light Dragon @Ignister (1) - Meet You, plus it can wipe a few cards off of your opponent's board.  Wind Pegasus @Ignister (1) - Synchro monster for Bururu, plus if your arrival gets removed, your opponent's monster gets removed.  &nbsp;  <em>Everything else in the deck is flex spots. Your hand traps are important, as that is how you apply pressure with your Arrival Cyberse. Not hooked on crossout for this deck yet, as resolving combo doesn't mean instant win. I don't have combos on here right now, but you should be able to find the most important ones pretty easily. It's all for the same endboard anyways.</em>"

Spam draws and special summons ~synchro into Boardefly activate it effect ~use De-Synchro to bring Boardefly materials back - summon Lightflare. If you got more De-Synchro you can do more loop and add Moonflowerviewing in the combo for more draw power.  Pot of Avarice may be a good idea for the main deck but i didn't found space for it.  The side deck is irrelevant so i added some prision and trishula stuff to fill it.  GLHF

Ive been playing this Deck for quite a while now so heres how it works: Your general gameplan is to get 1x Gouki monster + at least 1 extender in hand.  You almost always want to normal summon your Gouki and then play further with your extenders like ""War Rock Gactos"" or ""Fire Flint Lady"" which guarantee you the Isolde. When you summon Isolde your Chaining is essential. You always want to use your Gouki, which you send for her summon, as Chain Link 1 and the Isolde as Chain Link 2.  For the searches you get of these two the optimal options are to add a ""Gouki Headbatt"" from the Gouki and whatever Gouki you used for Isoldes summon through the search you get of Isolde. We add the Gouki we used already by Isolde so we have a material for Headbatt, since he needs to discard a Gouki Monster to be special summoned. After this you wanna use Isolde to either get your ""Gouki Twistcobra""(3 equip spells needed in Deck) ,""Gouki Octostretch"" (1 equip spells needed in Deck) or ""Gouki Guts"" (1 equip spells needed in Deck). This should leave you with 3 Monsters on Board. The Isolde in the Extra Monster Zone, the Monster you summoned of Isolde and the headbatt you summoned trough its effect. Then you go into a Link 4 with these Monsters for the ""Saryuja Skull Dread"" and then add a Gouki Rematch to your hand. You'll use this rematch to summon back 2 Goukis (be carefull not to summon your Isolde target) and then start the codebreaker combo. This will give you enough materials for a Rusty and leave you with a Link-3 Monster as well. You'll use the Rusty to dumb the silent cloak and set the Shade Brigandine, the you activate the brigandine and banish the cloak to add a boots to hand which you can special to your side. You can then go into a Gryphon or an Apolusa (depending on if you fear the late Nibiru). IF you decide to go for Gryphon remember to first of: Add Phoenix Blade back to hand Seccondly: To use Brigandine for its Summon.  Then you can, if you have no more extenders, end your Turn by summoning a Verte Anaconda and using its effect to summon a Dragoon to your side (remember to summon it in a Zone where a Link monster Points to, if you Summoned a Gryphon) and banish the silent boots for a Fog Blade.  This is your basic bread and butter combo which will leave you with 2 Monster negates trough Apolousa, 1 trough Fog Blade and one Omni negate trough the Dragoon.  Of course, the Deck can play trough the multitude of engines, like the striker engine, in many different ways on your turn, based on of what you draw.  Here are a few combo specific plays:  If you draw Engage or Hornet Drones: You activate it to summon the token. Then you go into the Kagari to add back the Hornet drones, and reactivate it. Then you summon the Kaina by using the Kagari as Material for the Summon. Trough that you have a Link zone and a Warrior Monster. This gives you even with one extender enough room to do your combo or more.  War Rock Gacta : You have to normal summon a warrior to trigger his summoning condition. Thats about it  On another note: If you dont want to use Dragoon just play 3x War Rock Mountains instead of the Dragoon engine, since it searches you the Gacta which serves as an extender.  Pros of the Deck: Many options to get to your Combo pieces Space in the Extra Deck  Cons: Very Vulnerable to Handtraps and/or negates in general"

It has been a top-tier presence in the meta more or less consistently since mid-2020, and continues to adapt despite several banlist hits.

Chamber Dragonmaid is currently inaccessible to budget players, clocking in at over $70 apiece currently, but it is confirmed to get a reprint in the upcoming set Maximum Gold.</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Mega-tins reprinted Chaos Ruler, a fantastic card in this deck that benefits basically all aspects of your game plan and enables you to synchro for Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss.</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The trendy meta version of Dragon Link tends to play floodgates in the main or side deck.

First, you need to get Master Ogre out into the Right EMZ. Next, get Destroy Ogre out directly under Master. Then, (this isn't required), I would put Great Ogre to the right oh Destroy Ogre. But only when you have completed the Extra Link!!! Next, put Giant Ogre the the left on Destroy. This in turn, will let you put Solid to the left of Giant, and then you can use Solid to get Blade onto the next EMZ and Powerload to the left of Solid. If you don't understand this completely, I made a Google Doc on how it should look. I can share the link in the comments, if you need it. Best of luck on your next duel!"

The answer is mixed. The grind game is better, and the interruptions get real, but you hit Winda less consistently and while the ceiling is high the floor is very low. I think Pure or Invoked Shaddolls is probably better than this. Too bad, I was hoping I'd jive with these boss monsters, since they are Fiends, But I'm not sure this is better than just consistently making Winda, or even making Mechaba + Ecclesia with a chance to Winda. One nice thing about the deck is it doesn't care about Zombie World. Like at all. So, we're free to run the best floodgate in the format without the risk of blowing ourselves out.  So, for the Despia engine, I have 3 Aluber, 3 Tragedy, 1 Dramaturge, 1 Despia Theatre, and 3 Branded Opening. Aluber is your Stratos, and contributes to that great grind game and is a clear 3 of. I like 3 Tragedy because it helps consistently search my Despia cards, the grind effect on this is a little weak but it can set Branded Opening so that's useful. Dramaturge at 1 is fine, this is your big main deck boss monster, and represents a negate in a lot of situations as well, pretty good I'd say. For Shaddolls we have 2 Squamata, 1 Wendi, 1 Ariel, 3 each of the Fusions spells, and 1 each of the Traps. Small Package, the goal is actually to search these cards with Apkallone to make Shaddoll plays, but sometimes starting combos with Construct will be a better option than holding onto your Dogmatika card.  We run Super Poly, basically both archetypes are Super Poly archetypes, against Light and Dark monsters, Dark in particular, you can crack pretty hefty boards with absolute ease.  Dogmatika cards are cool, but oddly enough we're running 3 Nadir and basically 1 each of the cards it searches. That's it. A little sad, but this isn't an ecclesia deck, it just needs an easy way to send Apkallone for value.  Magicalized Fusion opens up Winda out of Verte Anaconda, which is cool and fun. Super cool and fun, super cool and fun. We run 2 Winda so we can back Winda up with Winda. I like Winda.  Droplets is Droplets, its just super good right now, and even though it sends for cost I think it is worth it. Solemn Strike is here because we need extra negates in the deck, and pretty badly.  The Side deck is little sloppy but overall I'm pretty happy with it. I probably won't work on this deck anymore, because I don't think I like this engine as much as Aleister or Magistus cards, even if they are Fiends."

By using the basic swarming and Special Summon material set-up of Magnet Warriors, the play extension and powerful abilities of Adamancipators and the brute force nature of Fossils, this deck is extremely versatile in terms of its aimed win conditions. (NOTE: This deck runs as little negation as possible, because 10 pounds of negation gets boring after some time.)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Crazy Specific 1 Turn Lockdown Mode (ends board with Cross-Sheep [Extra Monster Zone], Knightmare Gryphon [Linked to Cross-Sheep in the zone below it], and Cyberse Quantum Dragon [next to Cross-Sheep's Link]): Special Summon Researcher with its own effect, then activate Sentry's effect in GY to Special Summon itself. Activate Magnetic Field and use its effect to bring back Beta The Electro from the GY. Beta's effect on summon adds a Level 4 manila Magnet Warrior. Activate Researcher's effect, and Special Summon either a manila Magnet Warrior among the excavated cards or a Gamma The Electro. If you summon Gamma, use its effect on summon to Special the added Level 4 manila. Use the Level 4 manila to Link Summon Link Spider. Activate Super Team Buddy Force and target Link Spider to Special Trisbaena from GY so that it is co-linked to Link Spider. You can then Normal Summon any 1 monster from your hand (most likely the manila added with Beta's effect if Researcher Summoned a manila instead of a Gamma). Use the Normal Summoned monster and Trisbaena to Link Summon Knightmare Gryphon,who should be co-linked to Link Spider. (You can activate its effect on Summon if you want, but it's not really important to the lockdown.) Next use Beta and Link Spider to Link Summon Cross-Sheep above Gryphon's Link. Then tune Sentry with Researcher to Synchro Summon Quantum next to both Cross-Sheep and Gryphon's Links (for assurance). Cross-Sheep's effect on Quantum's Summon, giving all of your monsters +700 ATK. This board limits your opponent's ability to attack or use certain card effects (since only Quantum can be targeted and can boot bigger monsters back to the hand), restricts your opponent's Special Summoned monster effects (thanks to Gryphon), and not to mention the fact that you get 2 main beaters with 3200 ATK each.</span>"

The idea is to spam Winda, back it with Mechaba, and abuse Nadir Servant to search your Shaddoll cards. The deck is a pile of broken spells and small engines.  For Shaddoll monsters, it is a small package, but not tiny, 3 each of the Squamata and Wendi, and 1 Ariel. You want to open Squamata or Wendi as often as possible to make the fusion spells live, and you need the 1 Ariel for the combos. It is also an incredible interruption. These are searchable off of Nadir Servant funnily enough. 3 of each of the Fusion spells, because we're a fusion deck and need to see fusion spells for the combos. They are both very good fusion spells. 1 of each trap because I wanted to keep the package just to essential cards.  3 Nadir Servant, 1 Ecclesia, 1 Fleurdelis. You don't usually summon Ecclesia, this is a generic Shaddoll searcher that also provides a Light monster for material. When you do summon Ecclesia she remains good. 1 of the Trap seems fine, you don't actually want to be locked out of follow-ups too often in your fusion deck.  1 Terraforming, 3 Meltdown, 3 Aleister, 2 Invocation. This helps give the deck another prong of attack in access to Invoked monsters and access to a good generic Fusion spell for making Shaddolls.  1 Magicalized Fusion, this is usually how you make your first Winda off Verte Anaconda. Guaranteed Windas are nice.  3 Super Poly. We're a little light on targets, but we're a Shaddoll deck, and this helps us make Shaddolls plays using monsters as materials at ""Spell Speed 4"".  3 Droplets. Should just be a steple right now if you want to play the game.  3 Secret Village of the Spellcasters. We play maindeck Spellcaster engines to get our cards back online, and we make Winda on our end board, so this is the first spicy floodgate we play.  In the Extra deck 2 Construct. You just need 1 for your turn 1 plays, we aren't a comboish version of the deck, we're trying to reliably make Winda a couple of times and Mechaba once. 2nd is for follow-up. 2 Winda, again I think this is needed for the grind game. 1 Apkallone, this is a negate to back up your plays sometimes, and a tool to send with Nadir Servant other times. 1 Titaniklad, this could come up in some hands but it isn't what we're playing Nadir for. 1 Nt'ss, this is to make the Trap card live. Starving Venom so Super Poly can break boards pretty well using your opponent's monsters. 1 of each Mechaba and Purgatrio. The best Invoked monsters, 1 for going first one for going second. For links we have 1 Artemis and 1 Almiraj. Artemis is important for turning Aleister into a LIGHT monster for Shaddoll plays but also makes him a low-end as a 1 card Mechaba you can run 7 of, and Almiraj means he just as easily accesses Purgatrio. Gravity Controller helps with your Construct combos that make guaranteed Windas. Cross-Sheep could come up in the grind game and be really useful there. Verte Anaconda is really insane in this deck, and necessary for certain opens into Winda 1.  For the side I started with Zombie World. In some matchups this will be better than Secret Village, even if it is worse in most, but it is relatively free in the deck, only impacting access to the Magistus Link 1, and having access to 2 broken floodgates for whichever is better in a matchup seems good. You could even run both going first against Dry, effectively 6 cards that shut down the ritual spell. I initially had the Solemns in the main deck, but I think they're a better side deck plan for this deck than a lot of the better options. We really lack negation, and being able to negate summons and effects could be a really important generic thing to do in matchups where our floodgates aren't effective. Then I threw in Droll and Lancea, high impact hand traps that are specifically good against the best 2 decks and gives us 6 cards to bring in in those respective matchups. Lancea is also good against Virtual World, which is probably the third best deck, and our floodgates are good against Dragon Link."

There are also two field Spells, each representing one state of the dream.</span>  <span>Every Dream Mirror monster (of these three) has the gimmick to tribute itself to summon their opposite form, if the opposite Field Spell is in a field zone (including your opponents). So if I control <span><a data-name=""Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Sprite"">Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Sprite</a></span> and a <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror of Terror"">Dream Mirror of Terror</a></span> I can then tribute Ikelos to summon <span><a data-name=""Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Mara"">Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Mara</a></span> from deck. This can be done during either player's Main or Battle Phase.</span>  <span>Each of them has an effect that triggers if they are summoned by the effect of a Dream Mirror monster. <span><a data-name=""Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Sprite"">Sprite</a></span> searches any Dream Mirror card, <span><a data-name=""Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Mara"">Mara</a></span> Special Summons from hand, <span><a data-name=""Phantasos, the Dream Mirror Friend"">Friend</a> </span>Special Summons a Dream Mirror from the GY, <span><a data-name=""Phantasos, the Dream Mirror Foe"">Foe</a> </span>attack directly, <span><a data-name=""Morpheus, the Dream Mirror White Knight"">White Knight</a></span> protects itself and <span><a data-name=""Morpheus, the Dream Mirror Black Knight"">Black Knight</a></span> destroys a card.</span>  <span>Both Field Spells, <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror of Terror"">Dream Mirror of Terror</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror of Joy"">Dream Mirror of Joy</a></span> have minor effects, they are most needed for their names. Both of these have an effect that allows you to banish them during the End Phase to activate the opposite one directly from hand or deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Their strategy:</span>  <span>The plan was usually to gain good advantage by swapping out your monsters during both player's turns. Sprite searches a monster which Mara Special Summons from hand. Usually a Friend that Special Summons from GY or a Black Knight to destroys a card. That way you could mass advantage while keeping disrupting your opponent (a little).</span>  <span>Since you need both Field Spells to enable all of your monsters you would make use of <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror Hypnagogia"">Dream Mirror Hypnagogia</a></span>. This would activate the Field Spells on both players fields, allowing every monster to use both their swap and their summon effect during either players turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Their fatal flaw:</span>  <span>This is were we transition from a joyous dream of card advantage a to frightful nightmare of bricking. The only way to search Hypnagogia is through Sprite but Sprite doesn't trigger unless it is summoned by a Dream Mirror monster's effect. But you can't use their effects if you don't control the corresponding Field Spell. How's the Field Spell searched? Sprite but Sprite doesn't trigger unless - you see what I'm getting at?</span>  <span>You need both a Field Spell and access to your monsters in order to start playing the game. You have the bare minimum in</span> <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror Phantasms"">Dream Mirror Phantasms</a></span><span>, which searches you a monster. Between that and</span> <span><a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a></span> <span>you had little means to access Sprite, which required Mara on Field and Dream Mirror of Joy in the Field Zone. And that's only what it takes to get to the cards to get your engine going. You then need to use their effects again to add, summon and do all the good stuff. There was no single card that did it all. You would brick a lot and then - obviously - would lose to any interruption. Oh and the Fusion Spell to summon your Boss Monster doesn't have Fusion in it's name either, which is fun. So you have a whole lot of cards you need to search off a single card and only little means to access that single card's effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Enter Sandmann 2021:</span>  <span>BLVO came around and out of nowhere Konami decided to print legacy support for Dream Mirror. Like with every protagonist, their power spike is preceded by a Flashback. So they printed the baby version of their Boss monster and printed a new Boss monster altogether.</span>  <span>The new addition to the main deck, <span><a data-name=""Neiroy, the Dream Mirror Disciple"">Neiroy, the Dream Mirror Disciple</a></span> could special summon itself, which was fine but didn't really address any of the issues the deck was facing.</span>  <span>Sounds like they scrapped their archetypes theme but it's fantastically thematic. The old boss monster, <span><a data-name=""Oneiros, the Dream Mirror Erlking"">Oneiros, the Dream Mirror Erlking</a></span> was a LIGHT so they printed <span><a data-name=""Oneiros, the Dream Mirror Tormentor"">Oneiros, the Dream Mirror Tormentor</a></span> who is a DARK, keeping the archetype not only on theme but completing them by giving every monster an opposite typing, but one...</span>  <span>---until now. It's the year 2021. It is October 7th and new legacy support is announced. The last remain Dream Mirror, the DARK version of our Boss Baby has finally been revealed and oh. my.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><span>Am I dreaming?</span></span>  <span>This card is pretty much everything this deck desperately needed. <span><a data-name=""Neiroy, the Dream Mirror Heretic"">Neiroy, the Dream Mirror Heretic</a></span> would on summon (yes, even on a simple Normal Summon, finally) search it's opposite, Disciple. Disciple's extend all of a sudden matters as Heretic can tribute another Dream Mirror (the Disciple) to not only Special Summon ANY Dream Mirror monster from your deck but also add the Field Spell necessary for its effect. This allows for a spicy new combo.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><span>Time to make Verte:</span></span>  <span>This is the new combo:</span> <ol>  	<li><span>Summon Heretic, add Disciple. Special Disciple</span></li>  	<li><span>Heretic tributes Disciple to summon Sprite and adds Terror. Activate Terror.</span></li>  	<li><span>Sprite, since it was Special Summoned by the effect of a Dream Mirror monster now searchs</span> <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror of Chaos"">Dream Mirror of Chaos</a></span> <span>(The Fusion Spell)</span></li>  	<li><span>Link both off them away for Verte / Link Heretic off for Almiraj (if you play Accesscode this is another Attribute in the GY)</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Chaos, banish both Neiroy from the GY to Fusion Summon Oneiros, the Dream Mirror Tormentor, which means a Monster effect negate on 5th summon so this combo is <strong>Nibiru-proof</strong></span></li>  	<li><span>(Link Almiraj and Sprite into Verte, then) Activate Verte to summon <span><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer</a></span></span></li> </ol> <span>This is a monster effect negate, a targeted card destruction and two 3k ATK beaters on the field off a single card. It's not game breaking but it's actual modern Yu-Gi-Oh. In a Dream Mirror deck. Incredible.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>What else?</span>  <span>This is the combo off a single card. But if you open with a Dream Mirror monster besides Mara you can also use Sprite's other effect to summon Mara who will then summon the Dream Mirror monster from hand. Friend could then Special Summon another one from the GY. White Knight would equal another pop during your opponent's turn. If you open Hypnagogia or Chaos you can search the other to have both Field Spells live making your Dream Mirrors actually gain you advantage, too. Having Joy on the field also means that you can change from Tormentor into Erlking for another pop if you tribute another Dream Mirror monster. <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror Oneiromancy"">Dream Mirror Oneiromancy</a></span> is another sweet pick-up off of Sprite if you open Chaos. It's a Spell/Trap or Special Summon negate. If you open with <span><a data-name=""Destiny Fusion"">Destiny Fusion</a></span> you can end on <span><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a></span> to make Apollousa during your opponent's turn. Depending on how you opened with you Dream Mirrors you might even be able to go into <span><a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World.</a></span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>What's next?</span>  <span>I dunno. I'm sure many cards in this deck will still change. Heretic completely changes how the deck plays (Not including <span><a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a></span> in Dream Mirror used to label <em>you</em> a heretic). Ratios need to be figured out. Maybe some names will be cut completely. There a few more Dream Mirror cards I haven't even included in the deck. This is but a first step in the right direction, a peek of what's to come. Maybe you wanna keep the ED simple and play Prosperity or Extravagance. Maybe you wanna lean into a r10nk OTK or play only Neiroy and Ikelos and play a bunch of handtraps. I don't know. And I love that I don't. This is gonna be interesting.</span>  <span>So here you go: I welcome you to the world of Dream Mirror.</span>"

(note: if you draw Forgotten Ruin, it's okay. It's still an ""Umi"" card but you don't benefit from that card for synchro and xyz summon. Its effect is the same with Sea Stealth Attack but SSA is much better because it protects the backrow against spell/trap destruction cards.)</span></li>  	<li><span>Set the other monster you drew to activate Penguin Champ's effect in which it summons itself to the field and you have an option to reduce its level. After it was special summon, activate Penguin Champ's effect of flipping the monster you set face-up. (note: If your set monster is <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Puny Penguin&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Puny Penguin</strong></a>, you have an option to not adjust its level using Magellanica to summon <strong><a data-name=""Penguin Brave"">Penguin Brave</a></strong> or adjust its level by 2 to summon <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;White Aura Whale&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>White Aura Whale</strong></a>.)</span></li>  	<li><span>During your opponent's turn, if he/she activates <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Twin Twister&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Twin Twister</strong></a> or <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Lightning Storm&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Lightning Storm</strong></a>, activate SSA's effect to temporarily banish your synchro monster and protect your backrow. You also take no damage from direct attacks because of Tornado Wall. After that, your synchro monster returns to the field during the End Phase of your opponent's turn. You can also use SSA to save your monsters from card effects.</span></li>  	<li><span>During your 2nd turn, once your synchro monster is on the field, you can attack twice if your synchro monster is WAW or attack once using <strong>Penguin Brave</strong>. (note: 1) If you draw <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Penguin Sword&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Penguin Sword</strong></a> and the monster set by your P. Brave's effect was <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Nopenguin&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Nopenguin</strong></a>, flip <strong>Nopenguin</strong> before <strong>Penguin Brave</strong> attacks so that it would trigger <strong>Nopenguins</strong> effect that every time a penguin monster activate its effect of returning a card on hand, instead of going to the opponent's hand, it is remove from play. 2) If you draw <strong><a data-name=""Glacial Beast Polar Penguin"">Glacial Beast Polar Penguin</a></strong> this turn and <strong>Penguin Brave</strong> which you summon on your first turn set a monster on the field, flip the set monster to synchro summon either WAW or <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Graydle Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Graydle Dragon</strong></a>.)</span></li>  	<li><span>The main deck have a lot of protection traps like Solemns, Aegis and Ice Dragon's Prison. (note: if your opponent uses Dragoon, bait him first by using any card effect so that he/she will use its once per turn negation effect then if you have a set <strong><a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a></strong>, activate it to banish 2 of his/her monsters including his/her Dragoon. If he/she is relying on the Predaplant Verte Anaconda to summon Dragoon, just negate its summoning or activation using Solemns.)</span> <ul>  	<li><span><strong><em>Update 10/10/21</em></strong>: To stop your opponent from summoning any OP cards like Dragoon, Zeus or Galaxy-Eyes Dragons, you need to have SSA, Tornado Wall and Magellanica/Forgotten Ruin face-up on the field and summon Barrier Statue of the Torrent. This stops your opponent from special summoning any OP monsters. If you're unlucky and your opponent summoned an OP monster, you can special summon 1 <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</strong></a> on your opponent's field by tributing their OP monster.</span></li>  	<li><span>To lock them out from special summoning any non-WATER attribute monster, normal summon <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Barrier Statue of the Torrent&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Barrier Statue of the Torrent</strong></a> then tribute the OP monster your opponent have to special summon Gameciel. Every time your opponent attacks using Gameciel, you can use SSA's effect to temporarily banish your Barrier. You're opponent will not attack because of Tornado Wall because even your opponent attacks, you take no battle damage. Gameciel is also good if somehow your opponent uses Jinzo</span></li>  	<li><span>I removed 2 Guard Penguins and replaced it with 2 Twin Twisters from the side deck in case your opponent uses Skill Drain, Royal Decree and other negate and limiting cards.</span></li>  	<li><span>I removed 1 <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Solemn Strike&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Solemn Strike</strong></a> from the main deck and replaced it with 1 <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Solemn Judgment&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Solemn Judgment</strong></a> to negate decks using Imperial Order.</span></li>  	<li><span><em><strong>Update 11/06/2021: </strong></em>I replaced 2 <strong>Spear Cretin</strong> and 1 <strong>Morphing Jar #2</strong> with 2 <strong>Penguin Sword</strong> and 1 <strong>Magellanica</strong> in the side deck while the two latter cards from the main deck is replaced with 2 Aquaactress continuous spell cards: <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Aquarium Stage&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Aquarium Stage</strong></a> which makes all WATER monsters indestructible by battle, and <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Aquarium Set&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Aquarium Set</strong></a> which increase the attack of all WATER monsters by 300. Also, either of the 2 Aquaactress spell cards are destroyed, you can special summon 1 Aqua monster from the GY to the field.

Get this into your hand ASAP.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Gravitino"">S-Force Gravitino</a> ; Great on-field effect and searches any S-Force card.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Pla-tina"">S-Force Pla-tina</a> ; Pla-tina summoning a banished Gravitino is your main turn 1 combo.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Edge Razor"">S-Force Edge Razor</a> ; Situationally useful field effect (Tri-Brigade Revolt...). Also helps with less than ideal opening hands where you have too many higher level S-Forces in hand. This is your main good way of getting enough materials for Justify... but is unfortunately Cyberse so Justify's unavailable with this under TCBOO.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Orrafist"">S-Force Orrafist</a> ; An extra piece of interaction that might be useful. Usually for if/when Chiyomaru resolves on my opponent's turn. Same Cyberse problem as above.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Dog Tag"">S-Force Dog Tag</a> ; Helps set up another aligning column. Mainly a Gravitino target for when you already have Chase in hand.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Chase"">S-Force Chase</a> ; Your main piece of interaction. This is usually what you search with Gravitino.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Nemeses Flag"">Nemeses Flag</a> ; Extra material to help summon Justify when you need it - or Eschatos. Return effect is also very useful for more drawn out games (acts a third Platina)</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Archnemeses Eschatos"">Archnemeses Eschatos</a> ; Your main followup play - board wipe + lockdown against some decks.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Justify"">S-Force Justify</a> ; Your other followup option. A monster negate and very good at cleaning boards.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dimensional Fissure"">Dimensional Fissure</a> ; Gets monsters banished for Pla-tina and Flag. Possibly annoying your opponent is a nice bonus :)</li>  	<li><a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> ; Strong floodgate card. You can play under this pretty much unhindered since all your monsters are different types (except Orrafist/Razor/Justify T_T)</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> ; Another strong floodgate.</li>  	<li>The Extra Deck ; General utility cards and accesscode/topologics for finishers. If TCBOO is on the field and you need to summon a card that's already on the field - <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and <a data-name=""Geonator Transverser"">Geonator Transverser</a> could be good options that solve other problems too. Other than that - there's Dogmatika Maximus hate, Cyber Dragon hate and <a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a> targets for when your opponent is too eager to destroy your backrow.</li> </ul> <strong>The Strategy.</strong> <ol>  	<li>You want to go first. The ideal opening hand has Chiyomaru and Gravitino. Summon Chiyomaru -&gt; Banish Gravitino -&gt; Summon Platina -&gt; Revive Gravitino -&gt; Search Chase.</li>  	<li>If you Chiyomaru, Gravitino and Platina in hand: You can summon Edge Razor from Chiyomaru to summon Platina from hand instead. This gives you one more monster, one more Chase bounce, one more field column effect.</li>  	<li>If you have the above combos and a Chase already in hand, you usually search Bridgehead or Dog Tag depending on whether or not Bridgehead is already activated. Dog Tag gives an extra column aligner/body for Chase bounce. Bridgehead could search Dog Tag or be used next turn if already activated this turn for followup.</li>  	<li>When everything goes wrong and Chiyomaru gets negated: Try to use Chiyomaru on your opponent's turn to either align Gravitino with an important monster to break their combo or summon Orrafist to maybe destroy 1 monster.</li>  	<li>If you manage to survive your opponent's turn: Justify or Eschatos might swing the game back in your favour. Justify requiring exactly 3 materials can be difficult - usually a mix of Edge Razor, Platina, Flag are needed.

Running an interaction suite which is better defensively, and fewer floodgates, and well as less confliction with D. Shifter.  So, I'm on all 6 pots. Flunders doesn't really special summon, doesn't use the extra deck as a result, and only draws a few cards. You're also highly reliant on seeing Robina or Map + Flunder. Digging deeper into the deck just improves consistency a lot. I think you should be running at least 5 of these, they don't even conflict. I'd avoid adding Extravagence into the mix, and I think it is worse than Prosperity in this deck, because you need to see such specific starter cards to get your game on. I'm trying 1 Gold Sarc, which helps you chain block and subs in for the field spell in some but not all of your combos. Then Terraforming and all 3 of the field spell. This version is built around being able to play an Earthbound Immortal card, so you need the field spell, and it also creates a bunch of two card combos, so I think it is actually a fine consistency card in its own right. Unknown Wind is actually a grind game card. Being able to tribute an opponent's cards, including spells and traps, is pretty huge, and so is the ability to put 2 random Flunders back into your deck to draw 2.  For Flunder monsters, the package is getting larger. 3 Robina is obligatory, it is 1 card combo. 3 Eaglen makes a lot of sense, since this way we are running 8 Flunder names for Map and Gold Sarc to start your plays, and Eaglen is the second to best Flunder. 1 of each Toccan and Strich. Both are needed for the Rasca combo that hand loops the opponent for 3, one represents some extra disruption, the other drastically improves your grind game. We also run 1 of the trap. The trap is bomb, but you search it with the combo and reset it with either Raiza or Toccan, so you can recycle a single copy of the trap turn after turn with Razia and Rasca.  For boss monsters, Empen is a decent flood gate and our main beat stick, and also searches out cards, usually the field spell or the trap. Raiza is a great piece of disruption that has the valuable upside of resetting cards from your GY to the top of your deck. Rasca hand loops opponents, usually for 2 on your turn 2 or occasionally for 3 on the opponent's turn 1 going first, and also recycles the Raiza by shuffling it back into the deck for later use.  5 floodgates are good enough, to avoid them conflicting too much. These are cards that can just randomly win you games when your combo gets disrupted effectively. Lose 1 Turn is pretty amazing, a 1 turn Skill Drain for Special Summoned monster which our deck doesn't make anyways that can buy you a lot of time. I cut Skill Drain, it conflicts with the deck's gameplan too much to be truly effective, you never wanted to flip it up until you were losing anyways. Imperial Order, on the other hand, is the tits, for sure makes the cut. Macro Cosmos and Dimensional Fissure can conflict a little bit, but will generally hit opposing cards much higher and are mostly free, and hit other decks really hard. Dimension Shifter is the other 3 copies of this style effect, on a hand trap. You can reset it with Raiza, so it is basically Macro Cosmos if you see it. Book of Moon is already a great offensive card, but in this deck is also doubles as a defensive card, since you can chain block with banished Flunders to screw Ash and book your Eaglen to protect from Imperm and Veiler, and you don't really lose to other common hand traps. It is also run because it doesn't conflict with D Shifter. Imperm same shit different pile, weird that it is worse than Book of Moon in this deck but there it is.  Extra Deck is a Zeus package and then Prom Thrush. You shouldn't often need to go into the extra deck, but being able to make Zeus instead of your normal summons will sometimes come up so you may as well run it. The rest doesn't matter, Ultimate Falcon is a mascot, the Knightmares into Accesscode is an option for cleaning up and Shuraig is for the Dogmatika matchup, free search if they're bad and hit your extra deck.  <strong>Combos</strong>  <strong>Robina Combo</strong>  Normal Robina  Robina effect, add Eaglen, summon Eaglen  Eaglen effect, add Empen tribute summon Empen  Robina and/or Eaglen's effects chain block Empen. Add them to the hand.  Empen effect, add City of Dreams to your hand.  Now on your opponents turn you can continue the combo with City of Dreams, either making Raiza or Barrier Statue. Raiza can even pick up the Trap if it is banished. If you already have the Eaglen you can add the Barrier Statue and summon it out with the Empen on your turn. Same if you just see the Barrier Statue. If you see Raiza or the Empen you can use the second Empen to search the continuous spell before tributing it to the Raiza. On a good turn you can get the Barrier statue and a search / reset of the trap while removing 2 cards off of the Raiza. 3 if you already have the continuous spell.  Cut Called. It's a great card, but too redundant with the other banishing effects. In its place I'm running 1 Gold Sarc, which is effectively the Field Spell for most of your combos and lets you chain block.  <strong>Robina + Toccan combo</strong>  This one can also be done with Robina + Map, but I'm going to go through this one because this is the backwards way into the Earthbound Immortal card.  Normal Robina  Robina effect, add Eaglen, summon Eaglen  Eaglen effect, add Empen, tribute summon Empen  Empen cl1, Robina cl2, Eaglen cl3 recover Robina, add Map (DON'T SUMMON)  Play Map. Map effect, banish the trap, summon Toccan, grab the trap. Ending your turn on Empen + Toccan.  On your opponent's main phase, activate the trap.  Summon Robina, which grabs Strich, summons Strich which banishes a card (your own trap, for example) and summons Eaglen, which adds Earthbound Immortal. Earthbound Immortal tributes over Robina and Eaglen, adding them back to the hand while chainblocking its effect, shuffling itself and the lesser Flunders back into the deck to make your opponent randomly discard 3 cards. You also still have Empen. You more commonly see this play through map + Robina, which is mostly similar but you can use Toccan to loop the trap.  I like this version of the deck because it has so many ways to grind, with Rosca shuffling your monsters back into the deck, Toccan and Raiza resetting the trap for additional use, with the Raiza combo you can search out the spell to grind with Apex Avian, and you can afford to run high-powered floodgates to stall your opponent out even if your combos are interrupted. This also makes it a non-linear deck, in that the same 2 cards can result in multiple different end boards, Empen + 1 of your other plans. The Rosca combo is nice because it doesn't really incorporate any bricks - you have to play Toccan, Strich, and Map if you go for this combo, but most lists are playing these cards anyways, and the only real ""brick"" is the Rosca itself, and what drew me to the Rosca was that I wanted to run 1 more boss monster for the grind anyways. In some sophisticated board states Rosca even lets you reset the Raiza to use it again, the card is actually reasonably in the grind, plus I think on average if you have the choice of setting up Barrier Statue, searching a second time with Empen before hitting an opponent with Raiza, or hand looping them for 3, the hand loop option is probably the best of these. This is especially true if you have the continuous spell or search it because you have the trap, enabling you to make Rosca into a 3100 ATK beatstick that can attack directly while tributing an opponent's monsters and hand looping them for 3.  I think that the loop that you should usually be doing with Rasca isn't to hand loop them for 3 on their turn on the first turn cycles. I think you should be aiming the end on Empen + Barrier Statue, using Raiza to shut down their normal summon while resetting a card, then using Rasca to hand loop them for 2 on their turn to reset the Raiza. Used properly this strategy can theoretically grind for as many turns as your opponent has 2 cards in their hand, and it eats up their resources while resetting theirs. But you might be inclined, depending on the matchup, to favour Rasca opens if pure raw cards are a problem. There will be other matchups, usually Trap based decks, where Raiza plays are necessary anyway, so being able to use one copy of Raiza multiple times is pretty appealing.  &nbsp;  Cheat sheet for combos  Robina =  Empen + trap (Represents Raiza for disruption, Statue for a floodgate, or Apex Avian for a negate)  Robina + Map, OR Eaglen + Map, OR Toccan + Map, OR Robina + Eaglen, OR Robina + Toccan =  Empen + trap into hand loop  Robina + Eaglen, OR Robina + Map, OR Eaglen + Map, OR Robina + Barrier Statue =  Empen + Barrier statue + Trap  Robina + Raiza, OR Robina + Empen = Empen + Trap into Empen search into Raiza  &nbsp;  Ways to grind  Return Apex Avian into the hand, and use the continuous spell to put back whatever you need to search to get your game going while drawing cards.  Summ0n Barrier Statue, Raiza their normal summon to reset the trap, use Wiraqocha Rasca to rinse and repeat while hand looping them.  Use Toccan to loop back the trap and your Empens to always have a summon and a monster  Use Raiza to loop back D. Shifter to always have D. Shifter, use Toccan to loop back the trap  Just go through your bosses one by one as they are answered.  That's before we get to the games you auto-win with your floodgates."

First of all, i i'll explain Uka effects: the first is a passive burn of 300 that activate each time your enemy normal or special summon, which is not once per turn and can do tons of damage against decks like Code Talker and virtual world, but we all know what barrier statue does, so no combo for your opponent. the second effect is that it can special summon itself (from your hand) when a monster is special summoned from either main deck. The third and most important effect is that when Uka is normal/special summoned you can target a opponent monster and special summon from the deck a monster with the same atribute and atk equals to def, that will likely be a Barrier Statue.  Ok now you understand how the deck master work.  There's no consistent combo to summon some barrier statue in the first turn so i gonna explain what each archtype does.  Kaijus are the target for Uka.  Dogmatika can help you stall time and make a good Synergy too because Ecclesia Atk and Def are equal.  Barrier statue are just chilling  Most of the gizmeks is to search Uka but Orochi can also be used for XYZ summon.  If you got Ecclesia or Nadir Servant+ Interrupted Kaiju Slumber + Uka + in hand, you can:  Normal summon Ecclesia ~Ecclesia adds dogmatika Punishment ~activate Kaiju Slumber and summon two kaijus in each field(summon Gameciel in the enemy side) ~activate Uka second effect and summon it from your hand ~activate Uka third effect and target the kaiju to special summon a barrier statue ~set Dogmatika Punishment and end the turn.  You will can summon and search Uka in many different ways and there's alot of cards to stall so you won't gonna lose so fast.  The side deck have some cards i wanted to put but that are better in the side deck.  Any suggestions are welcome.  &nbsp;"

Need some advice to finish building it and making it more reliable.,"<h2><span>Short Summary</span></h2> <span>The deck is using mostly the Phantom Kight part of the engine for it's plays. I've added three Burinig Abyss main deck mosters for the Tour Guide, into Graff, into Cherubini combo: this makes you special summon Cir from the deck and then recycle Cherubini from the GY after the Bardiche summon. Your first objective is to summon Bardiche and if you have the material to turbo out one of the XYZ dragons depending on your needs. You can turbo them out, mainly, via two combos: the Rank-Up-Force magic card, or summoning two level 4 monsters (one is free using Rusty Bardiche's effect) and going into Raider's Knight.</span>  <span>The side deck revolves into stopping combos, clearing control decks board and as a last chance to trying and turbo out the infamous Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon.</span> <h2><span>Why am I uploading it?</span></h2> <span>Simply I need some advice on how to make it more reliable. Right now i can feel that the deck is really consistent and has really not that much possible bricks, but also I know that needs something more to be really reliable and consistent. I hope to recive some advice to help me to finish building this really fun deck. Updated decklist: </span>"

It contains a little Charmer engine, to facilitate followup after you set up your first turn board and to increase the consistency of the deck.  <span><strong>Windwitches</strong></span>  I don't have too much to say about the Windwitches. They have a one card combo, ending on an indestructible <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a>.  Except for <a data-name=""Windwitch - Ice Bell"">Windwitch - Ice Bell</a>, that enables said combo, <a data-name=""Windwitch - Glass Bell"">Windwitch - Glass Bell</a> has a important role in this build, duo to its 1500 def and its ability to search for any Windwitch monster.  <span><strong>Charmer engine</strong></span>  The engine is build out of three cards: <a data-name=""Wynn the Wind Channeler"">Wynn the Wind Channeler</a>, <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a> and <a data-name=""Possessed Partnerships"">Possessed Partnerships</a>.  <a data-name=""Wynn the Wind Channeler"">Wynn the Wind Channeler</a> is a card played in many wind-based decks, thanks to its searching ability. It searches Windwitch - Ice Bell for the cost of discarding itself and another wind monster. It is also treated as a Charmer card, so it is searchable of off Spirit Charmers.  <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a> is the heart of the engine. It effectively increases your ability to search for Windwitch - Ice Bell and on top of that sets up a play for turn three, by setting Possessed Partnerships to the field.  <a data-name=""Possessed Partnerships"">Possessed Partnerships</a> allows you to special Windwitch - Glass Bell from grave. It is a searchable Back to the Front so to say. Special summoning Windwitch - Glass Bell during your opponent's end phase allows for Accescode plays or for level 8 and level 7 synchro plays during your turn, without being locked into wind monsters.  &nbsp;  The rest of the deck are just staples like crossout which help you to play through handraps or negate the activation of cards like Dark Ruler No More.  &nbsp;  I like the deck for all the tiny interactions between both the Chamers and the Witches.

The tournament was small and there weren’t a lot of people but I feel very proud of myself regardless.  Round one: mathmechs vs Dlink  So I matched into a Dlink player  Game one his entire opening was just HTs, I closed the game after negating a striker dragon and ending his turn  Game two I got clapped because I ran out of resources  Game three, went into time, I had much more lp so I got the W  Round two: mathmechs vs (maybe dogma?) invoked  Game one my opponent opts first and ns alister “search invo- “ I dropped my effect veiler so he just went into secure guardna pass, some shenanigans later he eventually got his turn again, draws, summons albaz fuses away my poor magma and gets titankind, attacks a clock spartoi and then I showed him his mistake, bullionblade was equipped and I milled devision and overpowered the titankind, next turn I set up and attack for game.  Game two, He opts first again, ns alister, I just drop another effect veiler, lol. My turn I do shenanigans but was hit by about 3 handtraps and decided to land on linkuriboh and magma. Ns albaz? What if… second effect veiler? I swear it alway gets into my hand, I final sigmaed him for game  Round 3: mathmechs vs Tri-Brigade  Game one I run into a billion handtraps but eventually get game when I realized he didn’t have summon to use  Game two a rescue cat took an effect veiler and then I attack for game with final sigma, it was an interesting game to say the least  But yeah, that was the tournament for me, I went 3-0 and got first place with mathmechs.  And that bought a question to mind for me: am I just that godly?"

Most of the Ghostrick traps are played at 1 copy mainly for the reason they will brick your hands and are only strong when you have established, however it shouldn't be an issue because almost all the xyz monsters for the Ghostrick archtype can get a Ghostrick card back when they are sent to the graveyard.  You can run mystic mine as a very strong option to control the board and allow you to set up your plays but it was not included in this deck list because I don't enjoy playing the card.  The side deck here is just to reflect cards that can be added instead of other cards in the main deck as they are all strong options."

You can do this combo in the first turn but you would need to have at least one monster to active Kaiju Slumber then proceed like normal. Normally you will not be able to use this in the first or second turn since kaiju Slumber is unsearchable, so the deck has a control layer that together with the kaijus helps to stall time.  The new card New Clear World is very good and indeed, can do a good par with Uka but not as good like Kaiju Slumber, because to use Clear Wolrd you would need at least 4 specific cards. Would be: Summon a kaiju using the enemy monster ~summon any monster in your field ~activate New World to bring any monster from the deck ~Special summon Uka ~with Uka summon a barrier statue. You not only can't do this in the fist turn but also have to do all of this while counting in not being negated and having a perfect hand, unlikely to ever happen. But ngl that new spell will be at 3 in many self-destructive decks and in these that uses alot of diferent types as Prank kids or Invoked.  In my last deck i explains Uka effects but feel free to read the card if you still don't know its potential.  Took off Dogmatika because i wanted to see how would the deck perform in 40 cards and discovered that is better this way.  I'll probably not update this deck anymore unless i found some broken shit since i think the deck is as it is now.  Go second.  &nbsp;  Almost forget! If you are against a water deck you lose! Since going against water means using the wind statue and giving to you opponent Gadarla that you can't beat :), and because you can't rely upon Luna which have only two copies. But if you are not playing singles you can in the second duel exchange Gameciel and water statue for Dogoran and a fire statue.  &nbsp;  Sorry for any grammar mistakes.  Any suggestions are welcome.

This deck is just for fun ONLY but I tried using this against Galaxy-Eyes OTK, True Light Blue-Eyes, and Drytron-Dragoon and somehow I won. Just lucky to have the right cards at the right time.  The main play of this deck is to have Final Countdown during the first draw and try to survive upto the 20th turn to win the duel. Also, this deck follows the current ban list so there's no Self-Destruct Button and Last Turn but you can modify it if you want to add those two in this deck. Lastly, you can modify it to have monster traps like Metal Reflect Slime, The First Monarch, and the Paleozoic archetype."

The deck can also play like normal HERO if the more gimmicky game plan fails.  I think this is a neat deck, not good per say, but neat."

The one card combo: Normal summon Deskbot 003 ~003 special summon a Deskbot 001 ~using these two link summon Crystron ~Crystron special summon another 001 ~link summon Auroradon ~Auroradon will summon his tokens ~after the token been summoned Chain the two Deskbot 001 effects and special summon them ~using one of the 001 and a token Syncro summon a Cupid Pitch and dont forget to rise its level ~syncro summon Borreload Savage Dragon usin Cupid Pitch plus one token ~Cupid effect will activate and add Plasma from your deck ~now activate Auroradon effect that tribute 2 to special summon Coltwing from the deck ~Coltwing summon more 2 tokens and deskbot 001 summon itself again ~using 001 and a token summon Herald of the Arc Light in defense position ~tribute 3 phantom beast to special summon Plasma from your hand. The final board shall have 2 negates and 1 skill drain in monster form (Plasma).  If you use the field spell before starting your combo, in the end you'll have 7-8 counter, so you dont have to worry in hindering your own negates.  Gizmeks have facility to special summon, so even if you dont get Deskbot 003 is still possible to combo.  One Darkruler no More or Forbidden droplet can make your board useless so i added Solemn Judgment to negate these spells.  When using pot of prosperity NEVER banish a combo piece.

Use the diverse array of water attribute cards in this deck to cool down your hard hitting Cyberse Link monsters!,"Altered Marincess deck with a full Link card extra deck. Based on mixing my favorite attribute (Water), with my favorite card type (Link), as well as my favorite species (Cyberse) . I was lucky the Marincess archetype existed, as without it these 3 concepts would not gel smoothly at all. The strategy for this deck is simple, Marincess Marbled Rock is your ace monster, use either her or Marincess Great Bubble Reef and ramp their power using the effect monsters in the deck such as Marincess Star Fish! Most of your high in monsters have solid defense provided from the trap cards as well as some of the other Link Marincess girls providing a nice shield from card effects and battle damage. You may be wondering about Relinquished Anima, and to be honest, I just like him :) use the DeepSea MacroTrema to get him on the field and be mean! Any other cards that may seem out of place are used to either ramp your more efficient cards, or are used in a specific way to effect combat specific situations (Like ShootingCode Talker). All in all this deck was made for me to have fun with! I hope you can appreciate this deck as much as I do!"

It gains ATK equal to the positive difference of LP between you and your opponent when <em>The Sanctuary in the Sky</em> is on the field  <em>Nova Summoner</em> and <em>The Agent of Mystery - Earth </em>(tuner of the deck) are bodies and searchers for <em>The Agent of Force - Mars</em>  <em>Zeradias, Herald of Heaven</em> is a good level 4 Fairy monster and a searcher for<em> The Sanctuary in the Sky</em>  The 2 <em>Performapal Kuribohble</em> and the 1 <em>Checksum Dragon</em> works as the three battle faders with the advantage of making you gain LP  <em>The Agent of Life - Neptune</em> and <em>Master Hyperion</em> are plan B. The first allowing you to special summon Mars from graveyard if necessary and the latter being an easily summonable beatstick with a destruction effect  <em>Ghost sister</em> <em>&amp; spooky dogwood</em> and <em>Child's play</em> are the two best LP gain card under normal playing conditions (which isnt the case of <em>Soul Absorption</em>)  <em>The Sanctuary of Parsath</em> works as a clone of <em>The Sanctuary in the Sky</em> to increase the probability of Mars having his attack boost  <em>Gingebread House</em> is a tech card that allows you to get rid of your opponent's monsters that have more than 2500ATK while gaining 500LP for each monster destroyed. Its a bit slow and risky, so it has been replaced by a 2nd <em>Mystic Mine</em> to stall if you dont have<em> The Sanctuary in the Sky</em>  <em>Divine Punishment</em> is a type specific <strong>solemn</strong> to save your monsters  <em>Dried Winds</em> is a continuous trap that allows you to destroy a monster every time you gain LP  <em>Rainbow life</em> is the best LP gain trap card, which can be activated in any players turn, can be chained to its destruction, and is effective the whole turn its activated to convert monsters attacks into LP gains  &nbsp;  Extra deck:  <em>Dispatchparazzi</em> is a Link 2 that allows you to redirect all attack to it, thus saving a monster of choice, while gaining half of the attacking monster's ATK as LPs. <em>Sweet Majoram</em> is a <em>Dried Winds</em> searcher as well as a <em>Dried Winds</em> on legs, allowing you to destroy a monster every turn in which you gain LP. <em>Ancient Sacred Wyvern</em> is the synchro version of Mars, non-dependant on a field spell, with a 2100 base attack that can be revived by paying 1000LP.<em> Colossal Fighter</em> works in a loop with <em>Rainbow life</em> to make you gain any amount of LP you want if it attacks a monster with higher ATK than itself as it revives at will. <em>Celestial Knightlord Parsarth</em> is a link 3 that can search every card with<em> ""The Sanctuary in the Sky""</em> in its text."

The field spell is kinda nuts against the right deck. Headhunt is a neat piece of interuption searchable off of griffon. Machina is just a great all around boss monster, although I struggle to make it with more than three materials.  For the older cards of note, zero king is insane, azathot is banned for a reason and this is just an in theme version of that card. Swirl slime is the heart and soul of this deck, if you don't draw this card, you basically can't access any lines from what I've tested. Lamia is jet synchron for the deck.  I've opted for a more adaptable and flexible version of the deck. Some opt for a more all in combo approach for the deck, I suck at the combos for this deck anyhow, so the simpler combos makes it a bit easier.  The main end boards mostly include a level eight synchro and halq to go into baroness on the next turn, big gungis is a decent end board card. Machina is good if it goes off, and big caesar is a summon negate.  The side deck is tech options.  I would like to make a full on guide on the deck, but I suck at it any help and advice would be nice, the deck is very much a WIP  &nbsp;"

Step 2: You must special summon <a data-name=""Allvain the Essence of Vanity"">Allvain the Essence of Vanity</a> and normal summon a monster. Step 2: Link summon <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> and activate its effect. Step 3: Summon <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> from deck using Halqifibrax effect. Step 4: Make <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Aurorado"">Mecha Phantom Beast Aurorado</a>n +3 tokens and Summon Deskbot 001 using it's effect. Step 4: Synchro summon <a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a> using 2 tokens and Deskbot 001. With Shooting riser's effect you must send a level 2 monster to the grave for the next step of the combo. (Ex: <a data-name=""PSY-framegear Gamma"">PSY-framegear Gamma</a>). Step 5: Synchro Summon <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> and PROFIT. The combo can continue in many paths from here but for the sake of efficiency I will end it here.  Notes: Use <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> only after you exhausted all your other combo options, because it locks you out of summoning anything but Fusions. When <a data-name=""Branded in Red"">Branded in Red</a> is used in conjunction with <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a> it is a devastating combo."

So the play is:  Danger engine to mill unwanted hands, the new myutant support FIXES FOLLOW UP PLAYS, so that means no more zombies! We can use dogmatika engine for extra control and interruption! myutants rely on the main deck monster and the extra deck monster only on the opponents turn, so, punishment doesnt realy hurt the deck if you use it to interupt a important play from your opponent! Side deck is optional but, i do recomend having TTT in the deck to help against heavy hand traps decks you might encounter or even dragoon!  If you already know myutant well i recomend this deck to further complicate the deck and make it more stronger, if you are new to myutant, i HIGHLY recomend you play my danger zombie version to learn myutant combo decks, since i dont build the pure versions usually!  Mutator is the bread and butter of the deck, every time i got my normal summon negated, mutator was there to save the day! so USE IT TO EXTEND OR BAIT."

Because having much more consistent access to a free special summon just for not having monsters. Another major thing of note: This is not a Dark Requiem build, nor is it a kali yuga build. Rather an Apollousa and I:P Masquerena build. Main end board is Bardiche, Apollousa with 3 counters, I:P and 1-2 fog blades. Run out of negates on Apollousa? Make a unicorn! Apollousa got kaiju'd?

It's a fun deck that I am happy to say that I have finished building.  I've wanted to play Adamancipators since Secret Slayers, but as a budget-ish player, I really couldn't afford the deck but the 2021 Mega-Tins have really helped a lot with the building of this deck, and this list was really inspired by the list that Farfa used in his sub-a-thon in his match vs Mystic Mine Fossils ( Yes, the one he got 2-0'd by XD ) and then I went around my local game shops and anime stores to see if anyone had the titular rocks, and thankfully they did. I'm really hyped to play this deck and hopefully I can do pretty well with this deck. If y'all have any suggestions for the deck, feel free to comment it, and I am down to try out the suggestions that y'all put. Thx.  -Update-  I got roasted by Farfa over the past weekend and I've got to say that it was hilarious. I also pulled a <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - &lt;a data-name=&quot;Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer&quot;&gt;Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;"">Destiny HERO - </a><a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> after 1 and 1/2 booster boxes. I've been play testing it, and I personally feel like it is working better but it might be a short term effect befire my ratio-ing takes a noticable affect, so I will be tinkering with the build a lot more. If you can play Dragoon, I would say play it over DPE.  -Update - 2022 Edition-  Holy Moly has this deck gone some good, and I've got new goodies for the deck, so let's see where it will take us.  -Update - January Banlist-  rip IO and a Fusion Destiny &#x1f62d;"

The goal is either to combo out one of the Red Dragon Archfiend monsters turn one and wipe your opponent's board or to play a slower control style continuously bringing back Summoned Skull until your opponent has run out of options. This deck is NOT meant for the meta but is fun to play against other nostalgic or casual decks.

Anyways, i tried my best to make metalfoes can go against MORE decks, thats why i ain't using Super Polymerization because even if it make a good Synergy it's not good enough.  Just a combo idea:  Normal summon Rescue Rabbit ~Activate Rescue Rabbit and summon any normal monster ~link summon 2 link spiders using the normal monsters ~Verte Anaconda.  This can be done in various ways since it's a pendulum archtype.  The ideal first turn board (and the best i could think) is having a dragoon, Alkahest, 1 Fullmetalfoes Fusion and 1 ""Metalfoes"" monster. This combination gives you one negate and two ways to get cards out the field, so, three disruptions if you use in the right timing.  I just realized that maybe DPhoenix Enforcer can be even better then Dragoon in this deck because of his destructive effects, but now is too late to change!  I aim to do another metalfoes deck soon.  &nbsp;  GLHF"

The deck is basically a pile of cards that search Necrovalley, a pile of cards that make Dragoon, some Pots, some Traps, and 3 copies of Royal Tribute. The game plan is simple, you establish Necrovalley + Dragoon and hope that it is enough to deal with everything they've got, and maybe occasionally Royal Tribute them.  So, 3 Necrovalley and a Terraforming seems obligatory. Necrovalley is the whole point of this deck, and you really want to maximize naturally drawing this card over searching it, and Terraforming remains the best way to search it. 3 Gravekeeper's Commandant seems like overkill but I want to try it out at 3 before trimming it back - it is effectively more copies of Necrovalley, which could be redundant run in these numbers but helps ensure you actually see Necrovalley. Necrovalley Throne searches for Commandant to find you Necrovalley, but I like this card more because it also searches for Headman for access to Dragoon, meaning seeing this alongside Commandant makes Necrovalley + Dragoon boards. 1 Headman to enable this. We're on 3 Red-Eyes Fusion and 3 Red-Eyes Insight to search Red-Eyes Fusion, with the bricks these entail. These are for easy access to Dragoon, which protects Necrovalley and is hard to out and a source of pressure, all at the same time. This card is stupid. We have 3 Royal Tribute. These can be a defensive card if you already have Necrovalley, but are mostly an offensive card to just shut opponents down by destroying all of their starters. 3 Droplets, these should just be a staple in most deck lists this format, even though we run low monster count this card is still just incredible. 3 Pot of Extravagence. You need card advantage in this deck, and you need to eat up those Ash Blossoms, as not a lot else stops your deck, but Ash really does hit both sides of the trick. 1 Called By the Grave, another way to eat up those Ashes, I'd make space for 3 if I could. 3 Torrential Tribute with 1 Fury to search it. This card doesn't pop Dragoon and combined with Solemn Strike will eat up whole combo boards, and is really powerful, so even though the spell telegraphs it I thought 4 in the main was a good idea. Lastly, I'm on the Solemn brigade, 3 Judgment and 3 Strike. Strike is really good alongside Dragoon or Torrential Tribute, and is just generically good going first or going second. I wanted some Judgment in the 55 for games 2 and 3 when the disruption comes in, but I'd prefer to main the card and side cards that are more impactful in specific matchups or circumstances. The card is amazing going first and still pretty good going second, and is a great generic answer to most sources of pressure an opponent can apply.  So, working through some probabilities, I discovered the deck has just under a 75% chance of making Dragoon and just over a 75% chance to make Necrovalley. This is pretty good all things considered, but it did change my attitude about Pot of Prosperity. You'll only get both on the field in about 50% of your games without it, but it improves your odds of making both greatly by standing in for either, digging 6 cards deeper into your deck. The maths started to get way above my head for just a children's card game, but you should see Necrovalley + Dragoon in over half of your games without Prosperity, and Prosperity should theoretically improve your odds of making both together, with 6 cards and several 2 card combos standing in for Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, and 9 cards total representing Necrovalley. The reason I'm off Terraforming is running the 1 Terraforming seems a little too redundant while not actually improving our final odds by that much, and Commandant represents part of a 2 card combo to make Necrovalley + Dragoon. The other adjustment is running copies of Needle Ceiling to represent more Torrentials without giving up the game.  Nope, I was wrong. Extravagence is better in this deck. You need raw cards for Dragoon and you're consistent enough in seeing Necrogoon before the Prosperity. In every test hand I saw it Extravagence was comparable or straight better. Extravagence is still a decent consistency boost in a deck with such high odds of seeing your players, and it plays well with traps and Dragoon."

It's hard finding 1 card engines with consistency cards, few bricks, and little conflicting with Necrovalley, but Toad is a card.  So, the list started with me thinking that Necrovalley is pretty good right now, we're in a format where two of the top decks are kind of in a league of their own, and Necrovalley is very disruptive to both of them, especially Drytron. It's also such an appealing engine to run, because you have so many copies of Necrovalley. Since it is good right now it has an edge over other field spell floodgates. However, Necrogoon is a little bit linear and relies a lot on Dragoon. Sure it usually puts up a Dragoon, but 1 negate + Necrovalley seems a little easy to out, provided people are prepared for a meta with Dragoon in it.  Dogmatika was the easy alternative engine to pair with it. Getting an interruption or three off of easy cards and searching backrow works well with the plan of Royal Tribute and traps, and there is no conflict with Necrovalley. The Fish part came in later in deckbuilding - I was basically looking for a 7 card engine, 3 starters 3 consistency cards and a brick, that could summon from the Extra Deck for Ecclesia, and worked under Necrovalley or at least could play around it being on the table. Invoked was the first thing I tested, but I found the engines conflicted too much to make Mechaba reliable. Destiny Hero would be appealing, save that Phoenix Enforcer can't revive itself under Necrovalley. I tried a few other small engines before remembering that Beautunaful Princess was a card and settled on the fish engine. It's actually pretty good, 1 card starter that gets you an omni-negate that pops with upside, and while it conflicts slightly it is really minor, and it was the perfect size, 3 consistency cards, 3 starters, and 1 brick. The brick is even not a brick sometimes.  The interruption suite has basically remained the same since inception, you need cards that don't conflict with Royal Tribute and are high impact."

You can also use tenyis instead of token for synchro but I prefer to use tenyis for support effect. This deck very solid and your main goal is to summon Cheng Ying, the Grand Swordsoul Duke and Chi Xiao, the Grand Swordsoul Swordmaster have a strong board (often deadly) - Here is a cool OTK combo to do if you have Tai A, the Swordsoul Swordmaster and Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda (and nothing on your board at that turn)  + Activate the ability of Vishuda to sp-summon it (special summon). Link summon Monk using Vishuda as material.  + Then normal summon Tai A then activate Tai A effect to summon a token by banishing Vishuda. Then synchro summon Chi Xiao. Then activate Chi Xiao when synchro summoned to add Long Yuan in to your hand (if you can/want to OTK) or add Sudden Shift as a control card (I gonna assume we added Long Yuan), also activate Tai A when send to GY (graveyard) effect to send Tenyi Spirit - Adhara to the GY  + Banish Adhara from the GY to add back Vishuda from the banished zone. Then activate Long Yuan effect, tribute Vishuda to summon Long Yuan and also summon the token. Then synchro summon Cheng Ying, then activate Long Yuan effect in the GY to deal 1200 damage to your opponent. <h4 class=""engine-dark-box""> Now you have a Monk, Chi Xiao and Cheng Ying on the board which normally have a total damage of 6900 damage meanwhile your opponent has 6800. ALSO DONT FORGET that you also have a vishuda in the GY which you can banished it and remove 1 of your opponent card from the field, which also activate Cheng Ying effect to banish 2 more cards (1 from your opponent field, 1 from their GY), WHICHHHHH increase the damage of Cheng Ying by another 300.</h4> <h4>You can go a step further if you can special summon 1 more monster (mostly by Ashuna or by Swordsoul Sacred Summit), you can link up to Shaman of the Tenyi using the Monk and the 1 normal monster you summoned, then activate Shaman, discard 1 card then bring back the Monk.

It actually provides in archetype interruption which is very new to a deck like D/D/D, it allows you to lock yourself up now with the fiend locks and the like and still build a semi solid board.  The griffon is a neato card, it comes with a free extension, a trade in effect to flush out your hand, and a search if summoned from the graveyard, the problem is getting it to your graveyard but it can search any D/D card in general which is good considering the trap that’ll be reviewed later, all three of these effects suffer from hard opt but you can definitely trigger multiple effects in a turn.  Patented is kinda a funny card, I get the idea and it looks like it’ll work but I haven’t taken it for testing just yet, on the bright side it does recycle when it goes bye so spell and trap removal will trigger it and you’ll likely be able to get it out again via recycling.  D/D/D headhunt is actually really good, you can steal stuff and make them D/D/D monsters! In the zoodiac matchup if you trigger it on your turn and steal a big stack you can make a ridiculous makina  makina is a once per chain interruption which is really good because it can keep on stealing things again and again and it allows you to get its effect 3 straight times if you manage resolve thomas pop a pend zone to summon a ddd (most likely requium) overlay into dark Armageddon, take the popped card as overlay, recycle a graveyard contract if possible, then solo overlay into makina."

A kingdom of sweets. An enigma to the people that visit this enchanted land. Ruled bya  monarch, the kingdom resembles a landscape made of various confections, with all the edibility that entails. The residents there are even strnagers, resembling plastic dolls or plush toys, thought inquiries into that are usually met with confusion.  The two princesses are the talk of the kingdom. the heiress known as <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess"">Puddingcess</a> lives a charmed life as she attends her royal duties, prepares to inherit the throne, and tries to keep her little sister out trouble. Recent gossip claims that she is enamored with ser <a data-name=""Madolche Chouxvalier"">Chouxvalier</a>, but he seems reluctant to confirm it. Among the nobility lie the royal staff, including the royal teacher <a data-name=""Madolche Teacher Glassouffle"">Glassouffle</a>, the clergywoman <a data-name=""Madolche Fresh Sistart"">Sistart</a> and the angel she is in communion with, <a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Anjelly</a>.  Visitors are often left charmed by the kingdom's delights, thought her political neighbors often suspect something amiss, as if there is a fey air around it. Interestingly, a young child with an expansive doll collection went missing a year before contact with the kingdom as established, and no records tell of the kingdom's existence before that point, furthermore the missing child bore an uncanny resemblance to <a data-name=""Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"">Queen Tiaramisu</a>...""  Well I haven't made a post in a while and I had some decks IRL to adapt to this site's decklist so I'd thought I'd rectify that for once. Be warned thought some aspects of this list are, puns aside, half-baked.  The gameplan of the scrumptious Madolche kingdom seems to emphasize Summoning (mainly from the deck) and their adorable princesses, the eldest of which being needed for certain cards in the archetype to get bonus effects and herself has an Xyz variant that serves as a beater and another way to pull from the deck. The last common ingredient is a reliance on continuous backrow cards. They are predisposed for going second but have tools to weather the storm should they have to go first (of course some of those tools are out of theme and not ones I can apply to the deck yet).  The main playmakers are <a data-name=""Madolche Magileine"">Madolche Magileine</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a> and <a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a>. Hooty and Angelly here both summon direclty from the deck, as does Petingcessoeur, but in her case that is meant to bring out her big sister, <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess"">Madolche Puddingcess</a> as the kid reduces the level of any monster she summons and otherwise messes up the Rank 4 plays with any other monster. Magileine OTOH is just a searcher, but one with no HOPT.  Another important card is <a data-name=""Madolche Messingelato"">Madolche Messingelato</a> who can fetch a needed spell card if he's special summoned. <a data-name=""Madolche Mewfeuille"">Madolche Mewfeuille</a> is another normal summon that can summon out another Madolche from your hand. Madolche Cruffsant meanwhile is card that bounces a Madolche to grant himself a level and 300 ATK, a little niche TBF but it is another way for Rank 4 plays and helping proc certain cards.  Moving onto the spells we have <a data-name=""Madolche Chateau"">Madolche Chateau</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Salon"">Madolche Salon</a> and <a data-name=""Madolche Ticket"">Madolche Ticket</a>, all of which are important to the strategy and play off of each other in interesting ways. Chateau is a field spell that brings every doll in the GY back to the deck to ensure certain effects are live and if any subsequent monsters left there are returned to the deck you have the option of bringing them to the hand instead (and it has a 500 ATK boost to Madolche monsters). This brings us to Ticket which can special summon or search monsters every time Madolche cards are returned to the hand or main deck. Last but not least is Salon, which gives us an extra normal summon (Notable because the archetype does have a few cards that plus on normal summon, two of whcih were already mentioned and of those two at least one isn't HOPT) and also helps to search backrow  &nbsp;  Moving onto the traps. <a data-name=""Madolche Lesson"">Madolche Lesson</a> is a simple 800 ATK boost, decent by the standards of such powerups but the effect itself is mediocre since the focus is away from the battle phase. still it can help close out games considering that Puddingcess's Xyz version can reach 3800 with this and Chateau active. <a data-name=""Madolche Nights"">Madolche Nights</a> serves as a monster negate and with Puddingcess herself out a way to remove a card by returning it to the deck. <a data-name=""Madolchepalooza"">Madolchepalooza</a> is...mostly there for fun, the effect to summon any amount of in theme monsters form your hand is nice but kinda wasteful economy wise given they will all return to the deck at the end and as a trap you can't use thus turn one. <a data-name=""Madolche Promenade"">Madolche Promenade</a> is the deck's best trap yet, negating a monster in exchange for bouncing one of your own, while also have an effect that lets you attach a Madolche monster to one of their xyz.  Onto the Extra deck, the off-theme ones were cobbled together from cards I have that weren't in another deck. ranging from the metaish such as <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crisadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crisadia Avramax</a>  to some small utility like <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and <a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>, to the less played such as <a data-name=""Evigishki Merrowgeist"">Evigishki Merrowgeist</a> and <a data-name=""Topologic Trisbaena"">Topologic Trisbaena</a>. Of course the majority of the ED is dedicated to copies of the 4 in theme monsters. Staring with the OG boss monster, <a data-name=""Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"">Madolche Queen Tiaramisu</a>. Tiaramisu is a primarily reason why the deck wants to go second as her effect a powerful piece of removal with a rate quality that moots certain forms of responses and ""cannot be targeted"" effects. For going first we have <a data-name=""Madolche Fresh Sistart"">Madolche Fresh Sistart</a> and <a data-name=""Madolche Teacher Glassouffle"">Madolche Teacher Glassouffle</a>, which serve to protect your backrow and one of your monsters, respectably. the latter also has a nifty recycling effect that procs when another Madolche goes to the GY, helping to keep your GY clean. The last monster is <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-mode"">Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-mode</a>. Puddingcess here taking on a new dress, 1500 extra ATK and the ability to summon a mosnter from the dekc (provided Puddingcess herself is an overlay unit, this explains Petingcesouer and Prominade's effects)  Madolche Butlerusk is another monster that search a card on Normal summon, however instead of a Madolche cards it is instead a field spell. the catch is that you need another Madolche monster to use it, if you're wondering why this dude wasn't teched in every deck that uses a field spell. He's here more becuase of the fact that I don't currently run Terraforming and Metaverse (despite having a lot of copies of them, I am considering them of course)  <a data-name=""Madolche Tea Break"">Madolche Tea Break</a> is a counterpart to Nights, whereas Nights responds to Monster effects, this card responds to spells, and like Nights,m it also has a Puddingcess reliant bonus effect. In this case popping a card. <a data-name=""Madolche Waltz"">Madolche Waltz</a> is in the side deck concept for some cute Game 3 memes, as it is a burn card that deals 300 damage each time one of your dolls battle, it can also potentially close out games (Puddingcess Chocolat with 3800 ATK plus this means up to 4100 damage), but the changes are minor.  Last card of note is <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>. This one helps search your Normal Traps provided you can spare a copy of the one you want to search and lets you activate it the same turn. Naturally if I do have these in the IRL deck the ratios of some of the traps would bump up.  thus ends my Madolche deck profile. I am aware that this is half baked and that other options are available (Traptrix Raflessia+Gravedigger's for starters). It is for that reason that I will appreciate any feed back you have on this deck. Especially where the Extra is concerned."

First turn setups are less about putting several negates/floodgates up and moreso about establishing a variety of different disruption, protection, and floating effects via backrow, monster effects, and GY setup, then pushing through whatever your opponent throws at you while accruing card advantage. OTKs come easy thanks to huge stat totals as well as Quaeritis's ATK zeroing and easy access to the Numeron Dragon package. Guardian Chimera fits perfectly into the deck, providing strong removal and cycling on a big body while triggering Despia on-Fusion effects, making it pretty much your best choice when using Branded in Red. In conlusion, Konami, please don't ban/limit Aluber just because you decided to print a bunch of broken Branded/Albaz support that doesn't do anything for this deck."

That was in large parts thanks to their Cyberse typing which in and of itself boosts the powerlevel of any of its given archetypes. Still, it felt like these fish were floating around the East Blue rather than the Grand Line if you know what I mean. They could pack a punch, take a bite but all in all weren't all that frightening.</span>  <span>But guess what, we're swimming with the big boys now. There's plenty of fish in the Ocean and the Ocean just, got, bigger. Let's talk support.</span>  <span>The Goodies:</span> <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Marincess Springirl"">Marincess Springirl</a></span><span>: Or <a data-name=""Marincess Spring Girl"">Spring Girl</a>? Either way this card's great. It's a level 4 extender with a trigger effect if sent to the GY, allowing for more *in deep, echo-y voice* CHAINBLOCKING. It can mill cards from the top of the deck equal to the number of Marincess monsters you control. Lemme translate. ""Here's another shot at Wave"". So many cards can recycle from the GY, this is an add effect with an attitude.....or additude SORRY</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Marincess Sleepy Maiden"">Marincess Sleepy Maiden</a></span><span>: What's this? Another extender? Konami is going wild today. It's biggest weakness is its level. It's a *gags* Level 5 *shudders*. It's a pretty free extender, requiring no banishing or a set amount of Marincess monsters on the field. Any Marincess equals 2 Marincesses with this tired gal. The problem is that the Marincess Link-1s need a Level 4 or lower Marincess monster, don't ask why.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Marincess Dive"">Marincess Dive</a></span><span>: And for the third card I present you: An..extender? Did Konami really just print three in-archetype extenders? Who of you madmen sold their soul to Konami again, huh? Leaving aside the large amount of firstbornes Konami is bound to receive in about 2-3 business days, this card is actually pretty bonkers. It's a Special Summon from the GY for your non-Link Marincess monsters or, if you already control Battle Ocean it straight up Special Summons from deck. That means that drawing Battle Ocean doesn't actually make you brick since you can then add this to hand instead using Sea Angel. This card also allows <em>any</em> Level 4 or lower Marincess Monster to enable a Link-4. Without the Field Spell but if you're loaded with handtraps and a Wave, who cares?</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Marincess Aqua Argonaut"">Marincess Aqua Argonaut</a></span><span>: I don't know if here name is derived from a certain useless goddess of if she used to accompany Jason on their search for their golden Feeces. Fleeces. I mean Fleece. Something golden that's not poop. Anyways she's the newest Link-4 and despite her name is pretty dang useful. She Special Summons one of her equiped Marincess Links in order to negate a Spell/Trap card or effect. Pretty cool. The worst part about her is that you now need too decide between her negate and Bubble Reef's draw. If that seems too hard just go with your heart, your gut or whatever is found beneath, whichever one helps.</span></li> </ul> <span>The Oopsie Daisies:</span> <ul>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Marincess Bubble Ring"">Marincess Bubble Ring</a>:</span> This card is a situational attack negate and I think that's all that needs to be said. Very slow, very weak, someone was hesitant to give up their firstborne and this is our punishment. Thanks..</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Marincess Circulation"">Marincess Circulation</a></span><span>: This trap is kinda like Snow. You swap one WATER Link for a Marincess Link with the same rating. Super duper situational. While it's cool to think that you could use Aqua's S/T negate or draw a card with Bubble Reef and then tag them out for the other I'd really prefer any other card in my deck over this one.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>What's remained</span>  <span>Let me start by saying no two Marincess decklists are the same. They tend to be very different from one another. Some might play way more extenders, some may still be on the Frogs. For this one I took my old version and updated it accordingly. I'd consider my decklist to be quite teched while some prefer it simple. However I like the tech choices and I think they're strong. I'm not gonna go over my Dinomiscus or Fury-Torrential ratios, I've done that in the past already. It's the same idea of running a good amount of handtraps, some backrow to protect your tower for a strong turn 1 that exceeds the standalone Marincess combo line to then finish off your opponent with an unfair amount of ressources on the following turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>What's changed</span>  <span>For starters, I added the new stuff but I think you figured. Sleepy Maiden is a one off for me since it doesn't equal full combo, is ""just"" an extender and this deck plays plenty. It's nice to have tho. Springirl is another three off since it's Level 4. I upped Pascalus up to two copies, although even three would be viable now. There are way more targets and she tooo can climb into a Link-4 now. Also, her recursion matters more as there are more good S/Ts which can be recursed. Dive's a three off for me since it's just really powerful. I added Sea Nettle since there's plenty of WATER boss monsters now to OTK and turn 1 it's just the best Level 4 extender.</span>  <span>I got rid of the frogs. What I didn't like about them is how win more Swap Frog felt. You needed a really good hand if you wanted to summon Toadally Awesome within 5 summons. And summoning Toadally after your combo felt very win more since at that point any form of extra interaction is great. Swap is very heavy on the ressources and with the new Level 4 Marincess and the Spell which can also be used to summon a Level 4 I found that this decklist can summon Toadally way more consistently that the previous one, which relied on pretty much exactly Swap and a good hand. Of course I've previously neverleaned hard into the Level 4 extenders but now I feel quite confident in cutting the Swaps without lowering this decks ceiling.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Access who?</span>  <span>I admit, I'm still on the Talkers. But great news, this deck is now completely viable without spending 200 bucks on four arrows. There are so many extenders now in this deck that it's no longer reliant on Accesscode to close out games. Don't get me wrong, Marincess still lack a way to out monsters without attacking into them but you can extend into way more bodies now and since you'll have so much ED space you can run a larger r4nk engine with cards like <span><a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Number 4: Stealth Kragen"">Number 4: Stealth Kragen</a></span> with two <span><a data-name=""Kragen Spawn"">Kragen Spawn<span>. The Kragens also count as a means to remove monster during the MP, making OTKing without Access all the easier.</span></a></span></span>"

Very simple deck revolving around getting out Golgonda, and stacking that Xyz Monster into Zeus during M2. It's got a few interesting tech choices in such as King of Feral Imps, and Machine Duplication.  Not meant to be competitive, but one could easily cut one of each four star Springan, and some of the traps to add hand traps.  Opted to throw an experimental brew in the sideboard.

Hope it brings you new ideas, this is the most fun deck I've been playing since launch. I like the card ratios but I'll show you the differences you'll find in other builds: 3 Sting Lancer and 3 Scout Buggy = many builds only use two of each. I like to maximize the Beetrooper monsters because they are the best cards in the deck along with the Resonance Insect and they always give you an advantage so I want to see them in my starting hand, not to mention that in more grind matches their third copy shows up a lot. Kaiju is the card that I feel the most that cutting from the main deck is good because there are a lot of hands that I brick with it. I think Parasite Paranoid is a card that plays the same role as Contact ""C"" in most cases that are in matches against Salamangreat and Ignister that have Link 1 that need Cyberse monsters to be summoned and especially against the Tri-Brigade it's practically another copy of Contact ""C"" that you lock a Link monster from it after the first effect you lock on Beast-Type resolves. Another deck that I've taken a lot of value from is against ABC when he activates Union Hangar to equip from the deck. The only matches that only Contact ""C"" works are on decks focused on the Archetype name like Zoodiac and Prank-kids so I use a copy in the side deck. Parasite Paranoid also shines in random situations like for example the opponent activates a monster effect that targets an Insect you control like Double Dragon Lords (if it doesn't send it as a cost to the GY) or ABC Buster Dragon among others functioning as a protection to your move. Another interesting situation is it protects your monster from being destroyed by battle, for example you pass Seraphim Papillon with 2 counters verses Eldlich and you prevent the Golden Lord from attacking you and Papillon is guaranteed to use the effect twice and stay alive for the turn. The third important situation of Parasite Paranoid is you equip it on any monster on the field that will be sent to the GY either to Link Climb or destroyed by battle or card effect and then use its second effect to summon usually from the Doom Dozer ignoring the summoning Condition which has been helpful to me 2 times. The last engine thing I did was take out the Battlewasp Twinbow and use Butterfly instead because that way the Underworld Goddess is much easier to happen because I easily put 3 effect monsters on the field and use Opponent's Apollousa or I:P Masquerena as material which I really like this option because Apollousa is a big problem for this deck since most of the monsters you summon have very low atk and Butterfly have 1200atk who can already get the Wind Barrier Statue or a Herald of the Arc Light. His being Wind also improves the situation of you being on Gozen Match because it's much better for you to try to play with the Wind monsters as you play Cicada King, Shinobi and Papillon and try to survive until you get an out. Not to mention that it makes a difference if you have more Bugs in GY and Butterfly is perfect to be banned at any time. If you draw multiples you simply discard the second with Picophalena's effect. The extra deck of the nine Insect cards that I highly recommend using because it always has utility, Shinobi is the only one that I never use its effect but to my surprise its continuous effect cannot be targeted by attacks has saved me a few times in grind game with simplified gamestate. As for the generic monsters I highly recommend you use Almiraj because it makes the Resonance Insect a live card at the same time you have enough game volume to leave it on the field and use only one zone to play and thus protect yourself from cards like Chuche, Punishment and Torrential Tribute taking the opponent by surprise. Phoenix and Trisbaena are other excellent cards in this deck and indispensable, Trisbaena you have several ways to trigger its effect, the main one is the Beetrooper Formation, but you also have Sting Lancer, Doom Dozer and this guarantees you to win backrow which is the main deficiency of this deck. Otherwise the other Extra Deck cards can be any other utility card like Knightmare Cerberus or Unicorn, Unchained Abomination etc. The choices of tech cards in the main deck as well as the side deck are just options that I present, you can assemble it according to the meta. Just be smart with Nibiru because sometimes you lock Bugs and you can't use it but it's a price to pay to survive and take the turn back. What I expect from the new support are more Advantage Enabler or monsters with Floating effects and especially a Link 3 or Link 5 with interaction effect even if it's a Pop every turn like the Phoenix Enforcer does. I expect a link that gives properties to the Invincible Atlas like for example: Insect monster that was made using this card as material gains this effect: Once per turn, if an Insect is summoned in a zone that this card points to: send a card that your opponent controls for the gy. I think it's perfect because this deck summons on the opponent's turn and Atlas is currently a very weak win condition, it's not just because it has dragoon protection that it's competent. I would also like a link 2 that does Picofalena's work, but it doesn't need to discard cards and equip a Banned Insect on it to keep looping the resonance insect in the grind game, because locking on insects is more interfering than helping because there's not much where go since the Insect type has very weak extra deck cards that don't help you put pressure on the field. But the big problem with this deck is that you need to use a lot of bad extender to make combo so this deck deserves to extend like Dragon Link which gives you an advantage as Noctovision makes Chain Block and draws cards and also an efficient way to deal with spells/traps which is horrible these days."

The artwork was amazing, the effects were strong yet balanced, and the summoning condition made sure it wasn't overpowered. I chose to put this in a Fluffals deck for two reasons.  One, Fluffals are good at getting a bunch of monsters in their hand, and two, Guardian Chimera is a go-second card, while Fluffals are a go-second deck. And due to the obvious killer doll theme, I decided to name this profile ""Deck of Chucky."" Which is ironic, considering that I saw a Chucky movie on TV last week.  &nbsp;  Anyways, this deck is NOT meant to go first. Your only first turn play is summoning Frightfur Sheep, or getting Edge Imp Scythe and getting a Fluffal monster--ideally Fluffal Penguin--into your hand. You want to go second, especially since some of the monsters in this deck WANT to be sent to the Graveyard. Edge Imp Chain, Fluffal Cat, et cetera."

Btw, i filled the unused space with Deskbot shenanigans.  Destruction sword alone can't do much against a non-dragon deck, so if you are going against these kinds, try aways get you Crystron and proceed to the <strong>Deskbot combo:</strong>  Jester Confit + any tuner (except deskbot 001); special summon Jester and normal summon the monster ~link summon Crystron Halqifibrax ~with Crystron effect special summon Deskbot 001 from the deck ~link summon Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon ~After Auroradon have summoned his tokens, special summon Deskbot from your GY ~Synchro into Cupid Pitch and rise its level ~Activate auroradon effect and destroy 2 tokens ~Summon Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing ~after summoning his tokens summon Deskbot again ~Synchro Summon Borreload Savage Dragon using Cupid Pitch and a token ~chain Cupid and Borreload effects ~Summon the Creation Resonator that you just added ~Synchro into Baronne de fleur ~Synchro Summon Herald of the Arc Light ~set any traps that you might need and end the turn. 3 omni negates plus your traps and hand traps.  If you are going against a deck using DPhoenix Enforcer you can change the combo a lit to get Clear Wing Synchro Dragon and negate his destruction effects.  I am using 3 Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman to mill cards needed to fusion summon, thats why i ain't using many Destruction Sword Memories.  <strong>Destruction Sword Combo:</strong> If you managed to get any Dragon monster in the GY and have PDS in hand, set it, in the opponent turn activate it and send 1 DSM and your Buster Blader to immediately after been send, activate DSM effect and fusion Buster Blader, Dragon Destroyer Swordsman that together with the Buster Dragon you also summoned you get a board stun akin to skill drain, but more like a plasma, since it's one sided. This can be used in conjunction with the deskbot combo.  !UPDATE: i changed some cards and the monst important I CHANGED A IMPORTANT PART OF THE COMBO COMBO, so if you have read the combo in the first version make sure to read again because this is much better now. Have a good day.  !UPDATE2: YES. I CHANGED THE COMBO AGAIN AND NOW THIS IS THE LAST TIME. The new combo have Barone de Fleur included. I was oscilating with the combos because theres so many variables and other ideas in this site but today i found the best, i guess. Also i included the DESTRUCTION SWORD COMBO. Have a good morning.  &nbsp;  Sorry for any grammar mistakes.  Any suggestions are welcome.  GLHF"

And to support this strategy, this time i use some consistency cards like left arm offering to search ties from deck and pot of extravagance, for draw power, and i also use some defenses that includes ash as a handtrap,  dark ruler no more and lightning storm to have a chance of putting out the combo if i go second, and crossout designator and called bythe grave to prevent my opponent from negating my ties of the brethren (mainly to prevent my opponet ash blossom). I also use  summoner monk since he is a very good back up plan that can bring most of my thunder monster from deck, he is very good as a backup plan for locking down my opponent."

OTK. Current/post BODE meta.,"Welcome back to to yet another updated Gren Maju build. With the way the current and likely meta is going to shape once BODE becomes TCG legal, I felt the need to shift from a handtrap Golden Castle based build to a more grindy and even more LVL 8 oriented build. Crossout Designator made handtraps even less effective as well all know. Also with the current meta running more Veiler and Imperms, the OTK that would often be provided by Dragubilon and Numeron Dragon is a lot harder to achieve, and Golden Castle simply burns too much through a 40 card build to risk using anymore.  The deck has seen a marked increase in LV:8's with the additions of Gadarla (vital for Barrier Statue spammers), Gamecial and Alpha. Kaiju's are often my go to to get rid of annoyingly tough to remove omni-negates and other interruptions (Dragoon/Enforcer/Baroness/Ultimatness.. you get the idea). Looping Alpha with Kaiju's is often a good way to eat through several layers of interruption and Alpha being a 3k beatstick allows it to clean up most of what is left. With this increase in LV:8's brings additional drawing power in the form of Trade-In, being useful not only to draw additional cards, but also activate the Danger monster effects should the need arise. Interrupted Kaiju Slumber provides both removal as well as ensuring I can get to a vital Kaiju to further prevent the opponent being able to regain a board. Gizmek/Eater Of Millions and Pot Of Desires as we all know do the job of deck thinning and banishing to allow Gren Maju to swing. Additional facedown removal from Eater is also at times of great benefit. Eater has been moved up from 1 in my Golden Castle builds to 2, to have a more balanced method of winning. Lightning Storm, Harpie's and Pankratops provide excellent removal as well.  Not much really needs to be said about the side deck. I'm pretty much happy with it as is. Dingirsu/Zeus are as strong as they've always been with non-targeting and non-destructive removal. Sanaphond has really come into it's own, as shutting off graveyard revival prevents Enforcer from coming back via it's own effect, as well as shutting down a great deal of the meta's ability to rebuild boards from the grave. Lancelot is surprisingly good with it's ability to poke directly for 2k damage. With life points likely to be low on the opponents end most of the time, this can often be critical. The added negating of any type of activation is a little bonus as well. N'tss to punish Dogmatika. Knightmare's Phoenix, Unicorn and BLS can come up from time to time, but Zeroboros/Accesscode are mainly there as additional win cons and to be honest lack of any real alternatives that fit with the deck. Out of everything in the Extra, these two I can't say have ever come up, nor have there been situations where they could've helped. But you never know, may find some uses at some point.  Dimension Shifter is sat in the side deck. Although still immensely strong and crippling to the vast majority of decks, without knowing the impact of Flunder's on the meta, I would rather have a reasonably solid 40 card main deck that is decently effective against everything (of course the die roll greatly skews this) rather than have a few cards that are utterly useless Game 1 when dealing with what could be frequent matchup. Ra Sphere is 3 Kaiju's in one, and is one of the few cards capable of flat out cleaning Drytron and the monster portion of Phantom Knight boards, which could otherwise prove tricky, if not impossible to get around. Can also come in handy against Swordsoul, as they can have three monsters on board as well. Being a normal summon is also helpful should I walk into Barrier Statue +2 monster boards, and doesn't usually interfere with the deck's strategy, as everything bar Gren Maju is a special summon anyway. Double Twins and Red Reboot are additional backrow coverage, whilst DD Ground, Summon Limit and Imperial Order all provide the ability to completely stun all the match ups i'm likely to face.  &nbsp;  As always, feel free to like and comment!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

It does mean giving up Scythe, and it conflicts a little with Tuning Magician and Selene, but on the other hand if your game is Necro-Goon, Necro Apollousa-Bagooska-Dragoon seems like upside. Of course, the downside is you're pendulum, there isn't a lot of space for hand traps or other interaction before you settle on Necrovalley, and none afterwards.  So, we've got 2 separate pendulum engines in the deck, a large Pendulum Magicians Engine, and a smaller Darkwurm engine. For Magicians I'm on 3 Wisdom Eye, the best Pendulum Magician and a card you want to open, 3 Oafdragon Magician, our main low scale and a way to recur monsters from the extra deck, 3 Double Iris, because sometimes you'll want to pop this to get an extra interaction, 1 Tuning Magician for combos with Halq and Selene, 3 Harmonizing Magician, the second-best magician in the deck, an instant Needlefibre off of its pendulum summon, 2 Skullcrobat Joker which is just fine, it is technically a consistency card, then 1 of the Time Pendulumgraph for the extra interruption, 1 Star Pendulumgraph, technically a consistency card, also technically searchable protection, 3 Pendulum Call to pitch Darkwurm and search us our pen magicians, and lastly 3 Duelist Alliance to search Pen Call and Double Iris.  For the Darkwurm engine, we're on all 3 Darkwurm and all 3 Odd-Eyes Revolution Dragon to search Darkwurm, and the Supreme King Gate Zero, a necessary brick for Darkwurm. I felt like consistency was key in pendulums and like Pen Call pitch Darkwurm was a combo I wanted to see often enough, this is just guaranteed scales and easy access to a strong combo where both pieces are searchable.  For our last package, we're running Dragoon. Look, I just... okay? The deck is great at making Apollousa + Bagooska but Apollo + Dragoon is probably more appealing to end on in a lot of circumstances, and when it pushes to Dragoon + Apollo + Bagooska + Necrovalley that seems pretty scary to confront. Note that the Rank 4 can be easy access to a 4-5 material Zeus through Utopia, and that Apollo can often be Unicorn-Accesscode, so the deck has the tools to break boards with that package.  7 copies of Necrovalley. While it does make some sense to run more, I think you do flood out with excess copies more often when you do that, and the space in this deck is real tight, especially with Dragoon, and your odds of seeing a copy at 7 are high enough that it'll probably be there in at least 1 of your games if it is actually good. The reason we run 1 of the spell and 2 of the Commandant is that the first copy of the spell is better for Selene's purposes, but being once per turn makes the second copy worse.  So, just gonna run through the deck real fast. 1 Halq, just an easy to summon extender that enables combos. 2 Selene, because of Necrovalley you aren't using the second copy as often but you still want it for follow-ups when you didn't draw Necrovalley. 1 Apollo, your big boss monster, typically ends on 2 negates, but with Bagooska back-up it can actually get them. 1 Unicorn, and 1 Accesscode are a nice little package of board breaking cards that can also deal with set backrow. Dragoon also helps break boards, but is an omni-negate and also has very good protection that make it annoying. Tornado Dragon is here to pop our own Double Iris and that's about it, but it can also help take down backrow. Bagooska is here to protect Apollo, since we're summoning it at few negates. Abyss Dweller is here in case we pop off without Necrovalley. The last cards in the extra deck are Utopia into Zeus, with 4 or maybe even 5 materials."

If swapping to make a legal deck that uses handtraps, swap PoG, surface, &amp; the 2 water hazards.  Main goal of the deck is to slam down Cosmocroix early to lock up opponent's monster effects. Agel can draw either Cradel card, depending on what you need, but if you have Cosmocroix or Icejade Cradel in hand, add the field, if you have Inion Cradel or Terraforming in hand, add Icejade Cradel instead.  Sea serpent cards in the deck are the basis for all the synchro monsters, with Diva being able to pull one of 2 ways to synchro to 7 or going into Halq to which pulls another tuner (usually Minstrel) and any one of 4 tuner synchros. Clear Wing helps protect Cosmocroix, Dragite negates backrow, Brionac is used to setup Moulinglacia as it allows you to choose how many water monsters go in your grave &amp; provides minimum 1 target for Moulinglacia to discard.  XYZ's are much more difficult to get out as most require Acty to summon as it's the only level 4 in the Main Deck. Should you be able to summon them, Number 37  can work in tandem with Cosmocroix to make your opponents lose 4600 attack for 2 turns. Silent Honor ARK helps remove big Extra Deck monsters while bypassing destruction protections, Bahamut Shark &amp; Toadally Awesome combo sets up a spell/trap negation, Leviair helps pull back icejades that have banished themselves and allows for some recursion in the deck, and Abyss Dweller is mainly for if you no longer have Cosmocroix &amp; your opponent is trying to use grave shenanigans.  Called by  &amp; minstrel provide protection against Ash Blossom which is one of the worst handtraps for this deck as you need to pull a cards from deck w/ agel unless you  open with a perfect hand. Side deck provides additional protections in the way of instant fusion/restrict or dragged down/dimension shifter. Infinite impermanence is among the best cards in the side deck to switch out for as it stacks w/ Cosmocroix to prevent monster effects even on the turn they're summoned, letting you stun your opponent. Nibiru &amp; DPE packages are both for removing big threats, Nibiru keeps things from ever hitting the board, while DPE stops effects that don't proc on summon &amp; has flexibility to destroy back row as well."

It doesn't have an exact ""combo"", but usually you want to Normal Summon Rod, and somehow get Dark Magical Circle in your hand, and usually you want to get either Magician's Navigation or Eternal Soul, a Dark Magician in your hand, and then use it as response. The Apprentice Illusion will help with boosting your monsters' attack, and searching Dark Magician directly. Really, for a rogue deck, the deck isn't bad. But it is most of the time very fragile. Once the deck can really get going, you can easily put 5-6 monsters on the field in one turn and smack your opponent for more than game."

The game starts when you send a Orcust monster to the grave, normally in the first turn you will send Orcust Knightmare or World Legacy - ""World Wand"".  In World Wand case you would be going to link summon Lib the World Key Blademaster that can give you a extender, go for this if you have a good hand with a lot of ways to keep putting bodies for you links.  If you send Orcust Knightmare to the GY and have a monster in your field ~activate Orcust Knightmare ~send World Wand from your deck ~Activate World Wand ~Summon your banished Orcust Knightmare ~Link into Galatea, the Orcust Automaton ~Activate Galatea effect ~put World Wand back in the deck and set a Orcust Crescendo. Orcust Crscendo is a omni negate. This is the only combo that i found that is consistently while playing but also i many times ended having to make a choice between Orcust Crescendo or Orcustrated Return to extend my combo.  But anyway, the deck is not as good like i thought, but is funny and the card desing is very unique.

You can replace the Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer engine with Dragoon engine but if you wan,"Dream Mirror has gotten a lot of flack (justifiably) for being pretty bricky and gimmicky. But Dream Mirror has recently gotten a new support which makes it a hundred times better than what it used to be.  I'm going to cut it short here. Your main strategy is on a 1 and 2 card combo. Having either Neiroy, The Dream Mirror Heretic or both Neiroy and Chaos Creator  You use Neiroy to get it's LIGHT counterpart onto the field &gt; Special Summon Sprite onto the field and add Dream Mirror of Chaos to your hand (and if it's already there) add Morpheus, The Dream Mirror White Knight &gt; Then activate Dream Mirror of Terror and use Sprite's effect to summon Mara to Special Summon a monster from your hand &gt; Then link Mara and Neiroy into Artifact Dagda or Anaconda. &gt; Then fusion summon Tormentor. If you have Chaos Creator, special summon it before using Anaconda's effect. From there you can go into many other combos which you'll most likely figure out on your own. Good luck Duelist and I hope you have fun with this deck and shock people with your Dream Mirror plays!"

Going first you're a strong Trap deck, but going second you have the tools to break boards, and I like that dual nature a lot. I'm still a little foreign to Cyber Dragons - unlike a lot of the decks I've investigated they don't seem that intuitive for me to play. Still, there's a lot of room for Spice and I like that a lot.  So, for cards, we have 3 Cyber Dragon. I'm running all 3 because of Machine Duplication, but also because Cyber Dragon is an important tool for breaking boards going second, important enough that I'm still clowning around with 1 Toon Cyber Dragon, the 4th copy of Cyber Dragon, though it doesn't work for all purposes it helps make Megafleet and Nova just fine, but too many seems cloggy, since it isn't a card you want to open multiples of. Then 3 Cyber Dragon Core. Core + Machine Dupe is your main combo starter, and thanks to the Cyberdark engine 1 Core also makes Shenshen or Draco Berserker, which is pretty cool. Obviously we're on 3 Cyber Emergency to search it. Cyber Repair Plant is not a card I'm high on but you need to search it or see it for some combos, so 2 seems reasonable. All 3 Herz make the deck. Herz is a great tool for recovering resources, is a Machine Dupe target, and searches Cyber Dragon to fuel Galaxy Soldier, which makes Nova into Infinity. 1 Nachster, because it is searchable, this is a cool little tool you don't mind seeing in your hand, but 1 of them seems fine. Then we have the Cyberdark engine, 1 Realm, 1 Chimera and the 1 Power Bond. This Otk going second is pretty stupid, and it is a tool for going first as well, which is nice, and it is just a nice option. Power Bond is a card I always thought people should consider running anyways, and being able to search it and banish from the GY for it is a huge push. 1 Cyberload Fusion, its a searchable fusion card that recovers banished resources, it comes up. 1 Stardust Synchron so we can make Synchro plays. 1 Jizikiru, because it is searchable. I'm on 3 Cybernetic Overflow and honestly, it either feels like the best card in the deck or the worst. If you've made Cyber Dragon plays and kept resources for it to banish the card is incredible, but where it suffers is when you see it without gas. Still, I think this is probably better than Compulse or Punishment or something like that in this deck, so 3 makes sense. The next card is spicy, but when you think about it it makes a lot of sense. 3 Machina Overdrive with 1 Machina Citadel to search. So, while this engine requires you to run a brick, even just the shuffle draw effect of the card is huge in the deck, and can shuffle back cards that are banished or in the GY. This card is a dream to pitch to Cyberdark Chimera, but it's also pretty good on its own. Being able to wipe your opponent's board at SS2 is a good effect, and it shuffles the brick back into your deck to draw you a card. In low-end boards this represents a crucial piece of interaction vs the opponent's board that is very easy to turn on. On high end boards you can often maneuver it so that you have an extra card to send to get this interaction. And when pitched or removed the shuffle draw effect is completely valuable in its own right. I think this engine makes sense to run in basically any machine deck that isn't already running too many bricks. Cyber Dragon is barely any bricks, most of your cards are live, even if some are only as live going second. Then Solemns because Solemns.  In the Extra Deck, I have 2 Nova and 2 Infinity. It's a soft once per turn on all of their effects, so rather than running the Chronomaly and Constellar monster I think putting up a second Infinity is pretty good when you can, and I particularly like the second copy for the grind game. This deck can win out of nowhere, but it can also just grind turn after turn until the opponent is out of resources. AA Zeus also helps it do this, being a thing you can make with Infinity after attacking. Infinity can attach any attack position monsters to help Zeus get extra materials, which is clutch, and if you don't OTK there are few things more dangerous than a Zeus, even with only 1 activation. For links we have 1 Cyber Dragon Sieger, this is mostly here just to be another copy of Cyber Dragon for Overflow, but also helps us break boards by increasing monsters attack points, at the cost of them dealing no damage. 1 Double Headed Anger Knuckle, because its recursion effect is actually good, it is generic to make, and it makes the Citadel into less of a brick, since you can use this to summon the Citadel, use the Citadel to make Sieger, and then if this ever gets popped or beaten over you revive the Citadel. I think this card is bad in Cyber Dragons unless you're playing Machina Overdrive, but it makes the Citadel less of a brick, and is accessible in your normal combos. 1 Almiraj. Usually you don't want to make this, because doing so means you probably aren't playing through Nibiru, but it's an important card since Repair Plant needs a Cyber Dragon in the GY to activate. For the fusions, it's just Chimeratech monsters. Fortress Dragon can be huge in Machine mirrors, it usually doesn't come up but you need it just in case. Megafleet makes our Cyber Dragon monsters into removal using just summoning mechanics, which is pretty good, and worth running 2. And then Rampage Dragon, which you want a second copy of, since you'll sometimes use this in your normal combos to make Synchro plays, and want a back-up or follow-up copy. Making this with Power Bond is your main tool for closing out games, and 1 Core does that. For Synchro, we need an 8 that doesn't require too much setup, and that is Draco Berserker, and we can also make 9s commonly enough that we need a 9, and the best generic 9 right now is Shenshen IMO, so we're running that. You could cut the Synchro package and the deck would still be just fine, and I considered playing Called By The Grave over the Synchros, but I felt there was space in the deck and extra deck to just make the combos less linear and more flexible, which is something I strive for.  So in testing a few things have come up. Machina Overdrive has actually been pretty good, and Overdrive + Overflow is pretty close an OTK, since you can use Citadel to clear their front row and then Overflow to clear their backrow. It does suck that Overdrive can be hit by Ash Blossom, but also generally people burn up their Ash on your turn while you're setting up your board. What I really like about the engine is how it dramatically improves the deck's grind game, and games where you see multiple copies it really feels like you can play forever, though I'll concede Citadel is basically a really bad brick in the deck, so your milage may vary.  While the automated tagging has put this as an OTK deck, and the deck does have OTK potential when it goes second, this version is really more of a control deck, and you're going to want to go first in game 1 all of the time. The OTKs help you have game going second, but you're really trying to make Infinity + backrow more often than you're trying to go for the OTK. The OTKs also really help close out games with your follow-up so they're worth keeping in the deck even if you're going first, especially since the Cyberdark engine still has implications going first.  The deck can make Synchro plays but you shouldn't go out of your way to put up Shenshen or Draco Berserker. These cards are fine in their own right, but usually if you're going first and have the option of searching Overflow or using up your Power Bond to make Synchro plays you should be searching Overflow. However, Shenshen is one hell of a floodgate in a lot of matchups, so if you identify that the Shenshen is good it is a nice option to go into that is usually available. But the majority of the time you should be saving the Cyberdark cards for the turn you go for the kill. Having said that, there's no other single card I'd rather run over Stardust Synchron, and I really did dig deep into the card pool looking for alternatives. If I'm going to have extra spots in the main and extra deck I might as well run the Synchro package and diversify the deck's toolbox.  Repair Plant is better than I gave it credit when initially building the deck. While it is a little bit awkward, the ability to search Galaxy Soldier in particular, as well as doubling as Cyber Emergency in some of your combos, is really quite good. I still don't want to run 3 of the card, but I'm inclined not to cut it back to one after testing, the card's generic search effect is really quite strong for Cyber Dragons.  Toon Cyber Dragon has been fine. When you see it going second you're happy it is in the deck. Not being Cyber Dragon for Overflow makes it literally worse than Cyber Dragon in the deck, but that aspect rarely comes up. You usually either have plenty of Cyber Dragons to banish or basically none. You can side it out when you know you're going first, or when Megafleet seems bad, like against strategies that don't put up Link monsters. Same for Jizikiru, it is a hedge that you run when you're going second and cut when you know you're going first."

Please understand.,"The strategy with this deck is pretty standard for Witchcrafters <ul>  	<li>Begin the summon chain with Potterie, Schmietta, Pittore, Genni, into Verre, Haine, or optionally Aruru if you're feeling frisky</li> </ul> <ul>  	<li>Dump Bystreet into the GY with Schmietta's effect. If it's already there, get Holiday, Draping, or optionally Aruru into the GY instead</li>  	<li>Use Pittore's effect to get an extra draw. Try not to be greedy with it if you don't have a witchcrafter card in hand</li>  	<li>Use Potterie's effect if your hand is empty to get something in-hand (if you have duplicate spells in the GY for example)</li>  	<li>Alternatively: You can use Reasoning and/or Card Destruction to quickly dump resources into your GY</li> </ul> My go-to is to get Madame Verre and Witchcrafter Bystreet on the field during the end phase of my first turn, with Aruru in-hand if it is at all possible. Against a lot of decks, Verre is able to hold her own since she's able to do untargeted monster effect negates and boost her ATK/DEF during the damage step, and Bystreet protects her from destruction once per turn. Haine is a good alternative to Verre since she's able to delete problematic cards, but I've that bringing her out first is less consistent than Verre. The strategy cares less about which one gets out first, so much as it does chaining the effects at the right times.

Genex Neutron is usually used to search for Cube, Cube along with Thrasher and Trident Warrior for a level 7 Synchro to search an equip spell with Cube.  Then you usually try to equip Sigma with whatever you have (hopefully a Mage Power searched with Cube and whatever Vylon Equips you have), attack with it to equip Tryce for another attack, attack again for a second Mage Power.  If you have Element and another Equip in hand, search for Kay'Est and turbo out Omega  Otherwise there's also the Epsilon Turbo option  The deck is not supposed to be anything gamebreaking, just some way to make Vylons look like they might work in some kind of format that is so far away from anything meta you would still assume you might lose if the deck contended in 2013 but hey, I just wanted to have fun and keep the whole thing affordable"

Cyberdarks can indeed end on two omni-negates. crazy, right?  And before you ask, Yes, it is indeed not pure Cyberdarks, unless you consider Cyber Dragons to be part of the deck (which is Konami's intention) then yeah it is pure... relatively.  Now! Let's start talking about how to build boards with enough edge to cut through my depression.  &nbsp;  <em><strong><span>DECK DESCRIPTION.....</span></strong></em>  Here i will be talking about each card in the deck, what purpose does it serve and how to use it correctly.  First we talk about the main deck monsters, starting with.....  &nbsp;  Cyber Eltanin: Can't be normal summoned/set and can only be special summoned from your hand by banishing all light machine-type monsters from your field and gy, when summoned that way it gains 500 for each card banished by it's effect and sends all other **monsters** on the field to the gy.  This guy is just a personal preference of mine to be honest, solely because it's a board nuke and i love those. It's not crucial at all to the deck's main gameplan, so you can remove it for anything else if you feel like it.  &nbsp;  Cyber Dragon: Ah, ""Cyber Dragon"" the og format warping machine. Doesn't really need an introduction, it's mainly here to summon ""Cyber Dragon Nova"" then go Into ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"" using ""Machine Duplication"" and because it's an extra target for ""Cybernetic Horizon"". If you were to remove it for something else you might as well remove ""Machine Duplication"" as well.  &nbsp;  Cyberdark Chimera: Now we're getting to the juicy core cards. ""Cyberdark Chimera"" is quite possibly the most important card in this deck. Basically what it does is that it let's you discard a spell/trap card to add ""Power Bond"" from your deck to your hand and then it allows you to banish monsters from your gy to summon a ""Cyber"" fusion monster, Also when it's sent to the gy it allows you to send to the gy a ""Cyberdark"" monster with a different name to the other ""Cyberdark"" monsters in your gy and face-up on your field.  This guy has it all gy set-up, searching and lets you miracle fusion. Needless to say it is absolutely crucial to the deck's gameplan and an absolute 3of.  &nbsp;  Cyberdark Edge, Cyberdark Horn, Cyberdark Keel: the reason i placed these 3 in the same section is because they're literally in this deck for the same reason, their names. Honestly you can get away by playing only two of these, i just play all 3 for thematic purpose.  &nbsp;  Cyberdark Cannon: Now back to the juicy core cards. This suspicious looking dragon is basically the rota Cyberdarks so desperately needed, it allows you to discard it from your hand to search a machine ""Cyberdark"" monster, also it has some other effects while it's equipped to a monster, those are not really worth mentioning. It searches ""Cyberdark Chimera"" and gives you an extra ""Cyberdark"" name in the gy, an obvious 3of.  &nbsp;  Cyberdark Claw: another juicy core card. This guy is basically ""Cyberdark Cannon"" but for ""Cyberdark"" Spell/Trap cards. You usually use it to search ""Cyberdark Realm"" or ""Cybernetic Horizon"", both are cards we'll get into later. Also same as Cannon, two equip effects no one cares about. Obvious 3of is obviously obvious.  &nbsp;  Cyber Dragon Core: The third most juicy card in the deck. It's ""Cyber Dragon Core"" i believe we all know what it does by this point, searches a ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap card when normal summoned and has a gy effect that rarely matters. Core is basically ""Cyberdark Claw"" but you normal summon it and it searches almost every single Spell/Trap card in your deck, you will usually search ""Cyber Eternal"" which is another card we'll get into soon enough. As with most ""Cyber Dragon"" decks Core is a 3of.  &nbsp;  And that concludes the main deck monsters. Now we head to the spells.  Starting with.....  &nbsp;  Overload Fusion: It's basically your miracle fusion. Fusion summon any Dark Machine monster by banishing materials from your field or gy, pretty self explanatory. I run it as a ""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"" target to make comebacks and stuff, feel free to replace it with something else.  &nbsp;  Power Bond: Your main fusion spell, there is a lot to unpack here. ""Power Bond"" allows you to fusion summon any machine monster using materials from your hand or field and it doubles the original attack of the fusion monster summoned, however during your endphase you take damage equal to that monster's original attack. This is what ""Cyberdark Chimera"" searches. needless to say it's a hard brick, you absolutely don't wanna see it in your hand and if you do see all copies of it in your hand you might as well scoop. You generally need 1, but i play 2 because i always draw it in my opening hand.  &nbsp;  Cyber Emergency: This is your Rota. ""Cyber Emergency"" allows you to add any ""Cyber Dragon"" or any Light Machine that can't be normal summoned/set from your deck to your hand. Your main search targets are ""Cyber Dragon Core"" and ""Cyber Eltanin"". Even if you don't play ""Cyber Eltanin"" you still want to see this card in your hand as much as possible, ""Cyber Dragon Core"" is that important, and you can discard it with ""Cyberdark Chimera"" if need be, so it's never a brick. Play 3.  &nbsp;  Cybernetic Horizon: Well well well, if it isn't the second most juicy card in the deck. ""Cybernetic Horizon"" requires you to send to the gy a Light and a Dark ""Cyber"" monster one from your hand and one from deck, then it allows you to send a ""Cyber"" fusion monster from Extra Deck to the gy and then it lets you add any ""Cyber"" monster from your deck to your hand. You're almost always gonna send ""Cyber End Dragon"" and one of the level 4 ""Cyberdark"" monsters other than ""Cyberdark Chimera"" to search either ""Cyber Dragon Core"", ""Cyberdark Claw"" or ""Cyberdark Cannon"", Also it's always treated as a ""Cyberdark"" card. Now let's recap here, a cost that's basically gy set-up, an effect that's also gy set-up and a search AND it's also searchable. This card is insane, play 3 and nothing less, I would play 4 if i could.  &nbsp;  Machine Duplication: I think we all know where this is going. ""Machine Duplication"" doesn't really need an introduction, everyone knows what it does but I'll say it for newcomers, it allows you to target any machine monster you control with 500 or less attack and then you summon up to 2 monsters with the targeted monster's name from your hand or deck. You can target ""Cyber Dragon Core"" with this card (Since it's name becomes ""Cyber Dragon"" while on the field or gy) to summon 2 ""Cyber Dragons"" from your deck and then go into ""Cyber Dragon Nova"" Then ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"". As i said with ""Cyber Dragon"" if you're gonna cut it might as well cut ""Machine Duplication"" since both are just ways to make ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"", and don't contribute to the deck's main gameplan that much.  &nbsp;  Cyber Repair Plant: Now this one's a classic. ""Cyber Repair Plant"" allows you to search any Light Machine monster or shuffle it from the gy into the deck if need be, also if you have 3 ""Cyber Dragons"" in your gy you can use both effects. This one isn't very crucial to the deck, i play 3 because i like it and it helps recycle your ""Cyber Dragons"" to make ""Machine Duplication"" useful, but you can play 1 or 2 if you like.  &nbsp;  Cyber Eternal: It's literally just ""Return of the Dragon lords"". ""Cyber Eternal"" Let's you special summon any ""Cyber"" fusion monster from your gy ignoring it's summoning conditions but you have to properly summon it first, also when a ""Cyber"" fusion monster you control would be destroyed by battle or by a card effect you can banish this card from your gy instead. It may not seem like it but ""Cyber Eternal"" is crucial to the final endboard of this deck, and it's probably the main reason ""Cyber Dragon Core"" is in this deck. Play 3.  &nbsp;  Cyberload Fusion: This one probably gave a certain Duel Links player some ptsd flashbacks. ""Cyberload Fusion"" allows to fusion summon any fusion monster that lists a ""Cyber Dragon"" monster as a fusion material by shuffling monsters from your field or Banished zone, also you can only attack with that monster for the rest of the turn. I mainly use this to summon ""Chimeratech Overdragon"" and ""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"" same thing with ""Overload Fusion"". Feel free to cut it for something else.  &nbsp;  Cyberdark Realm: The fourth most juicy card in the deck. What ""Cyberdark Realm"" does is that when it's activated it allows you to add any ""Cyberdark"" monster from your deck to your hand, also during your main phase it allows to normal summon a ""Cyberdark"" immediately after the effect resolves. It's another rota and double summon as well. Your normal off of this is always gonna be ""Cyberdark Chimera"" and your regular normal summon is always gonna be ""Cyber Dragon Core"". Needless to say play 3.  &nbsp;  And that concludes the main deck. (Yes traps are not real and no ""Cyberdark invasion doesn't count shutup)  Now we head for the extra deck,  Starting with......  &nbsp;  Cyberdark End Dragon: Is this God? No, it's just an extremely edgy dragon. Ooooh boy, there sure is a lot to talk about here, let's start shall we? First of ""Cyberdark End Dragon"" Can only be fusion summoned by using ""Cyberdark Dragon"" and ""Cyber end Dragon"" as materials OR you can summon it by sending a Level 10 or lower ""Cyberdark"" fusion monster equipped with ""Cyber End Dragon"" you control to the gy, Also it is unaffected by your opponent's activated effects, meaning it dies to stuff like ""Skill Drain"" and ""Destiny Hero - Plasma"", Also once per turn it allows to equip one monster from either gy to it, not a quick effect. This embodiment of mediocrity leaves me unsatisfied and sad, don't get me wrong it's good it's really good but it just doesn't do enough for a monster with such legendary status, anyways i could stay here and rant all day or i can talk about cards and i choose to do the latter. While the summoning condition might seem hard to accomplish, it is surprisingly relatively easy to do granted it wastes most of your resources but still if it works it works, the effects are above average at best it's not unaffected against everything which can be a problem at times and the gy equip thing while useful could have been better, also you can revive it and protect it from battle by using ""Cyber Eternal"". All in all, this is your boss monster and you play 1 of it.  &nbsp;  Cyber End Dragon: Ah, the og Train stable. ""Cyber End Dragon"" doesn't really need an introduction, you summon it using 3 ""Cyber Dragons"" and it's a 4000 atk beater that inflicts piercing damage. You rarely if ever summon it, it's main uses are being sent to the gy via ""Cybernetic Horizon"" and equipped to ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"" to summon ""Cyberdark End Dragon"". Not much to talk about here.  &nbsp;  Cyberdarkness Dragon: N E G A T E. ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"" is fusion summoned using 5 ""Cyberdark"" effect monsters, when summoned it equips a Dragon or a Machine monster from your gy to itself, also it can negate and destroy any card your opponent activates by sending any equip spell on your field to the gy. This guy is pretty crucial to the deck, it helps summon ""Cyberdark End Dragon"" and also is a non-once per turn negate, it can also be revived with ""Cyber Eternal"" which is how the endboard comes to be.  &nbsp;  Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon, Chimeratech Overdragon, Chimeratech rampage Dragon and Chimeratech fortress Dragon: boy that's a lot of names. The ""Chimeratech"" monsters don't really need an introduction either, but I'll skim over their effects real quick. ""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"" allows you to send a ""Cyber Dragon"" and a monster in the Extra Monster Zone from either field to the gy to summon itself, gains 1200 attack for each material used. Break boards. ""Chimeratech Overdragon"" Fusion summoned using a ""Cyber Dragon"" and any number of machine type monsters, gains 800 attack for each material and can attack that many times as well. Big number hit hard. ""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"" Fusion summoned using any 2 or more ""Cyber Dragon"" monsters, when summoned targets and destroys Spell/Trap cards up to the number of it's materials, also can allow to send up to 2 Light Machines from your deck to the gy to gives 1 additional attack for each. Small number hit many times. ""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"" Allows you to send 1 ""Cyber Dragon"" and any number of machine monsters from either field to the gy to summon itself, gains 1000 attack for each material used. Break boards again.  &nbsp;  Cyberdark Dragon: You literally never summon it. I have no idea why this is here it quite literally serves no purpose at all. Actually remove and play something better.  &nbsp;  Cyber Dragon Nova, Cyber Dragon Infinity: N E G A T E. I'm not even gonna talk about these two, if you don't know what they do you shouldn't be here to be honest. All I'm gonna say is that if you were to cut ""Cyber Dragon"" and ""Machine Duplication"" you should probably cut these two as well, unless you decide on playing ""Galaxy Soldier"" or something.  &nbsp;  Cyber Dragon Sieger: Now this is what i call battle prot. ""Cyber Dragon Sieger"" it's name becomes ""Cyber Dragon"" while on the field or gy, also once per battle phase if it didn't attack during this battle phase it allows you to target a Machine monster you control with 2100 or more attack you control that monster gains 2100 attack but neither player takes battle from ""Cyber Dragon Sieger"" during the turn you use this effect. Sieger doesn't seem like it does much but it simply existing helps this deck a ton, first off you link summon it by sending ""Cyber Dragon Core"" and ""Cyberdark Chimera"" to the gy, thus triggering Chimera's effect to foolish, and it's battle phase is very useful as well.  &nbsp;  Predaplant Verte Anaconda: No, you're not summoning Dragoon shutup. If you really want me to explain what verte does you should go watch YouTube or something. You use Verte to send either ""Overload Fusion"" or ""Cyberload fusion"" to aid you in the otk. That's literally it.  &nbsp;  And with that every single card in the deck is finally done. But we're not done yet, now i have to explain the combo move by move, so let's start.....  &nbsp;  <em><strong><span>THE MAIN COMBO.....</span></strong></em>  First you gotta have ""Cyber Dragon Core"" or a way to search it in hand and you gotta have either ""Cybernetic Horizon"" or ""Cyberdark Realm"" in your hand, you must have one of them and at least a way to search the other, you also gotta have any other monster and any other spell/trap card in your hand. Now let's make an imaginary hand, shall we?  Your hand is: ""Cyber Dragon Core"" ""Cyber emergency"" ""Cyberdark Realm"" ""Cyberdark Edge"" ""Cyber Dragon"". You go first and you do this....  1)Activate ""Cyberdark Realm"" and Search ""Cyberdark Claw"". 2) Activate ""Cyberdark Claw"" discard it and search ""Cybernetic Horizon"". 3)Activate ""Cybernetic Horizon"" send the ""Cyber Dragon"" in your hand and ""Cyberdark Horn/Keel"" from your deck to the gy, then send ""Cyber End Dragon"" to your gy and Search ""Cyberdark Cannon"". 4)Activate ""Cyberdark Cannon"" discard it and search ""Cyberdark Chimera"". 5)Activate ""Cyberdark Realm"" to normal summon ""Cyberdark Chimera"". 6)Activate ""Cyberdark Chimera"" discard ""Cyber emergency"", or any Spell/Trap card in your hand, search ""Power Bond"". 7) Normal Summon ""Cyber Dragon Core"", it's effect activates and you search ""Cyber Eternal"". 8) Link Summon ""Cyber Dragon Sieger"" using ""Cyber Dragon Core"" and ""Cyberdark Chimera"". 9)Activate ""Cyberdark Chimera"" to foolish a ""Cyberdark"" monster. 10)Now you have enough materials to summon ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"", activate""Power Bond"" and summon ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"", it's effect activates and you equip ""Cyber End Dragon"". 11) Send ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"" to the gy to summon ""Cyberdark End Dragon"". 12) Activate ""Cyberdark End Dragon"" to equip any card to it, except ""Cyber End Dragon"" and ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"". 13)Activate ""Cyber Eternal"" from your hand to bring back ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"", it's effect activates and you equip ""Cyber End Dragon"". And that's the combo. Your board now is ""Cyberdark End Dragon"", ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"" with two equip cards on field meaning two negates and ""Cyber Dragon Sieger"" for extra attack if needed. Not half bad for good ol'edgy Dragons if you ask me.  &nbsp;  <em><strong><span>AFTERTHOUGHTS.....</span></strong></em>  Don't really have much to say here that I didn't already say before except for some stuff. This is extremely flexible for the way you build it. I decided to go for a more consistent and thematically appropriate build, doesn't have much stables and dies if you sneeze on it. But a lot of the cards here can be removed and replaced with stables or even better tech cards. If i have one thing to say it's that Konami did a relatively good job with ""Cyberdarks"". Also yeah this deck dies to droll hard.  &nbsp;  Ah Finally, it's over. This took like 6 hours for me to make which makes all the more sad that no one is probably gonna read all that, not that i blame them LoL. But now I return to being depressed.  &nbsp;  <span><em><strong>THE END.</strong></em></span>  &nbsp;"

It's a simple Pendulum Beatdown deck that likes to use Normal Monsters to profit off of Pendulum effects like Dragoons of Draconia to get searches and such.  Nirvana High Paladin is only really summonable with Magicalibra or Hallo Hallo's Pendulum effect, I just like to keep him there as a boss monster though he can easily be switched for any other monster the deck can make that is cheaper than him.  Besides that it's easy to make the 3 Dracoslayer Extra Deck monsters within one turn if you have enough resources though it's nothing game breaking considering the deck doesn't try to set up anything remotely interactive. It just tries to play the game and will be sad if negated so please don't negate it. Not like it could hurt you if it actually tried so why not let it have some fun"

The Dark Magicians and Millennium Eyes-Restrict reprint when?","Before I get into the strategy of the deck, let's look at the most important card first: Fusion Parasite  This card can be used as a substitute for any 1 Fusion Material whose name is specifically listed on the Fusion Monster Card, but the other  Fusion Material(s) must be correct. Cannot be used as Fusion Metarial otherwise. If this card is Special Summons (except during the Damage Step): You can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, using monsters you control as Fusion Materials including this card  This makes basically any Fusion Monster that needs a named monster along with otherwise generic requirements summonable with it as long as we can Special Summon our Parasite while controlling another monster that fulfills the other requirements.  How can we do that as often as possible: Reviving him by any means necessary. Good thing there's a lot of traps that can accomplish just that like Back to the Front, Call of the Haunted, Limit Reverse, Graceful Revival, Oasis of Dragon Souls, Powerful Rebirth and such along with Monster Reborn, Battlewasp Arbalest the Rapidfire,  Kinka-Byo and Cross-Sheep.  However, many of those traps bring the problem with them that if the revived monster isn't destroyed they will stay on the field and clog up our backrow and how do we even intend to drop our Parasite into a position where we can revive him from in the first place?  The first problem is alleviated (but sadly not completely solved...) with Magic Planter thet gets rid of a Trap to give us 2 draws which might be new cards to revive our Parasite but he's still not in the Graveyard for said revive yet.  Here come multiple other cards into play:  We can easily Special Summon our Parasite from the deck with One for One and add him to our hand with Where arf Thou? (though that is more useful with Kinka-Byo) As for ways to dump the Parasite, we have Armageddon Knight, Dark Grepher (Reinforcement of the Army to search either of them), The Mathematician, Foolish Burial and Neos Fusion (Keeper of Dragon Magic to discard Parasite or anything else and search Neos Fusion).  So we now have enough ways to get our Parasite where we want it to be but what can we do with him now?  The two easiest Fusion Targets are Elemental Hero Brave Neos and Millennium-Eyes Restrict with Millennium-Eyes Restrict being our main play which is why we also run its support cards to efficiently cycle it.  Next we have the Fusions that require Warriors plus a named monster like Dark Cavalry (just becomes HUGE with all the backrow we're playing) and Red-Eyes Slash Dragon with Slash Dragon being one of the ""ladderable"" Fusions. We can Fusion Summon often and Slash Dragon being a Dragon enables us to use it for some more advanced plays. Never thought of hearing of a ""Fusion Ladder"" outside of a dedicated archetype like Lunalights, huh?  An honourable mention goes to Shura the Combat Star if we use Brave Neos to ladder into him since he can put on some pressure by making everything 0 ATK and floating into Idaten  Then we have the Fusions that require Spellcasters (like Millennium-Eyes Restrict) plus a named monster like Rune-Eyes Pendulum Dragon, another ladderable Dragon who's just big or the better Fusion target of this category being The Dark Magicians since they synergize REALLY well with this deck. Usually we're activating at least one backrow per turn so getting a draw out of it and if it's backrow being able to set and activate it is pretty insane. That basically equals another Fusion Summon per turn for basically no effort.  Now onto the Dragon Fusion monsters: We have Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman easy to bring out with DNA Surgery if you draw it to lock down the opponent and allow huge damage. The alternative would be Dark Magician the Dragon Knight who protects our backrow since that's the most important part of the strategy.  Link Monsters include Linkuriboh because we run our fair share of lvl 1 monsters, Cross-Sheep because it gives us a revive on Fusion Summon turning a singular Parasite Summon into 2, Seraphim Papillon because I wanted a Link 3 that was generic and it can technically revive the Parasite and Linkmail Archfiend because having a lot of Fusions is great Fodder for his effect along with him being generic as well.  Since we run Link monsters we can also play Cyberse Clock Dragon. Not necessarily for the mill but for his ability to search any spall on death and him pulling attacks at himself as long as there's a Link monster on our field which is really easy to fulfill with all the lvl 1s we revive all the time and Linkuriboh"

Dual purpose strategy: Apex Avian lockdown, combined with a synchro engine. Ideally, find Divine Wind as fast as possible, and then turbo using Harpie Dancer/Speedroids. Apex Avian can infinitely trigger with Thunderbird on the field, effectively locking down the opponent's effects. Star Staring Starling and Harpie Oracle can be used in conjunction with Swallow's Nest to drop Apex Avian onto the field.

No handtraps because i dont think they would like it that much, perhaps putting some kuribohs isnt a bad idea though. Also, since its an attempt of a competitive deck, yugi/atem asked joey to lend his red-eyes b. dragon and some of his supports, so they can summon dragoon with the power of friendship."

I have and lemme tell you, unless you cheat that train won't budge an inch from it's track.</span>  <span>If you're under the age of 18, remember the time <a data-name=""Ojama Black"">Bradley</a> threw his toy train right at your face? Remember the bubu it left, how much it hurt?</span>  <span>Either of these perfectly describes Earth Machine. It can play through handtraps, has great recursion and can deal a truckload of damage - pun intended - on the follow up.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Nothing but hot air</span>  <span>It's true. Earth Machine can easily play through one or two negates, need nothing more than a single starter and have multiple ways to navigate through their combo lines. Yet even if you run full steam ahead your combo nets you exactly zero interaction. You heard that right, this rouge tier deck does exactly nothing  to your opponent. Even Dream Mirror can pop an opponent's monster every ten games.</span>  <span>Yet this deck amasses you a lot of ressources. Remember Salamangreat? Of course you do, it's only the best deck. Technically, the Gazelle combo line nets you exactly one piece of interruption. One trap, that's all. But when was the last time you saw Salamangreat do nothing but activate one trap card? It's similar with Earth Machines. The combo draws you two cards, sets up your ressources and every card that is not a starter or extender is exactly that, interaction. You'll either start with interruption in your opening hand or draw into it.</span>  <span>And it's not just the obvious cards like <span><a data-name=""Machina Overdrive"">Machina Overdrive</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a></span>. If you open <span><a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a></span> (also your target for Overdrive) you can send it with <span><a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Double Headed Anger Knuckle</a></span> to  have it live in the GY or use <span><a data-name=""Machina Redeployment"">Machina Redeployment</a></span> to add Citadel to hand or keep the Redeployment until after you've drawn two in case you drew into a Machina card to then add Overdrive. There's plenty of ways to end on interruption and all of these are crazy strong.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Next stop, Drawtown. Population: Two.</span>  <span>Catchy name, isn't it? As for the combo you have twelve starters.</span> <span><a data-name=""Machina Metalcruncher"">Machina Metalcruncher</a></span> <span>(searched by</span> <span><a data-name=""Machina Redeployment"">Machina Redeployment</a></span><span>) and</span> <span><a data-name=""Infinitrack Harvester"">Infinitrack Harvester</a></span> <span>(searched by</span> <span><a data-name=""Heavy Forward"">Heavy Forward</a></span><span>).</span> <ol>  	<li><span>Starter adds</span> <span><a data-name=""Infinitrack Brutal Dozer"">Infinitrack Brutal Dozer</a></span></li>  	<li><span>Summon Dozer and with his effect</span> <span><a data-name=""Infinitrack Trencher"">Infinitrack Trencher</a></span> <span>(Tunneller works, too but Trencher can extend in the GY so you want access to him as early as possible.

If you open it it's best to summon it after Dozer's summon to 'chainblock' its effect), then send Gear Box to summon Bullet Train and overlay them into <span><a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora</a></span>, detaching Bullet Train. </span></li>  	<li><span>Bullet Train in GY will trigger in the EP adding you back the Gear Box or Dozer or whichever one you like best.</span></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span>During your opponent's turn you use Anger Knuckle to summon Bullet Train again to trigger it in EP, adding back the Box, triggering the Box to add</span> <span><a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Deck Disassemble</span>  <span>No I did not google how to spell disassemble. Yes I totally knew the difference between that one and dissemble.</span>  <span>Little about the Extra Deck: Knightmare Phoenix is there to have generic link material, which can be of help sometimes. <span><a data-name=""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</a></span> can easily be summoned off of Anchor Drill's level modulation and Box, summoned off of Anchor Drill. <span><a data-name=""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"">Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal</a></span> can be summoned with Anchor Drill and Harvester (or Box and Harvester). It's there to send Overdrive the the GY if you don't have it in rotation. That recycles the banished Tunneller and Trencher, allowing more flexiblity turn 2 onwards.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a></span> is great since you only need one card for your combo, although the combo itself does not OTK. But depending on the cards sent with Droplet you could end on a r10nk or have access to a r9nk to either wipe your opponent's board or OTK through it. However you could play other cards instead. Either three <span><a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a></span> or a <span><a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></span> and another <span><a data-name=""Machina Fortress"">Machina Fortress</a></span> or more trains should suffice.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Token Collector"">Token Collector</a></span> is there in anticipation of Swordsoul, which will be legal at the upcoming YCS. If you side into <span><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a></span> be mindful that you cannot summon Bullet Train if you control a monster that is not EARTH Machine. However you can send it with Anger Knuckle at the end of your combo rid yourself of it.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>A little treat for the journey ahead</span>  If you like Machines, Mechs and/or Manga: Trust me, read Heart Gear. Even if you don't like Mechs and Machines (although I doubt you've made it this far then) this is such a great Manga. The author got sick so it only has 29 chapters as of now but it's such a great piece of work. The artstyle is fantastic, using a lot of shading and grids to create astounding images. The story is captivating and interesting. It's one of my all time favorites and I thought this decklist is probably best suited to recommend it. Do yourself a favor and check it out. (In case this is not allowed: Hi mod, you're you doing? I've been great thanks for asking. Before you say anything, go ahead and give it a read. I'll take this section down if you still want me to by the end of chapter 29)"

Thats like Chicken soup without THE CHICKEN SOUP. Chaos nephthys dosent count. its like a hybrid ,"Have you ever wanted to swarm the board only to land on two 3k beatsticks? Have you ever wanted to give your Deck Dysentery only to then profit off of it by banishing the poor souls in the Graveyard for your own personal Greed, only to be Ash Blossom'd? You like Bricks? Then Boy oh Boi do I have the Deck for you!  Ok in all seriousness, It's not THAT bad, it can, as mentioned before, swarm the board with lots of cards to go into Extra Deck Plays.  This Deck's Goal is mainly to get Soldier of Chaos out with a Level 7, in order to smack your opponent in the face with a non-targetable beatSTICKK, which can either gain more ATK, a free banish or a second attack on the NEXT TURN on kill.  Chaos Ruler is here because he fits the theme of C H A O S and he can used to extend plays, reusable extra deck fodder or just as another beatSTICKK.  Utopia is here in case the Heart of the Cards has a bad day and decides to cuck you, in which case you go from Utopia to Utopia Prime AND THEN Utopia the Lighting for the sake of haveing 4 material, 2 of which are Utopia cards (Because effect). oh and Zeus... he's here too.  Kuribohble is here because he is cute, DARK Attribute and for the sake of being a kuriboh (but better).  Levianeer because why not? BLS because its FUCKEN BLS, and Lightsworn because this trainwreck needs an engine. (I dont know any other good engines that work here, dont crucify me)  so yeah... that is...that.  You'll figure the rest out, somehow... Try not to get stomped by the Meta!"

Better going first. The fusion traps are your main iniciator and therizia sets them from de,"*UPDATED POST DIFO*  Besides its a trap deck i dont feel necesary Lord of the Heavenly Prison since your main interactions happens at opponents main phase.  I prefer pot of duality in front of Porperity because sometimes the Extra Deck is a bit empty due to Dinomorphia Frenzy and the copy effect of Kentregina. On the other hand if you summoned Enforcer by his effect Duality cannot resolve so keep it in mind.  Ferret Flames is with Dinomorphia Rexstrum your better deffense.  Daigusto Emeral is a great card when you have all your material monsters in graveyard and you need recycle plus attack with Rexstrum effect and then summon Zeus over Daigusto. You can recycle all the Enforcer package too.  Torrential Tribute plays very positive since it can reniniciate the Dinomorphia effect monsters at the oponent's turn.  The main strategy with this deck is to play agressively fusion summoning at oponent's main phase while you reduce your life point to less than 2000, 1000 the better if you summon Rexstrum.  &nbsp;"

All in all this deck can beat the Meta decks very easy and you should give it a try.  For last updates you can consider <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a> in the main for TTT.

Orcust is more harder in pure but here you usually are going to normal summon Mekknight ~send Orcust Knightmare ~Summon a token with Mekknight effect ~Orcust Knightmare banish itself and send World Wand to the GY ~World Wand special summon the banished Knightmare ~now you have 3 monsters and can do any link you need. the token can be used to summon linkuriboh so 3 effect monsters.

This is my first time using Windwitch engine so i might be missing some really good card but this way works fine too.  I'm using King of the Sky Prison in the side deck because he can protect all your traps (opponent traps too) and give you a free search together with a respectable 3000 atk beatstick.  &nbsp;  GLHF"

OK, I gotta say, I really like this deck. I love the cybernetic and dinosaur-inspired designs of the monsters, as well as the nighttime city setting in the artwork! I think I could see some kanji in Therizia's artwork background.  &nbsp;  *Ahem* Anyways, this is my Dinoruffia deck. It mainly uses a pure build, but also has a small engine of 3 Solemn Judgment and 3 Solemn Strike. Dinoruffia Therizia is better for starting your plays off, because she sets a Trap from your deck. Your strategy should be to summon Kentregina as quickly as you can, and either disrupt your opponent's players or extend your own using your Trap cards.  &nbsp;  As for the title, I just couldn't think of a better name for this deck than ""Kamen Rider Tyranno.""

Turn 2: The 1 and a half card Cyberdark combo can be used to deal over 12,000 damage to the opponent, so start with this combo to bait out potential disruption, as if the opponent does nothing, you almost always win on the spot.

""Shaddoll Fusion"" is a great going second option that can gain you lots of advantage by acting as a triple foolish burial. They also provide a lot of utility, with there being a different effect for every situation.  Invoked: The power of the Invoked monsters, from ""Invoked Mechaba"" being able to negate almost anything, ""Invoked Raidjin"" being able to flip monsters face-down and stop crucial synchro, xyz or link summons and re-use Shaddoll flip monsters, and ""Invoked Purgatrio"" which can destroy well-established boards in an instant. This is all helped by the fact that ""Aleister the Invoker"" can come back to hand every turn and do the combo again and again.  Dogmatika: ""Dogmatika Punishment"" is an incredibly powerful card that can pop 2 cards on the field, and by using ""Dogmatika, Ecclesia the Virtuous"", it allows ""Dogmatika Punishment"" to be searched by ""Nadir Servant"". ""Nadir Servant"" is also an incredibly powerful card, acting as a 1 card ""El Shaddoll Winda"" and a monster negate. Activate ""Nadir Servant""; send ""El Shaddoll Apkallone"" from the extra deck to the GY to add ""Dogmatika Maximus"" from your deck to your hand. This will activate the ability of ""El Shaddoll Apkallone"", to allow you to add to your hand and then discard ""Shaddoll Schism"". Special summon ""Dogmatika Maximus"" and activate its effect; send ""El Shaddoll Construct"" and ""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"" from your extra-deck to the GY. Use the effect of ""El Shaddoll Construct"" and add back ""Shaddoll Schism"" from your GY to your hand and set it. During the end phase; activate the ability of ""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"" to add ""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted"" from your deck to your hand. This combo also provides a lot of versatility, as cards such as ""Elder Entity N'tss"" and ""Albion the Branded Dragon"" can be sent to the GY to destroy cards or to make use of the Despia engine.  Despia: The power of the fusion monster ""Despian Quaeritis"" itself justifies the use of this engine, as being able to stop opponent's monsters being able to beat over more vunerable monsters you control is very useful. In addition to this, it is very easy to summon due to ""Aluber, Jester of Despia"", which can immedietly add the fusion spell from your deck to the hand, and recurs itself when a fusion is destroyed, and then on top negates a monster's effects.

Cards such as ""Old Vindictive Magician"" and ""Exiled Force"" provide ways to out opponent's challenging monsters. With the power of traps, ""Jinzo"" both neutralises trap decks and acts as a 2400 beater.  Spells: Many spells are here for consistency, such as ""Reinforcement of the Army"", and to grab cards that can work in any situation. ""Heavy Storm"" and ""Giant Trunade"" act as backrow removal, and allow easy damage with the Chaos monsters. ""Snatch Steal"" and ""Brain Control"" can utilise the most powerful monsters the opponent may summon and use them against them.  Traps: These traps are all very high impact on the opponent's field, and result in huge gains in card advantage and easy damage for OTKs.  Side Deck: ""Skill Drain"", ""Spell Canceller"" and ""Royal Decree"" are useful against monster, spell and trap heavy decks respectively. Cards such as ""Injection Fairy Lily"" and ""Creature Swap"" help for dealing a lot of damage.  Weaknesses: Stall decks that inflict lots of burn damage (sometimes difficult to out their protection in the form of ""Swords of Revealing Light"" or ""Level Limit - Area B"")"

Cards such as ""Virtual World Mai-Hime - Lulu"", ""Emergency Teleport"" and ""Virtual World Gate - Qinglong"" give the deck great consistency, while the other Virtual World monsters allow for quick field swarming and get the Virtual World spell/traps in the GY quickly. One of the best elements of the deck is it's recovery, with cards such as ""Virtual World Xiezhi- Jiji"" that allow you to add Virtual World monsters back to tour hand from the GY in the end phase, and ""Virtual World Gate - Chuche"" that can shuffle your banished Virtual World cards into the deck to give you almost unlimited resources.  Tech choices: By using ""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"" to send ""Necroworld Banshee"" from your deck to the GY, you can activate ""Zombie World"", a card that can kill various meta decks such as Tri-Brigade. It can also send ""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"" which you can use ""Dragonlark Pairen"" to revive from the GY. ""Gaia Dragon, the Thunder Charger"" gives your ""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"" one more overlay unit to wipe the field with. ""Muddy Mudragon"" can fuse with any DARK monster, usually ""Ultimaya Tzolkin"" to form ""Invoked Caliga"", which allows each player only one monster effect and attack per turn, which cards like ""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"" and ""Solemn Strike"" can stop easily.  The side deck contains some cards that can be exchanged with ""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"" for other floodgate effects.  Weaknesses: Destroying the first summon or Virtual World Gate (needs other Virtual World cards on the field to start combos), banishing floodgates (the Virtual World Gates need to be in GY to activate), ""Nibiru, the Primal Being"" (if you cannot use the ability of ""Ultimaya Tzolkin"" before the fifth summon)."

The main combo which opens up with One For One or Unexpected Dai this is easy to follow and has a lot of different routes you can take depending the cards in hand or the end board you want. To start activate <a data-name=""One For One"">One For One</a> or <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a> to bring out <a data-name=""Sunseed Genius Loci"">Sunseed Genius Loci</a>, link summon into <a data-name=""Sunavalon Dryas"">Sunavalon Dryas</a> and activate its effect adding <a data-name=""Sunvine Sowing"">Sunvine Sowing</a> to hand. Activate the Sowing bringing out <a data-name=""Sunseed Twin"">Sunseed Twin</a> to the left or right of the Dryas. You take 1000 dmg and activate the effects of the Dryas and the Twins. Chain link 1 the Twins to bring Loci back to the field to the other side of the Dryas then chain link 2 the Dryas to heal back the 1000 LP. Link summon <a data-name=""Sunvine Healer"">Sunvine Healer</a> below the Dryas and activate its effect adding you 300 LP (during this stage of the combo if <a data-name=""Aromage Laurel"">Aromage Laurel</a> or <a data-name=""Rose Girl"">Rose Girl</a> are in hand you can activate their effects to help swarm the field). Use the Dryas and the Healer to link summon <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a>, activate the effect of Jasmine to send the Twins to grave netting you a <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a> from deck. Link summon the Loci for another Dryas in the Jasmine arrow zone. Activate the effect of Lonefire tributing itself to bring <a data-name=""Mudan the Rikka Fairy"">Mudan the Rikka Fairy</a> to the field, this triggers Mudan's effect to add <a data-name=""Rikka Glamour"">Rikka Glamour</a> to hand. Activate Glamour, tributing Mudan to add <a data-name=""Primula The Rikka Fairy"">Primula The Rikka Fairy</a> and <a data-name=""Cactus Bouncer"">Cactus Bouncer </a>to hand, chain the Primula to special summon itself. Link Summon <a data-name=""Sunavalon Melias"">Sunavalon Melias</a> using the Jasmine and the Primula, this will trigger the effect of Melias bringing out Loci again from the grave. Link summon <a data-name=""Sunavalon Dryatrentiay"">Sunavalon Dryatrentiay</a> using the Dryas from before and the Melias you just brought out. On summon Dryatrentiay's effect triggers adding <a data-name=""Sunavalon Bloom"">Sunavalon Bloom</a> to hand. Set Bloom then link summon <a data-name=""Sunvine Thrasher"">Sunvine Thrasher</a> using the Loci, this activates its effect boosting it's attack equal to its link rating making it a 4000 Atk beat stick. Finally use your normal summon to bring out the Cactus Bouncer. This means on your opponents turn they will not be able to special summon monsters, and on the activation of of Bloom the effects of all monsters they currently control are negated and during battle Dryatrentiay gains attack equal to the combined attack of all monsters it points to in this case 5800, plus with Sowing in grave if a plant monster you control would be destroyed by card effect you can banish Sowing to negate your plant monsters destruction. Regarding this deck <a data-name=""Danger! Bigfoot"">Danger! Bigfoot</a> adds a beater and draw engine to the end board, and the other monsters in there are great extenders. The Extra Deck is pretty tight but <a data-name=""Queen Of Thorns"">Queen Of Thorns</a> works well when your opponent specials from hand alot and <a data-name=""Benghalancer The Resurgent"">Benghalancer The Resurgent</a> is good for going second and getting a dangerous effect monster off the field. Downsides to this deck are pretty apparent it's easily disrupted by cards like Ash Blossom or Nibiru and it takes a good hand to be able to go second. All in all it's cheap but a really fun and rewarding build when you get the combo off."

The idea is to play dragoon in your first turn, alongside with your dark magician cards to stun your opponent and remove their cards and oblitarate to bounce your opponent monsters back to their hand. This deck has pot and jar of avarice to recycle your exodia pieces and other important cards, while gaining card advantage. The eye of timaeus allows me to summon not only dragoon but other powerful monsters as well like dark magician the dragon knight, who alongsidewith eternal soul perform a lockdown so he and dark magicians you control become imune to your opponent cards, while your spell/traps become imune to target and destroying effects. Also i run secret village of spellcasters, that can lock any non spellcaster deck from playing spell cards."

The deck is relatively consistent, with cards such as ""Magician's Rod"" and ""Soul Servant"" to increase the likelyhood of winning. ""The Eye of Timaeus"" and ""Secrets of Dark Magic"" both allow access to various toolbox extra deck monsters that Dark Magician has, from ""Dark Paladin"" being able to wipe out all dragon decks in one hit, to ""Dark Magician Girl, the Dragon Knight"", which is a great control card that can help you slowly out-resource your opponent. ""Destined Rivals"" is one of two ""Skill Drain""-like cards this deck has to offer, at the mere cost of controlling ""Dark Magician"". The card is searchable by most of the searchers in the deck, and is very useful when going first against a combo deck.  Buster Whelp: This simple engine allows for the second ""Skill Drain""-like effect, plus a few big monsters that can potentially wipe your opponent out in one shot. For the combo, all your require is ""Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman"". Normal summon ""Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman"" and use it's ability to add ""Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman"" from your deck to your hand and set it. Link summon ""Linkuriboh"" and end your turn. During your opponent's turn, activate your set ""Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman"" to send ""Buster Blader"" and ""Destruction Sword Memories"" from your deck to the GY, and chain the ability of ""Destruction Sword Memories"" in the GY, to banish ""Buster Blader"" and ""Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman"". When the chain resolves, this will summon both ""Buster Dragon"" and ""Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman"".  Weaknesses: ""Imperial Order"" and ""Anti-Spell Fragrance"" (the deck relies heavily on spells to search cards), destroying a face-up ""Eternal Soul"" (wipes your entire field), negating the firs few searches (the deck really needs to get rolling at the start otherwise it is hard to pick up the pace)."

Unlike ones we have seen like ""Tri-Brigade"", ""Salamangreat"", and ""Agents""; Swordsoul is not as bipolar with their options, and has a very straightforward arsenal. Does the TCG often call something straightforward a winning strategy with? No, not since 2008. However, ""Swordsoul/Xiangjian"" has the honor of being the first of its kind in years for this feat that decks like CHAOS control and TeleDAD has done in it's reign.  LV8 synchro monsters are played like they're going out of style for this deck; however if you are a charlatan (or haven't played in the Zexal era), you maybe familiar with the Draglubion package (TL;DR Number 97 is ranked and goes into either Number 38, or another XYZ Dragon that is also a Number monster). I'm not gonna take time to sugarcoat the rest for you because it is just as similar as the day it has been released in the OCG; but we get 3 ""Crossout Designator"", a banlist that is more of a nuance than a threat, and anything but Maxx ""C"". Also ""Pot of Desires"" is in there at 2 copies because it's a waste of resources playing 3 (my advice is to play ""Triple Tactics Talent"" over this if you want your Crossouts to have more targets to dispose)."

It pumps out fusions using either player's graveyard and has one linear combo line. But what if you wanted to play it pure? Well boy do it have some terrible news for you. Introducing the epitome of rage quits and mechaba pass, behold Chris Hansen Invoked (get it because they are ghost girls)! This utter mistake of a deck was inspired by DistantCoder's pure invoked deck but somehow I made it so much worse. In essence the deck is essentially just mechaba pass turbo but sometimes you open well and you can make double mechaba pass and overlay for VFD (when he was legal) or just skip mechaba outright and make Cocytus. The Chris Hansen part is the 22 loli handtraps that you can use to interrupt once you've used your mechaba negate. Ratios don't matter anymore and I side in dragoon and 3 cherries against dragoon decks. Just play whatever handtraps you want.  If you're that guy who played cydra with me in a tag duel you were a great partner."

Not to a Meta-degree, mind you, but they actually have a solid strategy that can become a huge headache for your opponents in duels. After paying a visit to HouseofCard's YT channel, gleaning some ideas and playtesting the deck, I have found his deck to be quite substantial for all of your cartoony shenanigan needs.  Basic idea: The ideal board is you with a Toon Kingdom in your field zone, adequate GY setup with a Toon Bookmark in there, and a beefy boss monster such as Toon Black Luster Soldier or Toon DM out, with a Toon Terror in your backrow because omni-negates are fun.  <strong>Go first or second? </strong>Always go <strong>second</strong>. Your deck is geared towards clearing house before you do anything substantial, plus the Dark Ruler No More cards/Nibirus are there to mess with players who summon a billion times on their turn. Plus, save for Toon BLS, Toons can't attack on the first turn they're summoned anyway. The idea is to wreck their board and resources on your turn, and go for the kill on your next.  <strong>Strategy: </strong>If going second, your opponent will likely have a substantial board. Judge first if any monsters there have <em>[Quick Effects] </em>that will disrupt your plays, ESPECIALLY negates. If so, slap a Dark Ruler No More down first. If your opponent has backrow, use a Lightning Storm to sweep them off.  You might think that this is where you start going hog wild with searches via Toon Bookmark/Toon Table of Contents, but be cautious. If you have Toon Kingdom, try baiting with that and see if your opponent tries to axe it. If they do, and you have a searcher, you can just fetch another. Then, try using Contents to bait out any Ash Blossom cards. Remember, Contents can be used more than once, but it's the Bookmark that'll hurt if they counter that with Ash Blossom.  If you start off with a Toon Table of Contents, the idea is to ALWAYS fetch Bookmark FIRST <em>(you want your GY to be prepared to save Toon Kingdom)</em> and then use that to search for Toon Kingdom. Or, if you have Kingdom already, Page-Flip. THIS is your playmaker right here.  When using Page-Flip, always go for the big three: Red-Eyes Toon Dragon, Toon Dark Magician, or Toon Black Luster Soldier. Two are easy field setup cards that can cheat out your boss monster <em>(the aforementioned Toon Black Luster Soldier) </em>while the latter is, at its strongest, an untargetable 3000 ATK beatstick with the ability to attack directly OR easy card removal. Ideally, the safest bet is Toon Dark Magician, since he can also fetch support as well.  Briefcase and Toon Terror are ideal for removing problem cards that your opponent may attempt to play to start dismantling your board. Please, for the love of God, do NOT use Briefcase flippantly or you will regret it, save it for a REALLY nasty monster that can lead to bad things happening to your side. Terror is there to stop effects from destroying or removing Toon Kingdom <em>(because part and parcel of playing Toons is, as Rank10YGO once put it, a game of 'Protect the Castle.')</em>  The Extra Deck is really there for a few reasons: Rank 7 plays to make your opponent's life as miserable as possible, Bahamut Shark/Toadally Awesome engine to accommodate the Toon Mermaids, a bunch of cards -in case- something goes wrong, but mostly, fodder for Prosperity's drawing effect. That said, remember to NEVER sack important cards like Number 11: Big Eye for that card's effect.  I've put some cards in the side deck that may come in handy. The Cyber Dragon engine may be a bit dated, but it still comes in handy for clutch plays. You MAY want to add an Instant Fusion &amp; Panzer Dragon in there, since sadly that's a small oversight that I made."

I've been curious about Appliancer archtype since i first saw Laundry Dragon card desing, but only today i went make a deck and, to my surprise, Appliancer is not a bad deck (pure is bad) :)  There's no secret in Appliancer, you summon Socketroll's and link summon as many link 1's you wish, this was what i thought, but after searching more i perceived that Appliancer is not limited only to his only archtype or type and can summon 4+ monster in a turn without locking you like other decks so, if you use Codebraker engine you can do some crazy stuff like make 2 link 4 in a turn.  The goal here is get 4 monster in the field to use the Codebraker combo and end with either Apollousa co-linked to a Knightmare Phoenix (first turn) or Accesscode Talker and Codebraker Virus Berserker for a Otk. But unfortunately appliancers have only 2 reliable monsters and don't have many ways to search them alone besides the field spell so sometimes you will only got spells that don't do nothing alone like Where arf Thou and no monster to use it, so to fill that hole in Appliancers i added a control layer in the deck.  But lets say that you have a good hand, with Parallel eXced and 2 Socketroll :), this is the combo: Normal summon Socketroll ~special summon your other Socketroll ~the first Socketroll activates it effect and special summon one more Socketroll ~link summon Celtopus ~Activate Parallel eXced from your hand and special summon another Parallel ~link summon Codebreaker Virus Swordsman using 2 non-link monsters and place Virus Swordsman in THE BOTTOM LINK MARKER OF CELTOPUS, be sure to not forget this ~Virus Swordsman special summon Codebreaker Zero Day ~link summon Codebreaker Virus Berserker using Swordsman and Zero day only, PLACE IT IN THE BOTTOM LINK MARKER OF CELTOPUS TOO ~Virus Berserker summon Swordsman and Zero day back to the field ~now you can chose your path according to your turn, if you are going first ~link summon Knightmare Unicorn using one of the link 2 and Zero Day ~link summon Accesscode Talker with Unicorn and the last link 2 ~wipe the board with Accesscode and won the game, if you are going first you will need to be more specific in what you gonna do because it requires you to ~Link summon Knightmare Phoenix using Virus with another Day Zero and place it in the BOTTOM LINK MARKER OF CELTOPUS, again, then link summon Apollousa using Celtopus and Virus Swordsman and PUT APOLLOUSA ON TOP OF PHOENIX this gives you 2 monster negates and Apollousa stay protected against battle. In this exemple i ended with 1 extra monster, when this happens you can include them to Apollousa link summoning to get more negates.  I was thinking about using Jester Cofit and Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians to have more consistency and a even easier link four.  Very funny deck.

This is the first deck I'm building after taking a long time off of the game. That being said, the extra and side decks will most likely be tweaked once I see how it runs.

For those who don’t know the Magistus archetype is a series of level 4 spellcaster support with the gimmick of generating advantage through attaching monsters in the extra deck. Zoroa, the Magistus of Flames is a standout card in the archetype. He can special a level 4 spellcaster when he’s equipped with a magistus AND equip himself with a Magistus monster from the extra deck. He is great for simplifying  gamestates, extending plays, and the fact that he’s a level 4 tuner gives him huge versatility. In BODE we’re getting the new synchro Zoroa who can single-handedly lock your opponent out of the game. The Magistus although powerful don’t really have a way to get the ball rolling and start generating a lot of cards by themselves so they’re just begging to be paired with something powerful.  Pendulum Magicians are something powerful. In this deck the normal summon is already hugely impactful, and essentially being able to do it again with a pendulum summon gives combos near limitless potential while also providing a stable way to continually generate advantage once the cards are set up.  The charmers are in here because they make Zoroa plays much better. Awakening of the possessed is the absurd card in this set though. Both it’s effects are very strong, as 1850 monsters are readily available and we do play all 6 types. Think about it, 3 monsters with different types represent 2700 atk from  this card alone. This makes our end monsters beefy and you cant complain when you’re drawing an extra card every turn.  This deck can do some really cool different combos and put up a lot of interruption, sometimes through interruptions. It can also play the control game through cards like Time Pendulumgraph or just straight up lock your opponent out of the game with Archnemeses Protos or Secret Village. Every game feels fun, but sometimes I do feel sorry for the person on the receiving end.  Well that’s all, I hope you have fun, let me know how you like it."

It was a blind 2nd deck back then, and very inconsistent due to its lack of access to the field spell (people played foolish burial goods back then, just to indicate how desperate they were).  To my surprise, no one considers it a going 2nd deck any more after the new support, something which I consider very odd. It is the same deck as the one upon release, just much much much better.  <strong>Deck</strong> <ul>  	<li>3x @ignister pikachu: standard.</li>  	<li>3x @ignister charizard: standard.</li>  	<li>2x @ignister purple: quite standard. I say quite because some people play it at 1 with the obvious pros and cons. I like it at 2 because it is actually a really good card in hand and another copy comes in handy as well for the follow up turn.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister green: standard.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister earth: standard (some people play the water lvl 1).</li>  	<li>1x @ignister gatchiri: standard.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister danmari: standard.</li>  	<li>3x nibiru: one of my favourite cards in the deck. Some couple remarks below. <ul>  	<li>Blow out if resolves. Notice the use of security dragon to get it of your field.</li>  	<li>Suppose you have the link 6 on the field upon activation. The board clears but the link 6 stays because of unaffectedness.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>2x ash: -.</li>  	<li>1x pankratops: highly underrated imo. Do notice the conflict with transcode talker and AI meet you (does not come up much, but better safe than sorry).</li>  	<li>3x dark ruler no more: -.</li>  	<li>3x cynet mining: -.</li>  	<li>3x field spell + 1x terraform: -.</li>  	<li>3x AI meet you: -.</li>  	<li>2x AIdle reborn (including monster reborn: -.</li>  	<li>3x imperm: -.</li>  	<li>3x evenly: obviously insane. Do notice that you can use @ignister charizards 2nd effect to destroy your own monster in battle phase, to clear your half of the field to meet the cards activation requirement.</li>  	<li>1x red reboot: obviously insane, since wind pegasus is always a part of your combo for a backrow pop 4 which can't be stopped.</li> </ul> extra deck <ul>  	<li>3x dark infant: notice my endboard below why I play so many.</li>  	<li>1x link spider: in case you get nibirud.</li>  	<li>1x cyberse wicckid: standard.</li>  	<li>1x security dragon: to get your own nibiru of the field. Also just a really nice card to bounce windas, big tokens of whatever in case you really have to.</li>  	<li>2x splash mage: standard.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister dark templar: standard.</li>  	<li>1x transcode talker: standard.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister fire phoenix: to search @ignister charizard.</li>  	<li>1x firewall dragon: see endboard below.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister arrival cyberse: standard.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister light dragon: one of, if not the, most underrated card in the deck. Non targeting pop, build in protection, and revival effect during battle phase. Allows you to OTK against empty boards.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister wind pegasus: standard. DONT forget its second effect in graveyard, absolute killing.</li> </ul> <strong>Endboard</strong>  requirements: <ul>  	<li>1,5 card combo</li>  	<li>Any of the following: @ignister pikachu, charizard, purple, field spell, AIdle reborn, cynet mining</li> </ul> board (GOING 2ND remember): <ul>  	<li>4 card backrow pop</li>  	<li>3 card non targeting monster pop</li>  	<li>board <ul>  	<li>@ignister link 6 in extra monster zone with 4K ATK</li>  	<li>firewall dragon below it (2x co-linked)</li>  	<li>dark infant @ignister to the right of firewall dragon</li>  	<li>omni negate in graveyard from @ignister danmari</li>  	<li>shuffle back from @ignister wind pegasus</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>Final comments</strong>  I want to tell a lot more about the card choices I made, the combos, etc, but I don't have the space nor time to do so.  Maybe the big takeway is that @ignister was a blind 2nd deck on release, and it still is now but just much better.  Also realize that this build is <strong>NOT</strong> designed to OTK, let me emphasize this clearly (hence 3x dark ruler, 3x evenly). The idea is more that no matter the matchup, whether this is combo or backrow or stun, you have very generic outs to all these decks. If you do play against a slow deck, then red reboot / evenly / @ignister wind pegasus should be a blow out, while if you play against combo, the nibirus, dark rulers, pankratops are all very nice.  I hope that you guys enjoy my build! I Worked quite hard on it, with quite some playtesting, and I genuinely believe that going 2nd decks do have something unique to offer, in particular this archetype.  Cheers,  Adriaan"

I aim to make a Frightful - Despia or something like that in my next deck.  As i said before, Despia is a generic fusion archtype, and being generic means that they have someway to search themselvesv and can fusion summon monsters outside his own archetype, the first requirement is easily filled with Despia Opening, Aluber the Jester of Despia and Despian tragedy all these three cards can search Despia cards, for the second requirement you have the field spell that is a searchable fusion gate and the fusion monsters (the field spell alone already justitfy using a 5-7 card engine).  The pattern combo is fusion summon something using Dramaturge of Despia to special summon Dramaturge from the gy and get +1, you can attain this with many combinations of cards like Aluber+Opening, Dramaturge+Opening, Dramaturge + Aluber, etc...

It's a little weird to pilot mostly because often the best plays with any given hand are the simplest. It's important to go into the Sheou early for the omni negate both for protection and also because when you either normal the rokket synchron or use the rokket tracer effect it locks you into darks and therefore out of Sheou. Your combo hands  are very dependant on your opening hand, and this deck does brick a little more than either pure maids or dragon link, but the fact that you can end on three negates two bounces a +1 during your opponents standby going first and break any board with less than three or four negates going second make it worth playing imo.  I think there's a lot of play in the ratios of specifically the dragonmaid spell and trap cards because they're as searchable as they are, so in games two and three you can bring in say three nibiru over either a chaos space or a noctovision, a hospitality, and a tidying and still have enough gas to out grind most opponents because of the repeatability of your dragonmaid monsters. It's also very important to have a critical mass of lights and darks in your deck so you could potentially find room for a skull meister in the side over the lancea if tri-brigade gets hit at some point."

(Recommended for online simulator play only)","A Darklord variant that seeks to abuse powerful cards like ""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS- Sky Thunder"" and ""Diviner of the heralds"" in order to make up for their own inconsistencies and lack of an end board. The deck uses many drawing cards, like ""Allure of Darkness"" and ""Trade-In"" to cycle through the deck and set up the graveyard for the standard combos, discussed below:  The deck seeks to put either 2 level 8 or level 10 monsters on the board in order to quickly rank up multiple times, ending on a ""Number 77: The Seven Sins"" which can then attack and go in a Zeus capable of multiple effect uses in a single turn.  The setup done can also mean many more Zeus' in later turns, thanks to the Darklord cards. ""Darklord Superbia"" is a key card in this deck, allowing you to special any fairy from grave when special summoned from grave. The 6 cards included in the deck that can special it from grave are ""World legacy succession"", ""Monster reborn"" and ""Darklord contact"", which can be searched by your 3 copies of ""Banishment of Darklords"". The normal combo includes ""Darklord Ixchel"", ""Diviner of the herald"" and any of the 6 grave revival cards mentioned, preferably ""Monster reborn"" or ""Contact"". Normal summon ""Diviner"" and send ""Superbia"". Diviner becomes lvl 10. Then use ""Ixchel"" to pitch herself and another Darklord card from your hand to grave, then use the revival card on ""Superbia"" to summon it and then ""Ixchel"" from grave. It's recommended at this point, to use ""Ixchel's"" monster effect, which pays 1000LP to target and copy a ""Darklord"" S/T in your GY and apply it's effect, and then shuffle it into the deck. It's worth noting that using a Darklord monster effect to copy ""Contact"" and special ""Superbia"" will cause it to miss timing, essentially wasting the effect. Use it on ""Banishment"" if you can. Then summon ""Number 35"", Rank up into ""Number 84"" and finish on ""Number 77"" and attack, finishing with a 5-mat Zeus. If you go for ""Dingirsu"" with level 8s instead, just repeat the same thing.  *Important to note*  If you summoned ""Indulged Darklord"" in the same turn you wish to summon and use ""Zeus"" or ""Dingirsu"", you cannot use their effects as they lock you into DARK fairy effects for the rest of the turn. Darklord monster that pay 1000 to copy S/T effects in grave can only be special summoned once per turn, a clause that hurts the normal ""Darklord"" strategy. You can also summon ""Forbidden Maiden"" and search ""Droplets"", then use it for link mat for ""Condemned Darklord"" which can provide alternate ways to set up your graveyard for the combo. The lack of a side deck is due to the fact that it typically goes 2cnd, seeing as it literally can not do anything impactful turn one, so just put generic going second cards in there and feel free to switch them out for ""Droll and Lock bird"" and the forbidden cards."

How fast I am? I'm fast as fuck BOIIIIIIIIIIIII!,"By the time you read this article, FA Hang On Mach will have been banned for crimes against humanity. and also being a floodgate.  Do you Skate fast? Do you summon Stardust Dragon /Assault Mode? Is your sole goal in Yu-Gi-Oh to style on your opponent as hard as possible? Well, FA Speedroid is absolutely dripping with 90's energy, and may be the deck for you. Boasting a 3-2 record in cup, this deck is proven to be at least as good as Sonic 3d Blast, that is to say a solid 6/10 but beloved by many. <h2>Gameplan:</h2> It goes without saying that this deck's gameplan is to Synchro Summon, we are running an incredibly loaded tuner in Auto Nav, and are also running Psi-Reflector and Speedroid engines so we can Synchro Summon <em>even more. </em>A large part of what sets this list apart from other Synchro-Focused decks, is a combination of flexibility in the synchros we can make, thanks to FA level modulation, as well as a strong recursivness in our plays, thanks to the GY effects of cards such as Auto Nav, Pit-Stop, Test Run, and even Speedroid Den-Den-Daiko-Duke. <h2>Combos:</h2> As alluded to by the aforementioned flexibility, this deck can do many things with any given hand. Here I will list a few solid options to get you started. It should be noted that any combination of Auto Nav + Field Spell, or UA Hyper Stadium + a UA or an FA is your most common starter, and can pivot in to nearly anything the deck makes <h4>Garden Rose Flora:</h4> Garden Rose Flora is a relatively new card, and the end point of the deck's safest and most generally applicable combo. From Nav + Field, you do the following: <ol>  	<li> Normal Summon Auto Nav</li>  	<li>Add UA Hyper Stadium (Which is always treated as an FA card) if you did not already have it, otherwise add an FA Field of your choice (Situational, another Hyper Stadium is the safest, but you can also a ""true"" FA field for step 6)</li>  	<li> Add a Level 4 FA or UA with the effect of Hyper Stadium (There are slight implications to which you choose, but any completes the combo)</li>  	<li>Use the second effect of Hyper Stadium for an extra Normal Summon</li>  	<li>Synchro Summon Garden Rose Flora</li>  	<li>You can optionally activate another ""true"" FA field here in order to get it's search effect by popping it with Flora.</li>  	<li>Pop your field with Flora for the Level 2 Rose Token, You can take your FA search here if applicable, Pit Stop, Test Run, and Hyper Stadium are generally good searches</li>  	<li>In your opponent's Main Phase, after they have passed their priority, you can flex in to ANY synchro 7, Typically FA Dawn Dragster or Black Rose Moonlight Dragon.</li> </ol> This same line can be achieved with Hyper Stadium + a Level 4 by searching Auto Nav with Stadium, and then continuing from step 4. <h4>FA Motorhome Transport:</h4> Because sometimes you just need a big, hard to out stick. This combo starts the same way as the Garden Rose Flora Combo, but must have access to a Level 4 FA and One of the two FA fields that increase level in Main Phase Specifically, Preferably City Grand Prix. From Nav + Hyper Stadium: <ol>  	<li> Normal Summon Auto Nav</li>  	<li>Add FA City Grand Prix</li>  	<li> Activate UA Hyper Stadium, adding a Level 4 FA</li>  	<li>Use the second effect of Hyper Stadium for an extra Normal Summon</li>  	<li>Normal Summon your Level 4 FA.</li>  	<li>Activate FA City Grand Prix, <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: </strong>Activating the Level Modulation effect of your FA here makes synchro 10, this is a cool option but not in this combo.</li>  	<li>Your FA is now 6 and Auto Nav is 3, Synchro 9 for Motorhome Transport</li>  	<li>You now have a Motorhome Transport which is Level 11 in the Main and Battle Phases, and cannot be targetted because of City Grand Prix, and is indestructible by it's own effect. a certified unkillable boss.</li> </ol> This combo can also be done from Hyper Stadium + A Level 4 FA by adding Auto Nav. <h4>Speedroid Combos:</h4> No. I don't have the mental fortitude to explain these, sorry. <h2>Conclusion:</h2> This deck is extremely fun to play and provides a certain depth and player expression in it's piloting that many other modern decks don't have. It also goes through 17 steps just to end on something similar in power to what most other decks do in 3, but it definitely has a certain charm to it that can't be denied, and I hope somebody sees this list and tries to pick it up."

This deck takes advantage of Normal Monsters to get around the Summon Limit and pull off powerful combos an,"This list is one that I've been pretty dedicated to regarding Trinity and only continues to be optimized and improved with each banlist change, taking in the little side adjustments to make it better. While the deck has plenty of resources and ways of going about building it, this setup is the baseline for what I consider to be a pretty effective start for a Trinity ""World Chalice"" Deck centered around the aforementioned archetype.  <span><strong>Pros:</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><span>Non-linear Midgame</span>: This makes disruption windows and timing very frustrating for your opponent, especially since any two monsters usually can convert into a lot more than what they might've been expecting. You can really take someone off guard by just bringing out cards in your Extra Deck that weren't shown off before, for example: the Rasterliger who often takes so many games from my opponents just because it's a ""free, budget Accesscode.""</li>  	<li><span>Strong Starts</span>: Since this deck operates around combo theories, your openers will usually be some form of disruption that doubles as a means of putting out 2-3 bodies and setting up modes of revival for follow-up plays. If you happen to be unlucky, you can still end on 2-3 bodies, or just the Berserker and be content sometimes; though, engine access is prefered.</li>  	<li><span>Explosive Combos</span>: The combo lines in this deck get pretty crazy pretty quickly, just after 1 resolution of Lib, Ib, or Chalice in the Graveyard. The 2nd search pretty much opens up a vast amount of lines that often makes the deck difficult to pilot, especially in the way of disruption and/or adversity.</li> </ul> <span><strong>Cons:</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><span>Normal Monsters</span>: These guys do have the major downside of not being a handtrap, having innate effects, or being super valuable in a topdeck scenario as they still just are vanillas. While opening several in the same hand usually is a combo line thanks to Imduk, there are often times where just having too few or too many Normals can make hands seriously clunky, especially with no extenders and/or follow-up.</li>  	<li><span>Openers Are Everything</span>:  Not opening correctly or getting yourself on the map with this deck will put you pretty far behind in Modern Trinity; though, that's kind of a thing to be said regarding just about every strong deck in the format. You'll need to take your best discretion regarding the best opener for the given matchup and consider the direction the game might go, ESPECIALLY if you're going 2nd.</li>  	<li><span>Summon Limit</span>: While the Summon Limit often will be the thing we're exploiting with this list, it's important to always keep it in mind as it is still the limiting factor and the monsters being used for the combo lines aren't exactly the beefiest to end on like a Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Plan your lines and alternative pivots accordingly, else you might find yourself just making a Berserker of the Tenyi and passing, or much, much worse.</li> </ul> Now with that out of the way, let's get into some of the demo setups you'll be wanting to aim for.  <hr /> <p><span><strong>OPENERS</strong></span></p> The hand quality and/or number of extenders in the hand will always make the permuations of the gamestates more or less challenging to emulate; though, this much was obvious. That being said, in the 1st turns of the duel, you ideally want to get your engines rolling. This can be enabled by the following: <ul>  	<li><strong>Link Summoning Halqibrax as Summon 3 or Lower:</strong> The less summons used, the more things you can get done along the way, for example: making Ib and using her as material for Halqi so you can Special Summon a World Chalice Monster in addition to Halqi's on-summon effect. If you have an excess summon, it's best to just summon the handtrap Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit, as she doubles as a potential disruption while face-up on the field. If not, Guardragon Justicia will suffice. Just be mindful to try and keep at least 1 copy in the deck at all times if you can afford to because of Carboneddon. Draconnet falls under this category as well, but is less dependant on Justicia as we have Crowned as a back-up.</li>  	<li><strong>Link Summoning I:P Masquerena using Ib:</strong> This will allow you to summon Lee, the World Chalice Fairy from the deck, add either Guardragon or World Legacy - ""World Chalice"" to hand, and during the opponent's turn, simply make a Knightmare Unicorn or Phoenix based on the situation. Discard the added card to provide yourself with follow-up during your turn and disrupting the opponent at the same time, making the cost to discard a positive rather than a negative. Alternatively, if you can afford to hold said Chalice that was added via the Lee, being able to Tribute Summon it on the following turn allows you to use Lee in the GY to send it away and trigger the effect to Special 2 World Chalice monsters from the deck, all in 1 Summon (assuming you summon 2 Normal Monsters).</li>  	<li><strong>Imduk Double Summon a ""World Chalice"" / Special Summon into Tribute Summon ""World Chalice:""</strong> While the latter method of Special Summoning first is preferred (via something like Emergency Teleport for example), it's not always going to be an option with the baseline build. If you can pull it off, you have probably successfully FTK'd your opponent, unless they're able to blow you out somehow. Since this is the ideal scenario, let's look at the former instead. The Imduk Double Summon will put you on 2 Summons. If you DID NOT open a 2nd World Chalice Normal Monster in the hand, then it makes Tributing over Imduk even more costly as removing the World Chalice will require going into Almiraj, which will default the play to walling up with some Crowned or just settling for Berserker and passing. Remember, you want to get World Chalice to resolve and put it in the GY. It's fine to settle for less if it means you're still pushing your engine along. If you do happen to have a 2nd Normal in the hand, then upon floating the Imduk away as a Tribute Summon, you can Special that Normal Monster, make LANphorhyncus, then go into Lib, setting up a dangerous follow-up and Link-4 play.</li> </ul> Recognizing any of the above situations to be possible within the first turn you can play is vital to a powerful opener across almost every build of a ""World Chalice"" focused deck. If you're able to pull off these gamestates, you can definitely snowball the advantage and keep up with the viable decks in the format (usually anyway). <p><span><strong>MIDGAME</strong></span></p> The permutations midgame are far too complex to jot down here and vary based on your Extra Deck line-up (mainly the Link Monsters and Synchro 6-10 options you slotted in). I'll just highlight the star players to look for so you can get a general idea of the sequences you'll want to run through. <ul>  	<li><strong>Looping Lib: </strong>Resolving this card once in Trinity is strong on its own. Resolving both effects can be game-winning (or swinging). Resolving the search effect twice or more in a single duel can be a death sentence. The World Legacy cards can be extremely high-value, and so long as Trap Globe remains in the deck, you have the ability to go well beyond the average grind games of similar combo-based strategies. Just try not to be too greedy with Lib. This isn't a goodstuff deck, so you can't settle for ""good enough."" You gotta make that search count everytime. If it's not potentially game-winning that turn or next turn, then it's probably a misplay to grab it.</li>  	<li><strong>World Legacy Discovery has Text: </strong>People forget this all the time and it's honestly so hilarious. Your monsters can and will replace themselves (once per turn) under this Field Spell, even if they are bounce and/or banished. Just being sent to the GY can also just make them be revived instead, which is great for Lee in particular, allowing you to trigger the search effect during the opponent's push. I usually aim to set this up as a 3rd search target when going for a risky play into multiple backrow or disruptions, since if at any point the line would be interrupted with World Chalice mons, I can still recover and keep pushing. Don't underestimate this card!</li>  	<li><strong>The Extra Deck is Everything:</strong> This is still semi-highlander, so treat your Extra Deck Monsters like their lives and plays are vital to your chances of closing the game out. You don't want to waste a bullet or opportunity to win just for a Link Climb, even if the monster has no effect (like LAN and Berserker). You want to properly access what card is the best for the job and will get the best push and use it accordingly. During anything extra will likely have you relying on top decking the unsearchable Pots as a means of a crutch. Make those combos count!</li> </ul> Games should usually resolve themselves by midgame; however, if they don't, you always have the fallback options within the lategame. <p><strong><span>LATEGAME</span></strong></p>  <ul>  	<li><strong>Rasterliger:</strong> This is just Accesscode talker in the deck and should be treated accordingly. It's best to summon this by using I:P as a material since it would make it protected to help with the push.</li>  	<li><strong>Draco Masters of the Tenyi:</strong> Since we play a lot of Normal Monsters and 2 Non-Effect Links, this card in the lategame should be Raigeki. Honestly, it's probably Raigeki even as early as turn 2-3, but it's good to keep this for when you need it rather than just as a random blowout. This isn't a combo enabler or extender after all and its protection isn't actually that great.</li>  	<li><strong>World Legacy Collapse:</strong> If you haven't used this card for the GY effect or are just setting up cheeky lethal somehow, you can always use this in tandem with Lance or Armor in order to pump up a Link Monster in the Damage Step (<em>permanently</em>). This is a good way to clean up leftover LP in grindier games and should be used more as a Trump rather than a gameplan.</li>  	<li><strong>World Legacy - ""World Lance"": </strong>Maintain this in hand until the time is right, OR sit on that Crescendo in the GY and wait until the opponent locks themselves into an attack duruing their turn (usually it will be into one of the Link-2 or higher monsters during this stage of the game). In response to the attack, search out the Lance, then during the Damage Step, discard the Lance and finish them off with their own attack. ;P Works every time.</li> </ul>  <hr />  As you can probably see from the above, the deck has a lot of options and different ways of navigating even the more ""simple"" gamestates or setups. Sometimes even the above cirumstances aren't considered optimal due to a given gamestate and I often find myself slotting out the Extra Deck based on changing trends in a given format. That said, here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere: <p><span><em>Accesscode Talker, Mekk-Knight Core, Orcust Core, Guardragon Promineses, World Chalice Guardragon Almarduke, Adamancipator Risen - Dragite, Tenyi Core, Magikey Core, Piercing the Light, Pacifis</em></span></p> <p>Thanks for reading, and I hope this has convinced you to give the deck a try! It's a lot of fun to pilot, theorycraft, innovate, and watch replays on. If you can put in the time to learn it and cater the Extra Deck to be yours, it's well worth the ride. Now, cheers to the Chalice!</p>"

Okay, so right now I think Necrovalley is generally a better floodgate than Zombie World, but Zombie World is also pretty good rn, and will be better very soon with the release of Flunders, since you're essentially running 11 Mask of Restrict in archetype that also still hates on other meta strategies. Zombies is a nice shell for control, because you have built-in recursion and the ability to take incredible advantage of Rivalry of Warlords in a way no other deck can, and Super Poly, again in a way few decks can.  So, for essential Zombie cards, I'm going pretty hard on Zombie World. There are a whole 3 copies and Terrraforming, which is obligatory. Necroworld Banshee is a 3 of in my opinion, so want to be able to normal summon this in a pinch, you want to send it from your hand with Uni-Zombie, and most importantly you want a Zombie monster you can activate at spell-speed 2 for Balerdroch that doesn't go to far out of your way. That last part makes it worth running 3, especially since the deck is pretty reliant on Zombie World to get its game on. 2 Glow-Up Bloom, occasionally seeing these is good, these are easy access to Balerdroch or Golden Lord, usually Balerdroch since you'll have Zombie World on the field. 1 Mezuki, this is just a nice little bit of recursion that also activates Balerdroch, admittedly a little slow but still useful to have another way to activate Balerdroch that nets you value. We have 2 Shiranui Solitaire and 3 Uni-Zombie. You'd always rather just have the zombie than a searcher, and you only really want to see 1 of these, but you do want to see 1 of these, so 5 is the perfect number. Trust me, you think six is a good idea, and then you clog Uni-Zombies. 2 Balerdroch, you have lots of easy access to this in the deck, so you only need 2. 2 Golden Lord. The Special Summon from the hand while returning to the hand is actually relevant in this deck, but really it is here for a spot of in-engine removal. Still, it is a great beatstick and it activates Balerdroch while non targeting sending something to the GY, I'm seeing non-Zombie decks play this and if you were really looking to break boards you could even run 3, but my gut tells me 2 is the right number. 1 Vampire Fraulein. If you're new to Zombies you might wonder why people play this card, it is basically an OTK enabler, helps close out games while being a battle-phase hand trap. Yeah, the card isn't that pushed, but pushing in for an extra 3000 damage is too good to pass up. You only need 1, we don't want to see this all the time, we just want it around. Super Poly is basically a Zombie card, you use this to summon Dragonecro with 2 of your opponent's monsters, which is pushed. Rivalry is also basically a Zombie card since it combined with Zombie world locks people out of summoning non-zombie monsters if they control a monster, a powerful ""combo"". 3 Pot of Extravagence, I think this deck needs raw card advantage more than consistency, and it doesn't care about its extra deck that much. 1 Foolish Burial, this is your last copy of Zombie World but also more access to Balerdroch and Mezuki, as well as sending Glow-Up Bloom for Balerdroch. That left room for a reasonable suite of generic interruption. Droplets is a staple for a reason, and we're a GY deck, so 3 of these seem really obligatory. Evenly Matched seems pretty good right now with Tri being one of the best decks, if not the best deck, in the format, and it handles a lot of the midrange decks that are more powerful in the meta right now. It is also just a card with a proven pedigree, in Zombie decks in particular, so I wanted 2 in the main. That left 4 cards. I like the power of the Solemn Strike/Torrential Tribute ""Combo"" wherein they need a countertrap to save their board - we have the tools to deal with the creatures protected from these cards, so this seems reasonable. It also works in conjunction with Evenly Matched to clear away Backrow and deal with monsters, I mean, it just seems solid, solid enough that in some matchups I may want the third copy of any of these cards, or all of them, and have them in the side.  You need Linkuriboh for Glow-Up Bloom and we run Extravagence so we have 3 Linkuriboh. Avendread Saviour and Vampire Sucker are cards you go into regularly, and you may even want multiple Suckers in a game, so we're for sure on 3 of each of these in an Extravagence deck. Verte Anaconda could come up some time, but I'm fine running 1. Dragonecro, on the other hand, is a card you might make multiple copies of in a game if you don't banish it, a clear 3 of. Starving Venom is obligatory in Super Poly deck, but I also like Triphoverytium (or whatever, the 3 darks monster) because it is actually common enough to make 3 darks, or to make 2 darks and for me to be able to make Verte Anaconda, send Super Poly.  Side deck. First few cards are for backrow matchups. Shared Ride is for going first anywhere Droll is good. Different Dimension Ground is essentially a turn skip, and these 2 cards overlap in a lot of matchups. When you're going second you instead go for board breaking cards and backrow removal as necessary. Torrential and Solemn Strike contribute to these plans, being cards that are good going second as well as going first. Solemn Judgement is your anti-backrow removal card - you basically should be running this game 2 to 3 to protect your traps and your Zombie World from the influx of backrow removal.  I decided to run Ice Dragon's Prison over D D G, since with Zombie World on the field its grave hate that is also a huge blow-out, a little more reactive rather than being a temporary floodgate, but IMO still often a turn-stopper, and useful in the same matchups as D D G thanks to Zombie World.  So, I decided Evenly was a little weak going first in this deck, so it became the backrow removal in the side to focus on the more flexible TT + SS combo. That opened up some space in the side deck - I already has Ice Dragon's Prison as a GY hate, normally restricted to use against Tribal deck but really good in a Zombie World deck as generic GY hate. I also already had Shared Ride, to put the hurt on searching, and Solemn Judgement to shut down to backrow removal on a flexible card that answers any threat that would hit the table. The deck is good at putting up a couple high-quality interruptions, and Zombie World and Rivalry of Warlords gives us a low of floodgates. Between our answers, Drytron and Tri-Bri are covered really well, and so is Rokkets. Virtual World and Prank Kids is my next concern. I feel like Virtual World is covered pretty well by Shared Ride and Evenly Matched along with board breakers. That leaves Prank Kids as the matchup that needs the most coverage. I felt like having some Twin Twisters to go with the Evenly Matched would improve this matchup, while generically being useful against the midrange and fast control decks that are popping up as rogue decks right now. That left one space for one card, and I decided to run a lone copy of DRNM, so we can play games going second. If we only have space for a 1 of, I want it to be impactful when I do see it, because it won't show up enough to be the swing in the matchup on its own, and I like it as the redundant ""4th"" copy of Droplet."

There's access to desert locusts into Baroness De Fleur for a hand-rip and a negate off a stray Needlefiber (this is unironically better than using a level 4 non-tuner, Needlefiber and an extra for 3 material Apollousa)  If you can find a Hex-Sealed to put on field off an Adamancipator, you can use one of the many ways to set up a monster negate to completely shut your opponent out of monster effects for the turn using Caliga, with the best option being Millennium-Eyes, which prevents your opponent from Summoning something with 1900+ attack and swinging over Caliga. If you can find Hex-Sealed and mill a Gamma off of Chaos Ruler, you can use any other monsters on board for Lambda to shut your opponent off monsters.  You lose to almost any spell card if you don't draw Order, but if you are good at Yu-Gi-Oh, you would either draw order every time, or you wouldn't be playing Hex-Sealed Fusion in 2021.  Side deck is subject to change I just kinda threw things in there.  Don't Bother too much making Dragite live turn one, Baroness off of Needlefiber Locust combo just does it's job better, it's there for going second."

It’s a hyperactive combo deck designed to dump as many xyz monsters on the field as possible, mostly rank 8 dragons and numbers. It’s really solid at otks and does it’s job very well, they got new support and recently I decided to make a complete guide to the archetype, my card reasonings and stuff of the like.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Before that I’ll explain what cipher is. Cipher is a archetype built out of light monsters, at least intended to be that way, there are two additional monsters who ended up with cipher in their names, I play one of the said monsters in this deck for extra names. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">My run down with this archetype and optimal ratios from my understanding.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Biplane</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Biplane is a new monster debuting in the anime collection, it was used once and never again in the anime, it retained its anime effect though and has another effect to boot. Biplane can summon itself from your hand if you own a cipher monster. It can also relevel two cipher monsters to be level 8, it’s thirty effects is that it snags a cipher card from your deck to your hand if destroyed, this effect will pretty much never be used unless your opponent crystal wings or something.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Biplane is played at a triplane ratio due to the lack of better extender options cipher has and the fact that you need level 8 monsters</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Twin Raptor</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Twin Raptor is one of the best cards the archetype has to offer, combined with Biplane this card is a solo x dragon, Twin Raptor can summon itself if you don’t own anything and then summon a cipher from your deck once per turn, the second effect locks you out of anything but ciphers for the rest of the turn but you can summon whatever you like before that, and in the end a free boss is a free boss.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 3 Twin Raptor in any cipher build. Doesn’t matter one bit on anything else just play 3, even if more support comes out Twin Raptor should stay eternal.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Wing:</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Wing is a simple card, it summons itself from your hand if you have a cipher and it also can tribute itself to add on 4 levels to all of your ciphers, it’s an extender and that’s kinda it</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 2-3 wing, wing would normally be played at a lower ratio but I won’t lie, ciphers doesn’t have much to work with so we have to use what we have</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Mirror Knight</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mirror Knight is the only in archetype grind tool Ciphers have. It has a revival effect for if a cipher gets bombed by battle and<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>a search effect at the end of the turn it was sent to the graveyard, at a glance this card sucks, and it kinda does, but it’s effect has something the other ciphers lack which is providing a follow up play next turn.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 3 knight, not because of it’s battle revival effect but because a follow up play is something ciphers lack so you need to have what you can have for a follow up.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Entranger</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card is very different compared to nearly any other cipher, first off, it was obviously made with no intention of being used for actual xyz monsters. But free xyz materials that reincarnate and a search on use is amazing.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 2, entranger will keep on recurring and is searchable enough that 3 is definitely not too necessary.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Storm Cipher</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Storm Cipher was obviously not intended to be a cipher but it works, it’s a bad beatstick for the extra monster zones and it’s a cyberse, it’s searchable via mining providing six extra names though.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You can play 0 or 3 in pure builds if you choose to do so, but play 0 in variants, ciphers don’t have a lot of names to work with so storm cipher can be kinda a 3 of in pure, only because it’s actually level 4 though, in other builds you don’t play the card at all.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Soldier</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is unintentionally the oldest cipher card, and it shows. It sucks these days and there isn’t much to say about it.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">PLAY ZERO, I know we are tight on space but this card is an absolute useless waste of cardboard and shouldn’t be played in any deck: period</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The star of the show, this monster is super important for ciphers for providing a name to rank up with</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 3, you need it to rank up and even cheese your opponents with its own effect along the way!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A neat monster with spot removal and reincarnates your galaxy eyes that you get for absolutely free</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play one, you’ll never need it more than once a duel and can easily go duels without it but it’s a nice option to have regardless.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Neo Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card is hilarious, only for one reason though, vampire xyz monsters. The idea here is to take your opponents field, overlay them all for vampire, attack with Galaxy Eyes, main phase 2 overlay vampire and you got yourself a Zeus, if you stole 3 monsters for this then you got 4 materials to boot!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 1, it takes the rank up spell and is a one shot deal that’ll likely rope you the win when it goes off, I love the card but space is tight and this card only needs to resolve once in a whole duel.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">X Dragon is a neat monster that allows a recycle of a dragon xyz, and you can summon it for basically nothing.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play one or two, games don’t last long enough for you to use any more than that</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Interference</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Interference was used a lot in the anime, it doubles the atk of a cipher who shares a name with your other ciphers. It’s not able to be negated thanks to it triggering in the damage step, it’s cheesy but it sometimes does rope in a random win.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 0 or 1, ciphers don’t need much of a win con because of how big of monsters they can already make but if you like gimmicks it could be used at one. I opted 0</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Double exposure</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It doesn’t have the cipher namesake but it a solid card as far as ciphers go, you can’t search it but it makes you get level 8 monsters so I play it regardless.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play two, due to a lack of cards that let level 8 monsters hit the field I play that at two for that purpose, I’d play one if it was searchable but it’s not.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rank-Up-Magic Cipher Ascension</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The rank up card for ciphers, there isn’t much to say about it than that.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 3, this is the card that lets you put Neo Cipher out, I cannot stress playing 3 enough, neo cipher is a ridiculous card that you want in your toolbox</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Bit</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card is straightforward enough, it gives you an xyz control and a destruction protection effect, it’s not a opt either so there’s that too. Sadly most removal these days are not by destruction</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 0, this card just doesn’t have the merit to catch up with the rest of the game and is not worth the space in any cipher deck, it’s just an unnecessary brick.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher Spectrum</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cipher spectrum revives a monster and brings out another cipher to boot, but only if your opponent destroyed the first monster.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play none of this card as well, there’s nothing this card does that’s of any use in a cipher deck.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Double Cipher</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Sure it has a stupid duplication effect, but if your opponent has the biggest monster on the field than what’s another cipher monster with the same attack as another one of your monsters going to do against that? Also ciphers and numbers are big, you are probably going to have the biggest thing out at all times anyways.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 0, there’s nothing that justifies playing this conditional card that’ll never get used and has an effect that isn’t even that rewarding, if it were a spell then maybe we’d be talking something else like drago future in the side if your opponent will likely summon something that is big enough to trigger it, but it’s just a trap so drop the concept.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That wraps up every cipher card! Now for engines and techs you would like to run</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The most important one is this small Zexal engine: </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 utopic astral hope</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 zexal field</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 double or nothing</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 utopia double</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 utopia dragnir</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This engine is actually the best engine to run in ciphers at the moment, it gives you a monster who has the ability to jump start a boss and an amazing field spell that gives you a free materials, in fact at the moment this is the engine that is basically necessary.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This engine is highly recommend, it allows you to play tons of other different numbers and I’ll just say it, PLAY THIS ENGINE, you can’t go that far without it.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Extension on small zexal engine: tiny photon engine.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2-3 photon thrasher</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 reinforcement of the army</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 number 90</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Number 90 can attach thrasher from your deck so the fact that it doesn’t have any materials when dragnir summons it won’t matter. At the point where you are playing both the zexal engine and the photon engine you have enough Warriors to run rota as well. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The win con engine:</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 number 97</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 number 37</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 number 100</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">0-1 number 92</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Who likes big numbers? I do, and here’s how to make them, as you know ciphers pump out big xyz monsters, this engine profits the most from it, I do highly recommend this engine because of how funny it can be watching numeron dragon getting as big as it does</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The vampire xyz</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Sheridan and the undead vampire can overlay over monsters you take from your opponents, it’s a funny tactic.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That’s what I got in this deck, there are many more techs I missed but this build has a few to work with, this build is likely not the best possible cipher build but it should give you a basic idea of how to play them, I can’t exactly say that there are any specific combo lines though, just mess around with it and try it for yourself!</span></p>"

The Invoked engine can help assist in your strategies as ""Invoked Mechaba"" is a LIGHT Machine and has a few synergies with your ""Ojama"" cards. ""Ojama Red"" can summon the ""Ojama"" Brothers after they have been searched by ""Ojamagic"" and provide access to a Rank-4 Link. ""Ojama Pajama"" offers very strong protection for all of the deck's boss monsters and can search out key cards, including ""Ojamagic"", which can be then dumped and triggered. ""Ojama Blue"" can be used in combination with ""Ojamatch"" to lead to massive card advantage if the opponent has a monster with &lt;2100 ATK and they have no disruptions. The ""ABC"" monsters can be used as Link material to trigger their effects and afterwards you can banish them from the GY for ""ABC-Dragon Buster""."

I knew the game had changed so much since I last played in roughly 2003 and after extensively reading about the existing BEWD support--including copious warnings and admonitions from seasoned players that such a deck was inconsistent, often bricked and generally could not compete. I believed them for the most part, but I also wasn't sure how much I would like YuGiOh as a game itself. If I was going to start playing again and learn the game, I wasn't going to invest in some more or less unknown archetypal deck recognized as being competitive. Frankly I had no concept of what 'competitive' meant in present-day YuGiOh six months or so ago. I wanted something familiar, interesting and extensive enough to really sink my teeth into learning. That was Blue-Eyes White Dragon.  As it turns out, it couldn't have happened any other way. Because of fairly regular support releases for the archetype, building Blue-Eyes nearly hits all the major summoning mechanics of YuGiOh--and if it doesn't hit them, it's at least adjacent to them. Looking at both the Fusion and Ritual Blue-Eyes deck builds, I decided I preferred fusion and set to work building as strong a deck as I could. I studied card text and combo plays, building and testing new versions of my deck to casually duel at my neighborhood card store on Saturdays. Another player, now a good friend of mine, offered to teach me the game and patiently walked me through the present-day game mechanics and trouble-shot my deck with me. Whether I won or lost--and at the start, I almost always lost--I found that thoughtfully summating the games and matches didn't just help me improve my deck build; before long, I started to grasp the basic theory at work in YuGiOh. <h2><strong>Blue-Eyes Dragon Link: When the most-competitive-build-possible still can't compete</strong></h2> As the theory came into focus, I began to understand <em>why </em>my BEWD deck couldn't compete against certain archetypes--that being an article for another time. Now I had the foundation to look at the top meta-performing decks and think about them critically by way of comparison to my own. Naturally the closest analog to what I had started playing was Dragon Link, which unbeknownst to me at the time had just taken a serious body blow on the forbidden and limited list: Guardragon Elpy, a ridiculous card I never got to play with but badly wish I had, was banned and Striker Dragon was limited to x1. Some of the more competitive Blue-Eyes players had already tread the path of creatively applying the BEWD engine to Dragon Link, and even with the deck taking a hit, it still seemed capable of building the kind of boards that Dragon Link is known for building.  It meant moving away from the Blue-Eyes extra deck monsters--first scaling down the fusions to two or three like Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon; then down to just Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon, which can be contact summoned, and excising the fusion engine completely; then swapping the Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon / Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon synchro package for the off-brand but far more powerful Chaos Ruler / Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss. That last change forced the most extensive reworking of my deck yet, forcing me to introduce several level-7 dragons in order to build into Hot Red Abyss and make use of his incredible omni-negate. There's absolutely nothing in BEWD that accomplishes this on its own so before long, I was running a small Rokket engine. It quickly became a bigger Rokket engine when I understood through practice just how much more power and consistency cards like Quick Launch and Rokket Tracer give Dragon Link as a deck.  When local tournaments resumed in my area, I started competing on Saturdays. Generally I would win 2 matches and lose 2 matches--never getting blown out turn-1 in the 2 losses but certainly unable to play through the statistically certain occurrence of bricking the opening hand. The last straw came in game-1 of a recent tournament, in which my opening hand consisted of Blue-Eyes White Dragon x3 and Sage with Eyes of Blue x2. I could normal summon Sage and add a tuner to my hand, but with no BEWDs left in the deck, I couldn't even pop Sage with Sage to bring out a Blue-Eyes monster from my deck. It was such an uncannily bad hand that it led me into the world of hypergeometric probability. As it turns out, the chances of drawing all three unredeemable bricks in the opening hand <strong><em>is</em></strong><em> </em>about 1 in 1000, meaning this was a very particular freak-circumstance unlikely to repeat soon. More disturbing, however, was learning that a 40-card deck running 3x copies of Blue-Eyes White Dragon--a level-8 normal monster with nothing to its name but 3000 ATK / 2500 DEF--will draw into at least one of those blue bricks in about 33% of opening 5-card hands.  <em><strong>At present in the TCG, Blue-Eyes Dragon Link is without a doubt </strong><strong>the most competitive build for the archetype. </strong></em>It actually integrates the 3 vanilla BEWDs into the Dragon Link resource system to generate card advantage and eventually make major rank-8 plays for the end-board--and when it works, it works about as well as the Rokket engine does. But no amount of creative integration can change the simple fact that the deck still runs 3 copies of a normal monster that, ordinarily, cannot be normal summoned. <h2><strong>Brick Theory and Resource Systems in YuGiOh</strong></h2> YuGiOh's resource system is the deck itself and the amount of cards the player has access to using at any given time. Hand-traps and even single disruptions are so powerful because even slight deficits in card advantage can quickly become game losses if the affected player cannot continue to extend their position. Bricking is a different problem with the same outcome. The disruption comes from the deck itself when the opening hand fails to provide enough starters to establish your position on the board. But within the category of 'bricking', there are two different types of bricks.  A player bricks if their opening hand consists of superior extenders without the necessary starters. This forces either suboptimal plays or ends the player's turn entirely. If they can survive into the next draw phase, however, they may draw into a starter that would suddenly make those dead extenders in-hand become live. This is a <em><strong>relative brick </strong></em>since the cards bricking the hand in one moment can easily become live with the addition of a starter. Just about every deck can brick in this way, even the most competitive decks in the meta-game--though it should be said that the most competitive decks are built to lower the probability of this bricked-out game state.  Drawing into cards like Blue-Eyes White Dragon is different, even if the principle at work is similar. By itself, BEWD is absolutely not, nor has it ever been, a starter since it cannot be normal summoned without tributing and does not have any effect in-hand, on-board or in-graveyard. In early YuGiOh, the card's high attack strength could compensate for its lack of effect and difficult summon condition, making it an additional (secondary/tertiary) extender into a player's win condition. But outside of the most casual of settings in the year of our Lord 2021, Blue-Eyes White Dragon cannot even be classed as an additional extender. Starters and extenders, both superior and additional, can <em>make use </em>of the monster, like Melody of Awakening Dragon (starter) or Blue-Eyes Alternative Dragon (extender) but the card itself doesn't advance the player's game position. It is a dead-in-the-hand <em><strong>absolute brick</strong></em>--and unfortunately decks built around Blue-Eyes pretty much have to run x3 copies.  Compare it to the two Dragon Link field spells: Dragon Ravine or Boot Sector Launch. These are cards a player never wants to see in the opening hand (or God forbid, both) because they are easily and incidentally searched in the process of any basic Dragon Link combo board unfolding. They are relative bricks in that they represent an added restriction on the player's resources, namely the opportunity cost of drawing a card you would have eventually added to hand instead of a starter or extender. Both can be played from the hand anyway, however, and potentially act as starters or extenders depending on the rest of the cards in-hand.  Blue-Eyes White Dragon, a card that has a ~33% chance of showing up in the opening hand of someone playing a 40-card deck, is not a relative brick, even though it too can be easily and incidentally searched and added to hand. At present, it is an absolute brick that can neither start nor extend plays on its own.  I look forward to the forthcoming Blue-Eyes support in the Battle of Chaos set scheduled for release in the USA in February 2022. Who knows how much the new fusion cards will help the archetype and open new possibilities for playing the deck? Practice is the only criterion of truth so time will tell. It's no exaggeration to say the deck archetype itself allowed me to learn and enjoy modern YuGiOh. Dialectically, however, that's exactly why I've discarded the build for competitive play. <h2><strong>Finally, on the deck itself:</strong></h2> Dragon Link is a powerful deck format that can accommodate several different types of engines, but social practice has demonstrated that the Rokket engine is second-to-none in generating consistency and power for the deck. Read enough deck profiles and you'll realize that Dragon Link decks are not the most creative builds you'll come across, this one included. In fact, the only twist worth noting is the Number 97: Draglubion Xyz Dragon package in the Extra Deck, which I've held over from previous decks as an OTK win condition in lieu of the ludicrously expensive Accesscode Talker. Naturally this requires more access to making rank-8 plays than the Rokket engine generally delivers so I run Galactic Spiral Dragon at x2, which easily summons itself from the hand or graveyard and can make all monsters you control level-8 for one turn, and--less out of the ordinary--Chaos Dragon Levianeer at x2. In general, I want to make Number 38: Hope Harbinger by itself first, rather than through Number 97: Draglubion. While Draglubion can bring out Hope Harbinger too, neither Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon nor Number 100: Numeron Dragon can be optimally summoned by other means in this deck, effectively rendering them dead in the Extra Deck.  In most cases, I'll only make one or the other: Number 92 or 100. The general principle is that you never want to make Number 100 going first since it has no ATK without detaching its one and only material and cannot attack on the first turn anyway. Only very rarely will I make Draglubion at all going first--better to save your options for extending or rebuilding towards an OTK on turn-2--but if it's game 2 of a match and I know I'm going to face a restrictive board on my opponent's turn, the only acceptable Draglubion summoning target is Number 92. For the most part, though, these are plays to make if I lose the coin toss and get forced into going second or to power through a turn-2 or 3 OTK.  The side deck here is a generic toolbox consisting of a suite of hand-traps and tech-removal spells and traps."

Also wanting to Cyber Dragons and Dark Magicians playstyles are simila,"First off, I would like to owe thanks to Konami. Secondly, this deck is very strategic its very own format. Have you players noticed something similar??? No??? If so, good, then if not, I'll explain why this deck is like this. This deck is an turbo for Extra Deck access. If you notice, this format's playstyle is similar to Cyber Dragons but why??? Because Konami claimed Dark Magician and Cyber Dragons are suppose to play in a similar fashion to each other, which makes more sense if you look at both Cyber Dragon cards and DM cards you can see where Konami is correct about their playstyles being the same.

If that fails and you either have frost or treat, special summon them. Next, you want to link 2 to Verte, Pay the 2K to bring out big boi Dragoon.  <strong>Way Number 2: (Medium)</strong>  Open Hand, if you got a Live Twin, same as Way Number 1, except to the link. Depending on your position, you'll either want to pop a card or draw a card. If you want to POP a card, link summon Evil Twin Lil-la FIRST, then use their effect to special summon a Live Twin Ki-sikil from grave. Next, you'll want to link summon Evil Twin Ki-sikil using Evil Twin Lil-la and Live Twin Ki-sikil, then using Evil Twin Ki-sikil bring back your other Evil Twin monster. Once that happens, Ki-sikil (Evil Twin) will use its effect to pop one card off the field! Do the opposite form of link summoning if you want to draw a card. Next you'll want to link summon into Trouble's Sunny (Once it releases into the TCG). Her effect is really good against decks that try to OTK you from my experience. I'd advise against using her quick effect UNLESS it's a monster with higher ATK. Her GY effect is also really good, which can pop a monster off your opponent's side of the field if you throw an Evil Twin monster from deck to GY.  <strong>Way Number 3 (Hard[Not really]):</strong>  Open Hand, if you have Serziel, normal him to bring either Basilius or Evil Eye Reemergence to your hand, (You'll want to make sure you have those in your hand). If you already have them in your hand, get Selene instead. Next, special summon Basilius and activate Evil Eye Reemergence. Next, you'll want to link 3 into Zerrziel and attach Selene to it, and BOOM! Game for you! Alternatively, you can just use Selene on Serziel instead.  <strong>If you found other ways to play this deck, please let me know!!! Thank you!</strong>"

By excavating five cards it is almost guaranteed to excavate one of the 25 rock monsters in the deck, which each allow further field presence or protection from hand-traps, such as ""Koa'ki Meiru Guardian"". The Adamancipator synchro monsters are incredibly powerful, such as ""Adamancipator Risen - Raptite"", which acts as all of the main deck Adamancipator tuners, and ""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"", which is both capable of returning opponent's threats to the hand and negating key cards.  Koa'ki Meiru: These cards allow you to prevent your opponent's hand traps such as ""Nibiru, the Primal Being"" which would normally end your turn. ""Koa'ki Meiru Supplier"" acts as a free body and searches other Koa'ki Meiru monsters which can later be summoned or used for discard.  Naturia: These three extra deck monsters each prevent your opponent from using a key game mechanic, and due to the ability of ""The Earth - Hex-Sealed Fusion"" allows you to summon ""Naturia Exterio"" from your extra deck by only controlling one of the synchro monsters. This card essentially wins the game if paired with a card such as ""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"".  Prank-Kids: These cards allow for a one-card double ""Raigeki"" that also has 3000 ATK and DEF. The abilities of the Prank-Kids monsters allow for free rock monsters if your opponent disrupts the combo, and ""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"" can be used to equip onto ""Borreload Savage Dragon"". The combo is: normal summon any Prank-Kids monster. Link this monster to make a ""Prank-Kids Meow-Meow-Mu"" and use the ability of the Prank-Kids monster to summon ""Prank-Kids Fansies"" (if not the one that was first summoned). Use these two monsters to summon ""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"" and use it and ""Prank-Kids Fansies""' abilities to both add ""Prank-Kids Pandemonium"" from your deck to your hand and to send and summon a Prank Kids monster so that you have all four different names (one on field, three in GY). Use ""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"" to add the last two materials for ""Prank-Kids Battle Butler"" from your GY to your hand, set ""Prank-Kids Pandemonium"" and you are done!"

Wanted to use Wynn or Ghost Mourner you pulled from Me","The wind attribute in Yu-Gi-Oh used to be the one of the most under supported attributes. Recently all this changed, as support for the ailing attribute exploded into the scene with Windwitch, Dragunity, Armed Dragon, Gusto and Speedroids releasing in almost every set the past year. I affectionally call this mishmash of cards “Wind Soup” for the several wind engines it uses. This deck functions as monster spam synchro deck which turbos out notable wind boss monsters like Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon and Armed Dragon Thunder LV10. Wind Soup also can field the incredible strong and recently released Baronne De Fleur and Hi-Speedroid Clear Wing Rider. With this deck, you will generate gale force winds that will surely storm down your opponent!  Wind Soup features a whopping 5 different archetypes that work together fluidly to generate enough boss monsters to overwhelm your opponent. Despite their differences, Armed Dragon, Windwitch, Dragunity and Gusto function with synergy and grace, so that dueling your opponents will be a breeze!  The <span><strong>Armed Dragon Engine</strong></span> is comprised of 13 cards. <em>3x of Armed Dragon Thunder LV3, LV5, LV7,</em> and one of <em>LV10</em>. <em>3x Armed Dragon Flash</em> (basically this archetype’s Emergency Teleport) is also included for maximum consistency. No other Armed Dragon cards are used since room in this deck is tight, and is sacrificed for the other archetypes.  The main goal of this engine is to turbo out it’s archetypal badass powerhouse, Armed Dragon Thunder LV10. This big guy represents a quick effect destruction during your opponent’s turn (+ it’s cool because of the nostalgia factor. CHAZZ IT UP, MANJOUME THUNDAAA!!!)  This engine is fairly uncomplicated. Each Armed Dragon Thunder requires a monster as cost to “level up” to it’s next form, finally ending on the boss monster itself. The ideal discard for Armed Dragon Thunders are other Armed Dragons, which all give rewards being discarded for a Dragon’s effect (LV3 = Draw 1 card, LV5 = search any level 5 or higher wind dragon, LV7 = search any Armed Dragon card). Dragunity Arma Gram and Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms also love being discarded, since they can resurrect themselves from the GY.  This engine can also search out any level 5 or higher wind dragons as well, so if you’re missing Tempest, Dragon Ruler or Storms or any Dragunity Arma Gram, you can search it out through Armed Dragon LV5.  The <span><strong>Windwitch Engine</strong></span> is comprised of 5 cards: <em>3x Ice Bell, 2x Glass Bell, and 1x</em> <em>Snow Bell</em>. The main reason for this engine is to give you a powerful wind synchro. Being one of the ways to get Crystal Wing in this deck, it is immune to destruction through the use of Ice Bell. The engine brings out a monster negate, + to send Wind Pegasus to the GY, giving you a powerful ""target and shuffle"" back into the deck removal once a card of yours is destroyed. Best of all, this is accomplished <em>without using your normal summon </em>saving it up for something like Armed Dragon LV3 or Pilica, Descendant of the Gusto<em>.</em> The use of Windwitch cards lock you into wind, and monsters from the Extra Deck other than level 5 or higher wind monsters, but that should be fine in Wind Soup, since that’s all the monster you summon anyway!  The Windwitch Crystal Wing turbo combo is as follows: <ol>  	<li>The main starter here is Ice Bell, allowing itself to special summon from the hand if there are no monster cards on the field.</li>  	<li>Ice Bell summons Glass Bell from deck, triggering both of their field effects at once (Glass Bell searches Snow Bell from deck and Ice Bell burns for 500. hint: Chainblock with Glass Bell as chain link 1 and Ice Bell as chain link 2 so they cannot handtrap/negate your Snow Bell search).</li>  	<li>Summon Snowbell from the hand since you now fulfill it's special summoning requirement of controlling 2 wind monsters.</li>  	<li>The level 7 synchro you summon using Icebell + Snowbell depends on your choice. Usually you summon Wind Pegasus to destroy an opponent's backrow with it's effect, and allow for a potential ""shuffle an opponent's card back into the deck"" effect when a card of yours is destroyed. You can also summon Winter Bell if you want to give Diamond Bell its ""twice"" per turn destruction effect.</li>  	<li>Finally, you summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon into the Extra Monster Zone (to allow more space for generaider tokens) using your level 7 synchro + Snow Bell. Using Snow Bell, your synchro monster is now immune to destruction effects, which makes it very annoying to out. You can also summon Diamond Bell for it's board breaking capability (it can destroy up to two cards on the field with it's effect.)</li> </ol> The <span><strong>Dragunity Engine</strong></span> offers another combo line dedicated to turboing out Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon. Like the Windwitch combo, this is accomplished without using your normal summon! With only 1 and a half cards, (Dragunity Remus and a discard), you will have a 3000 ATK boss monster on the field with a once per turn monster negate! The engine is comprised of only 7 cards in the maindeck: <em>3x Dragunity Remus, x1 Dragunity Legatus, x1 Mist Valley Baby Roc, and x2 Dragon Ravine and x1 Dragunity Knight – Gae Dearg </em>in the Extra Deck. Keep in mind that this combo locks you into Dragon special summons for the rest of the turn. If you wanna summon something else, leave this combo for last!  The Dragunity Crystal Wing turbo combo is as follows: <ol>  	<li>The main starter here is Dragunity Remus. Discard Dragunity Remus to search out Dragon Ravine.</li>  	<li>With Dragon Ravine, discard any card to search from deck Dragunity Legatus (choose your discard wisely).</li>  	<li>SS Dragunity Legatus from hand since you control a Dragon Ravine.</li>  	<li>SS Dragunity Remus from the GY (this locks you into Dragon special summons for the rest of the turn.)</li>  	<li>Synchro Legatus + Remus together for Dragunity Knight – Gae Dearg.</li>  	<li>Use Gae Dearg’s effect to search Mist Valley Baby Roc and discard Baby Roc.</li>  	<li>Baby Roc summons itself from GY once sent from hand to GY.</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon using Dragunity Knight – Gae Dearg + Mist Valley Baby Roc.</li> </ol> The <span><strong>Gusto Engine</strong> </span>is the smallest engine of this deck, composed of only 4 cards: <em>x2 Pilica, Descendant of the Gusto, </em>and<em> x2 Emergency Teleport</em>. I included this in Wind Soup because Emergency Teleport was recently semi-limited! Pilica is psychic, so she is an incredible target for this card.  Pilica, Descendant of the Gusto functions as a very adaptable extender. Upon summon, Pilica resurrects any wind tuner from the GY, so she can theoretically be any level 4-7 synchro in this deck! <em>Old Entity Hastorr, Hi-Speedroid Chanbara, Daigusto Sphreez</em>, etc. can be made depending on the set-up in the GY.  For example with the Windwitch combo, you have two wind tuners in the GY, a level 1 (Snowbell) and level 4 (Glass Bell). You can make Clear Wing Fast Dragon for an additional negate, or  summon Old Entity Hastorr for it’s “change of heart” effect.  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/52oUKoB""><strong>Here is an example:</strong></a>  The Gusto Engine, made more consistent with Emergency Teleport’s semi-limit adds an extra layer of extension, synergy and power to your already beefy wind boards!  This deck also features <span><strong>generic wind support</strong>,</span> which tie the deck together adding more consistency.  <em>Wynn the Wind Channeler (x3)</em> is arguably one of the best cards in the deck, since she searches virtually any other wind attribute card in the deck! Missing a combo piece like Armed Dragon LV3, Ice Bell or Dragunity Remus? If Wynn is in your hand, they are only a discard of itself + a wind monster away! (Please Komoney, release the other Channeler Charmer attributes already). If you pulled shiny Wynns with your recent 2021 Megatins, this would be the perfect deck to use her in.  <em>Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms (x1)</em> is also an extremely versatile card, allowing the player to search any dragon with the discard of itself + a wind monster. While it’s searching power is not as potent as Wynn’s, it can search out Dragunity Remus and Armed Dragon LV3. Tempest can summon itself relatively freely from the GY, so it can function as a +2400 beatstick. It’s ability to return itself to the hand is the cherry on top, since you can potentially re-use it’s searching ability multiple times in a duel!  <em>Ghost Mourner and Moonlit Chill (x3)</em> functions like a more specific Effect Veiler that does burn. Interrupt your opponent during a vulnerable part of their combo and punish them with burn damage! It’s also a wind monster and tuner, granting it synergy with cards like Pilica (can resurrect her from GY for synchro plays) and Wynn/Tempest (wind monster for discard.) Versus specific opponents, you may wanna swap this card for the stronger wind hand trap, Droll &amp; Lockbird.  <em>Pot of Avarice (x3)</em> isn’t a wind support card, but it functions as very easy draw power in this deck. Every combo saturates your graveyard with 5+ cards, so it’s very easy to meet the conditions of card.  <span><strong>General Tips - </strong></span>I play tested this a lot in Yugioh OMEGA versus real opponents and bots. Here are the things I've learned about it. <ul>  	<li>While the current decklist is semi-casual, you can actually be fairly competitive with Wind Soup. Take out all the Armed Dragon cards and include the Speedroid Engine featured in the side deck. Limit your opponent’s plays with devastating continuous traps like Imperial Order, Anti-Spell, and Gozen Match. Pot of Prosperity is nice too (replace pot of avarice). Going first, you will have triple Crystal Wing supported by crippling backrow.</li>  	<li>You can play this deck going first or second. The cards that you can cut are the Gusto Engine, 3 Ghost Mourner and 1 Windwitch Glass Bell giving you 8 maindeck slots to work with.</li>  	<li>When using GY reliant cards like Pilica, Descendant of the Gusto, Pot of Avarice, Dragunity Arma Gram and Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms, take note of which cards you are banishing/summon/returning to deck! You don’t want to take certain cards out of your GY before you can use them, like Wind Pegasus @Ignister.</li>  	<li>Careful of being locked into certain cards! Being locked into wind isn’t a concern in this deck. However, cards like Dragunity Remus lock you into Dragons for the rest of the turn. Windwitch Ice Bell lock you into only level 5 of higher wind monsters from the extra deck. Ideally if you have both Windwitch and Dragunity cards in hand, it’s best to summon Windwitch cards first before you are locked into Dragons. Keep this in mind when comboing!</li>  	<li>Here are your average boards <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/7ep7Ex7""><strong>going first</strong></a> and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/fPJVuQ5""><strong>going second</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li> </ul> <strong>Concluding Commentary</strong>  The first ever structure deck I ever got was Structure Deck: Dragons Roar. There cards I particularly liked from the structure deck were the Armed Dragon cards, so they have had a special place in my heart. I can finally live our my childhood dream of using Armed Dragon in a semi-competent deck! Obligatory: “<strong><em>CHAZZ IT UP! MANJOUME THUNDAAA!!!</em></strong>”  With the ridiculous amount of wind support that has come out recently, both generic and archetypal, I made it my mission to make a SUPER WIND DECK, culminating with the deck “Wind Soup.” The only thing I regret about Wind Soup is failing to incorporate into this deck the “Wind Barrier Lock,” where you summon Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds, tutored from deck by Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty. If anybody figures out, let me know in the comments!  Be the tempest, generate hurricane force storm winds and blow your opponents away! With Wind Soup, dueling will be a BREEZE!  If you’ve read the entire thing, I congratulate you. It must’ve been hard to make it through all the wind puns.  I apologize. <em><span>not</span></em>  GLHF Duelists!"

This deck is meant to be as cheap as possible as the cards in it are the ones I have access to at the moment, so this deck isn't complete, there are a lot of better cards and interesting strategies, but I'll tell you some cards that are great to add at the end of the explanation, be patient. 2. This deck is a lot of fun, it's a little hard to understand at first, but reading a little about the basic combos and playing you can get the hang of it as the strategies are pretty simple. 3. I've been playing Yu-Gi-Oh for a while now and since I started I've been learning a lot and I would like to ask that if you have any suggestions for Staples or cards to put in the deck don't hesitate to write a comment below. That said, let's go to the deck: The deck revolves around Tindangle Jhrelth as it will be our seeker and also who will start our combos, the first combo will be activating its effect by discarding a card from the hand and another from the deck to summon it for special. some options depending on your hand. For starters, suppose you have 1 Tindangle Jhrelth in your hand and you also have 1 Terrifying Toddler of Torment, you can use the Tindangle Jhrelth effect by discarding Terrifying Toddler of Torment along with the Tindangle Intruder, from that we can specially summon the Terrifying Toddler of Torment also activating the effect of Tindangle Intruder making its special summon and still bringing Tindangle Jhrelth by its own effect, making you start with 3 monsters on the field besides still having your normal summon if needed. Another combo with Tindangle Jhrelth is with the Tindangle Dholes, in which case you just need another Tindangle in your hand or in your deck (even the Dholes itself can be in the deck), use the Tindangle Jhrelth effect and play in Graveyard 1 Any Tindangle and the Dholes, this will make the Dholes activate its effect in the graveyard by summoning the Tindangle you threw there along with it by special summoning face down, this combo is one you can use at the beginning but you will use several times in duels. Besides these there are several combos with Jhrelth, you will build your own depending on the game progress. Another card I would like to highlight is the Terrifying Toddler of Torment, this card can create a good consistency for the deck because from it we create several moves during the duel, especially if used together with Jhrelth, Tindangle Intruder, Armageddon Knight and Subterror Succession, who next to him can turn an empty field into a sea of ​​flip monsters. Now I'll talk about the last card I'd like to pay attention to here, as it is one if not the most important card for the deck, after Jhrelth of course, the Tindangle Delaunay card, from it you can create the Tindangle Acute Cerberus, a Extremely powerful card that combined with other cards and effects of cards Tindangle can be your greatest triumph against your enemies, especially if it's for an OTK, in addition Delaunay is a great card for defense with its effect of summoning 3 Tindangle monsters from the graveyard to the field, but with a small detail, this card does not have a limitation on how many times it can be activated in the graveyard, making it possible to bring up to 9 Tindangle cards face down in one turn, creating several problems for opponents and great opportunities for you. Finally I wanted to mention some great cards that the Deck can take advantage of a lot that I didn't add because as I said, I don't have in real life, Subterror Behemoth Fiendess is a great card that has a generic effect and very interesting for flip monsters, great card for be added to the extra deck, some hand traps would be awesome for the deck too, which one is up to you, but Ash is a great choice for any deck, finally some 3,4,5 and 6 level XYZ focused on negations and also in raw power, the entire Utopia family could be a great addition. Well, I hope you liked it and if you did I would like you to comment and say if you liked the build, maybe when I get new cards I'll make a new build with the most complete deck so I'll see you guys another day."

Our choice of main deck monsters are <a data-name=""Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy"">Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy</a> which is our XYZ/Synchro enabler, <a data-name=""Mudan the Rikka Fairy"">Mudan the Rikka Fairy</a> who searches <a data-name=""Rikka Sheet"">Rikka Sheet</a> to disrupt our opponents or <a data-name=""Rikka Tranquility"">Rikka Tranquility</a> that lets us stall or setup and Extra Deck play, <a data-name=""Primula the Rikka Fairy"">Primula the Rikka Fairy</a> who is a free body and helps us make our Rank 4 and 6 and lastly <a data-name=""Erica the Rikka Fairy"">Erica the Rikka Fairy</a> who lets us beat over big boss monsters and can revive itself from grave.  Next is the Extra Deck Rikka's, First is <a data-name=""Rikka Queen Strenna"">Rikka Queen Strenna</a> which is how we recycle our Rikka S/T and when tributed can ""rank-up"" into the other 2 if needed, Then we have <a data-name=""Kanzashi the Rikka Queen"">Kanzashi the Rikka Queen</a> that protects our monsters by tributing a plant monster in hand or field if they would be destroyed and can also act as Monster Reborn when a card has been tributed, Lastly is <a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop the Rikka Queen</a> who is our main boss monster and 1 of our main disruption tools, her first effect lets us Tribute our opponents monsters at SS2 and the second effect booster her by 200atk every time a card(s) is tributed.  <strong>Aroma:</strong> This is our second advantage engine which has high synergy with Rikka and gives us access to strong cards like <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a>, <a data-name=""Aromage Marjoram"">Aromage Marjoram</a>, <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a> and <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a>. Sweet Marjoram does it all, SS2 Pop, Targeting protection and searches one of our key cards <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a> which in tandem with her creates an infinite value engine that can either recycle our other engines, let us dodge banishing removal, Trigger sent to GY effs or revive something every turn all while keeping our lifepoints topped up. <a data-name=""Aromage Marjoram"">Aromage Marjoram</a> is our GY Disruption and Battle Phase punisher while <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy"">Aromaseraphy</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Aromaseraphy&quot;&gt;Aromaseraphy&lt;/a&gt; Jasmine""> Jasmine</a> is battle protection that synergises well with petal to tutor any plant we want out of our deck. These two engines together create an extremely potent control shell that is flexible and gives us a ridiculous amount of card advantage.  <strong>Predaplant:</strong> This give us more disruption with predaplanning, strong fusion boss monsters and access to Super Polymerization one of the strongest board breaking cards in the game. This engine really helps solidify our mid game and keep our opponent off of big boss monsters.  <strong>Traps:</strong> Our trap line-up is simple, Disrupt as much as possible. The rest are pure advantage cards that further push our greedy mid-late game.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <p><span><em><strong>Openers</strong></em></span></p> &nbsp;  Our deck isn't that dependent on getting a starter but knowing what your options are is important here's the most common openers for the deck.  <strong>Petal into Mardel:</strong> Summon <a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Rikka Petal</a> and activate its effect to search <a data-name=""Mudan the Rikka Fairy"">Mudan the Rikka Fairy</a>, summon Mudan by tributing Petal and Activate Mudan to search Either <a data-name=""Rikka Sheet"">Rikka Sheet</a> for disruption or <a data-name=""Rikka Tranquility"">Rikka Tranquility</a> for value. This is our standard opener and what we will typically do against most decks.  <strong>1 Card Marjoram Setups:</strong> Normal summon <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a>, sending <a data-name=""Dandylion"">Dandylion</a> and summon 2 Tokens, Link <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> and 1 of the tokens into <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> and activate its effect sending it and the other token to the GY, summon <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a> and activate her effect to search <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a>. This opener is really great against rogue or unrefined strategies since a single disruption is enough to derail these kind of decks but can punished by certain decks.  <strong>Jasmine/Mardel:</strong> Summon <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> in the Centre Column and send <a data-name=""Dandylion"">Dandylion</a> to summon 2 Tokens, Link the 2 Tokens into <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a> and activate its effect tributing <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> to summon <a data-name=""Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light"">Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light</a> and search either Petal to get the Rikka engine started or <a data-name=""Rose girl"">Rose Girl</a> if your engine is already going. This opener is really only ideal into control matchups since it gives us our engine as quickly as possible while also providing solid defense.  <strong>Set 4 Pass: </strong>This is probably the 2nd most common opener in this deck but not necessarily a brick, as long as we can continually disrupt the opponent they will eventually have the same ceiling for power that we currently do, which is exactly what we want because we have inevitability in that once we draw our engine cards we can easily start out advantaging our opponent and win from there. <p><em><strong><span>Midgame</span></strong></em></p> &nbsp;  Midgame is tricky because its extremely dependent on what your opponent is doing and what you have access to but generally at this point you should be deciding how many turns you can realistically close the game out in and how you are going to accomplish it. Here are some things to look out for in the midgame.  <strong>Abusing Blessed Winds: </strong><a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a> is one of your key cards in the mid game using each effect to its fullest potential is important.  Keeping your engine's going with the first of effect is crucial to get into a winning position, shuffling back your Rikka cards ensures you have the fuel to keep grinding out your opponent. Dodging removal with the 2nd effect is probably the single most important thing to keep in mind at all times, remember we only have 1 <a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Rikka Petal</a> and no way to recover it, if it's banished we are suddenly cut off from one of our main engines. The 3rd effect is basically just looping both marjoram's if they hit grave, it doesn't come up that often but can be strong when you get the chance.  <strong>Predaplant's: </strong>Midgame is where predaplants start becoming more relevant, <a data-name=""Predaplanning"">Predaplanning</a> can keep our opponent off of XYZ's and Synchro's while <a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a> and <a data-name=""Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra"">Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra</a> can act as unconventional removal. P<a data-name=""redaplant Verte Anaconda"">redaplant Verte Anaconda</a> also spikes in the midgame turning any 2 monsters into Super Polymerization which can be game winning on it's own.  <strong>Establishing Bosses: </strong>In the midgame we really want to summon our boss monsters like <a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop the Rikka Queen and </a><a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram and keep reviving them with cards like </a><a data-name=""Rikka Tranquility"">Rikka Tranquility, </a><a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds and </a><a data-name=""Super Team Buddy Force Unite!"">Super Team Buddy Force Unite!, this often ends up being your win condition.</a>  <strong>The Advantage Trinity: </strong>This is the point in the game where your secondary advantage engines start kicking in, <a data-name=""Card of Safe Return"">Card of Safe Return</a>, <a data-name=""Dark Factory Of More Production"">Dark Factory Of More Production</a> and <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a>, These cards give us immense card draw and let us draw into our powerful trap cards in order to keep disrupting our opponent.  <strong>Making the most of our traps: </strong>Traps are our main way of controlling the pace of the game and defending ourselves from big pushes from the opponent, knowing when and how to use your traps is matchup dependent but there are some fundamental's you can apply to any matchup. <ul>  	<li>Always keep your opponent's summon limit in mind when choosing when to use your disruption.</li>  	<li>Is the card worth removing? If the card is easily removed in battle refrain from using your removal too early and save it for a bigger threat.</li>  	<li>Am I on a clock? A clock refers to the amount of turns your opponent can lethal you from, if you feel like your opponent is trying to race you down then you can be more loose with your removal cards.</li>  	<li>How much has my opponent committed to a play? The more value you can get from each of your removal cards the better, shotguning your <a data-name=""Ring of Destruction"">Ring of Destruction</a> too early might leave you with less value than if you had waited.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <p><span><em><strong>Late Game</strong></em></span></p> &nbsp;  <strong>Ending the game: </strong>By this point we should have enough board presence to close the game out with our boss monsters, always keep cards like <a data-name=""Super Team Buddy Force Unite!"">Super Team Buddy Force Unite! and</a><a data-name=""Super Team Buddy Force Unite!""> </a><a data-name=""Erica the Rikka Fairy"">Erica the Rikka Fairy in mind when trying to close out games.</a>  <strong>Don't get too greedy: </strong>Ensure your plays are all trying to close out the game, don't keep playing for value as you may get punished by a top-deck from your opponent.  &nbsp;"

I already explained Despia deck idea in one of my last decks, so lets move to the Invoked engine explanation, combo and card choice:  Everything that Invoked do only need one card and this engine don't have bricks if used in a fusion deck, so can be used in a amount of decks much bigger then my despia engine ;-; also is one of the easiest archetypes. The most important card is Aleister the Invoker, he only uses your normal summon to get a boss monster with a ""omni"" negate and banish effect.  <strong>Invoked one card combo: </strong>Magical Meltdown hand. Activate Magical Meltdown ~Meltdown add Aleister from your deck ~Normal summon Aleister ~Aleister add Invocation ~link summon Salamangreat Almiraj using Aleister ~link summon Secure Gardna using Almiraj ~activate Invocation to fusion summon Invoked Mechaba. You not need to use Magical Meltdown to start the combo because Magical Meltdown simply searches for Aleister and this is what you really need to get Mechaba.  The deck has 2 Magical Meltdown because adding one more would make the deck have 41 cards and also because Terraforming is like another copy of Magical Meltdown, so virtually you will be using the normal engine. I am just testing Guardian Chimera because it can be summoned with Despia, Theater of the Branded and has effects that can be good in sometimes, but you can trade it if you don't want (or have a way) to use it.  &nbsp;  I will stop uploading Despia decks and back to my Orcust journey, bye.  &nbsp;  GLHF"

Somebody stop me! (This is only maybe good, and won't be for long, but it is a good reference for what the package could l","So let me preface this deck by saying this - unless you think Necrovalley is actually very good when you play it, don't play it in Altergeists. This is kind of a test list, just me drumming up another deck that can make use of Necrovalley while it is good. Having said that, I'm not sure it is good enough to run in this meta, and Altergeists isn't a perfect home for it. It certainly won't be good enough post-BODE. Still, I thought the idea was intriguing, so I decided to share my list.  The next thing I want to say is that I am not an expert at Altergeists. I still don't even know their combos, and the deck for some reason has always been hard for me to get a grasp on. I think I'm finally starting to figure out why Altergeists are so powerful however, this deck excels at putting up interaction, for a dumb trap deck the engine is really quite good. Slow the game down to where 1 for 1 trades matter and win on high quality 1 for 1 trades.  I went for a version with no hand traps, aside from Imperm which makes the cut for being a trap card for Multifaker. There are a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, there just wasn't space to fit in a Necrovalley package with 6 hand traps. Secondly, hand traps other than Imperm, obviously, are too low-impact this format to be worth running when instead to can run plans that are still good going second.  So, onto the line-up. Pretty standard for Altergeist cards, 3 Meluseek, 3 Multifaker, 3 Mario, 1 Kunquery, 2 Silq, with 3 Spoofing, 2 Protocol, and 1 Manifestation. The standard line-up is fine in Necrovalley, some effects get shut off but Protocol protects most of your effects. 3 Meluseek, 3 Multifaker, and 3 Spoofing is for easy access to multifaker. 3 Mario 2 Protocol is still correct, since you need your number of Altergeist monsters to be higher and since Protocol is better as a card searched by Mario than drawn on its own. 1 Manifestation, the first effect still works under Protocol which is when you will search for this, and you won't always draw Necrovalley, which will likely hurt the opponent more. Still a 1 of, just here to search.  Then we have exactly 5 copies of Necrovalley, the 3 actual copies plus 1 Terraforming and 1 Metaverse. Metaverse is necessary for increasing the number of traps cards in the deck, and is just better than Commandant here (and maybe elsewhere). It lets you back up a Necrovalley with another instant-speed copy if you see them together. We run exactly 5 of these cards, because while you do want to see a copy you never really want to see multiple copies of this card, and because this way you have the perfect sized package to side in Secret Village of the Spellcasters and Imperial Order (side out Terraforming).  Pot of Extra is here to dig through cards, and from here on out everything is pretty standard. Imperms for the Multifaker interaction, Solemns, and a few tech-choice traps. I really like Torrential Tribute combined with Solemn Strike in this deck as a board breaking tool, so I'm on 3 Torrential Tribute. I'm also on Dogmatika Punishment, because the downside doesn't matter and getting to pop 2 is huge upside.  So, one downside with the deck is you're playing with Necrovalley in 1/3 of your games. The Secret Village plan is too important to run Necrovalley most of the time in games 2 and 3, realistically. So you're looking to cheese game 1s with Necrovalley and then play future games with Secret Village. Is that really worth the space? You have to ask yourself that. But remember 1 game is half of what you need to win a match, so the answer to this could be yes, if Necrovalley will cheese you those game 1s in your meta. The other downside is you are hurting yourself in some ways that are crucial to your own grind game - in a grindy enough format this might not be the answer, and it's one of the reasons that even though Necrovalley stacks up well against the top decks right at this moment, I don't know if it is good enough to run in Altergeists right now. However, this version is overall, quite functional, and has the potential to grind those games out under Necrovalley, so don't be discouraged to try it if you're expecting a lot of Dry and Tri in your meta.  Overall I'm glad I made this deck list. It helped me learn a little about Altergeists, and I feel like I have a better understanding of the deck now than before I built this list."

And within that deck, the Speedroid cards I had were my go-to cards to help me win in the end. And so, I decided to finally get around to making this deck. There's only two ways I can see this deck going wrong. 1, You don't get any tuners in your starting hand (which shouldn't be very likely), and 2, Having your opponent OTK you. I'm mostly worried about being OTKed, mainly because of the fact that a decent amount of the Speedroid's effects revolve around summoning from the graveyard, but that's only some of them. Anyway, onto the strategy I planned.  <span>STEP ONE</span> - The first thing you need to do is get out a decent Synchro monster so you at least have a little bit of protection. I recommend Chanbara, to help get it's ATK boosted before your opponent can get some high-levels on the field.  <span>STEP TWO</span> - Next, you need to get out Kitedrake, but ONLY ONE!!! You need to keep the other one in the Extra Deck, so you have some board wipe abilities for late game.  <span>STEP THREE</span> - Finally, you need to get out your Clear Wings to help you keep up some high ATK. With this, you should be secured the win.  I took a lot of pride making this deck, and I think it'll work very well. Best of luck on your next duel!"

I mean, look, they say Zombie right on the card? Well, not quite. I've struggled when building Zombie Eldlich decks in the past. The Eldlich engine is a testy thing that takes tuning to hum, and previous builds have felt schizophrenic. When I sit down to pilot a deck I want to know what deck I am piloting, not some hybrid deck where half the time I'm playing Eldlich and half the time I'm playing Zombies. So the marriage of the two archetypes was not as natural as you might have suspected.  However, Golden Lord is straight up a Zombies card, Zombie World doesn't conflict with Eldlich cards gameplan and is good right now, and by running a small zombies package and a more formidable Eldlich Line I know what the deck is - an Eldlich deck that runs Zombie World and very occasionally Balerdroch.  So, starting from the top, I put in my tech cards first. 3 Zombie World, as a floodgate that disrupts a lot of different archetypes, 1 Necroworld Banshee as copy #4, plus 1 Foolish Burial as copy 5 of Zombie World as well as being a way to send Bloom or even just Golden Lord. Then Solemns and Imperm, because these cards are good, at this point these are pretty obligatory in my Eldlich builds for their power and versatility. For Golden Land trap monsters, 3 Conquistador, and 2 Huaqero is probably the best ratio. You don't need to grind forever, and 5 of these are the right number, since you only need to access 1 Eldlixer in most turns, and since you need to summon Golden Lord for them to be live you don't want to brick on these cards. 1 Golden Land Forever, because it is a searchable Solemn, made better by our normal summon being a Zombie. 3 Red, 1 White. I'm back on the white. You just need to see these, either to send them to the GY, or to search them for more value on the follow-up, so even though White is a lot worse, it really is still quite good, and even better in a deck with the Zombies engine. I think you need to play 3 Eldland 3 Golden Lord. Here's my reasoning: Seeing Eldland is always better than seeing Lord. But if 2 Lords get banished you want your cards to still work that third turn. So even though 5 might be a better ratio for ""Golden Lords"" I think 6 is still the right number, you want to see your lord, you want to see your Eldland, you don't mind seeing them together. That left room in the deck for a small Zombies package. 1 Shiranui Solitaire and 3 Uni-Zombie seemed like the right number of Uni-Zombie to run. You actually don't want to brick on this card as much as you do at 5 copies in this version of the deck, but you do want the consistency boost up to the 4th copy. I only wanted to run the 1 Bloom and the one Balerdroch. These cards all play pretty nicely with the Eldlich Engine, and are mostly here to support that, but also put up Zombie World even more consistently in matchups where Zombie World is good while being useful Eldlich utility cards in their own right. This small Zombies package best mitigates the ""schizophrenia"" problem the deck could have with a more Zombie World focused plan. That left room for 1 card, and I wanted it to be a consistency booster, and if it was a 1 of I wanted it to be more impactful than Upstart. Performapal Popperup carries a potentially high cost in life points, in exchange for letting you discard 3 to draw 3. Holy crap. Even better, since you discard UP TO 3. Yet nobody plays this card. And the reason is pretty simple, it is just Ash bait, and if you get Ashed you've just discarded a card, or potentially a bunch of cards, for no value. But tbh it being Ash bait is pretty good IMO, especially since it sets up my Gy even if it does get Ashed, and if it doesn't it'll turn mediocre hands into explosive ones single handedly. The card is particularly powerful in Eldlich since you want your cards in the GY so much and can set your cards to minimize lifepoint loss. I don't love it as card advantage enough to run 3 of it, I don't even necessarily want to see it that often, but sending for cost alone makes this card pretty worthwhile IMO.  In tuning I've decided to try a second copy of the countertrap. It's just really good in this deck and easily searchable, and you often want to search a second after using the first.  Ice Dragon's Prison is really good in Zombie World decks, by virtue of Zombie World making all monsters on the field and in the GY Zombies, so I switched to that plan. I also decided you really do only need 2 of Cursed Eldland. The card is nuts, but with the consistency boost provided by Zombie cards, you have enough access to Golden Lord that you want to brick out less on the Eldland. That left room to move an Ice Dragon's Prison to the main, the card is a huge blow-out with Zombie World, and we'll usually make Zombie World, and on top of that the card usually won't be dead. This frees up 1 slot in the side, for Red Reboot against other Trap.decks.  In further tuning I'm back on the hand traps in the side, and I remembered Called and Zeus are cards so I threw them in."

First is getting the Toon support going, getting Toon World/Kingdom on the board. Giving your opponent a Kaiju to use other Toon cards on like Shadow Toon and Comic Hand. There's also plenty of cards to banish to boost Maju and Eater. The Extra Deck isn't used. I've only included Link monsters that the deck can go into. But the Extra Deck is used for Prosperity and Eater. If anything, Borg Blocker would be the only Extra Deck monster worth making.  Most of the deck is budget. I only use Prosperity because I own them. You can always use more Desires or Extravagance. There's no substitute for the second most expensive card, Bookmark.  This is just a fun deck to play.

That being said, I think my deck is pretty good, though it could use more interrup","Honestly, I'm trying to make Fallen of Albaz playable. So far, I think this deck is pretty good, though it can be way better. It does brick if you don't draw the right combo. That being said, I have played through bricks and somehow I have won those matches. Then again, my opponent was bricking at times. I'll post the combos later, but don't hesitate to offer advice or some critique.  Alright, if you go first, you better hope you get ""Aluber, Jester of Despia"" and another ""Despia"" monster (either ""Tragedy"" or ""Dramaturge"" (preferably the latter)). Along with a ""Nadir Servant"" ( though you can still make plays without it).  Normal Summon the ""Aluber"", search for the ""Theather"", or if you already have it in your hand then search for ""Branded Opening"".  Use your ""Theater"" to fusion ""Aluber"" and ""Dramaturge"" and summon ""Masquerade the Blazing Dragon"" then Special Summon ""Dramaturge"" from the grave in Atk position. The ""Masquerade"" will constantly charge your opponent 600LP for every card and effect activated. And you can choose when to use ""Dramaturge"" effect to negate a monster's effect whenever an Extra Deck Monster is Special Summoned. So choose carefully. Not only that, your ""Aluber"" is in the GY, just waiting in the graveyard for your opponent to remove your fusion monster on the field.  Well, the Dogmatika package is pretty simple, send an extra deck monster (""Albion the Branded Dragon"" or ""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"") add your ""Dogmatika Ecclesia"" then you special and add the ""Fleurdelis"" (or the ""Dogmatika Punishment"") and end your turn. During the end phase, ""Albion"" will activate and you go ahead and set a Judgement of the Branded from deck to your back row (or if you sent ""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"", just add the Fleurdelis). It honestly comes in handy. Just a reminder, that ""Dogmatika Punishment"" is a double-edged sword, especially in a Fusion-based deck like this. So try to use ""Dogmatika Punishment"" as a last resort only."

At the end of the day it's Rageki effect is the life blood of the decks ability to control the tempo and with the limiting of Meow Meow one has to become creative with how they'll extend. As a result I stacked the deck with ways to get your linking off the ground even after you have spent your Meow Meow on turn 1. Likewise, control pieces are sprinkled throughout the deck to handle the most common archetypes you'll be facing. Whether that's droplet for breaking Drytron boards or the new Lord of the Heavenly Prison whose purpose is to allow you to search out any spell card in your deck."

REZD is moreso just filler and a card I've used in every Zombie deck since it came out, so you don't have to use them. Vampire Fraulein is a good defensive option and can make going into L4 Yuki-onna easier if Yasha isn't available. Doesn't really have answers to everything, but that's why it's a casual deck."

Trading Card Game Known as the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game (遊☆戯☆王オフィシャルカードゲーム, Yū-Gi-Ō Ofisharu Kādo Gēmu) in Asia, is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami. It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series.  ""D/D/D"" (ＤディーＤディーＤディー Dīdīdī), known as DDD in the English manga, and pronounced ""Triple D"" in the dubbed anime, is a sub-archetype of the ""D/D"" archetype used by Declan Akaba in the Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V anime and special manga chapter. The ""D/D/D"" monsters serve as the ""bosses"" of the ""D/D"" archetype due to most of the archetype's gameplay focusing on their Summoning, along with the fact that ""D/D/D"" monsters generally have higher ATK/DEF and stronger effects than non-""D/D/D"" ""D/D"" monsters.

Just following the recommendation cards that are listed below. ___________________________________________  <strong>[Key Cards]</strong>: 3 Main Engine - <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a> - <a data-name=""Performage Damage Juggler"">Performage Damage Juggler</a> - <a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>  <strong>[Recommend]</strong> to Search/Use - <a data-name=""Lyna the Light Charmer"">Lyna the Light Charmer</a> (Hand) &amp; <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> (Spell/Trap Zone) - <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a> (Hand) - <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a> (Spell/Trap Zone) = <a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a> (Hand)  ___________________________________________  Once you finally set up your cards. You will proceed with the next step by activating “<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>” effect to send out “<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>” from your hand to the GY. Then use ""<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>"" effect to become Earth Attribute that allowed you to Summon “<a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend"">Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend</a>'' card from either hand or Deck by sending both “<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>” and “<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>” from the field to the GY, which make them to trigger of their effects by Chain Link 2 and bringing it back “<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>” from the GY to the field along with “<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>” by it own effect. Now you have finally had a chance to Summon “<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>” from either hand or Deck by its own effect. After that use “<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>” effect to search out “<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>” from your Deck then add it to your hand which is the only best Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF/Level 4/Light Attribute monster that can be able to search out by ""<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed - Dharc"">Familiar-Possessed - Dharc</a>"" effect when it Summoned by it own effect.  <strong>Reminder:</strong> Do not activate ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" effect during your turn when it Summoned to your field, it will disable you for summoning from the Exta Deck unless if you have too. (This is an Optional)  You will soon basically understand the concept of which cards you might ever use during the set up once you finally figure out how the Charmer's strategy works. Do the rest which I already listed of all the cards that might be used for the final board set up at the below.  ___________________________________________  <strong>[End Board]</strong> • <em>Field:</em> - <a data-name=""Borreload Salvage Dragon"">Borreload Salvage Dragon</a> - <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> + {<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a> = <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Magicians</a>} (Opponent's Turn) • <em>Spell/Trap:</em> - <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> (face-up) - <a data-name=""Possessed Partnerships"">Possessed Partnerships</a> (set) = <a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a> (Opponent's Turn) - <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a> (Spell/Trap Zone)(Equipped by ""<a data-name=""Borreload Salvage Dragon"">Borreload Salvage Dragon</a>"" effect) • <em>Hand:</em> - 1 Draw (Your turn) - Extra Draw (During your Opponent's Turn) - Added: <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted</a> (During your Opponent's Turn)  ___________________________________________  <strong>Tips</strong>: You might not actually get them from the opening hand with exactly cards. So I prefer you to try something else with different cards in your hand if one of the Key Cards are missing. You should better rely on your additional cards in your hand that might help you to set up your cards. Keep it in your mind that ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" is just an additional card to use Familiar-Possessed - Lyna's Effect to search out ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" from your deck to the hand.  Since Lyna &amp; Dharc familiar monsters haven’t been revealed yet in TCG. I came up with those ideas by adding “<a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>” and “<a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a>” from the Deck to gain more consistency. I didn't actually plan to add them on my Deck in the first place since I want to prove that this Deck can win without relying on any Limited cards.  I might actually replace the “<a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>” and “<a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a>” including the “<a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>” later once the Light and Dark familiar’s monster has been finally released in TCG. By replacing it with two copies of “<a data-name=""Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin"">Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin</a>” Field Spell card and one “<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>” Spell card.  ___________________________________________  <strong>[Additional] </strong>for more Consistency You can use ""<a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>"" as additional for ""<a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>"" or any Level 4 monster from your Deck like ""<a data-name=""Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre"">Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</a>"" or any Performage monster depending what card you need. Requirement: 1 any Spell card, except ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" card, if not, you can use it as well if you have too. I include “<a data-name=""Summoner Mon"">Summoner Mon</a>k” from my Deck Profile since It actually works very well for any Level 4 monster."

The side deck is full of possible cards I need to experiment with it some more to figure out the ratios of cards but I found there's a new way to build it prioritizing the banishes so you can use Neptune to return them all and have a 3k beater. The deck isn't heavy on negates only because it's a work in progress and I wanna try the cards out over time it will be condensed. Have fun and experiment with this profile until you find a ratio that works for you! good luck have fun!

The decks main purpose is to set backrow whilst maintaining a scary board presence that in a form of Super Poly. Lair Of Darkness States: ""All monsters on the field become DARK Attribute"" What better way to abuse this privilege than to throw in Super Poly into the mixture so you can make monsters with that of your opponents. And who said Communism isn't Fun? Spicy Tech cards with Super Poly-ish effects such as Fallen of Albaz and The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion help make this strategy even more of a control method, granting the deck 9 Super Polys in total.  Traps are Superior in this deck with the help of Lilith, Lady of Lament granting you a guarantee trap you need if you play 3 copies, such as Infinite Impermanence, The Paleozoics, Back to the Front (which is busted with Lilith), and Dogmatika Punishment."

Shiranuis are good at swarming and banishing themselves out of the play to activate their innate effects. They can also return either to the field, GY or deck with the help of their support cards.</span>  <strong><span>Gren Maju Strategy:</span></strong> <span>Using the effects of <strong>Dimensional Fissure</strong>, <strong>Pot of Desires</strong>, <strong>Pot of Extravagance</strong>, <strong>Golden Castle of Stromberg</strong>, <strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>, <strong>Shiranui Style Samsara</strong>, <strong>Shiranui Squiresaga</strong> and <strong>Shiranui Samurai</strong>, this will increase Gren Maju Da Eiza's ATK and DEF dramatically. (possible ATK/DEF gain: 20,000+)</span>  <strong><span>Tips:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li><em><span><strong>Pot of Desires</strong> is good if you already have Gren Maju during your first 5 draws. You can just banish cards without worry. It is best paired during the first draw with anti-summon, anti-spells/traps and anti-monster effect cards like <strong>Solemns, Ash Blossom </strong>and<strong> Ice Dragon's Prison</strong>.</span></em></li>  	<li><em><span>If you don't have Gren Maju during your first 5 draws, swarm the field with Shiranuis and use them as a material to link summon <strong>Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy</strong> which has a beneficial effect for FIRE monsters in which they can't be destroyed by battle. With this, once you summon Gren Maju, it will not be destroyed by battle and you can use cards that can banish other cards freely.</span></em></li> </ul> <strong><span>Calculator Strategy:</span></strong> <span>By swarming the field with high level Shiranui Synchro monsters, you can dramatically increase Calculator's ATK. (possible ATK gain: 11,400. This is the sum of all Shiranui Synchro Monsters except 1 <strong>Shiranui Samuraisaga</strong> just to have a space for calculator to be summoned.)</span>  <strong><span>Tips:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li><span>Prevent Calculator's destruction by using your anti-magic/trap/summon/monster effect cards.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;"

At the very least it has potential, I actually like the synergies between it an Eldlich. But ultimately I think a purer version of the deck can still compete. Don't get me wrong, there are reasons the deck is underexplored, and it probably won't be a tier 1 strategy any time soon, but the core of the deck is really good. You Normal Summon Serziel, then turn his ability on with Evil Eye of Selene, giving you one pop on an opponent's turn and a boss monster with great protection. This 1 card 1 interruption schtick has proven to be good enough in the past, and having other useful spells and traps to search if you see the Evil Eye of Selene is pretty boss too. In addition, it has a Field Spell that searches it.  So, when building an Evil Eye deck you have to consider which element to build around, are you a more ""combo""ish Zerziel Turbo or are you Serziel Stun. The elements for both of these are okay. I ultimately decided on playing a very small Evil Eye package featuring none of the extra-deck monsters. I think this plays to Serziel's strengths better than playing the more comboish version, and I discovered this when melding the engine with Eldlich. You don't actually need to play a lot of Evil Eye cards outside of the core engine, the combos you are giving up aren't good enough, whereas Serziel by itself if at the very least close. My thought was to make this a dumb trap deck - summon Serziel, set 4 backrow is the nuts in this deck.  So, I started with tech cards. I'm not sure I'll stick to this system, but for now deciding on Tech Cards first is something I'm adopting into my deckbuilding process. This allows me to figure out what interactions I am playing ahead of my engine, so that I'm less inclined to ""cut"" tech cards in my deckbuilding process. Solemn Judgement IMO is obligatory in this type of deck - if you're playing a trap deck Lightning Storm and Evenly Matched and even Twin Twisters will ruin your day if you don't run this card. It could easily be in the side for games 2 and 3 but I like the card and it is a staple in my decks, because it is so versatile and powerful. Solemn Strike was added in the same breath, it's just a strong versatile card that is great going first and still very good going second, and a staple in successful Trap decks. Next I wanted a little spice. 2 Dogmatika Punishment made a lot of sense to me, but I wanted to run Trap Trick for essentially extra copies of this. With Trap Trick you're effectively running 4 Dogmatika Punishment for some purposes, but won't mind seeing the two of them together. For hand Traps I'm running 3 Imperm and 3 Dimension Shifter. Imperm is high enough impact, and doubles as a useful spell for Trap Trick to set, that it is worth running. D Shifter is potentially huge, we don't really play the GY game in this version of the deck and D Shifter is such a high impact hand trap that it is absolutely worth maining in basically any deck that can run it. Then I'm running 2 Evil Eye Retribution. You need at least 1 copy of this for when you see Evil Eye of Selene, but I think 2 gives us 5 cards Lightning Storm which is huge IMO. It also can't be negated if you have Evil Eye of Selene equipped to Serziel, though the downside is it does nothing if you don't see a Serziel. Evil Eye Defeat is also a huge interaction card, basically a 2 for 1 if you're strategy is online. We would only run 1 of these for the purposes of searching, but we need 2 to be able to use this off of Trap Trick. This way Trap Trick should almost always have something to set (and usually activate on resolution).  The next step was to throw in my Pot cards. As I said, you really need to see Serziel for the deck to do its thing, and the fact that it can play Prosperity and Duality for free is actually a huge upside for the deck. The pots don't even conflict, it is so insane.  After that it is 3 of the Field Spell with Terraforming, 3 Serziel, and 1 Evil Eye of Selene, your brick or Taketemborg for the engine. Evil Eye of Selene can reset itself, , so I think 1 copy of it is fine. It does leave you a little more vulnerable to Twin Twisters, but not by much. The Field Spell is always better to see than Serziel himself, since when Serziel pops you own card you can give up the Field Spell instead of something valuable. Regardless, I think you need all 7 copies of Serziel to play the Evil Eye engine. Sadly, you really don't need much else.  That left 6 spots in the deck, which was just perfect. I wanted to run packages of Floodgates that combo together, and to avoid bricking I thought packages of 2 made a lot of sense. So from just having put in everything I wanted I had the exact room to put in 2 Rivalry, the weakest floodgate but meta relevant and combos with There Can Be Only One, There Can Be Only One, the strongest individual floodgate that again combos with Rivalry of Warlords, and Summon Limit, which doesn't directly combo with either but puts a second limitation on opponents that combined with the first will frustrate them. These also have the advantage of being continuous spells, meaning you can pop them with Evil Eye cards after they've already done their job.  Punishment really didn't jive with the D Shifter in the deck, so it got cut for an Artifact Package. What is nice is that popping these cards yourself with Serziel lets you pop another card, so even if Scythe is dead Sanctum still puts in work in this deck. Scythe is also just really good, and is even half-decent to set a lot of the time.  In tuning I settled on a second copy of Selene because while it can be bricky, seeing it is nice, and it gives the deck a backup plan if your first is banished. I actually basically did what I always do and rebuilt the deck from the bottom up again, this time incorporating a couple copies of Zombie World. This card is decent as a floodgate in it's own right right now, but is notable for combing with Rivalry and There Can Be Only One very effectively. The idea is to have floodgates that are good on their own, but also combo with each other, and Zombie World fits that bill right now. The other notable new inclusion is 2 copies of crackdown. Much as I love the artifact engine in Evil Eye, when you only have 2 spaces to fill Crackdown is notable for stealing an opponent's monster to pop once it's on your side of the field, and means we might actually use our extra deck when our floodgates will let us. I still think 5 spell/trap negates is plenty, since when you see 1 of your copies of Selene you can search Retribution."

But the deck is still playable, i want to show you how I´m playing today.  The Main focus depends on the consistency while you try to combo. 3 copies of Polymerisation and 3 copies of Prank-kids Pandemonium are important to play through interruptions. To punish interruptions, 3 copies of Triple Tactics Talent does also a good job.  Pot of Desires is optional. The funktion of this card is getting faster into the game, but the card also hurt´s your grind game a lot. You can chance it to pot of avarice (for a very good grind game version) or to more interruptions like main decking nibiru, or even solemn judgement (when going first). Lock-down like Mystic Mine is also possible.  So try it out, it´s personally one of my favourite decks.  Have fun!"

Let's goooooooooo!,"<span><strong>Hello there,</strong></span>  this is my new attempt on the Majespecter archetype.  It is more of a ""pure"" version of the deck and I think this way, it is much stronger!  <span><strong>Strategy</strong></span>  The Strat is simple, set scales, pendulum summon as much as you can, search for traps and stop your opponent from playing Yu-Gi-OH! !!  Turn three, you try to otk with <a data-name=""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"">Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</a>. (that is also your plan going second)  <span><strong>Card highlights</strong></span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Antihuman Intelligence ME-PSY-YA"">Antihuman Intelligence ME-PSY-YA</a> -</strong></span> ME-PSY-YA is a very powerful new pendulum card. It is a generic low scale with no restrictions, but an interesting floodgate effect. It banishes all spell and trap cards that would go to the GY while placed in the pendulum zone. This effect helps against decks that rely on floating or recycling spell and trap cards like Sky Striker and Eldlich. ME-PSY-YA' monster effect is quite strong as well, but not too important for this deck. Its main purpose is to be a low scale for the deck.  <span><strong><a data-name=""Saambell the Star Bonder"">Saambell the Star Bonder</a> -</strong></span> While Saambell is not as strong as I initially believed, it is shares the same type and attribute as the Majespectors. It is a target for <a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a> and helps to go into Totem Bird, thanks to it being level three.  <span><strong><a data-name=""Servant of Endymion"">Servant of Endymion</a> -</strong></span> Servant's only purpose is to be a low scale for the deck while also being a target for <a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a>. Together with <a data-name=""Spell Power Mastery"">Spell Power Mastery</a>, I play three copies of it.  <span><strong><a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spellcasters"">Secret Village of the Spellcasters</a> -</strong></span> Village is a difficult one. I have seen many deck lists maining Village. The problem I see is that the Majespecters are getting tributed from the field to activate their traps and spells, eventually leaving you with no spellcasters on the field, resulting in Village to lock you down and not your opponent. Maybe I am too paranoid in that regard. It is still a strong floodgate against certain decks, so I decided to play it in the side deck.  &nbsp;  The side deck presents some accountable options, but can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!"

Experimenting with a smaller and affordable Zeus package in the extra, you could probably cut Omega or a Bearbrumm if you wanted to play with Downerd and Sky Cavalry. Fraktall/Kitt/Tenki + any Tri-Brigade monster in hand will get you to Apollousa + Revolt. Rescue Cat also gets you full combo with Apollousa + Revolt as well. Use the Gamma in hand on your turn to prevent you opponent from using Ash/Skull Meister on your Rescue Cat/Fraktall. I cut Rescue Cat to 2 copies because after the first resolves the 2nd is usually dead with no targets in deck for you to summon.

Monster ratios are the same, I feel pretty good about them.  9 hand traps is pretty standard right now, will probably throw in chalice post BODE. You always have more handtraps in the side deck.  I'm considering swapping Gold Sarc + Dotscaper for two One-Time Passcode. The deck just really needs all the extenders it can get to beat established boards.  I was able to pick up a playset of TTT. The draw two after getting interrupted can help you pivot into an accesscode/final sigma play. Crossout might be decent, but I prefer the flexibility of TTT.  Feel free to share your thoughts!"

Tudo certo? Espero que sim.</p> <p>Hoje eu venho abordar minhas experimentações com Megalindos (English: ""Megalith""/ Português BR: ""Megálitos""), ""Diabretiço"" ( English: ""Impcantation"") e as ""Artes de Ritual Superior e Avançada"" (English: ""High/Advanced Ritual Art""). Antes vou introduzir um pouquinho sobre a jogabilidade base dos ""Megálitos"". Se você não estiver interessado ou se já souber tudo sobre o arquétipo, fique à vontade para pular essa parte.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Introdução</p> <p></p> <p>""Megálito"" é um arquétipo de Monstros Rituais do tipo Rocha com atributo TERRA e que se destacam por não terem uma magia ritual própria. Ao invés disso, os próprios monstros do arquétipo substituem as Magias Rituais, o que é ótimo por reduzirem 1 ⁄ 3 os requisitos para uma Invocação Ritual.</p> <p>Todos os membros do arquétipo tem o efeito de se invocar por Invocação Ritual entre si, além de um efeito particular de cada monstro. Eles podem ser separados em 3 grupos de acordo com seu LV e função na estratégia.</p> <p></p> <p>Grupo 1: Monstros de LV 8 (parte agressiva/defensiva)</p> <p></p> <p>Esse grupo tem a função de invocar os Monstros Rituais ""Megálito"" da mão, ao se enviarem como custo e tributando monstros cuja soma dos LVs seja igual ou maior do que o LV do monstro a ser invocado. Tenha em mente que, infelizmente, o monstro enviado para o GY e que está invocando outro por Invocação Ritual não têm seu LV contado para a soma, apesar de enviá-los ainda ser o custo do efeito de invocar. Além do efeito de Invocação Ritual, cada um deles têm efeitos diferentes quando em campo. Ambos os efeitos de cada monstro são Hard Once Per Turn. São eles:</p> <p>""Aratron"": este serve como uma hand trap durante a Fase Principal, pois seu efeito de invocar 1 monstro ""Megálito"" da mão é um Efeito Rápido. Isso é ótimo porque: 1. Você pode pegar seu oponente de surpresa, destruindo o campo do seu oponente com ""Bethor"" no turno 1 do oponente; 2. Te permite esquivar de efeitos que dão alvo nos seus monstros, fazendo os efeitos deles passarem mesmo tomando ""Impermanência Infinita"" (""Infinite Impermanence''), por exemplo. Seu outro efeito, em campo, é: ""Quando seu oponente ativar um card ou efeito que dê alvo em um card que você controla (Efeito Rápido): você pode colocar um Monstro Ritual do seu GY no fundo do Deck; negue a ativação, e se isso acontecer, destrua-o."" Eu acho muito feio quem roda menos que 3 em qualquer decklist;</p> <p>""Bethor"": ""Se for invocado por Invocação Ritual: você pode dar alvo em cards que seu oponente controla até o número de Monstros Rituais com nomes diferentes no GY; destrua-os"". Ótima carta, mas, apesar do potencial, você precisa preparar seu campo e GY para fazer bom uso dele. Eu gosto de rodar 2, mas não julgo quem roda menos que isso;</p> <p>""Phaleg"": é o powerhouse do Deck. Enquanto ele estiver em campo, todos os seus monstros ganham 300 ATK/DEF para cada Monstro Ritual no GY. Não é raro você ficar com 3 ou 4 monstros com mais de 2500 de ATK quando ele entra em jogo. Mesma coisa que ""Bethor"", eu gosto de rodar 2, mas também não julgo quem roda menos que isso.</p> <p></p> <p>Grupo 2: Monstros de LV 4 (buscadores/extendedores)</p> <p></p> <p>Todos eles têm um efeito de invocar 1 Monstro Ritual da mão ao tributar monstros, incluindo eles mesmos, cuja soma dos LVs seja igual ou maior do que o LV do monstro a ser invocado. Esse efeito é hard once per turn. E cada um deles têm um efeito ao serem invocados por Invocação Ritual, e esses não são hard once per turn.</p> <p></p> <p>""Ophiel"": ""Se este card for invocado por Invocação Ritual: você pode adicionar 1 monstro ""Megálito"" do seu Deck à mão"". Buscador que busca quantas vezes você puder invocar ele no mesmo turno. Preciso falar que é 3 no Deck? Preciso, né? Roda 3.</p> <p>""Hagith"": ""Se este card for invocado por Invocação Ritual: você pode adicionar 1 card de Magia/Armadilha ""Megálito"" do Deck à mão"". Buscador de backrow. Esse Deck ama backrow, mas não o suficiente para 3 Hagith. Eu gosto de usar só 1 porque o que não falta é jeito de buscar ou reciclar ele nesse deck.</p> <p>""Och"": ""Se este card for invocado por Invocação Ritual: você pode comprar 1 card e descartar 1 card"". Mas esse não é o talento dele. Ele se diferencia dos outros LV 4 porque pode invocar da mão qualquer Monstro Ritual em Velocidade de Magia 2. É por causa desse carinha que a galera gosta tanto de rodar ""Shinobarão Pavão"" (""Shinobaron Peacock""). Roda de preferência 1 pelo mesmo motivo que o ""Hagith"".</p> <p></p> <p>Grupo 3: ""Phul"", o Foda</p> <p></p> <p>""Megálito Phul"" é um Monstro Ritual de nível 2 que ""Se este card for invocado por Invocação Ritual: você pode dar alvo em 1 Monstro Ritual no seu GY; o seu LV se torna igual ao alvo e depois adicione o alvo à mão"". Além disso, ""Durante a Fase Principal (Efeito Rápido): você pode ativar este efeito; Invoque 1 Monstro Ritual ""Megálito"" da sua mão ou deck tributando monstros da mão e/ou campo cuja soma dos LVs seja igual ou maior que o LV do monstro invocado"". Ele busca, recicla e pode interromper o turno do oponente. Só seria melhor se desse um impeachment no Salnorabo. Se puder, roda 5.</p> <p></p> <p>O Problema do Deck</p> <p></p> <p>O problema é que os Monstros Rituais do arquétipo necessários para começar a invocar outros monstros são de nível 8, ou seja, não podem ser buscados com ""Preparação de Rituais"" (English: ""Preparation of Rites""), muito menos por ""Pré-Preparação de Rituais"" (English: ""Pre-Preparation of Rites""), o que reduz muito a consistência necessária para fazer o que o Deck deveria fazer. O arquétipo conta com alternativas de busca, por meio dos monstros de LV 4 e LV 2, mas que, para buscarem, precisam ser invocados por Invocação Ritual (｡ŏ﹏ŏ). O Deck também conta com uma Magia Rápida que invoca por Invocação Ritual 1 ""Megálito"" direto do deck, que, por ser uma Magia Rápida, também não pode usufruir de suportes genéricos de Rituais, dependendo, assim, dos meios do próprio Deck.</p> <p> Aí entram os ""Diabretiços"", que não só aumentam a consistência do Deck, buscando as cartas Rituais chaves do Deck, mas também gera monstros para tributar para Invocações Ritual, sem falar nos combos com ""Soberano da Vaidade"" (""Vanity's Ruler"") e o ""Zaborg o Mega Monarca"" (""Zaborg the Mega Monarch""). Só que ""Megálito"", por não ter Magias de Rituais próprias, deixa embaçado para usar o ""Velaneco"" (""Impcantation Candoll"") e o ""Livropedra"" (""Impcantation Brookstone""), restando praticamente metade da engine.</p> <p>Fora tudo isso, eu me canso fácil quando diferentes Decks, por terem a mesma engine (""Nekroz"", ""Shinobird"", etc.), acabam ficando repetitivos e, por fim, enjoativo para a minha gameplay. Por isso eu tento misturar com outras engines para variar, por exemplo, trocar os ""Diabretiços"" por ""Dogmatikas"" ao jogar de ""Nekroz"".</p> <p>Daí eu comecei a gastar massa cinzenta para deixar o ""Megálito'' mais diferente de outros Decks que rodam a mesma engine.</p> <p>Então, depois de gastar muito ATP e horas de experimentação, acabei com a seguinte lista. Vamos abordar o que têm de diferença de outras builds comuns de ""Megálitos''.</p> <p></p> <p>""Dragão Branco de Olhos Azuis"" (""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"") e ""Dragão de Alexandrita"" (""Alexandrite Dragon""): alvo para as ""Artes de Ritual'' para trazer os monstros dos dois grupos. A escolha desses dois monstros se dá principalmente pelo LV 4 e 8, e também por terem a capacidade máxima de ATK dentre os vanillas.</p> <p>""Arte de Ritual Avançada"": ajuda bastante a pôr os primeiros monstros em campo sem gastar muito esforço, por enviarem os tributos do Deck. Te ajuda, também, a economizar os Rituais de LV 8 para que você possa usá-los de forma mais agressiva. E, por último mas não menos importante, você tem mais alvos para ""Velaneco"" e ""Livropedra"", deixando eles mais viáveis e o Deck mais consistente. Esse último argumento também serve para a ""Arte de Ritual Superior"".</p> <p>""Arte de Ritual Superior"": Traz Monstros do Deck. Ótimo para trazer os LVs 4 pro campo e realizar as buscas e ótimo também para deixar os LVs 8 também mais acessíveis.</p> <p></p> <p>Conclusão</p> <p>Acredito que tenha resolvido os problemas do Deck que apontei anteriormente por meio dessas ações. Não tenho nada contra as engines genéricas, tanto que até continuei as utilizando. Só acho que quando roda o ""Soberano da Vaidade""/""Mega Zaborg"" fica meio repetitivo e reduz a versatilidade do Deck, deixando a condição de vitória dependente de poucas cartas que não são tão acessíveis o tempo todo.</p> <p>Apesar disso tudo, não acho que ele tenha ficado OP Tier 0 1 card combo, mas acredito que desse jeito seja a forma mais divertida e consistente que você pode esperar desse Deck até então.</p> <p>Valeuzão! Espero ter ajudado! E até a próxima ideia… ...se pá</p> <p></p>"

You can use Cards of the Red Stone to get a pot of greed AND allow for one more use of the aforementioned Insight.

All you need is 2 Red-Eyes monsters.  &nbsp;  You can easily get Red-Eyes Alternative by discarding one Red-Eyes, or even the Alternative.  There are many more combos but these are the ones that come to mind."

Summon your XYZ monsters to punish your opponent for using their graveyard!,"This is my current work-in-progress pure Exorsister deck.  My build here is a lot more slower-paced compared to some other Exorsister lists. Instead of turboing out Mikhaelise to search Vadis, I opted to run more traps and sit on main deck monsters.  &nbsp;  The Game Plan:  Summon the main deck Exorsisters to try to proc them on your opponent's turn and utilize traps to interrupt your opponent's plays.  &nbsp;  My thoughts on plays:  I normally don't really like summoning Mikhaelise turn 1, opting instead to just keep the main deck monsters on the field, but Mikahelise turn 1 is definitely not a bad idea. Depending on the matchup and your opening hand, Mikhaelise turn 1 can help shape your board around the opponent and round out your plays. However, the deck is not all Exorsister. This deck runs some traps to help back up your sisters. This deck runs Traptrick to help turbo out sisters using Vadis, but it could also search out other traps in case you open Vadis or search it with Mikhaelise. IDP is great against some decks and if used properly can end turns. Imperm is nice because it can be a hand trap and a normal trap. Speaking of hand traps, this deck also runs Dimension Shifter. Dimension Shifter on its own can also end turns. If you open Dimension Shifter turn 1, you can just normal summon a main deck sister to keep Dimension Shifter active.  &nbsp;  Some of my card choices explained:  Some things I think this deck struggles with are hand advantage and finishing games.  When you're playing this deck, you often have to vomit out your hand. It feels almost like BA to me, except without the Cir-Dante loop. To combat this, I decided to add desires.  As for finishing games, it's a bit hard to link climb, and Vadis locks you into sisters, so I chose to run utopia the double, which does have some conflict with desires. Until I think of a better finisher, this is what I'll stick to.  I've also been thinking of messing with all of the sister ratios some more. I was originally running 3 of all the main deck sisters, but I felt like Elaine just wasn't doing much, so I decided to cut it to 2 for another copy of a trap. The ratios I have feel pretty good because you want to see at least one every turn. But I might experiment with it some more especially if I implement other engines.  &nbsp;  My Thoughts  Overall, I've been having a lot of fun with Exorsisters. They're not the most competitive deck, but they are a lot of fun to play. Specifically, I love Carpedibel, their in-archetype prohibition. It just feels super rewarding to use. I'm thinking of experimenting with some other engines as well. I've seen some Magistus, Brave Token, and other builds that seem fun.  &nbsp;  Please let me know if you have any thoughts or changes! Also, The side deck doesn't have much thought put into it, it's just some random stuff I threw in there."

With Aluber, if you don't already have the field spell (Despia, Theater of the Branded), you search for that, otherwise search for Branded Opening that let you search Dramaturge of Despia or, if you have high level fusion monster in the GY, Ad Libitum of Despia.  Now, with the field spell, you can fusion summon using Aluber on the field and what you have in the hand.  With Indulged Darklord you want to give to the opponent Darklord Ukoback, if you can't usually the best one to give is Darklord Superbia and you want to search for Darklord Mornigstar, if you  can fusion summon into The first Darklord to nuke the board or Darklord Ixchel to cycle the deck.  Some nice interactions are: <ul>  	<li>you can use the darklord you give to the opponent for a fusion summon using super poly</li>  	<li>the second effect of The first Darklord that let you special summon a fairy monster trigger  Aluber, Indulged, Ukoback, Superbia</li>  	<li>the best card to discard with Ixchel effect are the two trap cards that you can later use from the GY without paying the activation cost</li>  	<li>the effects that discard cards like super poly, branded opening, allure of darkness, all of them synergize with Despian of tragedy letting you search for a despia monster</li>  	<li>with golden sarcophagus if you target Despian of tragedy you trigger it's effect letting you search a despia monster and after 2 turn you take it into the hand (that's why i prefer it despite foolish burial, i found that the second effect to retrieve a speel is not that useful and i can still use it later sending Despian of tragedy to the GY with another card)</li>  	<li>Darklord Superbia sometims miss timing so i reccomend to summon it at the end of a chain or outside of it</li> </ul> I don't like using card outside the archetype so I put staple cards in the side deck.  It's very easy to summon rank 8 xyz monster and I decided to use N.38 and N.90 to cover the negating effect that the deck lacks.  N.97 can be used as a finisher summoning N.100 that go easily at 9000 atk.  The deck has a lot other synergies and interactions so I reccomend to try it and have fun.  The deck is very very consistent and you have a dead hand 1/10 of the games, probably even less.  Feel free to comment if you have any advice to improve the decklist."
