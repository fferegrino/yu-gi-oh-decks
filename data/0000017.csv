This deck is good for supporting all warrior cards which i have woven it to be. Solidarity is a good card with its 800 Atk buff and this effect can stack. To get real good early game is when i summon <strong>Zubaba General </strong>and attaching either <strong>Lv. 6 Mystic Swordsman </strong>or <strong>Freed the Matchless General</strong> buffing him by roughly 2000 atk.  *Edit Credit - shinrazantetsu* I agree with him, Sogen is a very poor card and was added as filler so i removed it and added Magnum Shield. As well i added Rose, Warrior of Revenge since its a better tuner and its suitability is higher.  -This is the third deck i've put alot of thought into any tips or adjustments are welcome!  -Blason"

I made this deck purely to go second, if you go first you won't have a very strong board.  When you do go second using the fire true king to destroy 2 infernoid monsters in your hand and then banishing a monster your opponent controls is very effective! There is also void imagination that allows you to fusion summon Infernoid Tierra and send the 3 Elder Entity N'tss.  Then you can pop 3 cards your opponent controls.  I put cards in the side deck that allow you to go first and be more successful like the solemns but it isn't enough normally so going second is your best option!"

First of all, it's highly recommended to send as many skull servants as possibile to the graveyard, in order to increase King's attack. Your first strategy consists into sending wightprice from your hand/deck to the graveyard: use Gozuki's effect or card trooper's effect. In this way, you'll be able to activate wightprince's effect, and send a skull servant and a lady in wight from the deck/hand to the graveyard. The cheerful coffin is another useful card because allows you to send monster from you hand to the graveyard.  Once wightprince, skull servant and the lady in wight have been sent to the graveyard, you can activate wightprince's effect: banish all these 3 monsters and special summon the king from your deck. Now you can activate burial from another dimension to bring back your 3 monsters and boost the king's attack.  Wall of light and gravity bind are useful cards to control the field and to give you the time to set your board with 1/2 kings with 3k/4k atk points each. Extra deck is not necessary, but this deck can easily spam monsters even thanks to zombie master, and borreload dragon is quite strong."

The yang zing engine is for synchros and since your whole extra deck is synchros, you will have lots of options to choose from!  This deck is a lot of fun to play just like I say for most of the other decks I make but they really are great to mess around with and so is this one! Although this one is not competitive, its more of a fun, casual deck to play."

I custom built this deck so that it brings out big boss monsters constantly that will create a big problem for your opponent! Use double evolution pill and the invoked engine to bring out huge boss monsters that cause tons of problems for your opponent like mechaba and ultimate conductor tyranno.  The True King engine allows for big combos for the dinosaurs.  Use the spellbook engine to get more draw power and pull off the combos you need to win! This deck has been tested by me and works really well and is lots of fun to play!

It plays pretty straightforward, with your main goal being to summon Clear Wing","This deck is a pretty simple take on the Windwitch Speedroid strategy. It plays pretty straightforward, with your main goal being Clear Wing Fast Dragon and the indestructible Crystal Wing, and there are plenty of combos you can pull off. One thing you may notice is that I decided to run three of every Windwitch. Although most strategies only run 3 Ice Bell, 2 Glass Bell, and 1 Snow Bell, I decided to run 3 of all 3. This is because you will always have two Wind-type monsters on the field when synchro summoning, so filling Snow Bell's condition is easy and makes for even easier indestructible Crystal Wing summons. I kept Ice Bell at 3 for obvious reasons, due to it being the catalyst for the instant indestructible Crystal Wing. One thing I was debating was whether or not to leave Glass Bell at two, but I eventually decided to put it at three due to it also being able to create the indestructible Crystal Wing when paired with Taketomborg due to it being Normal Summoned, searching out Snow Bell, then Special Summoning Taketomborg from hand, then using Snow Bell's effect to Special Summon it, and then go into the indestructible Crystal Wing. Plus, it is a searcher for any Windwitch, which can help improve consistency."

There is a Blue-Eyes portion of the Deck,since they're the REAL DEAL of this Deck. Of course you can remove them and put everything else you like. And,by the way,this is my real life personal Deck,so i tested it against others. It's quite good,so don't worry&#x1f44d;."

Can be played differently depending on if user goes first or second. ,"<h2>Legacy of the Thousand Eyed One</h2> <blockquote><div>As you can probably already see, this deck is filled with the new legacy support for Relinquished and Eyes Restrict monsters. Why? Because they're amazing!  Millenium-Eyes Restrict is capable of countering some of the most annoying Effect Monsters. It's effect reads: ""Once per turn, when an opponent's monster activates its effect (Quick Effect): You can target 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls or in their GY; equip that target to this card. Gains ATK/DEF equal to the combined ATK/DEF of the monsters equipped to it by this effect. Monsters with the same name as a monster equipped to this card by this card's effect cannot attack, also negate their effects."" Millenium-Eyes Restrict is capable of equipping more than one monster at a time, a feat that used to be impossible. Plus, it if the opponent activates an effect, just equip it to yourself. Problem solved!  Millenium-Eyes Illusionist is another great example of amazing support. It's effect reads:  ""(Quick Effect): You can discard this card, then target 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls; equip that target to 1 ""Eyes Restrict"" Fusion Monster or ""Relinquished"" you control, and if you do, it is treated as being equipped by the equipped monster's effect. If an ""Eyes Restrict"" Fusion Monster or ""Relinquished"" is Special Summoned: Add this card from your GY to your hand. You can only use each effect of ""Millennium-Eyes Illusionist"" once per turn."" This card can be used for Ritual Summoning Relinquished with ease because when Relinquished is Special Summoned, M-E Illusionist is returned from the GY to your hand. It also can be used similarly to a handtrap as it's first effect can counter cards. <p class=""engine-dark-box"">Magical Illusionist Faceless Mage is perfect candidate for post-Instant Fusion. ""If a face-up ""Eyes Restrict"" Fusion Monster or ""Relinquished"" you control is destroyed by battle or card effect while this card is in your hand or GY: You can Special Summon this card. If this card is sent from the field to the GY: You can target 1 ""Eyes Restrict"" Fusion Monster or ""Relinquished"" in your GY; Special Summon it. You can only use each effect of ""Magical Illusionist Faceless Mage"" once per turn."" Basically, Instant Fusion an Eyes Restrict while MIFM is in hand, end turn once satisfied, kill the IF target, Special Summon MIFM. You got a body right there! You can also send it from the field to the GY to Special Summon that IF target back to the field. Rinse, repeat, victory!</p> Relinquished Fusion the Quick-Play Fusion Card for the ""archetype."" Fusion Summon 1 ""Eyes Restrict"" Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, by banishing Fusion Materials from your hand, field, and/or GY. During your Main Phase: You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls; equip that target to 1 ""Eyes Restrict"" Fusion Monster or ""Relinquished"" you control, and if you do, it is treated as being equipped by the equipped monster's effect. You can only use each effect of ""Relinquished Fusion"" once per turn. Yet another way to use Equip shenanigans.  Those are the major cards to worry about. Have fun with the deck! :D</div></blockquote>"
