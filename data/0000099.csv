(Also, I wanted to throw any JoJo fans here a bone!)","This is a Numeron Eldlich deck I made recently. I actually got the idea to make it months ago, but I've been too lazy to post a deck profile. Anyways, this deck is named after Gold Experience Requiem, the most powerful Stand in JoJo's Bizzare Adventure: Vento Auero. So, between this and Golden Wind(<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/golden-wind/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/golden-wind/</a>), that's TWO Eldlich decks inspired by JoJo.

&nbsp;

Anyways, you'd prefer to go first with this deck, but 9 hand traps and some go-second cards in the Side Deck mean that it can still pack a whallop if you don't, especially given the battle-related effects of the Rank 1 ""Numeron Gate"" monsters. Nonetheless, you'd prefer to go first and try to summon Utopic ZEXAL so your opponent will never arrive at the truth.

&nbsp;

And before you ask...YES, that WAS a JoJo reference!"

So madolche ,the sugar of yugioh, which affects its opponent with diabetes.

Today I'm gonna show you some combos and boards this deck is able to pull.

The first combo I'm gonnaa show you is : It's basically a one card combo , if you have madolche magileine in your hand normal summon her then acc her eff to search petingcessoeur then acc her eff to special summon it self then he second eff will trriger which will let you special summon one madolche monster ,the one you want to summon is puddingcess,then use magileine and puddingcess as materials for madolche teacher glassouffle after that detach magileine and use her first (protection) eff but you dont want to acc the second eff bc we gonna need it for later on . Now what you want to do is to use her as material for madolche puddingcess chocolat - a - la mode , acc her first eff to target one monster in the gy to shuffle back in the deck then detach glasssouffle to acc her second eff and special summon anjelly then acc her eff which will dump her in the gy and the summon hootcake ,then acc his eff to target glassouffle in the gy to special summon messengelato from the deck then acc his eff to serch for chetau acc it ,it will trigger his eff to shuffle the monsters from your gy back in the deck then acc chocolate -a-la- modes eff and special summon another messengelato now acc his eff to add ticket acc ticket , now using messengelato petingcessoeur to make glassouffle ,now use the other messengelato and chocolate to make fresh sistart and now you can finally acc the eff of glassoufle to shuffle back massengelato and puddingcess and then special summon another massengelato and take promenade to your hand set it then pass the turn,but one thing make sure that hootcake is linked with fresh sistar.

Now the sphere mode otk combo : lets say youre second and sphere mode your opponent ,now if you have puddingcessoeur summon her special summon puddingcess then overly those two for glassouffle ,then detach puddincessoeur now go into chocolate using glassouffle as material acc her eff to shuffle back puddingcessoeur now dettach glassouffle to special summon anjelly then her eef to special summon hootcake ,acc hootcakes eff banish glassouffle special summon messengelato - eff add cheteau acc it shuffle your gy back to the deck , now aac chocolates eff to summon the second messengelato - eff add salon acc salon ,now overlay the two messengelatos for queen detach a material from queen shuffle your into the deck again now use salon to target the sphere mode now the eff of salon triggers then set ticket acc it now make a chocolate using the queen now attack for game but if you need some more damage then go straight into ticket summon messengelato and then set promenade just for the case .

This deck has so many combos to do ,but for now I'll give you this two .

Have fun with the deck."

Your general play is to get <strong>Raviel, Hamon, </strong>and<strong> Uria </strong>in your hand, onto the field, or in the graveyard so that you can fuse into the <strong>Armityle</strong> retrain using <strong>Dimension Fusion Destruction</strong>. Cards like <strong>Dark Beckoning Beast, Chaos Summoning Beast, </strong>and<strong> Dark Summoning Beast</strong> help get the Sacred Beasts into your hand or onto the field with the help of <strong>Opening of the Spirit Gates </strong>of course. If you plan to activate <strong>Dimension Fusion Destruction </strong>and plan to fuse a Sacred Beast that you currently control away, you can Link it off into <strong>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</strong> since you can fuse by banishing from the grave too.

<strong>Soldier of Chaos </strong>gets it effect to be untargetable and indestructibility from card effects since you used a level 7 or higher monster and it can be an out to <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong> in the battle phase since <strong>Raviel, Hamon, Uria,</strong> and og<strong> Armityle</strong> still lose out to its ability to gain attack of the monster it's battling if it has a level. <strong>Soldier of Chaos  </strong>can gain 1500 ATK if it destroys a monster by battle so you can use it to attack into Crystal Wing and it wont be able to gain ATK since <strong>BLS</strong> is a link monster.

<strong>Exodius, the Ultimate Forbidden Lord</strong> is material for a Rank 10 monster and is also a target for <strong>Magicians' Souls</strong>. <strong>Capshell </strong>a free draw and a target for <strong>Spirit Gates </strong>and<strong> Dark Beckoning Beast</strong>'s extra normal summon. <strong>Relinquished Amina</strong> allows you to equip one of your opponent's monsters to it. This allows you to free up one of your opponent's zones to give them the <strong>Armityle</strong> retrain. <strong>Verte Andaconda</strong> is for your fusion spell. <strong>Pentestag</strong> is for your monsters doing piercing. <strong>Gustav Max </strong>and<strong> Liebe</strong> for more damage and field presence. <strong>Mannequin Cat </strong>and<strong> Crumble Logos</strong> are there for you get <b>Infinite Impermanenced. </b>

<strong>Reasoning </strong>and<strong> Foolish Burial</strong> for grave set-up. <strong>Evil Mind </strong>is a free draw or a search for <strong>Dimension Fusion Destruction</strong> if you go against something like <strong>Adamancipator</strong>(?).

Try to get <strong>Clock Tower Prison</strong> or <strong>Terraforming</strong> to add <strong>Clock Tower Prison </strong>(not <strong>Dark City</strong>!). Wait 4 turns or use cards like <strong>Destiny HERO - Dread Servant </strong>or <strong>Eternal Dread</strong> to get counters faster. When you have 4 or more you don't take any battle damage until it's destroyed, and in that case you get to summon <strong>Destiny HERO - Dreadmaster</strong>!

If you can't do a combo like this, then defend yourself with <strong>Destiny HERO - Defender </strong>or <strong>Destiny HERO - Dynatag</strong>!

But what about Fusion? You know, use <strong>Polymerization </strong>or <strong>D-Fusion</strong>.

Don't forget about <strong>Masked HERO Dark Law </strong>and <strong>Anki</strong>! They are both DARK monsters, just like your <strong>Destiny HEROS </strong>are!"

If you are taking this deck to locals, the main deck as shown below is probably fine. You should really try to fit in <strong>Dark Ruler No More </strong>or other cards that just stop your opponent's board going second.

You really want cards in your hand rather than field presence in this deck since a lot of this archetype's cards restrict you to only Fusions or make you just not be able to Special Summon for the rest of the turn like what <strong>Neos Fusion</strong> does. That is why we are playing no Link/Xyz monsters and some heavy draw power. For the draw power, <strong>Three Tactical Talents</strong> is actually good, but the situation will rarely be there where this is active since if you are bringing <strong>Neos-Spacians </strong>to locals or a tournament, you are expecting that they are also playing decks that are just as bad. <strong>Generation Next</strong> is in the side deck since you aren't always going to have it live despite how good it is. You could play <strong>A Hero Lives</strong> to shotgun <strong>Prisma </strong>off the top and have <strong>Generation Next </strong>live, but it is a limited card resulting in it not being always there in your starting hand. You do have <strong>Performapal Popperup</strong> to get <strong>Generation Next</strong> live, but you kind of want to set the other spells/traps that you need face-down before activating <strong>Popperup</strong> so that you aren't burn't for like 5k due to its effect and <strong>Generation Next</strong> is a Quick-play Spell (For some apparent reason) so you can't activate it the turn you set it.

There is literally no starting combo you can do with this deck since such a thing doesn't exist. But if you do get a Fusion on the field, you can equip it with <strong>Favorite Hero</strong> to get a monster with like almost 8k ATK if its a triple fusion, <strong>Flare Neos</strong>, or <strong>Air Neos</strong> since those bois have a grand amount of ATK. Also, at the start of the BP, if you don't have a Field Spell for <strong>Favorite Hero</strong>'s ATK boost, the card lest you activate any field spell from the deck like <strong>Neo Space</strong> for more ATK and no shuffle away eff or <strong>Mystic Mine</strong> since this deck sucks.

Extra Deck has the triple fusions since they are decent and their shuffle effects can be devastating to your opponent (and yourself too????) but they are very hard to get on the field. <strong>Brave Neos </strong>searches almost every spell/trap in your deck. <strong>Air Neos </strong>gains ATK equal to the difference in LP you will have from the <strong>Performapal Popperup </strong>burn. <strong>Grand Neos</strong> is just trying his best here and <strong>Flare Neos </strong>is a possible big beefy boi. No Links because of the stupid fusion restrictions on most of the spells/traps in the main deck."

Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend can destroy all other Special Summoned monsters on the field, and deal 500 damage to your opponent for each destroyed monster. Obviously Beelze is immune to this, so you get another 3K attacker to follow up on the nuke.

Borreload Furious Dragon can target 1 monster your control and 1 card the opponent controls to destroy them. If you target Beelze with this, it'll still pop your opponent's card, so you get free quick-effect removal every turn.

Topologic Bomber Dragon destroys all monsters in the Main Monster Zones if a monster is special summoned to a zone a Link Monster points to, so just summon Beelze in one of the 3 zones below it."

So to speak, the only cons would be Hyozanryum, which requires two sacrifices and has little attack. But there are variants on the deck to summon it.

With","the main hand in the deck you'll be looking at is a way to get Aleister and 3 Cyberse monsters or ways to get to three and a hand trap. With this, going first you'll do the Invoked combo first to normally get out Mechaba but put it in the main monster zones. Next, you'll get your Cyberse monsters on the field, link into Link devotee and Link disiple then do mathmech plays from there but you'll also link into Code talker inverted to special the Nabla from your hand. All in all, it is a fantastic deck that easily goes first or second and can play through normally 2 negates. and has a good hand trap line up.  If you're going second you can get out mechaba to play through negates and then do Mathmech OTK to win.

It is similar to <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/mist-valley-1-card-negate/"">my other deck that ends with the same Mist Valley lock</a>, but with a longer combo and the addition of I:P Masquerena/Avramax to the end.

The combo:

-Summon <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> (With one of the starters listed in the next section), and use its effect to summon <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion</a> from the Deck.

-Summon <a data-name=""Linkross"">Linkross</a> using Halqifibrax as material, and use its effect to get 2 Link Tokens.

-Summon <a data-name=""Martial Metal Marcher"">Martial Metal Marcher</a> using O-Lion and 1 of the Link Tokens. Use O-Lion's effect to get a Mecha Phantom Beast token, and use Marcher's effect to summon O-Lion back from the GY.

-Summon Accel Synchron using O-Lion and the Mecha Phantom Beast Token. Use its effect to send <a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a> to the GY and decrease its level by 1.

-Summon <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> using Marcher and the remaining Link Token.

-Summon Primathmech Alembertian using Herald and Accel Synchron (which is level 4 by its effect). Use its effect to add <a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla to your hand</a>, and chain Herald's effect to add <a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Art"">Advanced Ritual Art</a>.

-Use Alembertian's effect to Tribute itself and Summon Nabla from your hand.

-Use Nabla's effect to tribute Linkross and Summon <a data-name=""Mathmech Division"">Mathmech Division</a> from your Deck.

-Summon <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> using Nabla and Division. Use its effect to detach either Mathmech and add <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> to your hand.

-Discard 1 card (not Advanced Ritual Art or Block Dragon) to Summon Jet Synchron from the GY.

-Summon <a data-name=""Reprodocus"">Reprodocus</a> using Gallant Granite and Jet Synchron.

-Banish Primathmech Alembertian, Mathmech Division, and Gallant Granite to summon Block Dragon to the zone Reprodocus points to.

-Use Reprodocus' effect to make Block Dragon a Winged Beast.

-Summon Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty using Reprodocus and Block Dragon. Use Block Dragon's effect to add <a data-name=""Gigantes"">Gigantes</a> and <a data-name=""The Rock Spirit"">The Rock Spirit</a> to your hand.

-Banish Block Dragon to summon Gigantes, and banish Reprodocus to summon The Rock Spirit.

-Summon <a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"">Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</a> using Gigantes and The Rock Spirit.

-Detach both materials from Dugares to summon Herald of the Arc Light from the GY.

-Summon <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> using Dugares and Herald. Use Herald's effect to add <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> to your hand.

-Use Advanced Ritual Art to send Guardragon Justicia to the GY to summon Devotee. Use Devotee's effect to summon <a data-name=""Disciple of Nephthys"">Disciple of Nephthys</a> from your Deck.

-Summon Union Carrier using Devotee and Disciple of Nephthys. Use its effect to equip <a data-name=""Mist Valley Thunderbird"">Mist Valley Thunderbird</a> to Simorgh.

-End your turn, and use Simorgh's effect to summon <a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a> from your deck.

-During your opponent's turn, summon <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> using I:P Masquerena and Union Carrier (with I:P Masquerena's effect).

At this point, you should be able to negate as many of your opponent's effects as you want (with Apex Avian's effect), while Avramax's effect makes sure your opponent does not attack Thunderbird after it has benn Summoned.

Deck breakdown:

Main Deck:

<a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> x3, <a data-name=""Sangan"">Sangan</a> x3, <a data-name=""Righty Driver"">Righty Driver</a> x3, <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a> x3, <a data-name=""Draconnet"">Draconnet</a> x3: These are the starters used to summon Halqifibrax.

<a data-name=""Crusadia Arboria"">Crusadia Arboria</a> x1, Lefty Driver x1, <a data-name=""Guardragon Justicia"">Guardragon Justicia</a> x3: These cards are summoned with the effects of the starters. Justicia is also needed in the deck for Advanced Ritual Art.

<a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion</a> x1, <a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a> x2, <a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a> x1, <a data-name=""Mathmech Division"">Mathmech Division</a> x2, <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> x1, <a data-name=""Gigantes"">Gigantes</a>/<a data-name=""The Rock Spirit"">The Rock Spirit</a> x2, <a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Art"">Advanced Ritual Art</a> x1, <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> x1, <a data-name=""Disciple of Nephthys"">Disciple of Nephthys</a> x2, <a data-name=""Mist Valley Thunderbird"">Mist Valley Thunderbird</a> x2, <a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a> x2: These cards are needed for the combo (see above). All non-Mist Valley cards that have 2 included cannot be used unless they are in the Deck. Gigantes and The Rock Spirit are completely interchangeable, this deck list uses 1 of each but 2 of 1 of them is fine. I have 2 of each Mist Valley monster because it is nice to be able to summon a second Apex Avian at the end of the opponent's turn, and despite the numerous negation effects Mist Valley Thunderbird can sometimes be removed by quick-play spells like <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> and <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>.

<a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> x3, <a data-name=""Prohibition"">Prohibition</a> x3, <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> x3: These cards are used to protect the combo, Called by the Grave is mostly used to stop <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom</a> and <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, and Prohibition is able to prevent Ash Blossom (or <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru</a>, if you also have Called by the Grave). Dark Ruler No More is a great card for removing any monster-based threats when forced to go second, and it can be discarded for Jet Synchron if you draw it going first. I plan to add <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> and cards to banish with it once it releases, but for now it is not included because this is a TCG deck.

Extra Deck:

<a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> x1: This card is used with Sangan to eventually summon Crystron Halqifibrax.

Crystron Halqifibrax x2, Linkross x1, Martial Metal Marcher x1, Accel Synchron x1, Herald of the Arc Light x1, Primathmech Alembertian x1, Gallant Granite x1, Reprodocus x1, Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty x1, Number 60: Dugares the Timeless x1, I:P Masquerena x1, Union Carrier x1: These cards are all part of the combo. Halqifibrax is at 2 in case you run into an Ash Blossom with nothing to counter it.

Side Deck:

<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> x3, <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a> x3, <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> x3, <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> x3, <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> x2, <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> x1: These cards are all used to stop combo decks that get to go first games 2 or 3, except Red Reboot which is a counter to Impermanence or whatever other traps my opponent may have. The side deck cards are subject to change based on what seems to frequently threaten the combo."

(For YGO players and Boku No Hero Academia fans alike!)","This is a Prank-Kids deck that uses their new Link 1, Prank-Kids Meow-Meow. Because of how easy she is to summon, and the floating effects of the Main Deck monsters, Meow-Meow gives Prank-Kids a much-needed improvement!

This deck is meant to go first, but thanks to it having a total of 8 hand traps, and 9 cards in the Side Deck, going second won't do much to hinder you.

As for the reason for this deck's bizarre name, allow me to explain. Lately, I've been binge-watching Boku No Hero Academia, or ""My Hero Academia"", if you prefer. One of the Heroes is Miss Joke, and her Quirk(superpower), Outburst, causes her victims to laugh uncontrollably, making it much easier for her to defeat them. Given the whole theme of Prank-Kids, it seemed kind of appropriate.

The gun dragons (Dra-<em>gun</em>, if you will). These guys are pretty relevant to the meta game, and are surprisingly easy to pick up!</span>

<span>Basically, your normal strategy is going to involve targeting your Rokket monsters with various Link monster effects (namely <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Booster Dragon"">Booster Dragon</a>, and the family of Borrels), activate the Rokket monster's effect, then at the end of the turn, special summon a different Rokket from the deck!</span>

<span>These guys' biggest strengths include their ability to swarm the field and their quick effects, allowing various forms of destruction and removal (My personal favorite being <a data-name=""Shelrokket Dragon"">Shelrokket Dragon</a>). Another strength being their swole Link-4 Borrel dads and their crazy Topologic uncles. Want mass removal? Topologics. Want interruptions and the best way to trigger a Rokket? Borrels.</span>

<span>Now for the interesting part. Namely, how their greatest strength is their greatest weakness: Graveyard effects. These guys can get really hurt if your opponent activates Called by the Grave or Silent Graveyard, so plan accordingly. Borreload Savage Dragon can ease that problem, so plan ahead with this sweet deck.</span>

<span>Remember to have fun!</span>"

I decided to throw the Cyber Dragon engine in because it gives you a good negate and Infinity allows you to suck up a lot of problem monsters. Here's some notes.
<ul>
 	<li>Scrap Recycler  are used to send either Jet Synchron, Wonder Wand, any Orcust monster that isn't Girsu, or Cyber Dragon Herz &amp; Core to the grave to start plays. It plays a lot more of a role than I would have thought.</li>
 	<li>Girsu the Orcust Mekk-Knight is a good foolish burial for any Orcust monster and a free token if you don't control any other monsters. (which you can go into a Linkuriboh and get a Galatea off of just that!)</li>
 	<li>This deck is very graveyard focused so you have to watch out for Called By The Grave. But it gives you plenty of options to bounce back!</li>
 	<li>Your turn one board should be either a Galatea with Crescendo, a Dingirsu, Apollousa &amp; Infinity, or Savage Dragon. Or a combination of any of them! You have a lot of options but should keep in mind that once you start banishing Orcusts from the graveyard, you're locked into DARK monster special summoning for the rest of the turn. So get that Infinity or Apollousa out while you can. Oh yeah, and AccessCode Talker is here because we need a big beatstick and he happens to be the best suited I feel with his card destruction effect which isn't once per turn. Was Topological Zeroboros, but he's really unneeded unless you're using Gizmek Orochi for more power. (Also watch out for Nachster, because it locks you into only MACHINE types as well.)</li>
</ul>
I will be honest this deck can get a little brick heavy if you're going first because of the higher level monsters, but 9/10 I've found myself with at least one decent play to make in order to keep myself alive. It's very fun to play and isn't too complicated to try out!"

","The most feared,most hated,most dominant deck  alongside with sky striker ,zoodiacs ,dragon rullers in their format,yes I'm talking about pepe (performapal - perfomages).

Boards that this deck was able to set were crazy , there are a ton deck builds and a ton of ways to play this deck but i choose the full pover variant.

Pepe could easly defeat lieraly every other deck by going first , it was so strong in his format that they called an emergency banlist where they banned 7 cards from the deck ,and they stayed banned till now .

I'll just say one thing about pendulums Mjaespecter Unicorn - Kirin. The fact that its effect wasnt ""once per turn"" back at the days made him so strong ,that konami just felt the need to bann him. Even tho he is not part of the deck I put him in the side just for the case.

What else do I have to say about this deck , then thats it in my oppinion the best deck ever ."

This allows you to link up, use the effect again, and so on to generate the link 6 arrival ignister from only 2 cards!

Additionally, the other cards will allow for strategies such as using Cyberse Quantum Dragon, Cyberse Magician and Crusadia Avramax to create a field that cannot be targeted with card effects or battle due to the looping restrictions. This means that your opponent has to use kaiju effects or non-targeting removal to tackle the board you create!

Heres the bread and butter combo to create Arrival Ignister and Quantum Dragon opening up with Pikari and Achichi. From step 17 onwards you have a lot of options available depending on the opponents board, or what additional cards you have in hand to generate more resources on the field:

1: NS Pikari to search for Ignister A.I Land (If already in hand, search for A.I Reborn to extend)

2: Link Summon into Lingruiboh

3: Activate Ignister A.I Land

4:Activate Lands effect to SS Achichi

5: Active Achichis effect to search for Doyon

6: Link up into Cyberse Wicckid

7: Lands effect to SS Doyon at one of Wicckids arrows

8: Doyons effect to add Pikari to hand from GY

8: Banish Achichi to add Bururu to hand via Wicckids effect

9: Link up into Transcode Talker

10: Lands effect to SS Pikari anywhere but below Talkers down arrow (Because he was NS only this turn, and lands effect only restricts SS from land!)

11: Transcode Talkers Effect to SS Wicckid

13: Link all 3 into Dark Templar

14: Lands effect to SS Bururu to one of Templars Arrows

15: Templars effect to SS Doyon and Pikari

16: Synchro Summon Quantum Dragon using Bururu and Doyon

17: SS Doyon via Bururus effect

18: Link Summon Splash Mage with Doyon and Pikari

19: SS Pikari via Splash Mage

20: Link Pikari, Splash Mage and Dark Templar into your Link 6, 3k boss monster!"

Has Dux as fo","Competitive Structure Deck at last, but it comes with price (literally and figuratively). Dragunity combo is so convoluted unlike regular Dragon Link which is only a Romulus turbo. This deck made the combo easier to navigate and only needs basic understanding. All we need is <strong>Gae Dearg + 1 extender</strong> (but for King Calamity we need Couse, Remus, Phalanx in GY, Halq summons 1, so we need 2 of them in GY). Combo: <a>https://bit.ly/39efLg1</a>

Our main pieces are Dux (best starter with tuner in GY), Couse (lets us Barcha), Remus (extender and Ravine searcher, only use its GY eff after Halq), Ravine (dumper/searcher). The secondary pieces or extenders are Arma Gram (follow up play), Mystletainn (behaves like Dux but slightly worse), Legatus (our second Dux, play 2 cus we dont wanna draw multiple as it can be sarched by Gae Dearg if we draw Baby Roc), Phalanx (combo pieces for Savage/King Calamity), Baby Roc (combo pieces as Gae Dearg target, we need 2 and it equals to Legatus if we hard draw it), Glow (great spell but bad starter, only as combo pieces), Divine Lance (hopt like Glow, but is a great starter, we dont wanna draw double both this and Glow, so just run 1 copy of both), Monster Reborn (revives our boss monster), and lastly World Legacy Guardragon (fixing Pisty zone).

The rest of it is just staple or as Crossout target while being great handtrap. Only 2 Cards of Consonance because the target is only a few (like Orcust+Return ratio), so run Upstart instead. 3 Impermanence cus Zexal everywhere.

Extra Deck: Combo pieces. Ascalon as removal and floats, Coral Dragon as removal and easy to make, Vajrayana for beater and synchro climb, Borreload as non-target/non-destruction removal.

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/ZB7Klky.png"" alt=""image"" />

Pros: Consistent, big monsters, multiple negations, King Calamity stun, have follow up play, big staple slot.

Cons: Multiple cards combo, prone to handtrap (still can make 1 negation at least)."

The two heavy hitters are Boot-Up Admiral and Machina Citadel. Boot-Up is the easier of the two to bring out, as the Gadgets can easily be brought out by each other, and even from the graveyard thanks to cards like Pinpoint Guard. Citadel, meanwhile, is best brought out using Air Raider's effect. Machina Fortress is there as a reliable 2500 beatstick that is ridiculously easy to summon, and if it gets taken out, there's always Megaform to fall back on. The Gadgets exist mainly to either provide discard fodder or to be used as Xyz Material themselves. Fortress and Citadel can be brought out from the graveyard so cards like Twin Twisters and Fortress itself can discard them easily. Most of the Xyz Monsters are Rank 4, but there are a couple of Rank 8, as well as 1 Rank 7 (brought out by Fortress) and a couple Rank 5 (which is where Jumbo Drill comes in).

This is not a strictly meta deck, but I did not have the budget to get a bunch of Infinitrack cards."

Durring the years it has been toping ycs,lcs and all kind of events ,some years back it was even considered as undefeatable.those were times the nekroz,pepe,striker,true draco,pendulum magicians era,but now nekroz came back and hes given to less atention ,lets show them that rituals are not dead and what a deck like nekroz can truly do.

So what does the deck does is:

it has its own lock called the ""unicore lock"" where most extra deck based decks scoop ,becouse it prevents the opponent from using the effects of extra deck monsters ,altough you may think unicore is just 2100 atk and is easy to run over, there is nekroz of valkyrus for protection which says "" when an opponents monster declares an attack,you can banish one ""nekroz"" card from your gy and discard this card ,negate the attack and end the battle phase,and the thing about this card is that you can easly get it in your hand in almost every turn.

Enough about the deck now off to the 2020 combo.

Combo : this is bassically a one card combo ,then if you have lets say preparation of rities its better to acctivate it first to bait out the combo becouse that one card needs to go through and the card is deskbot 003 ,normal summon it then acc its first eff which lets you summon any deskbot monster from the deck and the one you want to summon is deskbot 001 ,then link them away into crystron halqifibrax acc his eff to special summon a tuner from the deck and the one you want to summon is 001 ,now link those 2 into auroradon activate his eff to ssmn 3 tokens ,the the gy eff from bot the 001 - s will activate which lets you summon it self from the gy if you special summon 2 or more machine monsters ,now use one token and one 001 to make herald ,now do it again ,now using the heralds xyz summon gallant granite to get nibiru to your hand.

Now since you dettached one herald to acc galants eff use heralds gy eff to add nekroz of brioniac to your hand , now use auroradons eff to sent 2 monsters from the field to the gy to special summon one phantom beast monster in which case you'll take coltwing acc his eff to ss 2 tokens which will trriger the 001 in the gy ,special summon them ,also acc the seconds heralds gy eff to searc for ben ten ,now using the token and one 001 make another herald ,using the left token and 001 make the crystron quandax now link the 2 synchros away for dugares the timelles acc his second eff whic will let you special summon one monster from the gy ,and the one you want to ss is herald ,since herald was sent to the gy use his eff to add unicore ,now use coltwing and herald for daigusto emeral ,acc his eff detach herald to shuffle back one herald ,halqfibrax and one 001 ,then you will draw one card of daigusto ,since herald was send to the gy trigger his eff to search for nekroz kalaidoscope ,now acc kalaidoscope and target the herald you just shuffeled back to ss unicore ,acc heralds eff for the final and last time to search for nekroz of valkyrus , now acc brios eff to add clausolas after that use his eff to add cycle,acc cycle to special summon brio from the gy by sending benten to the gy ,acc bentens gy eff to add archlord kristya and since you got at least 3 fairy cards in your gy ss archlord kristya ,acc his eff to add benten from your gy to your hand ,lets say u started your combo with one card and you added 4 ,how many cards do you have in your hand rn 8 ?!?!

Thats it for the combo ,but if you dont get deskbot 003 in your opening hand (which can happen) or your opponent negates the eff ,just do a normal nekroz play to have unicore on the field ,valkyrus in the hand and if you can secret village and it should go through somehow ,or if you can even expand it ,its up to you .
<ul>
 	<li>Have fun testing this deck and show them that nekroz is back ,let them fear it one more time .</li>

Featuring girsu for amazing first tur","Generaiders are back with Loptr and Girsu! Running the optimal ratio of hand traps for going second and consistency along with a toolbox for every situation, get ready for a blast! Your best starter is Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight! Summon him and send World Armor to grave then activate his effect to create tokens to both sides of field and special summon Linkuriboh using token. Now go into Lib the World Key Blademaster and set World Legacy Succession from the deck. Alternatively if you were unable to send World Armor to grave because he is in hand, go into Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star and discard World Armor adding Succession to hand. Activate succession reviving World Armor using it's effect to add World Legacy Burgeoning to hand. Make Linkross using whichever link monster you made and if you were able to make Lib use her effect to shuffle away your opponents token and create 2 additional tokens, tributing 1 of them for Linkuriboh's effect. After this use 3 monsters to special summon Trishula of Icy Imprisonment and finally target him with your Burgeoning special summoning both Mardel and Harr from deck allowing you to search any generaider card. If you have a generaider monster in hand add Boss Quest, otherwise do the minimum to make sure you have the field spell or if you have the field spell one of the generaider traps. Activate your field spell and make Jormungandr without using Harr activating his effect and making you and your opponent draw. This will trigger Harr's effect forcing your opponent to send a monster to the graveyard AND trigger your field spell allowing you to summon an additional generaider.

If you start with Vyon, the main way into Isolde is send Shadow Mist, search Liquid Soldier, banish Shadow Mist, search Poly, Poly for Sunrise, draw 2 discard 1, search Miracle Fusion, summon Ab Zero, link into Isolde - full combo. This means you wipe boards at the start of your combo, which can be a pretty cool way to start a turn. These are also monsters you extend sometimes."

The main point of this deck is to play off how the older toon monsters are worded, where they don't actually need Toon World/Kingdom on the field to attack directly (in this case, Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon and Toon Dark Magician Girl). You have the basic searchers, Bookmark and Tables, because if this deck is going to do anything, you will need all the searching you can get. Rollback, because why not, it's pretty much the only Toon spell you have access to without Toon World. Also Briefcase, which only requires a toon monster, for some reason.

So, even though you don't need Toon World to attack directly, you do need it for the summon right? Wrong! Because Red-Eyes Toon Dragon and Toon Dark Magician both ignore summoning conditions, so you need those as quickly as possible, hence Black Stone and Insight. Levianeer and BLS, because I needed to fill space, same with Chaos Space.

Does this deck work? Theoretically, yes, but since you have basically a clunky mess with no Extra Deck (you can do whatever you want with that, it's not like you'll ever get to it), and since you don't have Toon World, you don't have Comic Hand, Page Turn, Mimicat, or any other good toon support, you will probably lose by turn 4.

So why did I make this deck? Because I like finding weird loopholes in old cards. So if you play this deck good luck, you will need it."

So off to the combos :

1th combo : For this combo you will need one spell you can discard ,one ""little witchcrafter "" to special summon Verre from the deck thats gonna be the first step ,then you will also need to have the card spell chronicle in the hand ,and a way to put witchcrafter patronus in the gy either with foolish burrial goods ,schmiettas eff or by having it in the hand whyle acctivsting spell chronicle ,after the effect you will discard your whole hand so if you have more plays to do before the eff  off spell chronicle resolves better play them ,then you can banish any 5 spell cards  from your deck (I preffer 5 different withchcrafter spells) ,which you can get bach with patronuses eff durring your opponents turn for the lp gain eff of verre and also the negation eff.

2.nd combo: in this combo ill explain why i have 3 copies of patronus in this deck,so the combo starts this way : if you have gennie and witchcrafter creation use creation to get haine ,with genni special summon verre ,the goal is to have as much copies as of one card in the gy as you can to resolve gennis gy eff which adds you any witchcrafter monster from the deck to your hand and the card which you want to add is arruru then set patronus and end your turn ,the in your opponents turn the contorol starts acctivate the eff of patronus target the banished genni shuffle her in the deck then add witchcrafter unvailing use the eff to ss haine and be sure to have an bigger amount of spells in your hand to resolve both verres and haines eff,altough tje best way to do is combo is if you have lets say schmietta 3 witchcrafter spells and patronus in your hand ,then acc schmietta to ss genni then acc the gy eff of schmiette to send bystreet to the gy which you can acc at your endphase ,and continue with the mentioned combo genni eff.. ,but this time you will have double protection due to bystreet and golem .

Now if you ask me why sorrcer of dm in the side ,I'll answer that with a counter question ,which is the most dominate deck in the current 2020 meta game ,eldcilch right,then there you have your answer ,but its not particullary made for lich ,it was made for all trap decks like traptrix,altergeist etc..,you can also include it in the lockdown to lock the opponent even from using traps , but make sure you're going first when you summon him ,also to summon him use the card double summon which i forgot to include ,its the easiest way i think.

Lockdown?!

Yes there is a witchcrafter lockdown which i think all of you alredy know ,but I'm gonna repat it for those who might not know it: so basically you need secret village of the spell casters ,thats the reson i put terra forming in the side if u dont have it alreday in the hand ,then you will set summon limmit while havin a verre on the field and thats it ,but you have also another way to do the lockdown by discrding magicians restage to the gy to resolve his eff to add magicians left hand to your hand while you have the right hand alredy on the field if you dont have the secret village but i think the secret village option is way better ,you can expand the lockdown with the 2nd combo if you have enough resources in your hand ,the end board should look like this: verre ,secret village,summon limit,haine,magicians left hand ,golem in the hand with also an bigger amount of spells in your hand including and if you also find a way to put the scroll on the field its even better ,and if you can include sorrcer by any chanche ,so what you have is ,spell negate ,monster negate ,

Now for the extra deck :this deck doesn't need it at all ,but if you have matchups like let's say heroes and your opponent has bane on the field you can go into big eye  to steal it and destroy his board ,then selene is there just for the monster reeborn eff ,like i had situations where i needed verre but she was in the gy and i didnt had holiday in my hand so i used her eff to revive verre ,and theres also borrelsword and borreload just for game ,and the usual knghtmare package ,but as said it doesnt relay thst much on the extrawhich is the reason i use 3 copies of extravagance.

Now for the stats :

Both are good choices since if you sort your deck with Dominance you can destroy an opponent's monster to draw a card which you know what you'll since you sorted your deck. While with Destiny End Dragoon if it gets destroyed you can just banish a Destiny Hero monster from your graveyard to revive it during the standby phase. When fusing normally your go to Fusion Monster is going to Destiny Hero - Dystopia since you can inflict a good amount of burn damage while have a quickie destruction effect when it has a different attack then it's original. Destiny Hero - Dusktopia is probably the worst out of the fusions but still pretty good in my opinion as it can conduct another fusion summon if you have the materials to do so, and it can protect your monsters with it which is pretty good. The reason I put in 3 copies of D-Fusion is because I felt like it and you can remove 1 copy if you want. Adding some more Masked Hero support in the deck would be pretty beneficial as well."

The first card you want to use to link summon Code Talker is Micro coder, that will let you draw your draw engine ""Cynet Codec"". If you have cynet codec in your opening hand then you still want to use micro coder to draw you Cynet Storm.

You will get the chance to special summon alot and in a few cases make a couple normal summons a turn.

if youre looking to link circuit this is the order you need to do it in:

code talker in the left extra monster zone, code talker inverted below code talker, use code talker inverted to make Transcode talker, use transcode talkers effect to summon code talker inverted from the gy, use code talker inverted to make Excode talker, summon a code talker inverted to the right of excode, use code talker inverted to make shooting code talker, then summon a code talker in the other extra monster zone, if you have the resources at this point use transcode talker to summon Accesscode talker.

I tried to work in a negate effect in there but the arrows dont line up to pull off the link circuit, so its kinda give and take.

zeroboros is just there as a panic button card for the end game if the other monsters havent done the job yet."

&nbsp;

While Meklords finally got some love with their new cards, they're still not really viable in the meta, but did get a little better.

<a data-name=""Meklord Astro Dragon Triskelia"">Meklord Astro Dragon Triskelia</a> will be the main boss monster of the deck, being able to hit hard and hurt your opponent by stealing a monster from their extra deck, wtih the added benefit of being able to attack up to 3 monsters if one of the monsters its equipped with is a Synchro.

I'd say the deck benefits most from going first, as it gives you a chance to set up negates without having to worry about your opponents board. The main prbolem is hand traps, as they more or less shutdown your opening play outside of <a data-name=""Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core"">Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core</a> and <a data-name=""Meklord Assembly"">Meklord Assembly</a>. Depending on your hand you have several options:

<strong>Option 1- </strong><a data-name=""Meklord Army Arsenal of Obbligato"">Meklord Army Arsenal of Obbligato</a> and <a data-name=""Meklord Emperor Wisel"">Meklord Emperor Wisel</a> are needed in your hand. Summon Obbligato and uses it effect to destroy itself and summon two Meklord Army monsters from your deck, this will proc Wisel's effect so you can summon it. Link your two Meklord army monsters into <a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a>, and uses its effect to equip Wisel with <a data-name=""Dragon Buster Destruction Sword"">Dragon Buster Destruction Sword</a>. Now you've locked your opponent out of their extra deck and have a 3500 attack point monster on the field. If you have any traps in your hand be sure to set them for extra negates or stall and Wisel can also negate one Spell card per turn for another layer of defence. Your Graveyard is also set to be able to summon Triskelia. A downside is that Wisel is the only monster that can attack due to its effect.

<strong>Option 2- </strong>This can be done as long as you start with <a data-name=""Meklord Assembly"">Meklord Assembly</a> in your hand and any Meklord Emperor. Using Meklord Assembly you can search for Nucleus if it's not already in your hand, otherwise searh for any Mekord that you need. Summon Nucleus and use its effect to add Meklord Control to your hand. Use Meklord Assembly's other effect to destroy Nucleus by sending  Meklord Control to the Graveyard to summon one of your Emperors from the deck, this will also proc the effect of whatever Meklord Emperor is in your hand as well. Summon the Emperor from your hand and a different one from your deck using the effect of Nucleus. Wisel is good here as it adds that extra layer of defence with its effect. but <a data-name=""Meklord Emperor Granel"">Meklord Emperor Granel</a> could also work giving you a 4000 attack point monster and then using the other Emperor you can link into Linkuriboh as well. Granels attack is based off your LP so it may not be great later into the match or if you use Solemn Judgement next turn. Having Meklord Control in your Graveyard also helps your Meklords survive an effect or attack as well, since you can banish it to negate their destruction.

Of course their a more opening options but these two are the ones I like using the most, and can shut down some opening plays.

Going second is a little bit harder as you'll have a tougher time getting out your Meklords. To help going second <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More </a>and <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> are pretty self explanatory, and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> can help shutdown your opponents combos. Try and get Triskelia out as soon as possible if you can. The easiest way is through the use of Obbligato since it sends itself to the Graveyard and you can Link summon to send the others to the Graveyard.

&nbsp;

While some of the Spells and Traps seem obvious a choice like <a data-name=""Pulse Mines"">Pulse Mines</a> helps keep your Meklords alive and kicking forcing your opponent to have all their monsters in defence position. Link monsters do get round this and can cause a problem but both Solemn traps can help prevent your opponent getting any on the field. I did try <a data-name=""Guard Mines"">Guard Mines</a> as well but found it got very little use as to many effects are mutlitarget.

<a data-name=""Meklord Astro Extermination"">Meklord Astro Extermination</a> is a nice way to summon 3 of your Meklords from your Graveyard ignoring their summoning conditions, which is a nice way to get Triskelia and <a data-name=""Meklord Astro Mekanikle"">Meklord Astro Mekanikle</a> on the field. If your opponent dose have Synchro on the field too, it has the added benefit of being able to get rid of that as well.

<a data-name=""Meklord Control"">Meklord Control</a> can be used to boost one Meklord up to some high attack, and by banishing it from your Graveyard gives your Meklords some defence. Just remember it uses the original attack of Meklords you control, so Emperor Granel will contribute nothing to the total as an example, as its original attack is 0.

&nbsp;

As for the Extra Deck I used what most other Meklord decks use. <a data-name=""Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid"">Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid</a> is an alternative way to get a strong monster out on your field, such as <a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech King Great Magnus"">Super Quantal Mech King Great Magnus</a> as it's able to disrupt your opponents board by returning one card to their deck every turn as long as it has 2+ materials.

<a data-name=""Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer"">Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer</a> is another way to get rid of your opponents Spells and Traps will boasting 5000 attack points, its a nice anaswer to Spell and Trap heavy decks.

<a data-name=""Topologic Trisbaena"">Topologic Trisbaena</a> is another answer to Spell and Trap decks, and while it does remove yours too, it is an easier answer than Galaxy Destroyer.

&nbsp;

Again this is my first deck I've made and I'm no where near being a good deck builder, but I like Meklords and thought I'd try giving them a go. Again any constructive criticism and advise is welcomed.
