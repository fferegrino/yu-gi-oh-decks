It plays well into Maxx 'C', liberal space for non-engine to pack outs to problem board states, enough power and resillience to deal with opponents' attempts to kill you, and has ways around most common handtraps (except Gamma, but that bozo's functionally leaving the format in a week so even that won't be a problem). While Yubel and Tenpai are presently superior decks, Voiceless Voice stands as one of their unsung rivals.</p><p>The only question was how you wanted to build the deck. Branded and Dogmatika were common choices in the TCG, but Branded's limits in MD make that a non-starter IMO and Dogmatika just doesn't have the punch I'm looking for. Pure VV was, of course, an option (and how I played it in the past, I have a deck profile for pure from a few months ago).</p><p>Then I encountered the concept of Kashtira Voiceless Voice. I forget what gave me this idea, whether it was running into it in Ranked or seeing a decklist on YGOPRO or even just thinking about Kashtira Snake-Eyes (for those who remember that innovation from the MD playerbase), but here it is. I won't go into the card-by-card, but here's some reasoning on why I've built it this way:</p><ul><li>Kashtira is an engine that can be played before starting your main VV line without any issue. Drawing Unicorn or Wraitsoth is full Kash combo, and both baits out handtraps and disincentivizes your opponent from handtrapping the VV line by way of Unicorn's presence. It can also be performed without running into Nibiru by pausing your Kashtira combo after Unicorn's search, running through the VV line from there, then continuing after Skull Guardian's negate is online. It also means you're less likely to brick on non-engine, since three Kashtira cards are straight one-card combos and there's some two card combos that can all result in Shangri+Ariseheart on field even if you don't draw a VV card.</li><li>In a similar vein, the Kashtiras are also a good source of tribute fodder for the VV Rituals. They're all level 7 (except Riseheart, but he can even make himself a 7 if you're truly desperate), meaning you can use them as the whole material when summoning with Saffira's GY effect. Note that not being LIGHT means they cannot be used for a Ritual Summon with Prayers, however.</li><li>Kashtira also functions as a strong extra end-board set-up. Ariseheart is a walking Macros Cosmos with a huge attack stat and removal (and under Barrier, cannot be targeted for attack while Lo+Skull Guardian are present), which means he can often shut down turns on his own.</li><li>On the other end, Voiceless Voice is able to tolerate Ariseheart's presence as an end-board piece as long as you're not an idiot. Blessing lets you recur banished cards, and as long as you don't tribute Lo while Ariseheart's on the field you can generally get away with having him there.</li><li>Tenpai also has a decent amount of difficulty playing through Voiceless Voice if you can get Sauravis, Ancient and Ascended onto the field. While they theoretically have ways around it, a lot of Tenpai players will run straight into Sauravis by summoning Bident (at which point you can just use Sauravis to banish it before it even technically hits the field, removing it from being a problem at all). Prayers also lets us swiftly recover from most of Tenpai's destruction-based board-breakers, summoning Skull Guardian then reviving Lo to turn the negate back online.</li><li>We also main-deck 2x Evenly Matched as our primary board-breaker. It's half-economic purposes (Evenly is the best SR rarity board-breaker), but also that I find it preferable in most match-ups over other options. It's especially strong into Yubel, who is probably the best going-first deck in the format right now.</li><li>Imperm is probably the hand-trap I fear most right now, on grounds that it dodges Triple Tactics Talent and Called By (two of the anti-handtrap tools we run), meaning we need to hard-open Sauravis to fully be safe on protecting our activations.</li><li>Extra Deck is definitely very flexible. I rarely ever actually use any of these cards outside of the Kashtira line, so feel free to experiment.</li><li>Droll &amp; Lock Bird is very bad if it is activated on our turn, but it also is not especially common in this format right now. We can manage if we hard-open Lo+Skull Guardian, but otherwise you will have to figure out a line on your own based on your hand. There's not a lot of good options, sadly.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Terrortop is crazy because he sets up more combos using Levirtue Dragon and helps playing through handtraps using Totembird or Gossip Shadow. I dont main Virtue Stream though because you mostly just make Levirtue Dragon when you draw terrortop while Silhouhatte Rabbit can always be made and works under droll, playing both is too many bricks.</p><p>Non-engine was nice, would probably run more handtraps instead of Fenrir though. Daruma Cannon was busted again, even going second it just forces a grindgame which this deck mostly wins.</p><p>played 42 because I felt like with 40 you draw too many duplicates. With my next lists I will stay at 42 - 44.</p><p>Nothing too special in the extra deck. 2 Varudras is mandatory, I play 3 just in case. Lyna sadly didnt come up, but dont know if I would swap her for Knightmare Phoenix again. Lyna is nice if you want to make S:P and can search Demigod if you crash with her.</p><p>In the side deck, im honestly just trying out some things. I always play Ultimate Slayer + Targets, Thrust, Talents, Duster and now Dbarrier too. I also side Virtue Stream for going first.</p><p>I sided Phantazmay but never found him, same with Cosmic Cyclone. They could theoretically have been pretty good still so I dont know if I will keep them in the side deck or not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall Im extremely happy with that list. The only things you could maybe improve is playing a small fiendsmith engine, but I havent tried that yet and it might not even be the right decision because of how many extra deck slots it requires.</p>"

You can also send Trencher or Tunneler to the GY instead. Trencher allow to extend and Tunneler to draw.</p><p>- Activate Outrigger effect targeting River to SS Arise-Heart. You now have an Arise protected from targets and that is quite hard to pass through battle because of Road Roller's effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to acces the Earth Machine monster ?&nbsp;</strong>Now to perform the previous combo you need one Earth Machine monster on the field.

Those are my favorite but you can use other instead, like the trains. I found those quite usefull since Anchor is accessible through Heavy Forward, the Vernusylph can send a Road Roller to the GY to SS after and the SHS engine is so powerfull here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The SHS combo :</strong> I come now to the SHS engine and all the versatility it gives to the deck. I recall here the basic SHS combo :</p><p>- Wakaushi -&gt; Monk -&gt; Soulgaia</p><p>You now have 2 LV4 on the field. One of them being an Earth Machine tuner. What can you do from there ?</p><p>- You can perform your previous combo, Soulgaia being the Earth Machine monster.</p><p>- You can Xyz Summon <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=28912357"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/28912357.jpg"" data-card=""28912357"" data-name=""Gear Gigant X"">Gear Gigant X</span></a> to add Harvester turning your SHS engine on a one card combor. You can also add something else to extend like another infinitrack.</p><p>- You can go into the Synchrol line. Synchro Bureido and activate its effect to SS Shirokunishi and place Wakaushi into the Pendulum zone. Synchro Bureibu and activate its effect to SS Kunamzan.</p><p>This last play is the most powerfull. The Kunamzan can be used as the Earth Machine monster from Infinitrack combo but it also provide a LV5 to go into Cyber Dragon Infinity. It also provide a Pendulum Summon that can help to extend either with Pegasus or Anchor Drill and can often give access to Infinity or S:P.</p>"

I even made a (terrible) video showing how this time!</p><p>First things first, the ability to perform The World FTK is a 1-card combo off of both <strong>Union Hangar</strong> (which includes <strong>Terraforming</strong> and <strong>Set Rotation</strong>) and&nbsp;<strong>Union Activation</strong>. The line is similar within both, as your goal is just to gather all six pieces of the A-to-Z fusions, get Light Barrier, and put Union Activation into the GY. Basically, this hasn't changed from the previous build.</p><p>A major change, however, is the expansion of the Fiendsmith engine to be more complete. The addition of&nbsp;<strong>Lacrima</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Sanct</strong> in addition to&nbsp;<strong>Engraver</strong> is just to give the deck a bit more grind capability - you can summon Lacrima off of Requiem to pitch Engraver for the summon of <strong>Desirae</strong> and link Desirae and <strong>Sequence</strong> off for&nbsp;<strong>Agnumdei</strong>, and that will set you up for at least one revival of Desirae if it's outed at some point. Of course, this is all in the event you either decide you dont want to or are unable to position yourself to summon The World.</p><p>Speaking of ""unable to summon The World"", the backup endboard has been modified greatly, weaving both&nbsp;<strong>Psy-Framelord Omega</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Silhouhatte Rabbit</strong> into the line to add both a hand rip and a summon negate in the form of&nbsp;<strong>Azurune</strong>.</p><p>All in all, these modifications make the deck feel much nicer - less chaff in the Extra Deck, every piece of the combo is actually used reasonably often, and the ability to FTK is not sacrificed in the process.</p>"

Most paleozoic decks exceed the 40 cards limit for consistency (to 60 cards main deck) by adding ""Needlebug nest"" and many other useless paleozoics.

Rocket Salamander. <br />The base combo is this-<br />Summon Rocket Salamander (through any means, Normal summon, special summon through OSS or One for One, ect) &gt; Tribute Salamander for it's effect, summon Screw Serpent, Serpent revive Salamander, Synchro into Ib, Ib effect add World Legacy World Chalice. <br />If you special summoned Salamander, you're fine to just normal summon the Chalice by tributing Ib. If you normal summoned Salamander, you'll need to summon Ib the the EMZ, and then link it off for Gravity Controller (after which you use Ib effect summon Crowned, link Crowned into Imduk, Tribute Controller and summon Chalice. then resume combo)<br />After summoning Chalice, use Ib's effect to summon Lee from deck, then Lee effect to add Crowned. Link Lee and Chalice into something (Currently testing Sprind, but Auram should work as well. This list was originally a Master Duel deck and I used Spright Elf, but that's banned in the TCG) then Chalice effect summon Guardragon and Crowned from deck. Next is where it changes up a bit, I know there's a lot you can do from this point but currently what I've found to work best is to XYZ into Gigantic and do Spright plays. <br />Currently Rocket Salamander (special summoned) gets me to Gigantic, S:P, Abomination, and Avramax OR Avramax (made with I:P), Earlie, Gigantic, and a set Sorrows <br />Originally in Master Duel, I would end on Apollousa instead of Abomination (Abomination is just a replacement with good arrows and an okay effect, I could see Saryuja Skull Dread being a good option as well)</p>"

Kashtira birth is clutch against d shifter decks as well. The diabelstar is just there as an extra body and a ponix summon with the OG sinful spoils. If you can get either ulcanix or ponix effect off, it becomes very hard for your opponent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All the non engine you can just replace with whatever you like, for me this works because the droplet kinda gives you infinite chain blocks with kirin and the circle as well. You can choose to put more handtraps in the deck but the crossouts really help when going first.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have things to recommend pls let me know!</p>"

The goal is to use Dreadmaster for the fusion of either DPE or Dominance. Once it's your opponent's turn you can pop Dominance and their card to bring out Dreadmaster for the protection and then of course the big punch next turn. That's really it, just big guy punch. It's fun. The D-Force in the side deck is if you're going second and need to turbo out Plasma. The D-Tactics are for Dystopia, which is why I have a second one in the side deck. D-Tactics is a lot more gimmicky than the Dominance line so unless you're messing around I wouldn't really go for it. Since it's a pure Destiny HERO deck I tried to use as little of the other HERO cards as possible, hence the ""weird"" ratio of Vision and Elemental HEROs. I've been building and updating this deck for months now and this is what's been working best for me. Feel free to ask or tell me improvements in the comments.</p>"

The whole idea of Nouvelles is that your opponent never wants to target anything ever, or you can climb up the ritual levels. this best can put up a ton of interruption with very few cards on field, with my end board usually being, at the worst, just buerillabaisse and chef's special recipe. however if the opportunity presents itself, diviner, who is already a good combo piece, can be used to synchro summon after sending arc light to grave. I find it easiest to put up level 7 (diviner + poissonaire/buerillabaisse) or level 12 (Diviner + baelgril/hungry burger) however most levels are doable to some extent, if you want to substitute in a different synchro. Vagnawa is in the side deck as a time card when nessesary as this deck cannot burn in any other way. only other things to note is that benten can search itself on a non-once per turn when tributed for ritual material, while also searching diviner or trias. diviner and poissonaire both have important effects on summon, but also when tributed effect, which makes trias and enemy controller(going second) incredibly helpful to get around targeting negates (veiler/imperm/etc).<br />Overall deck works out most of the time, but in the case where you only get 1 starter and the opponent has ash, it's so over.</p>"

By half your stuff happening in the grave...,"<p>This is a Tearlaments deck at its core that synergizes with 4 major engines, Fiendsmith, Kashtira, Horus and Shaddoll. Each engine does its thing when in the hand or in the GY.</p><p>Fiendsmith can serve independently on its own with engraver as its starter, or if you happen to have extra bodies laying around, can be made with closed goddess with 2 extra bodies from either the Horus line or other incidental summons from Tearlaments/Kashtira.</p><p>The Kashtira line is the all around last resort that stays the lowest to the ground - fenrir banish and unicorn to hose out the extra deck is very important.</p><p>The Horus line provides extra bodies needed to either go into fiendsmith line or double up as extra bodies for The Zombie Vampire for extra mills or even to go into sprind to dump Merli and fuse on the fly. Worst case scenario, they are huge beatsticks that perform non targetting send to the GY, shuffling your banished cards back and provide lots of grind in battle.</p><p>At last but not least, Shaddoll. The Shaddoll package serves as the tippy-tip of the gameplan as it is the most incidental of all of the archetypes. It's serves as a way to fuse into Shaddoll Winda to force interaction or completely win games on its own or when it's sided, serves as additional negates with Apkalone coming out easily as a summon going 2nd and providing your team with the ability to proceed forward. Shaddoll Dragon serves to destroy annoying spells and traps and floodgates on the field and Ariel banishes opponent's cards, especially good against GY needers like Fire King and Snake Eyes. Maliss/Ryzeal are very resiliant to these cards so not fully recommended to bring Ariel into most matchups.</p><p>Rainbow Bridge of Salvation is one of the few ways you are able to bridge the 3 archetypes with field spells together - Horus, Tearlaments and Kashtira. Use this to grab whatever field spell is needed.

The basic idea was to summon the OG Demise ritual monster to break the field and then with the help of the level 10 Ruin ritual card (which can attack 2 times in a row if summoned correctly) to attack with these 2 cards for game.</p><p>But this restrictions makes this strategy a bit of impossible. So my next approach was to bring the OG Demise ritual monster and then the Impcantation boss monster with 2 other Impcantation monsters to hit for 9400 LP.&nbsp;</p><p>This might not be that easy to make a first turn kill cause handtraps and other disruptions can slow the process. This deck contains a 9 card draw engine which can help a lot with cycling through materials and pieces of the combo.</p><p>Impcantation Ratios: Most of the times Ritual monsters are way more accessible, cause we use more of them. The main reason for that is that Impcantation ritual spell can be retrieved from grave. So it's smarter to use more of level 3 and level 6 Impcantation monsters to activate them from hand. The level 10 Boss monster can even suffle them back to deck if needed, to never run out of resources.</p><p>Cards like swords of concealing light and gravity bind can help with slowing down your opponent, while they can be targets for Magician's soul or can even be destroyed by Demise.</p>"

White Forest cards also synergize very well with spell cards, since they use them as cost to enable them to spam tuners and synchro material on the field. The starters are&nbsp;3 Astellar, 3 Elzette and 3 Silvy - all searchers and summoners from deck. 3 Rucia isn't a starter, but it is a valuable extender since she summons from hand. 1 Tales of the White Forest (searcher), and 1 Woes of the White Forest (interruption) are used since they all reset themselves on the field when they are sent to the GY as cost for a monster effect, and are combo pieces for the strategy.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">A <strong>TOY BOX </strong>engine is used to further fuel the White Forest portion of the deck. Toy Box and Toy Soldier search each other, and Toy Box sets two cards from deck - giving White Forest plenty of spells to send to the GY as cost. It's not even a ""hard"" once per turn, so if you have multiple Toy Boxes you can keep setting resources from deck! The Toy Box monsters also summon themselves to the field whenever they're sent to the GY, so it gives additional bodies for synchro summons. Finally, Toy Box has a surprise battle phase effect to destroy attacking monsters by sending a set card to the GY, offering further defensive play. It is composed of 3 Toy Box, 3 Toy Soldier and 1 Toy Tank.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>BYSTIAL </strong>engine works extremely well with the White Forest strategy, granting the deck level 6 and 8 bodies to synchro summon with. Since White Forest is a light deck, it also synergizes very well with the interactions Bystials offer. For example, Dis Pater can summon your banished White Forest cards from the banished pile so you can continue comboing, and Branded Regained can recycle spent light/dark monsters in your GY so you can summon them again. On top of that, Bystials counter a fairly big number of today's meta like Gimmick Puppet, Yubel and Tearlaments.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">White Forest interrupts your opponent with Silvera's fieldwide ""Book of Eclipse,"" Baronne's negate, Dragoon's negate and Diabell's quick-synchro into Chaos Angel's banish.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">White Forest combos are somewhat linear, but resilient and can weave through interruption.

Important concept: This is a sky striker deck, not a tenpai deck, in which tenpai is used as bait to set up spells in the gy, material for the otk line and potenially otk just as how they are designed to, do not afraid to use desire but be careful with it. This deck works well aginst ryzeal, blue eyes, or potenally all fusion/link deck unless under shifter. The main play for this deck is to ultilize ultimate slayer to bounce and send back to extra deck for a free plus 1, while using spell cards to either bait negates and/or to filter out ultimate slayer. This deck frequently uses the link otk line to bait out opponent's interruptions while setting up small board with the effect of princess, then if possible set up negates to later drain down resources. Given chances tenpai's small trident dragion line would be useful for otking too. Super poly is currently an interesting board breaker in the format: Everything is fusable in Maliss's board, while detonator could be used as fusion material given that you start with the striker engine(most of the time)[Ignition Beast Volcannon = Machine + Pyro], they could also be used as the target for the sky striker field spell if they became a brick. The play is likely used as a bait for detonator's pop and could trigger and summon raye from the deck. Facing Maliss match ups, it is recommanded to bring chaos hunter instead of lancea is to limit the impact of shifter, where it could disable the Ultimate Slayer and Dropplet along with the striker engine. The deck does suffer from maliss match due to shifter, voiceless voice due to being unable to target monster with card effects and kashtira fiendsmith since the deck cannot interact with hand and may lose to the grind game. However the main advantage of this deck is a suprise for people who thought tenpai is dead and not knowing to hit the striker line or tenpai line.</p>"

It is not meant to be the best or meta/competitive whatsoever but can still be used in order to be able to play somewhat decently.<br /><br />Many of the handtraps can be replaced by other generic plant support such as the Aroma cards, the Ragnaraika cards, Sunavalon/Sunvine/Sunseed cards, or other generic plant support cards like -Therion ""Lily"" Borea, -Rose Girl, and -Evil Thorn just to name a few ideas. <br /><br />The Side Deck is comprised of some generic going second cards and things the deck lacks such as backrow removal as well as two other Extra Deck cards to consider which are -Sylvan Princessprite and -Orea, the Sylvan High Arbiter.<br /><br />A sample combo for this deck is as follows:&nbsp;<br /><br />Our starting hand will consist of a -Rikka Petal, a -Rikka Glamour, and a -Mudan the Rikka Fairy.To start, Normal Summon Petal, activate Petal add -Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy to hand. Activate Glamour tributing Petal in order to add -Rikka Princess and -Primula the Rikka Fairy. Activate Primula's effect because a monster we control got tributed in order to special summon herself. Activate Princess' effect in order to special summon herself. XYZ into -Rikka Queen Strenna. You CAN activate Strenna here in order to send Princess to the Graveyard and then add her to your hand (Or any other card like Glamour or Petal BUT Glamour will be used for Hyperyton and Petal likes to stay in the Grave). But for this example, I will keep Princess in the grave so I will NOT activate Strenna's effect. Activate Snowdrop's effect in order to tribute Strenna in order to special summon Mudan and Snowdrop. Mudan and Strenna will activate at the same time. You can choose the chain however you want and whichever you think is more important first. In this example, chain 1 will go to Mudan. Strenna, because she got tributed, will special summon a Rank 5 or higher Plant monster from the Extra Deck OR Graveyard and then attach herself as material. We will summon -Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton and attach Strenna as material. Mudan will add -Rikka Konkon from the Deck to the Hand. Activate Konkon and activate Hyperton's effect in order to attach Glamour from the Graveyard to itself as material (Now it has either a monster or spell negate during your opponent's turn). Activate Snowdrop's second effect in order to target herself and make all Plant monsters you currently control the same level as the targeted monster. In this instance, Mudan and Snowdrop will both be Level 8. XYZ into -Teardrop the Rikka Queen. Activate Konkon's effect in order to set -Rikka Sheet. And now, you can end your turn.<br /><br />This end board consists of a Quick Effect Tribute (Teardrop), a monster/spell negate (Hyperyton), a monster negate as long as you control a Rikka monster (Princess in Hand or GY), a negate for a face-up monster (Sheet), and a tribute for the effect of either Sheet or Princess (Konkon passive effect). As well as a Petal in the GY in order to special summon during your opponent's End Phase.<br /><br />The general game plan for the deck is to Normal Summon Petal, activate her effect to search out whatever Rikka monster you might need, (which for me I found is usually Snowdrop or Mudan) and then Tribute Petal using one of the Rikka monsters you added and you go from there.<br />The end board usually consists of: Teardrop the Rikka Queen, Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton with Rikka Queen Strenna and a spell card equipped as material, Rikka Konkon in the Field Spell Zone, a Rikka Princess in the Graveyard or the Hand, and a set Rikka Sheet as well as maybe a Rikka Petal in the Graveyard in order to summon during the End Phase of your opponent's turn.&nbsp;<br /><br />Overall, this is one of my favourite decks and archetypes to use in any sort of play and I hope you enjoyed my deck list!&nbsp;</p>"

I don't have a great combo idea yet because I hvaen't done nearly any play testing on it yet, but what I do know is that Girsu is the normal and you can follow a pretty linear world legacy combo to get a basic set up. If you want to truly insulate the girsu combo you have to use sanct to go through the fiendsmith combo first before commiting to the normal summon. Soma can be an extender if you get handtrapped on Girsu, but it is a pretty low to the ground endboard compared to no handtraps.</p><p>Realistically this deck is terrible, but I think it's the most playable version of Krawler so far, so I wanted to build this as an example of taking a low power deck and seeing if it could maybe snatch a round at locals.&nbsp;</p>"

This, combined with a larger than normal Bystial package, you can out grind your opponents.</p><p>Ideally, you end on D/D/D Wave High King Caesar, Maliss Q Hearts of Crypter, set Maliss C GWC-06 to summon Maliss Q White Binder from the grave to banish cards in the graveyard.Alternatively, you can end on Fiendsmith's Desirae, and using the Fiendsmith's Sequence as link material to link climb into your Maliss link monsters.</p><p>Simul Archfiend is a neat card that can counter a spread of matchups better than Dimensional Barrier, preventing your opponent from summoning links, xyz or fusion. Dimension shifter tests the current meta and may be replaced, as this deck does not synergize well with it.</p><p>All in all, Maliss is a deck that suffers heavily to cards like Artifact Lancea and Nibiru, the Primal Being. In my opinion, Firewall Dragon Darkfluid - Neo Tempest Terahertz isn't strong enough for the meta. Maliss don't really have good normal summons other than Maliss P Dormouse, so having the Maliss field spell in hand is often times better than having the Maliss monsters in hand.

It's also a very fun Synchro deck that's presently Rogue-ish in Master Duel right now. It's not perfect, but the small engine requirements and flexible build options can snatch games even against the best.</p><p>Due to laziness, I will not be doing a card-by-card, but it's got potential to be tiered when the Azamina cards come out. I don't think it's going to be top tier (outside of like a month or two if the Azamina cards release before Ryzeal/Maliss, and even then it'd probably not be a stand-out top tier), but it's got enough teeth to compete.</p><p>Beware the White Forest, for it may consume you completely (and make you into a Synchro supremacist like me).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

There are a few one card combos that get you 2 omni-negates, a bounce, and an on board monster negate. The deck really only dies to D-Shifter and Droll &amp; Lock Bird. It can play through just about anything else. I would add 2 Lo, prayer of the voiceless voice if I owned the copies, no need to cut anything for them, just add them to the list. The deck wants to be above 40 cards to decrease your chances of drawing your realms.</p><p>Starting with Diviner of the Herald or Lo gets you the full combo.</p><p>Diviner send Trias, SS by tributing Diviner. Diviner tributed SS Lo.&nbsp;</p><p>Lo places the barrier, adds saffira, send to add skull guardian. Banish to Ritual the skull guardian.</p><p>Lo comes back and Skull guardian adds Mistva. - one omninegate online at your 4th summon.</p><p>Scale Mistva, add the field spell and pop it. Activate field spell. Get your 3 names. Your choice of which to which zone, prefering the dino to hand in most cases. Use dino in hand to add the dino domains, shuffle the dino back in deck. Activate the dino domains. Activate the field spell to SS all 3 of your Ryu-ge non-pendulum cards. Overlay your Wyrm and Sea Serpent into varudrus. Second Omninegate.</p><p>On your opponents turn, you use Varudrus to negate something, then detach another to destroy Varudrus, this lets you tribute your Dinosaur to summon Mistva and when Varudrus is destroyed, it lets you destroy another card on the field. Mistva pop the field spell to place sea spires, giving you a bounce.</p><p>There are other variants depending on opening hand, you can add sauravis instead of one of the other rituals if you open one of them. When side boarding you can add either protos or dogoran, if you can set up your grave or need removal, though when you get to the point of activating the field spell to grab dogoran, you usually are interrupted before.</p>"

Yu-Gi-Oh! Deck Uploaded by Star Lord,"<p>The White Forest Architype gives something back to Centurion that was clearly missing before: more Tuners, that can be summoned on the opponents turn!<br /><br />We still have too many normal summons, so I'm thinking of scaling Astera back for more hand-traps (the deck struggles with indestructible, untargetable monsters).<br /><br />The overall 'flow' of gameplay is no where near as fluid or 'all gas' as the old Visas Synchro pile, but it has a clear identity, and clear tools to respond to most situations with. Using True Awakening, Phalanx and Silvera to intuerrupt the opponent if we go first is very effective, while going second we generally depend on the power of our spells and chain-blocking.&nbsp;<br /><br />Why are we playing both Emeth VI and Gargoyle II? They're both just useful. Dropping Emeth into the GY with Stand Up if we draw him feels great, while Gargoyle is just one of the best targets to search for with Stand-Up.<br /><br />Since the White Forest Tuners can special summon themselves on the opponents turn, we can also make use of any extra Gargoyles or Trudeas to make Level 10 Synchros, which is why Baronne is here. Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend is another good target, but needs more materials to make, so we're running Silhouhatte Rabbit instead.<br /><br />I'm considering playing more Rucia than Silvy, since we really wanna normal summon Trudea if we don't draw Stand Up. In the same vein, dropping Astellar until we get the Azamina support.</p>"

You want to go 2ed for the 6th card for bigger plays unless your match up is a deck you can't let set up a board then go first.</p><p>When going 2ed you can do some of the following...</p><p>Ultimate Slayer - To send monsters on there board back to there deck that may give you issues (its not once perturn and they can't use monster cards to respond so its not a bad way to start breaking the board. Also when going 1st its not a bad idea to use Spellbound in place of this card or using Super Polymerization going 1st or 2ed although the Super Polymerization is not always the best to try and go into Witchcrafter Vice-Madame unless you know there going to have a spellcaster or same match up but its a spell just toss it for cost at worst)</p><p>Diabellstar the Black Witch - If you did not draw into Ultimate Slayer you can special summon Diabellstar the Black Witch and set to the board from deck Sinful Spoils of Subversion - Snake-Eye to shut off one of there monsters or get rid of a monster you can't beat over. If the board does not look that bad just for for Sinful Spoils of Doom - Rciela or when going first its a good card to set so you can pop cards with low ATK before they go into bigger monsters or atleast take less damage from there bigger ATK monsters. (You often search Diabellstar the Black Witch with WANTED: Seeker of Sinful Spoils to add to hand)</p><p>Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous - When you go 2ed more times then not will be able to special summon this card for free then use her effect to bring out The Iris Swordsoul and you can also go into Fallen of Albaz as well this way from deck or hand.</p><p>The Iris Swordsoul - If you happen to draw into this card and don't have Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous in hand to just summon it you can wait for your opponent to negate any monster effect and just summon her to the board or you can also go into Witchcrafter Madame Verre and negate there effect monsters and chain to summon as well.</p><p>Witchcrafter Unveiling - This card is super good with any of the witchcrafter monsters as using this card will force out a negate or ""your opponent cannot activate cards or effects in response to the activation of your Spellcaster monster effects for the rest of this turn."" (Not just Witchcrafters yes all spellcasters)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reasoning - Well its Reasoning and this deck using lots of levels so even when your opponent knows your deck there is still a good chance they guess wrong so its a free summon and body that really helps this deck and even if it fails maybe you get lucky enough to have a few extra tools in the GY to help you out. ( This card its just too good and at worst its still a spell to use for cost for your other cards that need spells in this deck also if you just want to be super funny go into your Diabell, Queen of the White Forest using a Tuner Synchro Monster and add Reasoning to your hand and use it again because its not once perturn)</p><p>Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous - If you just so happen to get Fallen of Albaz on the board or in your GY then you can also summon this girl for free and this is the main way you're going to want to go into Witchcrafter Vice-Madame and if it all possible well you can use her as a spellcaster you really want to keep her on the board for her Synchro plays because after you summon Witchcrafter Vice-Madame you do any action to triger Witchcrafter Vice-Madame and use her special summon effect to summing a level 2 , 3 or 4 or what ever you need for the synchros in the profile or ones you added.You can also do this to go into XYZ plays as well or Links.</p><p>Witchcrafter Confusion Confession - is nice when in hand with Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous you just summon the Cartesia and go for her Quick effect and when your opponent negates it you just follow up with Witchcrafter Confusion Confession and when its in your deck this is what you do when you don't have Cartesia... You normal summing Genni or Schmietta and use there effect to summon a Genni or Schmietta.. Then you will link ontop of the one thats left on the board with your link one in this case I use Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden to do this sending the card to the GY. What has happen at this point is you put both Genni and Schmietta in the GY. You use Schmietta effect to send from deck to GY Witchcrafter Confusion Confession and use Genni to copy the effect of Witchcrafter Confusion Confession by banishing both cards from the GY to use Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden and what ever other witchcrafter you have in your hand or field to then go into Witchcrafter Vice-Madame. (This tends to not end up in big boards but, it gets your boss monster on the board never the less... you also may be able to use this as a follow up if you got negated before as now your opponent will have to have GY hate to stop this)</p><p>Monster Reborn - Its to act as the 3rd copy of Witchcrafter Holiday and to bring back things that Witchcrafter Holiday can't it also helps with not drawing into 2 or 3 copies of Witchcrafter Holiday because that card is once per turn so it can be used with Holiday to bring back 2 cards if drawn together. Monster Reborn is also not once perturn so if you get it back with effect of Diabell, Queen of the White Forest you can use it again<strong>.</strong> Likewise you can use&nbsp;Witchcrafter Holiday effect in the GY with Genni with her effect so in a low chance you could end up with 4 GY special summons.&nbsp;</p><p>Witchcrafter Vice-Madame - She is the main boss you often want on the board and each turn you can use all 3 of her effects so you want to set up ways and play in ways to tringer her so you can chain with her. Any spell card or spellcaster effect will triger her and you can pick any of the 3 effects to use. She as a non target pop that is super good... I found using the pop on my own Diabellstar the Black Witch was super useful on my opponents turn as you pop her with Vice effect then she goes to the GY and as soon as she gets there the Black Witch is going to chain 1 asking if you want to summon back to the board from there you Chain Vice as chain link 2 and use one of her other effects then when Black Witch is back on the board she starts another Chain 1 asking you if you want to set a target from deck and you Chain Vice to that as well as Chain link 2 using another effect. So you end up with a level 6 or lower witchcrafter on the board and a add back to hand with Black Witch still on the board by popping Black Witch and from there you can use the effects of your level 6 or lower witchcrafter to go into bigger cards.You can also pop card like Vahram, the Magistus Divinity Dragon to say goodbye to your opponents board if they let you do this.</p><p>Witchcrafter Golem Aruru - Is super great and easy to add to hand. She protects all spellcasters not just witchcrafters from card effects or attack but, only when there being targeted so do keep this in mind. Its a bounce back to hand though and she can also add a witchcrafter spell from your GY back to your hand giving your other witchcrafters the cost they need to use there effects as well as she sits on the board till your opponent standby phase meaning when she returns to hand she also is a triger for Witchcrafter Vice-Madame and from there you can summon or use one of her other effects so its really good in this way and Aruru protects herself in this way going back to your hand as well as she is a handtrap so she is where she needs to be.</p><p>Fortune Lady Every - Not a must have card but she keeps getting stonger and stonger in ATK power and is a force to mess with well with Witchcrafter Haine, Witchcrafter Madame Verre and Witchcrafter Golem Aruru and because of her standby phase effect she also trigers Witchcrafter Vice-Madame giving you two non target effects Vice pops and Lady Every banishs one of there monsters.</p><p>Lyna the Light Charmer, Lustrous - You could change her out to any of her counter parts for main matchups but, I put her in her because well light cards are common but, also because she has some of the most value to the deck being she can add ""add 1 LIGHT monster with 1500 or less DEF from your Deck to your hand."" This means you can add cards like Witchcrafter Golem Aruru, Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous and Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous.</p><p>Bystial Magnamhut , Awakening of the Possessed - Rasenryu and Ranryu - I'm still testing this but going 1st I think its a better 3 of then the Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous and The Iris Swordsoul.</p><p>There is a lot this deck can do but its Witchcrafters at the end of the day and with decks now playing 15+ handtraps its going to be hard. The deck could be pushed a little more with some of the new White Forest main deck cards and other cards like Guiding Quem, the Virtuous but at this time cards like this are too much in cost for me to want to get into them.</p><p>Have fun even if you just use this deck as a idea to build from. I know witchcrafters are not a great deck vs anything that even comes close to meta but I do think witchcrafters are stonger then people often see this deck so iv been making it a goal to push this deck as far as I can useing mostly budget cards and keeping the heart of the deck still Witchcrafters. I think I mostly achieved this with what I have here and im going to keep working on it. I hope to see a level 6 for this deck at some point as we don't have one depsite Vice saying level 6 or under so there is also hope for support for this deck among loads of room in the extra deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

The basic idea was to summon the ""Demise, King of Armageddon"" ritual monster to break the field and then with the help of ""Ruin, Supreme Queen of Oblivion"" monster (which can attack 2 times in a row if summoned correctly) to attack with these 2 cards for game.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #d4d1d0; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'segoe ui', Roboto, 'helvetica neue', Arial, 'noto sans', sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol', 'noto color emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">But these restrictions makes this strategy a bit of impossible. So my next approach was to bring the ""Demise, King of Armageddon"" monster and then with ""Crealtar, the Impcantation Originator"" monster + 2 other Impcantation monsters to hit for 9400 LP.&nbsp;</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #d4d1d0; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'segoe ui', Roboto, 'helvetica neue', Arial, 'noto sans', sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol', 'noto color emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">This might not be that easy to execute as a first turn kill cause of handtraps and other disruptions that can slow the process. This deck contains some small draw engines as Spellbooks and DarkMagicians which can help a lot with cycling through materials and pieces of the combo.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #d4d1d0; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'segoe ui', Roboto, 'helvetica neue', Arial, 'noto sans', sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol', 'noto color emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">Impcantation Ratios: Most of the times Ritual monsters are way more accessible, cause we use more of them. The main reason for that is that Impcantation ritual spell can be retrieved from grave. So it's smarter to use more of level 3 and level 6 Impcantation monsters to activate them from hand. The level 10 Boss monster can even suffle them back to deck if needed, to never run out of resources.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #d4d1d0; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'segoe ui', Roboto, 'helvetica neue', Arial, 'noto sans', sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol', 'noto color emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">Cards like ""Swords of concealing light"" and ""Gravity bind"" can help with slowing down your opponent, while they can be pretty good targets for ""Magicians' Souls"" (to send them to grave and draw some cards). ""Gravity Bind"" might be annoying for you aswell but it can be destroyed in your turn by using the effect of ""Demise, King of Armageddon"" to remove it from the field. Some other good targets to discard with ""Magicians' Souls"" are ""Rise to full Height"", ""Lost Wind"" and ""Galaxy Cyclone"".</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #d4d1d0; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'segoe ui', Roboto, 'helvetica neue', Arial, 'noto sans', sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol', 'noto color emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">You can always use even better ritual monsters to end your opponent as Chaos Max Dragon which has some sort of build-in protection. That's why you should look at the side deck for more options.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #d4d1d0; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'segoe ui', Roboto, 'helvetica neue', Arial, 'noto sans', sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol', 'noto color emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">I am a bit lazy with the extra deck cause Impcantation non-ritual monsters prevent you from special summoning from the extra deck. But that's not true when you summon ""Crealtar, the Impcantation Originator"" which negates the effects of all impcantation non-ritual monsters. So you can always extend your combos even further. I just don't feel like I have to do it.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #d4d1d0; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'segoe ui', Roboto, 'helvetica neue', Arial, 'noto sans', sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol', 'noto color emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">-----IMPORTANT NOTE-----</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #d4d1d0; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'segoe ui', Roboto, 'helvetica neue', Arial, 'noto sans', sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol', 'noto color emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">This is an approach I've not tested that much and it's more expensive than this one: https://ygoprodeck.com/deck/armageddon-impcantation-cheap-deck-for-masterduel-551502</p>"

A possible substitution for cheaper crafts is Stardust Sifr Divine Dragon for Cosmic Blazar, it is only a monster negate not an omni, but its also Rare not Ultra Rare. You should see a starter most hands, if my math is right ~85% chance of drawing a starter in a five card hand. Bystials are there with Branded Regained just for a bit more draw power and for their interuption, but they could be cut for staples if you don't want to craft them. The rest of the deck is a mash-up of staples that I think provides good coverage. Ghost Belle is definantly the flimsiest of those, but I liked it during testing. You could run Bonfire to search Trudea, but I don't think the deck needs ANOTHER starter, so I cut it an put in some non-engine.&nbsp;</p>"

Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls renders your Gimmick Puppet combo UNAFFECTED by monster based handtraps as well as monster interruption! With this absolutely cracked field spell, going first and second suddenly became much easier for the strategy, especially since Gimmick Puppets burn for the entirety of your opponent's lifepoints going first, and going second, opponent's boards are naturally cleared as you fly through the combos.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Rouge Doll is another incredible card, acting as this deck's ""Exosister Martha,"" summoning herself and another Gimmick Puppet from deck for further XYZ plays! Not only that, she recurs herself the GY as soon as she hits hit (for ex. Getting detached for foolish'd) granting this strategy a robust grind game. Little Soldier'ss gives the deck it's best normal summon and 1-card combo in the form of a foolish burial. Cattle Scream gives the deck a free body to XYZ summon with and more ways to summon monsters on your opponent's side of the field to enable the burn FTK.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">I thought the burn FTK was just like it's namesake - a gimmick. But in reality, I was pleasantly&nbsp;surprised during testing that Quattro's macabre puppets can really win games with their ""fan service!"" Gimmick Puppet is like the burn version of ""Tenpai Dragon."" They know the FTK is coming, they try as much as possible to stop it, but it still succeeds! As Quattro would often say...

Due to the consistency boosts from the new support, the deck core is relatively small. Rouge Doll, Little Soldiers, Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls and Condolence Puppet are all used at 3 since they are starters. Two each of Terror Baby, Cattle Scream and Argent Chaos Force are used since they are garnets and mostly need to be searched from deck as part of the combo. Finally, Service Puppet Play is the search target for Fanatix Machinix, enabling the deck to interrupt the opponent if they manage to survive the burn FTK.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">A <strong>HORUS </strong>engine is used to enable rank 8 plays and to give Set Rotation another target to go into. King's Sarcophagus is also a great discard outlet for cards you want to get out of your hand, like if you happen to draw your garnets of Bisque Doll and Terror Baby who have beneficial effects in the GY.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The rest of the deck is composed of STAPLES to ensure the FTK combo goes through successfully. Double Called By the Grave, x3 Ash Blossom, x2 Maxx ""C,"" x1 Crossout and it's targets x1 Veiler, Imperm, Nibiru and Droll.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">While this deck needs to be consistent, so it is 40 cards sharp to enable to FTK to go though with as much protection as possible.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Gimmick Puppets are infamous for being an extremely effective FTK burn strategy.

The only difference is that your Gimmick Puppet Monsters on the field will be affected by your opponent's non-XYZ monster effects, especially handtraps. If you also lack a level 8 body, Horus monsters are excellent extenders.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Unlike other FTK decks, Gimmick Puppets actually do well at breaking boards, especially while Mansion is active. Going second, Gimmick Puppets naturally break boards as they combo through Gigantes Doll, Giant Grinder, Puppet of Strings and Dark Strings. All the while, Mansion of Dreadful Doll renders your monsters nearly invincible vs. your opponent's monster-based interruption (except XYZ monsters like Zeus and TY-Phon). Horus monsters paired with Gold Sarcophagus remove monsters through the battle phase effectively as well.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></div><ul style=""text-align: left; list-style-type: disc; flex-direction: column; display: flex;""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">The Horus monsters are excellent extenders if you lack a level 8 body to XYZ summon with.

Remember, this deck has many extenders (Horus, Biqsue Doll, Chimera Doll, Terror Baby) so you can still potentially play through those specific handtraps!</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">If your FTK have been interrupted into a standstill and you lack resources to complete the shift, the trap card Service Puppet Play is your next play.

Gimmick Puppet's innate ability to summon big beatsticks,&nbsp;clear boards en-masse, unaffected combolines due to Mansion, and the Horus engine's brute force pressures most boards to fall apart.

You add it and discard it by Tract, summon it from the GY with its own effect and then link it of into Requiem.&nbsp;</p><p>3x Enchantres: 1 card adventurer combo.&nbsp;</p><p>1x Gryphon: The adventurer combo's omni negate.&nbsp;</p><p>3x Diabellstar: The Azamina combo starter.&nbsp;</p><p>1x Diabelleze: If you have in your hand after you finished your Azamina combo, it can be a brutal floodgate for the opponent. Otherwise just discard fodder, but still pretty good.&nbsp;</p><p>3x Nibiru: The most important hand trap against decks like Ryzeal, Maliss, Branded, Fiendsmith, Fire King etc.&nbsp;</p><p>3x Veiler: Could've just played two since imperm does the same better, but still really good against Ryzeal which needs to be handtrapped multiple times to be finished off for good.&nbsp;</p><p>3x Ash Blossom: The best hand trap of all time.&nbsp;</p><p>1x Ogre: Again, you can just remove it since it is the weakest hand trap here, but still can come in clutch against decks that can summon bosses even after multiple hand traps.&nbsp;</p><p>1x Mourner: Veiler on a diet. Can also be used for some burn damage if you use Ogre on the same monster.&nbsp;</p><p>3x Tract: You almost always side for one. It can be used as a Fiendsmith starter, but is still better for being searched by Engraver and then doing the lurrie shenanigans.&nbsp;</p><p>3x Aramesir: The 1 card starter and THE MOST IMPORTANT card in the Adventurer engine.&nbsp;</p><p>1x Faithful Adventure: A key piece in the Adventurer combo, you search it off of Aramesir and then use it to search for Gryphon</p><p>1x Dracoback: I didn't use it a single time. Just side it out.&nbsp;</p><p>1x Called by: Your saving grace if you get hand trapped in an important spot.&nbsp;</p><p>3x Deception: A key combo piece for Azamina.&nbsp;</p><p>3x Wanted: The 1 card combo starter for Azamina.&nbsp;</p><p>1x Hallowed: The most important card for the Azamina engine.&nbsp;</p><p>1x Paradise: a good way to set up your Fiendsmith combo during your opponent's turn, otherwise side it out.&nbsp;</p><p>3x Imperm: The third best hand trap in the game (After Ash and Fuwalos). Also can't be Called by.&nbsp;</p><p>1x Azurune: Bunny</p><p>Extra:</p><p>Sequence: Used if you go for Des Irae instead of Caesar in your Fiendsmith combo.&nbsp;</p><p>Requiem: A key piece in the Fiendsmith combo, whether you go for Caesar or Des Irae.&nbsp;</p><p>Moon: Can turn any two bodies in the field into a fiendsmith combo.&nbsp;</p><p>Masquerena: Alright, I guess? It's not used in any of your combos, but can be good if you get handtrapped multiple times and can't continue to summon S:P during opponent's turn to banish thier bosses or starters.&nbsp;</p><p>Little Knight: The best link monster in the game. Already explained.</p><p>Rabbit: If you can't continue and have two bodies on the floor, this little bunny is potentialy your only saving grace.&nbsp;</p><p>Des Irae: Can negate multiple monstars if you do go for him, but kinda clunky to set up.&nbsp;</p><p>Necroquip: idk honestly, I guess it can be used(?), but I didn't know.&nbsp;</p><p>Aerial: idk man. Guess it can set up a Fiendsmith combo but I don't actually use it.&nbsp;</p><p>Mu: Very good Azamina card. You can go without her but she's still good sometimes.&nbsp;</p><p>Silvia: The omni negate of the Azamina combo. Insanely strong.&nbsp;</p><p>Caesar: The main anti-Nibiru monster on the field. It can be used either as a summon negate to mess with your opponent or as a material for ZEUS and/or TY-PHON.&nbsp;</p><p>Evolzar: A pretty good monster negate, but Caesar is still a bit better.&nbsp;</p><p>ZEUS: If you went second, you can summon it on top of Caesar in your MP2 to make an insane boss monster and further ruin your opponent's chance of making a comeback in turn 3.</p><p>TY-PHON: The best Xyz monster in the game. It not only has a good removal effect, but it can also render all of your opponent's bosses useless and make them pretty much just big beatsticks.&nbsp;</p><p>Deck pros and cons:</p><p>Pros: The deck has three engines which are all 1 card combo (omni)negates, and all can summon that one negate in under 5 special summons, so you're completely Nibiru-proof.</p><p>Cons: The three engines have no way of searching each other out, so if you want to go with all three combos, you need three special cards in your hand.</p>"

Saw a lightsworn / skull servant hybrid deck that had a similar idea but it didn't have enough ways to start the skull servant mill. This build is still a WIP but being able to trigger elemental burst via transaction rollback and swinging in with King of the Skull Servants right after has been crazy. Also wanted to keep the budget down which is why there's no horus engine. Think swapping out some of the more expensive traps (Ex. The Black Goat Laughs) might also be helpful.</p>"

The two Reptilianne Coatls are your own access to the synchro monsters, but it's pretty easy to have a level 4 dark reptile on the field in this deck allowing you to special it from hand (also in the rare case you have two in hand you can normal one, special the other, then use it's other effect to treat one as a non-tuner).

This is the reason why I have removed sarama which is not that bad but you definitly prefer to normal summon a light fiend instead since those are a one card combo.<br /><br />Abominable can be cut but he brings some added value because you easily trigger a destruction to summon it to extend your combo or destroy an opponent card.&nbsp;<br /><br />The trap unchained are good but not in this deck since they are useless if you don't draw any unchained monsters. This is why I added a foolish burial to give flexibility. If you have an unchained standalone card, just send shyama in GY to full combo or if you have only an unchained monster send sharvana to set a card.<br /><br />I didn't added lurrie for the fiendsmith package because you always find value to discard a card like shyama or engraver for instance.<br /><br />This deck is strong because you have the possibility to stop the opponent thanks to all the handtrap in the deck and with the fiend monster usually you will be able to destroy the opponent board.&nbsp;</p><p>I still add budget because this is the best version I found with only 1 engraver.

This is my take on the Cyber Dragon OTK with the added Cyberdark Chimera and Clockwork Knight combo with its release in the TCG in January 2025. The side deck contains cards i have found useful in playtesting this deck online but these are obvioulsy depended on your preferences.&nbsp;</p><p>The new support cards for Cydra being the new Cyber Jormungandr and Cyberdark Wurm have only just been announced so i havent tried these new cards. I will be interested to see just what these cards do for the deck. Disablaster is quite literaly a 'Negation Fortress'! Negateing anything in the same column as itself is a blessing! either being able to be used with Machine Duplication to XYZ summon into Infinity or activate to shut down the opponents Pendulum Zone.</p><p>Cyberload Fusion and Cybernetic Overflow is a combo ive always been a fan off. Allowing you to pop opponents cards and quickly fuse into the Big Hitters and swing for the win! I've found in my play testing a single copy of CK is enough to pull the combo simply because my opponents dont know when to hit the combination, so it has always gone through! Cyber Dragons are very versitile and can use multiple different avenues to win the game, which is one of my favortie things about the deck. Cyber End Dragon and Cyber Twin Dragon are cards i use mainly for the Duality play with the Chimeratech's.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you enjoy my take on the Deck, Hail CYDRA!</p>"

The key card, <strong>Dogmatika Alba Zoa</strong>, is a ritual monster that allows us to send one card from the opponent's Extra Deck to the graveyard for every two cards they have. If they have 15 cards, we can eliminate half of their Extra Deck.</p><p>The strategy revolves around using <strong>Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</strong> as a key card to search for the spell <strong>Dogmatikamatrix</strong>. This spell not only removes a card from the opponent's Extra Deck but also helps us gather all the resources needed to summon <strong>Dogmatika Alba Zoa</strong>.</p><p>We also have <strong>Dogmatika Maximus</strong>, which lets us send two cards from our Extra Deck to the graveyard while forcing the opponent to do the same. This effect benefits us more, as cards like <strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong> destroy enemy cards on the field, and <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> lets us search for key cards.</p><p>To maintain control, we include <strong>Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted</strong>, who negates monster effects, can be special summoned, and boosts all our Dogmatika cards with a permanent 500 ATK increase during the battle phase. This deck is perfect for dominating both the opponent's Extra Deck and their field!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>"

Using Insight to ditch the new Black Meteor Dragon to search for REF from the deck,should you want another Dragoon to rise up, BM Dragon will then on your next turn search for another REF from your Deck or recover the same from the GY should your Fusion be stopped the turn before. REF is the current best 1 card combo to Dragoon! so i dont see why we cannot use the Red-Eyes cards to recurr this Card should in our DM decks we are using Red-Eyes cards already.</p><p>Smaller DM Stratergy to fall back on should your Dragoon fall, aswell as Secret village keeping you safe from spells and the best board breaker in the game currently, Super-Poly! Up-start Goblin is counted as a DM card in my eyes as it synergizes with the deck well when used with DMC, Soul Servant and IOC.</p><p>Side deck can be filled with cards to your own preferences. There are however, 2 cards i like to tech in for my own reasons. They are 'Bond Between Teacher And Student' and 'Dark Burning Magic'. I like these two because I run a 'Dark Magic Attack' in my Side Deck which synerizes with Bond and ES. Burning magic is a great card for a non-targeting board clearer and to this day, it has never been stopped when i personally have used the card.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope you enjoy the Deck!</p>"

The variability of the deck keeps your opponent on their feet to predict what you're going to do next. HOWEVER this deck runs out of gas really quickly, and - much like some spright decks - uses far too many materials to play only 40 cards without burning out and I had to do ALOT of cutting and condensing to get this to 40 cards - so play more, also it's less of a chance to draw bricks(but it's far more painful when you do). This deck dosn't play many handtraps because it's too tight to change ratios. All that being said, play this deck how you want and let me know any other lines you find, it'll help others that wish to play this bizzare deck.

This is untested and just an idea. Unfortunately there are no real good level 8 Fairy targets aside from Construct, and even then she only adds a Shadoll spell/trap from grave to hand.

Ever since, many other duelists have picked up this strategy for it's ""low to the ground"" grindy control playstyle in a meta where handtraps reign supreme. Able to handtrap to a standstill combo decks like Maliss and power through a mid-range deck's interruption like Ryzeal, Magical Musketeer Fiendsmith remains a dangerous competitor in the current meta!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The ridiculously powerful link-1s of both Magical Musketeer (Magical Musketeer Max) and Fiendsmith (Fiendsmith Requiem) give the strategy a lot of resilience through interruption and the ability to generate a lot of bodies for link summoning. If one archetype gets handtrapped (for example, when you summon Max), you can easily pivot to the other archetype (link away Max for Requiem) since both link-1s require only a light fiend monster! Handtraps are easily brushed aside in this strategy, with only the most powerful handtraps like Mulcharmy Fuwalos and Dimension Shifter able to fully stop the turn. Due to the sheer amount of link material, Magical Fiendsmith also can also tap into Unchained, giving you access to resource recursion and extra interruption through Unchained Soul of Yama and Unchained Soul of Rage.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If your opening hand has both Magical Musket and Fiendsmith, this deck ends on a whopping 5-6 layered interruptions! On top of that, this deck sports room for 22 staples, with 19 of them being handtraps! If you're looking for a deck to hardcounter combo heavy decks like Maliss while being able to withstand a ton of handtraps/interruption from midrange decks like Ryzeal, you've chosen the correct deck to pilot!<br /><br /><strong>Want to see the deck in action?

The other half of the deck is composed of staple cards, mostly consisting of handtraps.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>FIENDSMITH</strong>&nbsp;is the main<strong>&nbsp;</strong>""engine"" that keeps this deck running, and is a recurring engine that recycles light fiends&nbsp;that keeps the grindgame of this strategy going. Since it is the main strategy, the Fiendsmith cards are maxxed out for extra consistency. The Fiendsmith spells are also maxxed out since they have synergy with the Magical Musket monsters. It is composed of x3 Engraver, x3 Lacrima the Crimson Tears, x3 Tract, x3 Sanct, x1 Lurrie and x1 Paradise.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>MAGICAL MUSKETEER </strong>package in this deck is minimal, and it's used primarily as a way to generate extra link material, bait interruption, and to provide more fusion material for the summon of Fiendsmith Desirae. It is composed of x3 Starfire and x1 Calamity in the maindeck. There is x1 Max in the Extra Deck. Despite the low count of Magical Musket monsters, these cards are recyclable from the graveyard due to the Fiendsmith cards.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>UNCHAINED </strong>cards are a mini package in this deck that raises the power ceiling of the endboard. There are only two cards in the maindeck - x1 Sharvara and x1 Escape of the Unchained. Given you have enough link material, you can end on both Unchained Soul of Rage and Fiendsmith Desirae, complete with a set Escape of the Unchained and an Unchained Yama in the graveyard. If fully set up, these cards adds an extra 4 interruptions to your endboard (Rage's link away, S:P's double banish, and Escape's pop!)</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>STAPLES </strong>form nearly half of the cards in this strategy! A whopping 19 handtraps are used, and the best ones were chosen specifically for this format - x3 Ash Blossom, x3 Effect Veiler, x3 Infinite Impermance, x3 Dominus Purge, x3 Mulcharmy Fuwalos, x2 Nibiru and x2 Ghost Ogre. 2 Triple Tactics Talent is used since it's almost always live with all the monster-based interruption and handtraps during the Main Phase. Finally, x1 Called By the Gave is used to get the edge in handtrap wars.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">In the <strong>SIDE DECK</strong>, 6 handtraps are there to hardcounter Maliss - x3 Artifact Lancea and x3 Chaos Hunter. x3 Droll and Lockbird are used for ideal match-ups.&nbsp; x3 Dimensional Barrier is used to blow out decks dependent on 1 Extra Deck type. Finally, 2 Purulia is for more draw power. Archfiend Eccentrick is a searchable light fiend with Fiendsmith Tract and it can destroy monsters and spells.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Fiendsmith Magical Musketeer is adaptable - it can create a board with multi-layered interactions, with up to 6 interruptions + handtraps in hand! Or it can play low to the ground - for example if your opponent activates Fuwalos - you can just give your opponent a singular draw while you set up your entire gameplan!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">This deck functions as a grindy midrange control deck that specializes in destroying combo-centric strategies. The duelist simplifies the gamestate by drowning their opponent in handtraps, then using the combined resource generating power of Fiendsmith, Magical Muskets and Unchained. Overtime, the duelist should overpower their opponent with a gigantic Fiendsmith Desirae and his other fiendish pals.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif;

All opponents are generally hard pressed when facing this strategy because of the barrage of handtraps followed by the overwhelming grindgame of Fiendsmiths and Magical Musketeers!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">HELP!

Try not to give your opponent extra draws with the Mulcharmies!

Trap decks generally don't care about handtraps too much, and since there is no main or side-decked backrow hate they tend to flourish. Beware of decks like Labrynth!&nbsp;</div></li></ul><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>CONCLUDING REMARKS</strong></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">I've always liked midrange decks that can support a ton of handtraps or staples. It allows for the best Yugioh to happen, where both duelists have a back-and-forth trading resources, cards and monsters on the battlefield. Fiendsmith Magical Musketeer allows for that! You can go either first or second, and actually play proper games vs. almost any deck this format can throw at you! Also, something is so unfathomably cool and unfair when you use a link-1 of 1 archetype to pivot into another link-1 monster of a second archetype! The unique identity of Fiendsmith Magical Musketeer as the premier ""link-1"" deck and the fun characteristics of its gameplay make this deck one of my favourites to ever pilot.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">GLHF Duelists!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><br /><br /></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

That is, without interruption. If your hand and mills are good, you can still end in the same board even through two/three handtraps. The deck can also play around Nibiru and Droll and Lock Bird, but dies to Shifter or Maxx &ldquo;C&rdquo;/Fuwalos.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">ABOUT THE NORMAL SUMMON:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Let&rsquo;s start by the obvious part: any normal summon dies to ash, impermanence or veiler. You will need extenders or chainlocks, and this decks provides boths. Let&rsquo;s now discuss which normal summons are better.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The obvious choice is to chainlock Tearlaments Reinoheart with Tearlaments Scream, but if you don&rsquo;t have access to Scream there are other better options.</p><ul><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you don&rsquo;t have Supreme Sea Mare or Tearlaments scream, normal summon Laundry Dragonmaid to start the Tearlament line of the deck, but this is not what you would want to do normally since you are wasting the normal summon when Laundry can be summoned from GY with either Dragonmaid Tidying (if you mill it) or Spright Elf. Think of Laundry as a Tearlaments Merrli copycat of sorts (she can also contact fuse into Lady&rsquo;s Dragonmaid after all).</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you have Reinoheart and Laundry but no extenders, play it safely and use Reinoheart. If you have at least one extender, use Laundry. The reasoning after this is that if you ever mill Reinoheart, it can send the Reinoheart from hand to special summon itself, giving you Reinoheart effect and an extra body (in this example you could make Spright elf to revive Laundry, contact fusion into Lady&rsquo;s Dragonmaid if you have Dragonmaid Nudyarl in GY, then use Lady&rsquo;s Dragonmaid to summon another Laundry from deck and then link it with Spright elf into I:P; remember that Lady&rsquo;s Dragonmaid will bring forth Sheou in your opponent&rsquo;s standby phase, and Sheou will revive the laundry you linked away to mill 3 and have a free body to make S:P with I:P).</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you have Supreme Sea Mare and Reinoheart in hand but no access to Tearlaments scream, normal summon Supreme Sea Mare. It will have the same effect as Reinoheart and you can still special summon Reinoheart and use it&rsquo;s effect if you mill it.</p></li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">ABOUT THE FIENDSMITH ENGINE:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The task of fiensmith is very simple: eat handtraps while trying to make Agido. Well, the real objective is to simply make the pseudo-Agido card Pilgrim Reaper without being interrupted, but a simple Ash Blossom on Requiem or Pilgrim Reaper fully stops this line. If you draw Fiendsmith Engraver you can make Pilgrim Reaper with 2 Engravers, but if you draw Fiendsmith&rsquo;s Tract, you will need to make the Pilgrim Reaper with Necroquip Princess and Engraver.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">ABOUT THE TEARLAMENTS ENGINE:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Classic Tearlaments Stuff, make Kitkallos by any means necessary, mill eight and feel great. If I were to explain Tearlaments line we would be here all day, so I&rsquo;ll just focus on this decks special synergy and characteristics.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">ABOUT THE DRAGONMAID ENGINE:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I returned to Yu-gi-oh! after many years thanks to Dragonmaids and decided to stay after discovering Tearlaments, so when I read the new Dragonmaid Fusion that does not require a fusion spell I immediately tried to put the decks together, and I must say that I think that this deck is not only better than pure tear (present day tear of course), but even better than tear/fiendsmith.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The main purposes of the Dragonmaid engine in the deck is very simple: 1) make Dragonmaid Sheou through Lady&rsquo;s Dragonmaid effect (no bricky fusion spell necessary), 2) revive Laundry Dragonmaid with Dragonmaid Sheou or Spright elf in your opponents turn to mill 3. In other words, while the Fiendsmith engine returns Agido to Tearlaments, Dragonmaid returns Merrli to the deck, but with an additional omninegate.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">You will usually try to special summon Laundry from grave with either Tidying or Spright Elf to mill three more cards than usual (with respect to tear/fiendsmith), and then contact fuse into Lady&rsquo;s Dragonmaid. I cannot put into words how good Lady&rsquo;s Dragonmaid is, remember Phantom of Yubel? This card is also a link 0 negate (in your opponent&rsquo;s standby phase summons Sheou), since after being summoned it will summon another Laundry from deck, essentially not changing the number of bodies on field. It is true that it is a card that needs to be summoned under specific circumstances (which are easy to create with this deck as a side effect of the milling), but in the end it does not change the number of bodies in the field, and sets an omninegate that also allows you to mill three more cards in your opponent&rsquo;s standby phase! Is so good that in a board of Baronne, Rulkallos and I:P, your opponent should would always choose to use impermanence in this card before it resolves, and even so, you can simply use I:P to link away Lady&rsquo;s Dragonmaid and fusion summon anyways.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">You will notice in the decklist that there is only one House Dragonmaid in the Extra deck, so you may think that you can only use the Sheou omninegate once per duel, but actually, Lady&rsquo;s dragonmaid can recycle House with another Dragonmaid into Sheou. In other words, more than 1 House Dragonmaid is not optimal, since it takes necessary extender&rsquo;s space in the extra deck and, even if you lose your Lady&rsquo;s Dragonmaid, you still have a ton of follow up with Tearlaments and Fiendsmith.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">One interaction you should know comes from this line:</p><ul><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tidyng revives Laundry.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Laundry + Another monster &rarr; Spright elf (can also be made with any of the available link 2 in the extra deck if you don&rsquo;t have Laundry access).</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Spright elf revives Laundry.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Laundry and Nudyarl for Lady&rsquo;s.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lady&rsquo;s summons Laundry from deck.</p></li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the end of this line, you already are set to go into Sheou in your opponent&rsquo;s turn, and Sheou can revive a Laundry from GY, but you probably won&rsquo;t have the third one in GY. Since it won&rsquo;t be in GY you won&rsquo;t be able to use Spright Elf in your opponent&rsquo;s turn either. Solution? Link Spright elf and Laundry into I:P. In the opponent&rsquo;s turn Sheou can now revive Laundry, and you can later use that Laundry with I:P to go into S:P.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">ABOUT THE MAIN DECK:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bricks:</p><ul><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Unlike common Tearlaments lists I&rsquo;m not running Mudora or Keldo because they are terrible bricks in hand and I prefer a consistent deck (+this deck already runs some bricks). You can add them to increase your deck potential disruptions, but also expect to brick more consistently.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Destrudo, the Lost&rsquo;s Dragon&rsquo;s Frisson: it&rsquo;s a good extender that under the right circumstances can make baronne (lvl 4 + lvl 7 on field, target the lvl 4), or can be used as material for link fodder, but it&rsquo;s a card you prefer to see in the GY.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dragonmaid Nudyarl: a terrible brick, if I could I&rsquo;d play only one, but then I would almost never be able to go into the Dragonmaid line since it would be very rare for the card to come into play. The only salvation it has is that it can put itself in the graveyard (needs to be in GY for the contact fusion) to return a card to the deck or extra deck, so at least it won&rsquo;t be stuck in your hand like Trivikarma.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Trivikarma: an amazing searcher that triggers on GY. The problem? It needs to be in the GY, not in the hand.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fairy Tail Snow: use this card. I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s a brick in hand, is amazing as extension and disruption. Unlike Trivikarma, you have a way send it to GY, with Scheiren.</p></li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pseudo Bricks:</p><ul><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fabled Lurrie: necessary to go into the fiendsmith combo. Luckily it&rsquo;s not a terrible brick, since it can be normal summoned to be linked into Requiem.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dragonmaid Tidying: I run two of these because they are not actually terrible in your hand, since it can be used for disruption if your combo reaches the Dragonmaid line (which is easy, but can be problematic through two or more handtraps). Of course you rather see this card in GY, but you can still revive Laundry with Spright Elf.</p></li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Staples:</p><ul><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">This deck engine is strong enough to push through most boards, that&rsquo;s why it almost plays no handtraps. Triple Talents Tactics and Kashtira Fenrir help break boards, while Ash Blossom and Called by the Grave main purpose is to stop Maxx &ldquo;C&rdquo;, since this deck plays very well into any other handtraps (including Droll and Nibiru), but fold to Maxx &ldquo;C&rdquo; or Mulcharmys.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">If Maxx &ldquo;C&rdquo; were to be banned, I would recommend to remove Ash Blossom, it&rsquo;s a low impact handtrap that worsens your mills. Also, if your opponent uses Mulcharmy Fuwalos, don&rsquo;t go into the Fiendsmith line since you would be giving them 3 extra draws just to make Agido. Instead, go only in the Tearlament line that will give them two draws [Kitkallos, Rulkallos] (four [Spright Elf, Lady&rsquo;s Dragonmaid] if you can and decide to go into the Dragonmaid line).</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">About Maxx &ldquo;C&rdquo;: this deck does not need Maxx &ldquo;C&rdquo;, what&rsquo;s more, it is actually a brick that worsens mills just like ash blossom. Since this decks does not require Maxx &ldquo;C&rdquo; at all to win and it actually decreases mill quality, I don&rsquo;t run Maxx &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</p></li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Card distribution details:</p><ul><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Destrudo and Nudyarl are cards that will become omninegates if you see them, be it in your hand or GY. I play three (1 destrudo, 2 nudyarl) to have more chances to see them.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dragonmaid Tidying: I play two copies because I don&rsquo;t want to draw my only copy and I definitely don&rsquo;t want to draw to of three copies. It also is card good enough to BE in the hand.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tearlaments Grief: not necessary to extend in this deck, but is a good card to add from Trivikarma or to send to GY if you have a banished trap (through snow or Tearlaments Kashtira). For that reason is only added as a 1 of.</p></li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Cards that could be added:</p><ul><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tearlament Cryme: in case you want a third omninegate for your board, though three omninegates + all other interruptions that this deck offers is overkill. This card also worsens mills and draws.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tearlament Heartbeat: is a very good card that can DEAL WITH backrow while also getting trivikarma to the GY, as GY effect, it can also add a trap from GY to deck.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bystial Magnamhut: can search the Dragonmaids or Destrudo.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Maxx &ldquo;C&rdquo;: as I see it this card reads as follows: 1) activate this card: your opponent discards ash blossom or called by the grave, 2) if a card is to be milled from your deck, first mill three copies of this card. But if it resolves you are assured to win! No that you needed it anyways&hellip;</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pressured Planet Wraitsoth: better hand quality, worse mills quality, pick your poison.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Heavy Storm: aside from breaking boards, can pop Sulliek (add a tear monster from deck), Trivikarma (basically add a tear spell/trap from deck) and Dragonmaid Tidying (if you really really really need it in GY to special summon Laundry).</p></li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">ABOUT THE EXTRA DECK:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Obligatory cards (please do play these if you want your deck to work at all):</p><ul><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tearlaments Kitkallos: main extension and best card in the deck.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tearlament Rulkallos: main ending board piece for tearlaments, offers protection against Nibiru.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Spright Elf: if you don&rsquo;t play Spright Elf, don&rsquo;t play Dragonmaids in this deck, since this is the card that connects Dragonmaids with Tearlaments. The worse this card can do is offer an extra body and mill 6, the best it can do is all of the previous plus an omninegate and I:P. Into S:P.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fiendsmith Requiem: the third best card in the deck (after Kitkallos and Spright Elf), used in the fiendsmith combo to make agido, I mean Pilgrim Reaper.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pilgrim Reaper: the main reason to be playing fiendsmith, remember when I said that you have to remove Dragonmaids from the deck if you remove Spright Elf? Well, if you remove Pilgrim Reaper you will need to remove the fiendsmith engine.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lady&rsquo;s Dragonmaid: Dragonmaid&rsquo;s new contact fusion. It requires Laundry on field and Dragonmaid Nudyarl on GY, which is quite easy to pull off in this deck as a side line from your Tearlaments/Fiendsmith combos thanks to Spright Elf. This card is amazing, it gives you a body and turns into an omninegate in your opponent&rsquo;s turn. Consider fusion your banished Dragonmaids instead of this card, as it can recycle House Dragonmaid each standby phase.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">House Dragonmaid: it&rsquo;s actually a garnet, but a garnet that is required for Dragonmaid Sheou to have an omninegate. In some extremely rare occasions it can also pop a monster in the battle phase (notice this will happen once every new moon).</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dragonmaid Sheou: the reason to play Dragonmaids, if offers an omninegate and during the standby phase can revive Merrli, I mean Laundry, to mill three and have an extra body for I:P (or turn into a pop in the battle phase if you have House Dragonmaid by then).</p></li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Recommended cards:</p><ul><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Necroquip princess: allows you to go into rank 6 monsters if you open Fiendsmith&rsquo;s Tract instead of Engraver. Adds a lot of consistency to the deck.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Moon of the Closed Heaven: main bridge in the deck. Can bridge any two cards into fiendsmith combo or bridge into Spright Elf without wasting I:P if you didn&rsquo;t mill Dragonmaid Tidying.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I:P Masquerena : Allows to summon an indestructible S:P or Apollousa (if you play it) on your opponents turn. If you didn&rsquo;t mill Dragonmaid Tidying, this card can act as a link 2 bridge into Spright Elf if you aren&rsquo;t playing or already used Closed Heaven</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">S:P Little Knight: can help break boards, but it&rsquo;s main purpose it&rsquo;s to be made with I:P during your opponent&rsquo;s turn to act as 2 disruptions.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tearlaments Kaleidoheart: good at breaking boards and also a good disruption to summon in your opponent&rsquo;s turn. Has a better floating effect than Rulkallos, but most of the time stays as a vanilla on field.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Time Thief Redoer: If you have played Tearlaments you know this a non-official Tearlaments extra deck fusion card that, if lucky, can also turn into a draw or an interruption. Can be used to extend when you either have bricked or your combo have been interrupted; in some rare occasions can be used as a Quick-Effect fusion summon in your opponent&rsquo;s turn.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Baronne de Fleur: there are bad bricks and decent bricks, Destrudo is one of the good bricks. If you hace a lvl 7 and a lvl 4 of field and Destrudo in your hand or GY, you can make Baronne. Worst case scenario you have an extra body for link fodder. The problem is that you depend a lot on having those exacts levels on field and also have Destrudo on hand or GY, that&rsquo;s why it can be exchanged by something like Apollousa, which this deck can make consistently. If you change Baronne for Apollousa, consider removing Destrudo from your deck.</p></li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Cards that can be included:</p><ul><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess: may be a better inclusion than Baronne or Kaleidoheart. Can be made more consistently than Baronne, but Baronne omninegate, revival and pop can be more useful in other scenarios than simply stopping monster effects. As for Kaleidoheart, it&rsquo;s better at breaking boards while also being a decent disruption.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Borreload Savage Dragon: there is a way to make borreload, but it does not come frequently. Use Destrudo targeting Engraver or Necroquip ans synchro summon Destrudo and a Kashtira (or Nudyarl if for some miracle is on field, since it&rsquo;s a card that belongs to the GY) into Borreload.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World: this deck has a problem to deal with towers, there is no way to remove them or to punch over them. Closed World offers an out to those problems and can be made easily thanks to all the bodies the deck puts on fields and already having Closed Heaven in the extra deck (both cards can work together to get rid of two of your opponent&rsquo;s monsters). Can also be summoned in your opponents turn to become two interruptions.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Accesscode Talker: As I said, big puncher for towers.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Topologic Zeroboros: it&rsquo;s main function is as an interruption that can banish all of your and your opponent&rsquo;s cards (consider it a last resource), and it is quite easy to pull off thanks to Fairy Tail Snow. Thanks to Snow it can also become a pig puncher for towers.</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Number 60: Dugares the Timeless: it has low value as an extender since this deck can already extend in many ways and most of the time Redoer is a better rank 4, but has some value as a finisher and to punch over some towers (I still consider Topologic Zeroboros to be the better card, but this one can also offer some extension).</p></li><li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Chaos Angel: it can technically be Synchro summoned with Scheiren+Engraver, giving it both the dark and light effects, but that would be a waste of both Scheiren and Engraver.</p></li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br /><br /></p>"

This comes a bit late, since the season is already over, but here is the deck I've used for Ranked in Season 36 - Melodious. The new (and long overdue!) support made this a strong strategy, with several one card combos, that can usually play through multiple handtraps while also playing a large amount of non-engine. The Tenpai matchup is also decent, which was another reason for me to want to play this deck during this season. <br /><br />Sadly, as with many other decks, it suffers hard with Maxx C in the game. Still, I had a lot of fun climbing from Platinum V to Master V, and with some more time I'm confident this deck has the potential to reach Master I.</p><p><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=9113513"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/9113513.jpg"" data-card=""9113513"" data-name=""Ostinato"">Ostinato</span></a> is the best starter, it's basically (a non once-per-turn) Branded Fusion for Melodious, but <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=44256816"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/44256816.jpg"" data-card=""44256816"" data-name=""1st Movement Solo"">1st Movement Solo</span></a> and <a class=""type-pendulum-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=64881644"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/64881644.jpg"" data-card=""64881644"" data-name=""Refrain the Melodious Songstress"">Refrain the Melodious Songstress</span></a> are very good as well.

The poor man's Egyptian Gods that somehow work better as a deck with all three namesake gods than the original. Perfect for budget decks where I have to have the whole thing under a certain price.<br /><br />I love this archetype.</p><p>Some cards deserve a little context:</p><p>1. Terrors of Overroot is a fairly productive disruption card that also cheap. While it does target, the effect itself actually dodges Destruction protection by... well, not destroying. Just gently suggesting that a card should take a nap in the graveyard. Then graverobbing a corpse already in said graveyard and plopping on the opponents field. You'll wanna pick something they can't use immediately, like a once-per-turn effect they've already used.<br />2. Red Blossoms from Underroot is mostly there to enable silly shit with Trilojig or the Pitknight sisters(?). If things go well, both of the Pitknights are basically immortal.<br />3. Dark Hole Dragon is a surprisongly cheap card I added mostly because I added the surprisingly cheap Dark Holes. I'm sure I don't need to explain the synergy between the two cards?;<br />4. Ghost Belle is here because... look I won't hold you, it's situational, but I like it best out of all the ghost girl cards (except for Red Blossom), and it's gotten me out of said situational situations without being as smugly annoying as Ash Blossom... or nearly as expensive.</p><p>Now, the play idea is fairly simple - go first, hope you've got at least <a href=""/card/dark-beckoning-beast-10914"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a>, combo cards as best you can until you've got at least one of the Sacred Beasts, Fallen Paradise, and Awakeningof the Sacred Beasts on field. Additional traps or disruptions are recommended.<br /><br />Going second follows the same plan, but you'll wanna hope you have some field clearers like Heavy Storm and Dark Hole first. Or that your opponent bricked. Best if you go first, really.<br /><br />For the most part, your goal will be one of three win cons:<br /><br />1. The Ol' Reliable: Just beat the other person down with raw damage while constricting them with Awakening and two Sacred Beasts on Field;<br /><br />2. The Armityle Nuclear Disaster: Armityle the Chaos Phantasm - Phantom of Fury is a very funny card: for the low price of banishing a single copy of all the beasts from hand, field, or grave (very doable since they don't need to all be in the same place), you get to send him as a nuke to the opponent. Then once he's left a nice big smoking crater, you get to summon his actual body - Armityle The Chaos Phantasm. Who just so happens to be indestructible by battle, and on your turn gains 10K attack. That's right, you heard me. 10K. You can guess what you do after that;</p><p>3. The Red Blossom Shenanigans: This one is best used in case your opponent is running a Synchro or Xyz deck and sent you to play second, since that lets you be in control more. You can either set up the Pitknight sisters and their near-immortality, or go for the fusions - Trilojig for a good ol' beatdown, or Phantom of Fury to reenact Oppenheimer in IMAX.</p><p>And there you have it! Budget with quality!</p>"

The most common forms of interruption are less focused on negates, and center around various destruction effects (for ex. Ryzeal) or banishment (for ex. Maliss, S:P Little Knight). Destruction and banishment are interruptions that Branded easily brushes off due to how the strategy functions, and could power through the relatively fragile boards of Ryzeal, Maliss and Fiendsmith!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;<span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Despite being harshly hit by previous banlists like the limiting of the deck's key card Branded Fusion, and the ban of the infamous ""Puppet Lock,"" Branded continues to remain competitively viable! Branded players now are forced to play creatively, and go for less ""instant-win-button"" win conditions and play a game of resources and interaction. Not to mention that Branded has acquired particularly powerful tools with recent support - like Light and Darkness Dragonlord!</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Devastating staples made common by the January 2025 meta like Dimension Shifter, <span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Droll &amp; Lockbird</span>&nbsp;and Nibiru hardly affect Branded's gameplan and the deck can usually confidently still create a full board despite their use! This deck also features the Shaddoll package in the side deck for going second (credit to Galzo the Branded Master for this package) which is an incredible board breaker that trades 3 interactions for 1 card!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;Does Albaz and friends have a competitive niche to play in the upcoming 2025 formats?

Due to the current meta<span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">&nbsp;SUPERPOLY </span>is also included.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">BYSTIAL </span>package is relatively large, since banishing light/dark monsters is fairly impactful since light/dark banish targets like Fiendsmith Engraver and Mereologic Aggregator are common. Lubellion is ""searchable"" from deck since Branded Fusion dumps him to the GY, and Lubellion can summon itself from the GY by tributing the on-field Albion. Lubellion can place from deck <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">Branded Lost</span>&nbsp;as extra protection/search power or <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">Branded Regained </span>for more advantage generation.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">SUPER POLYMERIZATION </span>is an ideal card in many common match-ups during this format. For example, Ryzeal Detonader gets immediately outed by Super Poly and your normal summon, while Ryzeal Cross couldn't do its ""negate"" anymore since there isn't a Ryzeal XYZ on the field anymore. Also, vs. the ever common Fiendsmith match-up, Desirae can be easily Super Poly'd too!&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">FUSION DEPLOYMENT</span>&nbsp;also functions as a toolbox in this deck, since its 2 targets each serve a distinct function. <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">Albaz </span>can breakboards when summoned, and Albaz + Super Poly cracks most boards nowadays. If your opponent happens to field Dragon monsters, Albaz can contact fuse them away. <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">Cartesia </span>enables fusion summoning as a quick effect. Not only does she give access to Granguinol (which is a foolish burial), she can protect your activating monster effects on the field from targeting negates like Impermanence and Effect Veiler.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">TRIPLE TACTICS THRUST</span>&nbsp;is an incredible card in a Branded deck, since it can indirectly search you any normal spell/trap if your opponent dares to activate a monster effect during your turn, even Branded Fusion! Going first, this card can set Fusion Duplication, which can copy any normal/quick-play fusion spell from the GY from the GY like Branded Fusion and Super Poly! So say you get Ash'd on Branded Fusion, you can activate Triple Tactics Thrust to set Fusion Duplication from deck and full fusion combo during your opponent's&nbsp; Draw Phase!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">50 CARDS</span>&nbsp;are utilized in this deck rather than around 40ish since every important piece (esp. Branded Fusion) is highly searchable anyways. 50 cards also reduces the likelihood of drawing garnets and bricks.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">SIDEDECK </span>is has the Shaddoll package (explained below) for going 2nd. Mulcharmies are included when you are forced to go second. 3 Artifact Lancea is included since it severely hardcounters Maliss, and it is searchable and summonable in-engine. Finally, Albion the Sanctifire Dragon is placed in the sidedeck since it's used in the Maliss matchup to summon Lancea and it's better when you're guaranteed to go 1st. The best cards to side out are the Bystials whenever they don't apply to the match-up. You can also side out going second Branded Banishment, Fusion Duplication, and Branded Regained since they don't do very well going second. Super Polymerization can also be sided out in certain matchups where your Super Poly targets don't work out.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">SHADDOLL </span>package is in the sidedeck specifically to break boards going second. A singular Shaddoll Fusion does so much! This will simultaneously banish 3 cards from your opponent's GY(Ariel's eff), destroy 1 spell/trap (Dragon's eff), and negate a card on the field (Apkallone's eff). 3 chainblocked interactions with 1 Shaddoll Fusion makes for a potent boardbreaker!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">TEARLAMENTS SCHIEREN</span>&nbsp;is included as a 1-of as a possible extender, and as a way to generate more resources since she allows a mill 3. Scheiren's main fusion target is Masquerade the Blazing Dragon which is especially useful in the Maliss match-up, since the added lifepoint cost to every effect puts immense pressure on them. Scheiren can also make Predaplant Dragostapelia and can help recycle cards in a prolonged grindgame.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Branded is designed to play through your opponent's interruption to create gigantic fusion beatsticks and overwhelm with high ATK and massive resource generation. With various ""locks"" deemed unplayable by the banlist If given even a second of breathing space, your opponent will find that they are facing down a field full of powerful fusion monsters!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Branded Fusion is both a blessing and a curse for this strategy. The whole deck revolves around searching and resolving that card, and if it's negated, your further options are likely limited. Resolving Branded Fusion is even more important nowadays since the card is only at 1!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Your obvious glaring chokepoint and weakness is Branded Fusion, so it is imperative that you can bait out the Ash Blossom or other forms of interruption before you activate this card. It is advisable to use every other card first like Branded Opening, Fusion Deployment or Lubellion so that you can bait out your opponent's interruption (but be careful of Droll). Also, from experience playing the deck, I've discovered that people intentionally hold their Ash Blossom saving it for Branded Fusion - so if you don't have the card, you can bluff having it and just do all your searches/summons from deck!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">End boards are very hand dependant and can vary greatly, but here are the mainline combos:</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><em>Branded Fusion + Dark Monster + Discard = Mirrorjade (banish), Bystial Lubellion + Branded Continous Spell (resources), Set Branded Card (Branded in Red, Banishment, Retribution, Opening)</em></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><em>&nbsp;</em></div><ol style=""text-align: left; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; list-style-type: decimal; flex-direction: column; display: flex;"" start=""1""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;"">Activate Branded Fusion to summon Albion, sending Albaz + Bystial Lubellion from deck.</li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><div>Fusion summon Lubellion the Searing Dragon by fusing Albaz + Dark Monster with Albion.

Depending on the hand, your opponent may also be dealing with Mercourier's monster negate, bystial's GY banish, Masquerade's -600 burn, and Granguinol can summon Luluwalilith from the Extra Deck. If you're lucky, you also have a facedown Super Polymerization - a devasting turn ending card if used at the right time. Your hand will likely also be sizeable and ready with follow-up for next turn since Cartesia, Titaniklad and Albion generate resources during Branded's ""main phase 3"" - the End Phase.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Going second, Branded can slog through interruption, pierce through boards and beat down your opponent's monsters with big beatsticks. Branded is naturally equipped with in-engine ways to play going second. &nbsp;If Branded Opening is in the GY, your fusion monsters can tank one destruction effect, which is super useful vs. the Ryzeal match-up! Super Polymerization can fuse away many boards in today's meta, especially with Garura, only needing 2 monsters with the same type and attribute. Alot of interruption these days involve destroying and banishing (The most common match-ups Ryzeal and Maliss do this alot) - Branded is very comfortable with all those interruptions and it usually shrugs them off.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">GENERAL TIPS</span></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">&nbsp;</span></div><ul style=""text-align: left; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1rem; list-style-type: disc; flex-direction: column; display: flex;""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><div>To play around the potential Droll &amp; Lockbird that is somewhat common this format, try to search for Branded Fusion first before anything else. Once they Droll you after you get this crucial playstarter, the lingering search floodgate hardly affects the Branded strategy since everything else summons or sets directly from the maindeck.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;"">Try to bait out Ash Blossom by your many searches/summons from deck before you use Branded Fusion. If you don't have Branded Fusion, your opponent will likely hold Ash Blossom in their hand waiting for it, so you can bluff having the card to search/summon all you want!</li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px;"">Branded lacks in-engine ways to remove backrow, except with Guardian Chimera. Be sure to side in the ample amounts of backrow hate in these match-ups! Luckily Ryzeal phases out most backrow decks this meta so they aren't too common.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;"">Try to have Cartesia on board before you summon monsters on the field with important effects. Cartesia's quick effect fusion summon allows you to dodge common targeting negates like Impermanence and Effect Veiler.</li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px;"">The best cards to side out are the Bystials and Branded Banishment, Fusion Duplication, Branded Regained especially when the match-ups doesn't call for them. Super Polymerization can also be sided out in certain matchups where your Super Poly targets don't work out.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><div>If Branded Lost is active, Fusion effect's activation cannot be negated.

This is my personal favorite way to play plants, even if it is by far not the strongest way to play plants.</p><p>Main combo consists of using Petal (or a way to Petal) then get Mudan, the field spell, and the two level 4s to end on Strenna, field spell, and Petal and Princess in grave with Tranquility set. Very unassuming but it can easily get out of control for the opponent. After that it uses whatever it has at its disposal to secure victory or win the grind.</p><p>Hope you guys enjoy!</p>"

Finally, Diabell recovers ANY spell/trap from the GY, while enabling a quick synchro during your opponent's turn!&nbsp;<br /><br />These white forest girls mean business, since they make synchro plays ridiculously easy whenever and wherever they are played. The amount of card advantage both strategies generate outpace most decks of the format in a prolonged grindgame, easily winning duels with a myriad of synchro-based interruptions. Diabellestar's ""synchro"" archetype certainly shows a lot of promise as a synchro engine - especially when it's paired up with a defensive powerhouse like Runick! <br /><br /><a href=""/deck/beginner-s-guide-to-white-forest-runick-july-2024-512451"" rel=""nofollow"">If you want a thorough guide on this strategy, check out my earlier article. </a><br /><br /><em><strong>Want to see the deck in action?

Melody of Awakening Dragon ends up enabling both halves by pulling out two Mistvas and tossing two spells (probably) into the grave.</p><p>Ryu-Ge's awful bottleneck is War Zone, hence crossouts to deal with Ash; in theory the Striker engine's there to eat omnis. Both halves get murdered by Droll, so there's one in the side deck as a Crossout target. Has a similar issue with Nib when you Striker &gt; War Zone &gt; 9000/9000 token lmao before you can get Varudras up, so Crossout again I guess. Striker-only is ok since there's some draw power to find a Ryu-Ge starter, Ryu-Ge-only is a lot worse due to the aforementioned bottleneck; pray the breakers you drew can deal with negates. If you're forced to go first, do the normal Nib-safe Ryu-Ge stuff into Varudras + Mistva, ignore the Striker half on turn 1.</p><p>Also, there's an oh shit button where you throw out most of Ryu-Ge for the 14 cards of Striker/Handtraps in the side deck; keep Kaiva, Dino Domains, and 2x Emva/Hakva depending on matchup and pray they hit the summon conditions.</p>"

While some have found suship to have a new home in ryzeal I personally wanted to see how I could jam my favourite little pink guy into my favourite deck. Thanks to the new Infernal Flame Banshee suship now has incredibly consistent access to snake eyes. Any two-level fours can get us into banshee which should not be hard to find. From this we can search snake eye ash, add it to hand, and do snake eye things. Not only does this give us easy and consistent access to powerful snake eye end boards it has the possibility of simply making strong end boards with the boats while your opponent holds their hand traps waiting to see ash. This sort of flexibility means you can work around what your opponent has and mess with their expectations making them second guess just what you could be going for. All this being said, one of the decks biggest upsides is its price point every engine card is dirt cheap with only the generic cards; ZEUS, TY-PHON, S:P, thrust, and talents running you anything substantive.<br />Now go my child.

The result is this, an absolute mess that somehow kinda works. Are their more effective ways to build a deck? Yes but this is an experiment. I could also make a 60 card pile with even more engines for the funnies, but I did want to focus on making it actually good and playable to see what comes of it. Primary feature of each engine: No normal summons or locks on any of them, so throw in whatever other archetype you want and it will probably work.</p>"

The extra deck is really tight and you really can run out of gas trying to break a board while building your own, neither P.U.N.K of Materiactor has good recovery so by turn 6 you are probably out of extra deck to do anything, but you can add another options, Gigaboros is rarely useful since you need luck to get a handtrap with meltdown since you only want to use meltdown with the xyz package already, it's easily replacable as the second S:P, you could add more P.U.N.K extra cards to go longer.<br />&nbsp;The number of cards are those because you're running like 8 one-offs, while only one of those is really a brick (Full-Armored XYZ), you definetely don't want to see them often as there a better starters and extenders, if I could I would run definetely a 50 card deck but there a 3 conflicts in bulding the deck. 1&ordm; You want all the extenders and gas as possible so you need to run a bigger deck so you don't draw the bad stuff often. 2&deg; Materiactor want a smaller deck with a lot of handtraps to get handtraps and materiactor cards to add from meltdown and you because of the number of materiactor you want to see atleast one of them in your hand but no more than 2. 3&deg; you really want to see punk cards so you run a lot of them that are extenders or combo pieces to break/build/protect boards since it's doing the heavy lifting.</p>"

While the Ryzeal and Ogdoadic builds are also solid, the Drytron package just seems to flow better for me. It feels less bricky, it's easy to play and the end boards aren't too oppressive. It rewards finding the choke points of your opponent's deck and making the most out of what seemingly little your board ends on.

Is it on par with Snake-Eye Fire King or full fletched Yubel decks.. No. But is it more fun.. Yes (in my opinion).</p><p>In the decklist provided we run 13 one (occassionally +0.5)-card starters that put up at least 1 or more interruptions, landing us on almost 80% of opening one.</p><p>We run 10 handtraps (69% chance getting 1, 25% chance of getting 2) and 2 Super Poly's, 1 Thrust and 1 Talents as 14 non-engine (~82% of opening one).</p><p>Ashened is not a 1 card starter deck (except for Awakening but that has a nasty lock), and in combination with the one-card starters, the chances on opening starters is decent. It is even better if you'd open more than 1 engine as you can survive hand traps and still put up a board (whilst likely also having hand traps yourself).&nbsp;</p><p>Mathematically rations are quite ok, I maybe want to make some changes down the line but it is a decent start of the MD season.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other options to consider, I originally anticipated going for a Centur-Ion (has Pyro monsters too - will be even better when new support comes) and Horus (better than Yubel I think) pile, but this worked perfectly fine too.</p><p>If you have any questions and/or remarks, please refer to the linked video and I'll make sure I'll answer.</p><p>Lastly, I firmly believe that running an Ashened pile is the best way to play this deck. Not 100% if this combination is the best pile yet.</p><p>Cheers!</p>"

Basically you play the deck as normal Sky Striker unless you open an Ecclisia in which you simply do all Sky Striker stuff then summon Ecclisia. The end of the board is usually a Shizuku and Ecclisia with one two 2 backrow. Then on your opponents turn you can tribute your Ecclisia to bring out Albaz to then go into a Mirrorjade using you Sky Striker Link as material so you usually end up with a Mirrorjade and a Widow Anchor most of the time. The deck plays really low to the ground and is honestly a lot of fun. The deck does prefer to go second but with Ecclisia you can go first and make a mirror jade and backrow and still pass without much stress. As for the typhon you can play the deck without it but if you have it put it in the more ways you can eat the opponents board the better. Overall the deck is pretty cheap and has a lot of interaction really fun hope you enjoy playing it!</p>

Search Rosalina. Save the other effect for later.</p><p>1) Summon Rosalina, Or Lonefire Blossom into Rosalina [Or if you are lucky, One for One her]</p><p>2) Summon Laurel using her effect.</p><p>3) Link into Aromaseraphy Jasmine</p><p>4) Use Laurels effect, then Aromaseraphy Jasmine's effect to search for Rikka Princess<em> [OR another further combo piece or alt win condition if you already have her in hand]</em></p><p>5) Use Princess's effect to summon herself. Use Jasmine's second effect. Special Summon Mardel. <strong>Cry if you drew it into your hand (though you should still have other plays). If you have Aroma Blend in hand and didn't use it to get Rosalina, you discard Mardel and set Blessed Winds instead. It will be awkward but it will continue the combo.</strong></p><p>6) Mardel Effect, Search Aromage Mangoram&nbsp;<em>[OR another further combo piece or alt win condition if you already have her in hand]</em></p><p>7) Link all monsters into Aromaslilith Rosemary. Use her effect to search Aroma Blend. If you already have it, get Aromaseraphy Angelica in hand. <em>[OR another further combo piece or alt win condition if you already have her in hand.]</em></p><p>8) IF YOU HAVE OTHER AROMAGE MONSTERS, OR WAYS TO GET MORE, DO SO NOW. Perform Step 0. If not possible, skip this step.&nbsp;</p><p>9) Through any method availible, gain LP (Either with one of the tuners in hand or Humid Winds second effect. ENSURE YOU END THIS STEP WITH MORE THAN 8000 LP or&nbsp; A METHOD TO GET MORE LP. Activate Rosemarys effect. Special Summon at LEAST Aromage Mangoram. If Canacanga, a second Laurel or Jasmine is in hand, also special summon them.&nbsp;<strong>DO NOT SUMMON ONE OF THE LV1 TUNERS.</strong></p><p>10) If you used Aromaseraphy Angelica's effect to trigger Rosemary, ignore the first part of this step. Activate Angelica, gain LP and trigger the mandatory effects of your Aromages. This can extend some plays on turn 2, or in the case of Jasmine, let you draw handtraps and alt win conditions. Then, special summon Angelica from the GY using it's own effect.</p><p>11) Synchro Angelica and Mangoram into Sweet Mangoram. Add Either Dried Winds or Blessed Winds to hand. I find that it depends on the scenario. Dried is an extra interupption, that can be played at a different time than your other mandatory Aromage LP gain trigger effects, while Blessed let you trigger the effects more consistently and let you resummon Aromages to counter Kaiju's and similar cards.&nbsp;</p><p>12) Fusion Summon using Mardel and Laurel in GY using Aroma Blend's second effect. Summon Aromalilith Magnolia. Set any Traps you have in hand.</p><p>13) Extend your plays if you can. Aromage Jasmine will give you an Extra Normal Summon and if you used One For One, you didn't use your Normal Summon too. Also, if you summoned an extra plant somewhere down the line, you can link it and Rosemary into Benghalancer for an extra interupption.</p><p>14) On your opponents turn, activate Humid Winds and search one of the LV1 Tuners with hand effects. Be careful not to go under 8000 LP or else you turn off all of your plant monsters anti-targetting and anti-destruction. You should now have all the tools to interuppt and cancel opposing plays.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EXTENSION/ALT WIN CONDITIONS</strong></p><p>1) Cactus Bouncer - Can't be special Summoned, but you can search it or draw into it. Must be your last action if you summon it. It basically means your opponent can't summon anything lol. It's also your emergency win condition if you get interuppted a lot, since I have gotten Blend negated, then gotten the non-link jasmine on board and just summoned it and passed.&nbsp;</p><p>2) Naturia Carmellia - Pick Sunflower or Vein depending on whether monsters or spells matter more to you. Send one to GY on summon, special summon it with Carmellias effect on your opponents turn for an extra negate. Unlike Bouncer, this can be Special Summoned, so an extra Lonefire Blossom can be turned into this. They can also help you get into your emergency/extender Synchros. If you need more damage on board, I've used vein with Sweet Mangoram and turned them into Periallis, which resummons Sweet Mangoram. Circle of the Fairies is also another way to get Cactus Bouncer on field with it's extra Normal Summon.</p><p>3) Rikka/Sylvan - Sylvan Dancepione is your emergency Link-2 if shit goes wrong. If the Link Jasmine gets negated... ruh roh, Dancepione can sometimes get you back on track or down another line of play... but its entirely luck. It does however, allow you to get 2 monsters to share a level, which can help with synchros and XyZ plays. Rikka Glamour meanwhile should always be your first play, usually searching princess unless you already have one. It's not vital, so negating it with Ash is fine, and if you have an extra princess, you can search an extender instead. Snowdrop, the rikka fairy is your last piece of interupption you can place on the field. If things go to shit, you can special summon her and another plant by tributing a negated plant. Then, much like Dancepione, she can get 2 monsters to level 8. With that you can make the Xyz that tributes on quick effect. Funny enough this is another way to get Naturias online too, since you can summon either Carmellia, or Lonefire Blossom with this. Eitherway snowdrop is a good extender and doesn't even need to use her second effect all the time since your Fusion monster is also level 8. If it's not doing anything... well there you go.</p><p>Oh and Rikka Petal? Thats an emergency way to get to Aromalilith Rosalina via the Rikka's Spell's second effect if you tribute a card. It's also an extender since it is also a searcher of Rikka stuff, so you can summon it instead of Mardel if... Mardel decides to be the brick that it is.</p><p><strong>Effect Considerations</strong></p><p>I have played the main combo and emergency other routes of play enough times to mention these. Don't forget these effects.</p><p>Need Emergency LP? - Aromalilith Rosemary has a third effect that lets you gain 1000LP in exchange for a monster it points too. It's usually not worth it on the main combo path, but it has come up a few times, especially on Turn 2.</p><p>BANISH - Aromalilith Magnolia can pay 2000LP to banish shit based on the number of Wind Traps you have. Note that you don't get to pick the amount you banish from this effect. This usually comes up when im the second player and need to scuff past stuff, since blend will ensure you always have at least 1 Wind Trap. That being said, this feels very much like a Turn 3 Clean-up effect. It is however, non-destructive removal, so keep it in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>FIRE FIRE FIRE - Dried Winds second effect rarely comes up... but when it does it is spectacular because even people who read the card sometimes forgets it has a second effect. Also I have used it against Dinomorphia to limited effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Closing Notes</strong></p><p>I'll be honest, this deck folds a lot of the time to Rosalina -&gt; Ash Blossom -&gt; Cry. It's an obvious chokepoint and while there are ways around it, you either get a half-baked board, Cactus or death or... usually just Rosalina pass. It's never going to be meta and I hesitate to call this rogue, but I have had hilarious wins against Runick, Tenpai, Swordsoul Tenyi and other decks.&nbsp;</p><p>Its fun. At least for me.</p>"

The problem with Dream Mirrors was that it was known for being slow. As one of my favorite archetypes ever, I FINALLY found the solution: making the overall strategy revolve around the field spells, as well as wasting deck space on the Dream mirror spells and traps requiring either field spell on the field. Once you don't care about their strategies, they become a real threat. Pretty unorthodox but that's what makes this deck lethal. The Fiendmsith engine can be used on the Dream mirror fusions, and there is a hidden combo during the Battle Phase where you can fusion summon with their fusion card, which can give you an additional attack. Very aggressive on the field.&nbsp;</p>"

Historically being the strongest Yugioh deck of all time, Tearlaments has weathered the many banlists that targeted it, and it still remains a tier 1 meta threat to this day - especially on Masterduel ladder!</p><p>With the Horus cards Masterduel, Tearlaments have another way to mill cards to the GY with The Zombie Vampire, easily accessible by the level 8 bodies that Horus monsters provide. Get your gamble on, and mill mill mill your way to Masters 1 with Horus Tearlaments!</p><p>Tearlaments' gameplan is to mill as much as possible to trigger graveyard effects. Like every Tearlaments strategy, this deck aims to mill as much as possible and gain beneficial effects from those mills. The reliance on mills makes this strategy unpredictable and luck dependant, meaning that there are hardly any straightforward combos.</p><p>There are no straightforward ""combos"" for Tearlaments due to the random nature of the deck. Combos are hand/mill dependent - leaving the rest of the game up to the duelists individual skill, decision making and mental fortitude (that's the Tearlaments is considered as a difficult to pilot deck). Tearlaments are also infamous for requiring a great deal of skill, since the pilot has to be aware of the various interactions they have in the GY and the amount of cards left in their main deck.</p><p>GLHF Duelists!</p><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><br /><br /></div>"
