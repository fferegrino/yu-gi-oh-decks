It plays well into Maxx 'C', liberal space for non-engine to pack outs to problem board states, enough power and resillience to deal with opponents' attempts to kill you, and has ways around most common handtraps (except Gamma, but that bozo's functionally leaving the format in a week so even that won't be a problem). While Yubel and Tenpai are presently superior decks, Voiceless Voice stands as one of their unsung rivals.</p><p>The only question was how you wanted to build the deck. Branded and Dogmatika were common choices in the TCG, but Branded's limits in MD make that a non-starter IMO and Dogmatika just doesn't have the punch I'm looking for. Pure VV was, of course, an option (and how I played it in the past, I have a deck profile for pure from a few months ago).</p><p>Then I encountered the concept of Kashtira Voiceless Voice. I forget what gave me this idea, whether it was running into it in Ranked or seeing a decklist on YGOPRO or even just thinking about Kashtira Snake-Eyes (for those who remember that innovation from the MD playerbase), but here it is. I won't go into the card-by-card, but here's some reasoning on why I've built it this way:</p><ul><li>Kashtira is an engine that can be played before starting your main VV line without any issue. Drawing Unicorn or Wraitsoth is full Kash combo, and both baits out handtraps and disincentivizes your opponent from handtrapping the VV line by way of Unicorn's presence. It can also be performed without running into Nibiru by pausing your Kashtira combo after Unicorn's search, running through the VV line from there, then continuing after Skull Guardian's negate is online. It also means you're less likely to brick on non-engine, since three Kashtira cards are straight one-card combos and there's some two card combos that can all result in Shangri+Ariseheart on field even if you don't draw a VV card.</li><li>In a similar vein, the Kashtiras are also a good source of tribute fodder for the VV Rituals. They're all level 7 (except Riseheart, but he can even make himself a 7 if you're truly desperate), meaning you can use them as the whole material when summoning with Saffira's GY effect. Note that not being LIGHT means they cannot be used for a Ritual Summon with Prayers, however.</li><li>Kashtira also functions as a strong extra end-board set-up. Ariseheart is a walking Macros Cosmos with a huge attack stat and removal (and under Barrier, cannot be targeted for attack while Lo+Skull Guardian are present), which means he can often shut down turns on his own.</li><li>On the other end, Voiceless Voice is able to tolerate Ariseheart's presence as an end-board piece as long as you're not an idiot. Blessing lets you recur banished cards, and as long as you don't tribute Lo while Ariseheart's on the field you can generally get away with having him there.</li><li>Tenpai also has a decent amount of difficulty playing through Voiceless Voice if you can get Sauravis, Ancient and Ascended onto the field. While they theoretically have ways around it, a lot of Tenpai players will run straight into Sauravis by summoning Bident (at which point you can just use Sauravis to banish it before it even technically hits the field, removing it from being a problem at all). Prayers also lets us swiftly recover from most of Tenpai's destruction-based board-breakers, summoning Skull Guardian then reviving Lo to turn the negate back online.</li><li>We also main-deck 2x Evenly Matched as our primary board-breaker. It's half-economic purposes (Evenly is the best SR rarity board-breaker), but also that I find it preferable in most match-ups over other options. It's especially strong into Yubel, who is probably the best going-first deck in the format right now.</li><li>Imperm is probably the hand-trap I fear most right now, on grounds that it dodges Triple Tactics Talent and Called By (two of the anti-handtrap tools we run), meaning we need to hard-open Sauravis to fully be safe on protecting our activations.</li><li>Extra Deck is definitely very flexible. I rarely ever actually use any of these cards outside of the Kashtira line, so feel free to experiment.</li><li>Droll &amp; Lock Bird is very bad if it is activated on our turn, but it also is not especially common in this format right now. We can manage if we hard-open Lo+Skull Guardian, but otherwise you will have to figure out a line on your own based on your hand. There's not a lot of good options, sadly.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Terrortop is crazy because he sets up more combos using Levirtue Dragon and helps playing through handtraps using Totembird or Gossip Shadow. I dont main Virtue Stream though because you mostly just make Levirtue Dragon when you draw terrortop while Silhouhatte Rabbit can always be made and works under droll, playing both is too many bricks.</p><p>Non-engine was nice, would probably run more handtraps instead of Fenrir though. Daruma Cannon was busted again, even going second it just forces a grindgame which this deck mostly wins.</p><p>played 42 because I felt like with 40 you draw too many duplicates. With my next lists I will stay at 42 - 44.</p><p>Nothing too special in the extra deck. 2 Varudras is mandatory, I play 3 just in case. Lyna sadly didnt come up, but dont know if I would swap her for Knightmare Phoenix again. Lyna is nice if you want to make S:P and can search Demigod if you crash with her.</p><p>In the side deck, im honestly just trying out some things. I always play Ultimate Slayer + Targets, Thrust, Talents, Duster and now Dbarrier too. I also side Virtue Stream for going first.</p><p>I sided Phantazmay but never found him, same with Cosmic Cyclone. They could theoretically have been pretty good still so I dont know if I will keep them in the side deck or not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall Im extremely happy with that list. The only things you could maybe improve is playing a small fiendsmith engine, but I havent tried that yet and it might not even be the right decision because of how many extra deck slots it requires.</p>"

You can also send Trencher or Tunneler to the GY instead. Trencher allow to extend and Tunneler to draw.</p><p>- Activate Outrigger effect targeting River to SS Arise-Heart. You now have an Arise protected from targets and that is quite hard to pass through battle because of Road Roller's effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to acces the Earth Machine monster ?&nbsp;</strong>Now to perform the previous combo you need one Earth Machine monster on the field.

Those are my favorite but you can use other instead, like the trains. I found those quite usefull since Anchor is accessible through Heavy Forward, the Vernusylph can send a Road Roller to the GY to SS after and the SHS engine is so powerfull here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The SHS combo :</strong> I come now to the SHS engine and all the versatility it gives to the deck. I recall here the basic SHS combo :</p><p>- Wakaushi -&gt; Monk -&gt; Soulgaia</p><p>You now have 2 LV4 on the field. One of them being an Earth Machine tuner. What can you do from there ?</p><p>- You can perform your previous combo, Soulgaia being the Earth Machine monster.</p><p>- You can Xyz Summon <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=28912357"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/28912357.jpg"" data-card=""28912357"" data-name=""Gear Gigant X"">Gear Gigant X</span></a> to add Harvester turning your SHS engine on a one card combor. You can also add something else to extend like another infinitrack.</p><p>- You can go into the Synchrol line. Synchro Bureido and activate its effect to SS Shirokunishi and place Wakaushi into the Pendulum zone. Synchro Bureibu and activate its effect to SS Kunamzan.</p><p>This last play is the most powerfull. The Kunamzan can be used as the Earth Machine monster from Infinitrack combo but it also provide a LV5 to go into Cyber Dragon Infinity. It also provide a Pendulum Summon that can help to extend either with Pegasus or Anchor Drill and can often give access to Infinity or S:P.</p>"

I even made a (terrible) video showing how this time!</p><p>First things first, the ability to perform The World FTK is a 1-card combo off of both <strong>Union Hangar</strong> (which includes <strong>Terraforming</strong> and <strong>Set Rotation</strong>) and&nbsp;<strong>Union Activation</strong>. The line is similar within both, as your goal is just to gather all six pieces of the A-to-Z fusions, get Light Barrier, and put Union Activation into the GY. Basically, this hasn't changed from the previous build.</p><p>A major change, however, is the expansion of the Fiendsmith engine to be more complete. The addition of&nbsp;<strong>Lacrima</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Sanct</strong> in addition to&nbsp;<strong>Engraver</strong> is just to give the deck a bit more grind capability - you can summon Lacrima off of Requiem to pitch Engraver for the summon of <strong>Desirae</strong> and link Desirae and <strong>Sequence</strong> off for&nbsp;<strong>Agnumdei</strong>, and that will set you up for at least one revival of Desirae if it's outed at some point. Of course, this is all in the event you either decide you dont want to or are unable to position yourself to summon The World.</p><p>Speaking of ""unable to summon The World"", the backup endboard has been modified greatly, weaving both&nbsp;<strong>Psy-Framelord Omega</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Silhouhatte Rabbit</strong> into the line to add both a hand rip and a summon negate in the form of&nbsp;<strong>Azurune</strong>.</p><p>All in all, these modifications make the deck feel much nicer - less chaff in the Extra Deck, every piece of the combo is actually used reasonably often, and the ability to FTK is not sacrificed in the process.</p>"

Most paleozoic decks exceed the 40 cards limit for consistency (to 60 cards main deck) by adding ""Needlebug nest"" and many other useless paleozoics.

Rocket Salamander. <br />The base combo is this-<br />Summon Rocket Salamander (through any means, Normal summon, special summon through OSS or One for One, ect) &gt; Tribute Salamander for it's effect, summon Screw Serpent, Serpent revive Salamander, Synchro into Ib, Ib effect add World Legacy World Chalice. <br />If you special summoned Salamander, you're fine to just normal summon the Chalice by tributing Ib. If you normal summoned Salamander, you'll need to summon Ib the the EMZ, and then link it off for Gravity Controller (after which you use Ib effect summon Crowned, link Crowned into Imduk, Tribute Controller and summon Chalice. then resume combo)<br />After summoning Chalice, use Ib's effect to summon Lee from deck, then Lee effect to add Crowned. Link Lee and Chalice into something (Currently testing Sprind, but Auram should work as well. This list was originally a Master Duel deck and I used Spright Elf, but that's banned in the TCG) then Chalice effect summon Guardragon and Crowned from deck. Next is where it changes up a bit, I know there's a lot you can do from this point but currently what I've found to work best is to XYZ into Gigantic and do Spright plays. <br />Currently Rocket Salamander (special summoned) gets me to Gigantic, S:P, Abomination, and Avramax OR Avramax (made with I:P), Earlie, Gigantic, and a set Sorrows <br />Originally in Master Duel, I would end on Apollousa instead of Abomination (Abomination is just a replacement with good arrows and an okay effect, I could see Saryuja Skull Dread being a good option as well)</p>"

Kashtira birth is clutch against d shifter decks as well. The diabelstar is just there as an extra body and a ponix summon with the OG sinful spoils. If you can get either ulcanix or ponix effect off, it becomes very hard for your opponent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All the non engine you can just replace with whatever you like, for me this works because the droplet kinda gives you infinite chain blocks with kirin and the circle as well. You can choose to put more handtraps in the deck but the crossouts really help when going first.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have things to recommend pls let me know!</p>"

The goal is to use Dreadmaster for the fusion of either DPE or Dominance. Once it's your opponent's turn you can pop Dominance and their card to bring out Dreadmaster for the protection and then of course the big punch next turn. That's really it, just big guy punch. It's fun. The D-Force in the side deck is if you're going second and need to turbo out Plasma. The D-Tactics are for Dystopia, which is why I have a second one in the side deck. D-Tactics is a lot more gimmicky than the Dominance line so unless you're messing around I wouldn't really go for it. Since it's a pure Destiny HERO deck I tried to use as little of the other HERO cards as possible, hence the ""weird"" ratio of Vision and Elemental HEROs. I've been building and updating this deck for months now and this is what's been working best for me. Feel free to ask or tell me improvements in the comments.</p>"

The whole idea of Nouvelles is that your opponent never wants to target anything ever, or you can climb up the ritual levels. this best can put up a ton of interruption with very few cards on field, with my end board usually being, at the worst, just buerillabaisse and chef's special recipe. however if the opportunity presents itself, diviner, who is already a good combo piece, can be used to synchro summon after sending arc light to grave. I find it easiest to put up level 7 (diviner + poissonaire/buerillabaisse) or level 12 (Diviner + baelgril/hungry burger) however most levels are doable to some extent, if you want to substitute in a different synchro. Vagnawa is in the side deck as a time card when nessesary as this deck cannot burn in any other way. only other things to note is that benten can search itself on a non-once per turn when tributed for ritual material, while also searching diviner or trias. diviner and poissonaire both have important effects on summon, but also when tributed effect, which makes trias and enemy controller(going second) incredibly helpful to get around targeting negates (veiler/imperm/etc).<br />Overall deck works out most of the time, but in the case where you only get 1 starter and the opponent has ash, it's so over.</p>"

By half your stuff happening in the grave...,"<p>This is a Tearlaments deck at its core that synergizes with 4 major engines, Fiendsmith, Kashtira, Horus and Shaddoll. Each engine does its thing when in the hand or in the GY.</p><p>Fiendsmith can serve independently on its own with engraver as its starter, or if you happen to have extra bodies laying around, can be made with closed goddess with 2 extra bodies from either the Horus line or other incidental summons from Tearlaments/Kashtira.</p><p>The Kashtira line is the all around last resort that stays the lowest to the ground - fenrir banish and unicorn to hose out the extra deck is very important.</p><p>The Horus line provides extra bodies needed to either go into fiendsmith line or double up as extra bodies for The Zombie Vampire for extra mills or even to go into sprind to dump Merli and fuse on the fly. Worst case scenario, they are huge beatsticks that perform non targetting send to the GY, shuffling your banished cards back and provide lots of grind in battle.</p><p>At last but not least, Shaddoll. The Shaddoll package serves as the tippy-tip of the gameplan as it is the most incidental of all of the archetypes. It's serves as a way to fuse into Shaddoll Winda to force interaction or completely win games on its own or when it's sided, serves as additional negates with Apkalone coming out easily as a summon going 2nd and providing your team with the ability to proceed forward. Shaddoll Dragon serves to destroy annoying spells and traps and floodgates on the field and Ariel banishes opponent's cards, especially good against GY needers like Fire King and Snake Eyes. Maliss/Ryzeal are very resiliant to these cards so not fully recommended to bring Ariel into most matchups.</p><p>Rainbow Bridge of Salvation is one of the few ways you are able to bridge the 3 archetypes with field spells together - Horus, Tearlaments and Kashtira. Use this to grab whatever field spell is needed.

The basic idea was to summon the OG Demise ritual monster to break the field and then with the help of the level 10 Ruin ritual card (which can attack 2 times in a row if summoned correctly) to attack with these 2 cards for game.</p><p>But this restrictions makes this strategy a bit of impossible. So my next approach was to bring the OG Demise ritual monster and then the Impcantation boss monster with 2 other Impcantation monsters to hit for 9400 LP.&nbsp;</p><p>This might not be that easy to make a first turn kill cause handtraps and other disruptions can slow the process. This deck contains a 9 card draw engine which can help a lot with cycling through materials and pieces of the combo.</p><p>Impcantation Ratios: Most of the times Ritual monsters are way more accessible, cause we use more of them. The main reason for that is that Impcantation ritual spell can be retrieved from grave. So it's smarter to use more of level 3 and level 6 Impcantation monsters to activate them from hand. The level 10 Boss monster can even suffle them back to deck if needed, to never run out of resources.</p><p>Cards like swords of concealing light and gravity bind can help with slowing down your opponent, while they can be targets for Magician's soul or can even be destroyed by Demise.</p>"
