Of course debug/foxy (searchers), Fowl/Spinny/Reclusia/Gazelle (extenders), Coyote/mole/falco (recycle salads/tech/ note: mole is also an extender), racoon is to protect one of your Salads from destruction and gain lp in process also when you destroy your opponents monster it while its in the grave it recycles back to hand.  Spells are self explanatory, traps are disruption but like I said if you don't agree with them remove for more hand traps especially backfire. The extra deck right now is setup to control the board as well as have flood gates/extenders ( transcode/splash mage), take hiita out for update if you feel like it same with zorovoros for Avramax.  Currently I use the same deck in rl except I have Beat Bison in as a tech card."

It's very easy of you add the effect of Divine of the Herald by normal summoning it and send from the extra deck the Herald of the Arc light who will add a ritual card from the deck. I put the Psyframe gamma which will be' summoned by Crystron Halqifibrax that will be' generally link summoned with a lv1 drytron and the diviner of the herald. Union carrier is here to have it equipped with one monster to have it gain 1000 atk and been used to chain the drytron ritual spell or just to equip the dragon buster to Borreload Savage Dragon or to the chaos ruler. Vanity's ruler is the final stop to the opponent. If you did not normal summon diviner of the herald you can normal summon it, preferly by tributing Benten from the field.

An ideal end board would be able t,"&nbsp;  <span>Hello and welcome to my Drytron Nekroz build! Drytrons are a new archetype that will come out in Genesis Impact this week and this build uses them to their full potential. You never know this may even become meta after the December 2020 banlist! The main goal of this deck is to bring out powerful ritual monsters and interrupt the opponent as much as possible. An ideal end board would be able to end on Unicore at the very least since it counters more of the decks in the metagame right now. Extra deck is not needed for the build put in whatever you like! I recommend having at least some of the knightmares, an OTK card and definitely need 3 heralds. I also decided to add in assembled nightingale (can attack directly) and zeus but that's really your choice. Big Thanks to everyone at YGOPROdeck who helped me make this build! I really appreciate the help! </span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you are interested in an in-depth deck explanation and card choices, I recommend that you watch my youtube video - please like the video and subscribe to the channel, it is an amazing way to support me and the channel.

Even if the first effect of <strong>Halq</strong> resolves, nobody said you had to go for <strong>Veiler</strong>. You can summon a <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> instead, as her effect can activate on-field, unlike <strong>Ash Blossom</strong>. But, if you go for <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> instead of <strong>Veiler</strong>, know that you won't be able to summon <strong>Quariongandrax</strong>, you will be stuck with a Level 8 Synchro instead. With a Boat, of course. Unless you play <a data-name=""Formula Synchron"">Formula Synchron</a>, which can be summoned in place of <strong>Quandax </strong>which lets you get away with not having to run <strong>Veiler</strong>.  Anyway, moving on from <strong>Halq</strong> for now, let's get into the next play.  <strong>Whitebeard</strong> &amp; <strong>Goldenhair</strong> + <a data-name=""Plunder Patroll Shipshape Ships Shipping"">Plunder Patroll Shipshape Ships Shipping</a> = <strong>Almiraj </strong>&amp; <a data-name=""Plunder Patrollship Lys"">Plunder Patrollship Lys</a> equipped with <a data-name=""Emblem of the Plunder Patroll"">Emblem of the Plunder Patroll</a> + <strong>Redbeard</strong> <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon <strong>Goldenhair</strong></li>  	<li>Link Summon <strong>Almiraj</strong></li>  	<li>Discard <strong>Whitebeard</strong>, reviving <strong>Goldenhair</strong> from the GY</li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Whitebeard's</strong> effect, summoning <strong>Redbeard</strong></li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Shipshape</strong>, summoning <strong>Lys</strong> using <strong>Goldenhair</strong> and <strong>Redbeard</strong></li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Redbeard's</strong> effect, attaching him to <strong>Lys</strong></li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Shipshape's</strong> GY effect, equipping <strong>Lys</strong> with <strong>Emblem</strong></li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Lys's</strong> effect, summoning the equipped <strong>Redbeard</strong></li> </ol> <strong>Whitebeard</strong> &amp; <strong>Goldenhair</strong> + Any Level 4 Extender = <strong>Blackbeard</strong> &amp; <a data-name=""Plunder Patrollship Moerk"">Plunder Patrollship Moerk</a> (equipped with <strong>Redbeard</strong>) <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon <strong>Goldenhair</strong></li>  	<li>Special Summon Extender</li>  	<li>Link Summon <strong>Almiraj</strong></li>  	<li>Discard <strong>Whitebeard</strong> to bring back <strong>Goldenhair</strong> from the GY</li>  	<li><strong>Whitebeard's</strong> effect summons a <strong>Redbeard</strong> from deck</li>  	<li>Overlay your extender and your <strong>Goldenhair</strong> into <strong>Moerk</strong></li>  	<li>Link Summon <strong>Blackbeard</strong> using <strong>Almiraj</strong> and <strong>Redbeard</strong></li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Redbeard's</strong> effect, attaching him to <strong>Moerk</strong></li> </ol> Ok, back to <strong>Halq</strong>.  <strong>Whitebeard</strong> &amp; Any Extender + <strong>Emblem</strong> = Any Level 8 Synchro &amp; <strong>Lys</strong> (equipped with <strong>Redbeard</strong>) + <strong>Blackbeard</strong> &amp; Any Boat <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon <strong>Whitebeard</strong></li>  	<li>Special Summon Extender</li>  	<li>Link Summon <strong>Halq</strong></li>  	<li>Chain Link 1 <strong>Whitebeard</strong>, Chain Link 2 <strong>Halq</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Halq</strong> summons Any LIGHT Monster</li>  	<li><strong>Whitebeard</strong> summons <strong>Redbeard</strong></li>  	<li>Equip <strong>Emblem</strong> to <strong>Redbeard</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Emblem</strong> effect, summon <strong>Lys</strong> (LIGHT Tuner from <strong>Halq</strong>)</li>  	<li>Link Summon <strong>Blackbeard</strong> w/ <strong>Redbeard</strong> &amp; Tuner</li>  	<li><strong>Redbeard</strong> equips to <strong>Lys</strong></li>  	<li>Pass turn</li>  	<li>During the opponent's turn, <strong>Halq</strong> can summon <strong>Quandax</strong>, and <strong>Lys</strong> can summon <strong>Redbeard</strong></li>  	<li>Now, at any point during your opponent's turn in which you wish to activate <strong>Redbeard</strong>, activate him as Chain Link 1</li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Quandax</strong> as Chain Link 2 in response</li>  	<li>Using <strong>Quandax</strong> &amp; <strong>Redbeard</strong>, you can make a Level 8 Synchro of choice &amp; a Boat</li>  	<li>Equip <strong>Redbeard</strong> to <strong>Lys</strong></li> </ol> When it comes to Extenders and Level 8 Synchros, you are not limited to any of the ones in this list. In fact, I may leave these combos here even if I take out some of the pieces; that just means I don't think they're worth playing at the moment. If you think they are worth playing at any given point, go ahead. Oh, and of course, do not run Veiler unless you are going one of the combos above. The card sucks in comparison to other hand traps right now. Now, a little batch of Level 4 WATER Extenders for you to consider: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Silent Angler"">Silent Angler</a>: Can be summoned from hand as long as you control a WATER Monster, but prevents you from summoning any other Monsters from your hand for the rest of the turn. I was playing him until <a data-name=""Ravenwing, the Plunder Patroll Pilot"">Ravenwing, the Plunder Patroll Pilot</a> was revealed, as now there are too many Monsters conflicting with <strong>Angler's</strong> restriction.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aqua Spirit"">Aqua Spirit</a>: While she may not share the restrictions of <strong>Angler</strong>, she does require set-up, and now with <strong>Ravenwing</strong>, this card is looking even less convincing. An option nonetheless. <a data-name=""Fenrir"">Fenrir </a>follows the same foot but is even harder to bring out, and even harsher on your GY.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""White Stingray"">White Stingray</a>: This card seemed lacking to me at first. We need Plunder names in hand, preferably at all times. However, with <strong>Ravenwing's</strong> ability to bounce Plunders from the GY back to the hand, it looks a bit more convincing. Can't forget the fact that it triggers the Plunder's floating effects.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Shthana"">Tenyi Spirit - Shthana</a>: My favorite extender currently (that isn't a Plunder) Shtana operates differently than the other extenders. While most can or need to be summoned after you put down a Plunder, <strong>Shthana</strong> needs to be put down before anything else, requiring you to control no effect monsters. Meaning it only works on the first turn, and when you're losing. But, like every other extender here, it doesn't have the <strong>Angler</strong> restriction.</li> </ul> <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> has some interesting interactions with the deck. Due to the fact that <strong>Redbeard</strong> does not target, at any point that your opponent has summoned at least 5 monsters, you can activate his effect as Chain Link 1, and then activate <strong>Nibiru's</strong> effect as Chain Link 2. <strong>Nibiru</strong> will tribute everything, summoning a LIGHT token to the opponent's field. <strong>Redbeard's</strong> effect will be able to summon <strong>Lys</strong>, or any other boat if the situation allows, and will then, in a separate chain, activate his second effect, attaching himself to the boat summoned.  One last note. When playing Plunder, it is very easy to miss lethal, as they usually have the power to end games on board, but it isn't smack in your face like other archetypes. The main places you should be looking for power are the 500 from <strong>Emblem </strong>(and the monster it attaches), the 500 to all other Fiend monsters from <strong>Brann</strong>, and the massive boost from <a data-name=""Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd"">Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd</a>'s first effect (yes, reading has its benefits). Oh, and if you choose to run him, don't forget the boost from <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>.  And yeah, that's about it. Plunder Patrol is a midrange deck, not a combo deck. If you can make it to turn 3 or 4, the duel is typically in your favor, as you only ramp up from there. Once again, if you have suggestions, I am more than willing to hear them."

This way to combo is future proof if linkross gets banned (maybe elpy too) since you can use the triggering wurm to make garden rose maiden with red rose instead of the tokens of linkross. Sure it would need some tweaks but I think this may be our way to do it in the future. For the last combo with the barrier statue, I should have kept the black garden so I was 100% sure I would be able to summon the barrier statue, but you got the point I guess. You can play dragoon if you want to. Finally, no, phalanx isn't a garnet since you can add dragon ravine instead to send world chalice puppy, basically just pick one or another depending on the scenario.

I find it really fun, but it soffers handtraps too much, as every for fun deck. I play two gladiator beast charge because I have just two of them, but I'd prefer to rate at three both of the traps. I tried even to switch from three ash into three impermanence/judgment, but I found out ash is more useful. Your goal is to have some traps to negate, domitianus/heraclinos and editor. To have them you use andal, link spider, test panter and the rest of the normal gladiator beasts' combo."

I hate it too. <span>Deck guide</span>  3x Shaman- Shaman is basically a field barrier on legs, which helps to protect the main card this deck revolves around, Necrovalley. It also negate's your opponent's field spells, which can help to counteract some key parts of other decks. It also gains defense, although since it's tribute summoned, that's not very important. You have to wait a turn to summon Shaman, making it a bit of a pain, but it's worth it. 2x Chief- Chief is another slow tribute monster, although it's fairly worth the time and resource investment. Chief makes your GY immune to Necrovalley, allowing you to do some other plays with your Gravekeeper's freely and use the PK's to search without problem. Chief also makes it so you can special a Gravekeeper on his summon, recycling various effects and possibly allowing you to go into a Union Carrier for a Buster Lock. 3x Gravekeeper's Commandmant- Commandmant is basically terraforming on a Gravekeeper's body, allowing you to search out Necrovalley without being limited or having a once per turn. You can easily use more Commandement's if the first get's ashed, to eventually dig through your deck to a Necrovalley. 3x Spiritualist- Spiritualist is the deck's fusion spell, but on legs. I'm seeing a pattern here. Anyway, Spiritualist allows you to go into Supernaturalist, AKA big beater with protection, as long as you have Necrovalley out. This deck searches Necrovalley constantly, so getting it won't be a problem. You can get a big beatstick with Supernaturalist in order to push for game after your opponent finds they can't do anything under Necrovalley. 3x Priestess- Priestess is, Necrovalley on legs. As long as Necrovalley isn't on the field, Priestess makes the entire field into Necrovalley, so the opponent still isn't safe even if they manage to negate all your searches or destroy your Necrovalleys. It also gives a minor boost to your Gravekeeper's, although that's not very notable really. 2x Descendant- Descendant is one of the deck's only pieces of card removal. It can tribute another GRavekeeper (aside from itself) to pop an opponent's card, which isn't great, but isn't bad either. It's too slow to justify playing at 3, but not bad enough to justify playing at 1 or 0. 1x Headman- Headman is basically the deck's Monster Reborn on legs, as it revives a level 4 gravekeeper. Note that it's only level 4's, nothing higher or lower, and that it's immune to Necrovalley. So, Headman can be used for either recovering a lost monster, or for a small combo i came up with. You can discard Commandment for it's search, and then get Commandment into the grave by that discard. Activate Necrovalley from the search, and summon Headman. From Headman, you can summon Commandment back. Then you can go into a link-2 Union Carrier and equip the Union Carrier with Buster to lock down both the opponent's grave yard and extra deck, so they're basically just not allowed to play the game. 3x Ash Blossom- Ash Blossom is a staple hand trap in basically every deck now, and for good reason, since it can cripple nearly any  combo. Since this is a control deck, Ash is great, as it doesn't allow the opponent to do any combos they can even attempt under Necrovalley and/or Buster lock. 2x Buster- The other part of the buster lock, along with Union Carrier. Buster equips to Union Carrier by the effect of Carrier to make it so your opponent can't summon from the extra deck, which completely shuts off another core component of the game and cripples a ton of decks like Adamancipators, D-link, etc. Even if they can out this, they have to dedicate resources just to outing it. 1x Cloak- Cloak is the starter of the PK engine, which you either normal to SS Boots or banish from the grave to get it's search. Cloak is generally a searcher and a starter, which is quite solid. 1x Boots- Boots is another part of the PK engine, which special summons itself as long as you control Cloak. These two, along with other cards like Shade Briganade, are essential to summoning Bardiche. Boots is also a searcher, although this time locked into Fog Blades and Briganades. 3x Necrovalley- Necrovalley is the deck's key card, as it completely shuts down the opponent's grave yard. This effect shuts down tons of modern decks, as nearly all decks rely on the graveyard to make plays. Necrovalley also gives a nice boost to Gravekeeper's, although it isn't as important as the graveyard shut-down. 3x Hidden Temple- Hidden Temple is another fantastic floodgate of the deck. As long as you have a Gravekeeper and Necrovalley on the field, which isn't that hard to get for this deck, you can completely shut down any non-Gravekeeper's special summoning. While this locks you out of the Buster Lock and Bardiche, it is completely worth it, as it cripples literally any deck in the game, as all decks rely on special summoning. 3x Throne- Throne is the archetypal ROTA, allowing you to search out any Gravekeeper to fill in the gaps of your hand. It also forces you to normal summon right after you add. I can't tell, though, if that counts as an additional normal summon or if that's your normal summon for the turn. Any help on that end would be appreciated. 3x Field Barrier- Field Barrier is an essential card that you want in your opening hand, as you can't actually search it in this deck, sadly. Having to hard draw it is annoying, but it's still a great card, as it protects the essential card for this deck, Necrovalley. 3x Imperial Tomb- Imperial Tomb allows you to control the tempo of the game as you negate key combo pieces that your opponent try's to use, as you can negate anything they try that  doesn't involve the graveyard. 3x Fog Blade- Fog Blade is a very, very helpful card for this deck. Fog Blade is more so insurance than anything, in a lot of aspects. In case your opponent manages to get out a monster even under all the pressure and floodgates, you can Fog Blade it so they're not even allowed to do shit with their own boss monster. Then ya stall until you can out it. 1x Briganade- Briganade is mainly just fuel for Union Carrier or Bardiche, as it can be activated the turn it's set as long as you have no traps in grave, and you shouldn't have any in a best case scenario. So as long as you open it, it's very helpful for going into Union and/or Bardiche. <span>The extra deck <span>3x Supernaturalist- Supernaturalist is simply more of a big beater with good protection, as using Spiritualist you can go into him, get him to high attack stats, and then poke at the opponent while they struggle to do anything until they eventually lose. </span></span>3x Dragoon- Dragoon is just a target for Reaper, to get out all the opponent's copies of Dragoon in game 2 if i know they're playing Dragoon 3x Union Carrier- Union Carrier actually serves a dual purpose. It can be used for the buster lock, to completely shut off the opponent's extra deck so they're not allowed to play the game. But you can also use it as a target for Reaper, since so many decks like D-link are also playing the Buster lock. 3x Halqifibrax- Halqi is just another target for Reaper in order to cripple D-link and Adamancipator strats. 1x Bardiche- Bardiche is a great control card, as it can send some monsters to the grave in order to set great control cards with Fog Blade directly from the deck. 2x Borreload Savage- literally just another target for Reaper <span>Side deck </span>3x Ghost Reaper- Ghost reaper is just used to get rid of problem cards like Dragoon, Halqi, and etc so the opponent loses combo pieces or their boss monster. This deck doesn't care about it's extra deck too much, so it can easily fill up the extra deck with Reaper targets. 3x Nibiru- Nibiru is another great card when playing against combo decks, as you can easily make a ton of their attempts at playing the game worthless. (This deck is also Nibiru-proof, so that's nice.) 1x Pankratops- Pankratops is basically the deck's only going second card, as it hates going second, but Pankra is a nice card in case you want a pop. 2x Lost Wind- Lost Wind is another control card that can heavily counter stuff like D-link and Adamancipators.  <span>Playing guide</span>  The ideal hand is something involving Field Barrier, a few Necrovalley monsters, and Necrovalley itself. That's a more so simplified hand, really, as with that, you can activate Necro, set up Barrier, and summon your vital Necrovalley's and then control the game from there. You can fusion, pop cards, etc. Although, hands can wildly differ. In the end, the playing guide goes something like this. You'll want to activate Necrovalley, and hopefully activate Field Barrier alongside it if you opened it. Then you'll want to either do one of two things, depending on the hand: summon  a Necro and either fusion or pass, but you can also be even more of a dick. You can use the PK engine and shit to go into Union Carrier, and equip Union Carrier with Buster, completely shutting down the opponent's extra deck. Although, if you didn't open Buster, you can go into Bardiche and set up some strong backrow. After that, you just want to set up your backrow and pass. Then, you control the game's tempo and state until your opponent either quits or gets wittled down to 0 LP by the Necrovalley's. (things to note: Extrav is a nice draw option, I just opted not to play it as I didn't have space. This deck also heavily counters a lot of the current meta, like D-link. And it also dies going second.) Any suggestions are appreciated! Thank you, have a nice day."

By using ultra polymerization to set Benkei's defence to 0, we can burn the opponent for 3500 with reach Soulbreaker activation.  Big Benkei is easily searchable, so we can we just dig through the deck with Saryuja to find an ultra poly.  To get Soulbreaker into the grave, we can discard it from hand using scarecrow or Barricadeborg Blocker. Also, it can be equipped to a monster that is then used as link material. Either by its own effect or by Union Carrier. Finally, Curious can send a copy directly from the deck. Be carful to only send one Soulbreaker Armor to the grave at a time, since it's effect banishes all copies from the grave to activate.  &nbsp;"

Soul Pendulum","This is my favorite and current build on Abyss Actors, coming to you also in a very budget presentation.  This deck is super cheap but super fun to play as and against, seriously you won't regret getting this deck to play casually.  Everything in the build is very standard, some people like running Romantic Terror but I personally don't see the purpose of it, in any build i've seen in youtube nor replay. I'm also running 2 Abysstainment for personal reasons, but you can play the usual 3 or 2 Rise of the Abyss king, 1 opening ceremony, 1 abysstainment  The only weird thing that may shock a lot of people are the Soul Pendulum, but hear me out, this card is really good in this deck. Abyss Actors have very weird scales, unlike other pendulum decks where you see only 2 they have a wide variety of scales that sometimes prevent an optimal pendulum summon. Getting Curtain Riser negated in the scale pretty much leaves the level 7 actors (the best ones IMO) out of the turn. This is where Soul Pendulum comes in, with a handy scale changing effect you turn all the scales into optimal ones, suddenly Curtain Riser can pendulum Superstar and Madonna, and the 8 scales (normally just Comic Relief) can pendulum summon Evil Heel. the 300 boost is actually very relevant since this is a beatdown deck, and the double pendulum effect rarely if ever comes off, but is game ending by itself  The extra deck could be only for show, since you only go for Director and get locked into abyss actors, but turns after the first one can be very explosive with the link 4 and specially with the dark rebellion XYZ, being one of the only outs to dragoon in the deck.  Despite having so harsh restrictions in the summons (all effects that are good lock the turn into the actor bois) this deck has a surprising amount of versatility, with effect varied with each scale and having a very good out-of-almost-everything cards like Rise of the Abyss King and Comic Relief to out problem monsters. If you can't target said monster you can always run it down by battle with Funky Comedian instead. If let the change, Abyss Actors will run you down turn 2 with an OTK  I'm planning to make a more advance construction, with better staples (Nibiru, extrav, imperm), better extra deck and a better side deck as well made to at least reach a rogue status and compete against the meta.  I hope you enjoyed this deck profile!"

In this version(unlike the previous version) the goal is to go into spheres(or Apollousa), raptite, and herald before using the effect of raptite. Last time we went into union carrier spheres and herald but in order to continue from there you would need an extender in hand. Below is the main combo.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/jz8YIUt.jpg"" alt=""The Main Combo"" width=""1903"" height=""1581"" /> <h2>Handtraps</h2> If your opponent plays a handtraped anywhere before the Herald and you cannot get Magna Drago on the field, then 4 monsters on board by using one or more of the extenders (gilasaurus, the phantom knights of shade brigandine, succession, signs etc.). link of those that are not under the extra monster zone into Reprodocus and change the type to dragon. Then go into Elpy and use the other monster and Reprodocus for Protector Welp and continue.  The next Diagram is siding against Nib.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/MNebw7p.jpg"" alt=""Playing Through Nib"" width=""1903"" height=""2545"" /> <h2>Conclusion</h2> These are some examples to utilize this deck. I haven't played enough to see and test scenarios against the meta. There are still some problems i haven't worked out(like many engine pieces, or the lack of an an OTK card in the extra deck to play after turn 1). I will have to test more to find our. Unfortunately the banlist doesn't wait.  &nbsp;"

FUSIONS!  FUSIONS!  This deck is nothing but fusions and what you need to summon them!,"Hey guys, it has been a while since I have made a fun deck to use, and Dueling Nexus is down again so I figured now would be the perfect time to share a deck that I have been experimenting with.  It is composed of 100% fusion monsters and the ingredients necessary to summon them in battle.  I do have to admit that sometimes, some of the fusion monsters feel like the conditions have to be perfect to get them on the field, but when you do, hopefully you will give your opponent a hard time.  I am still working on perfecting this deck, so if you have any suggestions on how to make it better, let me know.  I understand that the deck is 60 cards, but that is just the way that I enjoy making decks.  There are so many good cards out there that it is hard to narrow it down to just 40 or even 50 for that matter.  If that is your suggestion, I am sorry, I already know that this deck will not be as good as the meta decks that we see in competitive play, but that is not why I make decks.  I make them to have fun doing so.  So, without further ado, please enjoy, but don't judge too harshly, and if you like it, feel free to leave a like and comment telling me what you like most about the deck.  &nbsp;  Thanks,  Bmike0787"

Cannot figure out how to make it stronger.  Focus on Su Mou 1st effect to search out Zhuge (unless opponent controls 2 monsters, if so then use Liu Xuan). Extend into xyz if you want (also has a very op link that can pop saga spells to search and summon things, while sending opponents cards back to hand). I wait and decide what to do based on what my opponent is doing, especially if Zhang Yuan is in my hand and a Saga spell on field. Never overextend to show off extra deck, instead react. Pop Saga spells to special summon and search other spells. Changban trap is very op when used strategically.  If 2 Sun Mous are on the field and no other monster. Your opponent cannot target you for attack. If 2 Zhang Yuans are on the field and no other monster neither monster can be destroyed by battle.  More tricks you have to see for yourself.  Very techy. I know it can be used with other archetypes. Have had some success with Windwitch because most of them can be special summoned even after Ice Bell's effect and core cards do not rely on extra deck very much.  Looking at True Draco next because of Sun Mou's effect? idk  Side deck perfect to counter flood gate decks that use gy because you will never use gy with this deck. Necrovalley and imperial wall will have opponents scooping. Play the opponent not the combos."

Beware this deck was created by pulling myself into the state of a 'trash mentality' duelist - spamming synchro monsters and drawing out half your deck. However, in order to appeal to target audiences that don't like this mindset (such as Jobe) I have included cards such as Slifer the Sky Dragon (because its cool, if you're lucky you migth draw it out from the first half of your deck) and DMG. This deck was tested in tags only - so you can replace Ancient leaf with cards in Side like the Spellbook engine but not sure of consistency (currently about 75-85%). End board is also pretty lame... usually you would try and summon Borreload/Crystal Wing and Avramax (during opponents turn with Masqeurena)."

Also, if you have enough resources you can get Soldier of Chaos out easily too if you summon a Buster Blader off of Protector, which doesn't happen a terrible amount of times but enough where it has won me games with. And linking all of those monsters off greatly helps the next turn when you get your Buster Lock on the field."

Than u can make another rank 4 and you still have 2 cards in hand.</li>  	<li>There are 3 waking the dragon on the side deck. After game 1, your opponent probably will side some backrow removal (Twin twisters, Lightning storm, Harpie's feather duster. If you have Waking the Dragon or Trap trick (activate to set Waking the Dragon) set, you basically win the game by summoning Ultimate Falco.</li>  	<li>You can learn more about this deck on Team Bortle's youtube channel, there's a lot of traptrix builds and tips there.</li>  	<li>Extra and Side deck depends on what decks you are playing against on your locals.

I decided to work on this idea today. Because most of the Bonding monsters are all Dinos I decided to add the best Dino monsters I could think of to this deck. I haven't been able to test the deck on Edopro or Duelingbook I don't know whether it will be good or not. I plan on testing the deck soon and once I do I will add in either the comments or this description of how well the deck does. If any of you have any suggestions for the deck I'll be willing to test them out."
