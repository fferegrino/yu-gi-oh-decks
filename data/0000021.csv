However my twist on it is to protect your spells / traps with Artifact cards to be able to get easy backup defense/offense cards. If you opponent attempts to disarm your spells / traps they will more than likely trigger your artifacts.  Being able to put on vast pressure with Sky Strikers with some insurance from artifacts is a reliving feeling.  I hope you guys enjoy it as much as i have.  -P.S. Please remember to give me feedback so that i may improve this deck and all future deck builds. :D

Che,"The main strategy for this deck is to summon Secutor to the field (either by the effect of Test Tiger or any other GB monster), and then start swarming the field with his effect at the end of each battle phase. Ideally, you want Secutor remaining on the field indefinitely but even if you’re only able to resolve his effect once: It can put you so far ahead of your opponent that it’s essentially a win-condition by itself.  Another important part of this deck is the Respite engine: Comprising of the card itself, Gladiator Proving Ground and every other card in the deck that has “Gladiator Beast” in its name. They synergize together to make the deck flow easily and consistently, by allowing you to filter through your deck to get to your key cards faster; while also greatly reducing your chances of bricking by allowing you to “reload” your hand if necessary. As with all the other GB cards, Respite can be looped back to your hand via the effect of Equeste, allowing you to re-use Respite multiple times in a single duel.  Secutor’s effect can snowball in numerous way: Whether it’s by going +4 through summoning 2x Equeste and resolving both of their effects; or by using the monsters summoned by him to make the Fusion monster Gyzarus, or the Link monster Dragacius.  I hope you find the video below helpful in understanding the sort of combos you can do with him, along with the rest of the deck:  <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANOY_eC6UGQ</a>  Thank you for reading!"

Primarily, the main strategy you want with this deck is to ensure Dark Magician the Dragon Knight and Eternal Soul are both out on the field at the same time.  For extra insurance, you can also throw in Magician's Left &amp; Right Hand's, or simply Secret Village of the Spellcasters.  It's nothing too special. Got me a few wins here and there, but overall it's as casual as casual can be.  Feel free to tweak it as you desire."

But thats over now... WE WILL COME FOR YOU! (enjoy and have fun^^","Am not a native speaker so I am sorry for the mistakes that may be in the text.  The strategy is simple, spam Blackwings via Pinaki/Blizzard/Black Whirlwind and synchro summon what your enemy needs... You are able to boost your searching ability(Black Whirlwind) via the Mystic Plasma Zona, every monster now let u search for 500 atk stronger monsters.  Most combs run around Bora and Gale becouse they have no limitation how often u special summon them, like u have Gale, Genex Ally Birdman and Shura in hand, you summon shury, special summon Gale(here you are able to use his effect), take gale back to hand with genex and becouse u have Shura, you special summon him again (and sure use his effect again= -75%atk on 1 monster or 2 Monsters -50% atk). Now u could summon any lvl 7 that not become a tuner, and go then for your Diabolic Dragon.  To have a defensive Monster that helps me to keep the specialsummon running AND be a backup against mirrorforces i put Force Strix in my side.  With Artifact Sanctum i play Artifact Moralltach to play santum in enemy M1, special summon moralltach, destroy a card. Moralltach is a lvl 5 non tuner and can easyly be used to special summon Crystal Wing or a lvl 7 BW synchro. Sometimes the enemy counter Sanctum, what is dumb, becouse u then can destroy a Monster by Sanctum too.  The spell Swallows Nest is a litle special, becouse I can make every lvl 4 BW you have a Zephyros the Elite, what strengths up my combo unbelievable well. With Zephyros Elite I can also make a 5 Turns Swords of Revealing Light, becouse I also can add Swords to my hand to special summon him. ( do it turn 2, makes 2+3=5)  A weapon against early heavy enemys like Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon is Utopia The Lightning I can easyly summon. Against many decks Ally of Justice is very strong, and he makes me able to specialsummon Onimaru the Divine Thunder even when I just have a lvl 7 Tuner BW Synchro monster.  To clear the enemy off and have weapons against his traps a.s.o. I run each once: Icarus Attack, Galaxy Cyclone, Phoenix Wing Wind Blast, Dimensional Prison, Black Sonic, Scrap-Iron Scarecrow and the Artifact Comb i explained befor.  In my side I got 3 Denko Sekko becouse many of my friends love to paly Traptrix and with that card I had at least a good chance."

This deck for :for player have some experience in yugioh game, know how  to play link and set co-link monster. this is not easy and not for newpie, but if you know how to play it is so funny and...so META, I mean you can duel with almost other META DECK nowadays, no-one can stop you pro!!!!  Archetype:  -Fable and some other similar monster: all FABLE monster  is have a same type of effect that can active when you discard 1 card to GY, I just put  monsters that can ""special summon when discard another ""fable"" cards/when you discard it from hand. "". I also put some monster such as ""the tricky"" and ""illustion magician"" have a same effect like that. All of them dont have ""can only active once per turn"" that mean you can special summon them unlimitted time and Opponent is very hard to counter you by solem or hand-trap.  -"" use-me-2-time-for-link-summon!!!"" monster: I mean all monster that can auto reborn from GY or summon a token when you send them to there such as Glow-up bull/o-lion/combo frog ""ronin-dupe-swap"", performage clown etc...  LINK-MONSTER:  -now is main monster of the deck, 7 troymare monster, this is so main boss, so you can summon all of them in 1 turn, but a combo of mermail-phoenix-ceberus-gobin is almost immortal.  -need fible is common searcher of the deck, You should summon it first if nothing stop you to summon 1 ""UM2TFLSM"" monster like ""cloak(black-wing tuner)"" or O-lion. Because that monster can re-use 3-4 time in 1 turn.  -firewall dragon: nothing to say with this boss, you should search google how to use it  -And some powerful link monster you can option when use, there is so many way to use that deck.  STRONG POINT OF THIS DECK: all of card is monster, just 1 soul charge ( and 3 pot of desire in option if you want to use), and must be very unlucky guy to bad draw with this deck. Not use spell or trap, very hard to stop it  WEAKNESS OF THIS DECK: some card like mornach field that can stop you to summon anymonster from extra deck, if you must battle a deck like that, oh, nothing you can do. And some  deck that can negative effect of monster like ""skill drain"", but dont worry, I put 2 link-4 monster with 3k ATK, you can easy to summon them with this deck( because the ""fable"" effect active when they in hand, not in field)  NOW I MUST SAY AGAIN: this deck is not for newpie and if you is a newpie and want to use it, you should know that you can lose many time before you know how to play well with this deck."

The biggest issues I've run into while trying to use Coelecanth are the reliance on normal summons and a lack of good search tools.  Brilliant Fusion into Seraphinite and Baobaboon with Dragonic Diagram are there to remedy these problems while also providing a possible win condition with Metaltron XII.  If this deck works properly, it can deal well over 8000 points of damage in one turn.  The current list is a bit bricky atm but I will continue to tweak it.  I will also add a side deck once I am happy with the main deck.  I know this deck looks messy, but I swear there was a reason for each card at some point.  If people would like a more detailed explanation of the strategy and card choices, just let me know.  I am also open to suggestions for card changes, make sure to indicate which card(s) would be removed for any new additions."

It performed extremely well in testing and I was able to go 6-0 on Ygopro using this deck. I had to edit the ratios so much over the course of the past two weeks and this is the final product! Also my last Altergeist build messed up and the file can't be downloaded for whatever reason so sorry about that. The goal of this deck is to go first and set traps and then use them next turn to trigger <a data-name=""Altergeist Multifaker"">Altergeist Multifaker</a> and blow up the field with Altergeists and interruptions. I added <a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries</a> to the main deck because it stops the current meta decks completely by having meta Cherry targets in the extra deck like <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a> for pendulums, <a data-name=""Spyral Double Helix"">Spyral Double Helix</a> for Spyrals, etc... Also there is <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon"">Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon</a> in the extra deck. That is a Cherries target for Raidraptors, but it's mainly for the side deck card <a data-name=""Waking The Dragon"">Waking The Dragon</a>. During game two, if your opponent sides properly they will want to destroy your backrow since Altergeists rely on backrow. You can set <a data-name=""Waking The Dragon"">Waking The Dragon</a> and when they destroy it, you can summon <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon"">Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon</a> and then you win the game because Ultimate Falcon is almost impossible to deal with since it can only be Kaijud or destroyed by battle. One really cool combo going first to help you if you're new to Altergeists is if you draw <a data-name=""Altergeist Meluseek"">Altergeist Meluseek</a> going first and you didn't draw Multifaker, you can normal summon Meluseek and then link into <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> and use Meluseek's effect to add Multifaker to your hand! Enjoy the deck."

I'll try to make this as brief as possible.  <strong><em>Dozered:</em></strong> The first possible OTK is This hand. <strong>Manju</strong>, <strong>Ritual</strong>/or/<strong>Demise</strong>, and <strong>Megamorph</strong> and <strong>Doom Dozer</strong>. if the opponent is not running Monster Effect counters you can wipe the board with <strong>Demise's</strong> effect Taking 2000LP and more than likely leaving you with less health then your opponent. When you ritual summon if you have <strong>Doom Dozer</strong> in hand send both <strong>Neo Bug</strong> and <strong>Insect Knight</strong> to the graveyard. this allows you to SS <strong>Doom Dozer</strong>. Once you've finished this apply <strong>Megamorph</strong> to <strong>Doom Dozer</strong> and <em>BOOM </em>you got an OTK.  <em><strong>Blue Eyes: </strong></em>The second method is to Have <strong>Manju</strong>, <strong>Ritual</strong>/or/<strong>Demise</strong>, <strong>Megamorph</strong>, and <strong>Swing of Memories </strong>the same pattern applies as above however instead of sacrificing Insects you sacrifice <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</strong>. Once you've cleared the board use <strong>Swing of Memories </strong>and bring <strong>Blue eyes </strong>back. then apply <strong>Megamorph </strong>and once again you've got an OTK.  I've played around 50 games with this deck and it has run though its Great games and its bad games. If any players have any suggestions please leave a comment and i will overview it.  Thanks a lot Blason!"

Use the Toad, Kaiju, F.A. Dawn, and Tri-gate Wizard to negate ur opponent","Please read the deck description below as certain combos are quite complicated.  Advices for the Deck  The deck is not fixed. If you want to have a lower chance of brick, you could well take away one Atlantean Marksman and one Atlantean Heavy Infantry and add in Surface or Aqua Spirit. These cards also help control the graveyard to summon Moulinglacia.  The same goes for adding a few cards to prevent ur opponent from disrupting ur combo. Take away Infantry and Marksman (if you think 3 terraforming is too bricky, take away one) and add in Called by the Grave or Twin Twisters or Cosmic Cyclone.  Two Abyss-Scales equip spell cards are also applicable, as it adds extra protection and makes OTK real easy if you equip it to Mermail Abyssmegalo.  Adding one copy of Dupe Frog seems to also work as Toadally Awesome would be able to summon a fixed Attack target next Standby Phase, and the Dupe Frog would be able to search for the last Swap Frog if it was sent from the field to the graveyard, and potentially bring back Toadally Awesome again. But I personally find the card bricky in certain cases and didn't add it.  Remember you can edit the deck according to ur play style.  Combo 1  Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince + Mermail Abyssteus <ol>  	<li>Summon the prince, use effect to throw Atlantean Dragoons into the grave.</li>  	<li>Dragoon search for a Mermail Abyssmegalo and Prince search for another Atlantean Dragoons</li>  	<li>Summon Mermail Abyssteus by throwing away Atlantean Dragoons into the grave</li>  	<li>Atlantean Dragoons search for Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord, Mermail Abyssteus search for Mermail Abyssgunde</li>  	<li>Summon Riplodocus using Prince and Abyssteus</li>  	<li>Summon Abyssmegalo by throwing Abyssgunde and a random water monster into the grave (leave the spot below Riplodocus open)</li>  	<li>Abyssgunde effect revives Abyssteus</li>  	<li>You have 5 water monsters in the grave, so summon Moulinglacia below Riplodocus</li>  	<li>Use Riplodocus effect to change Moulinglacia type to dinosaur</li>  	<li>Summon Summon Sorceress using Riplodocus and Moulinglacia</li>  	<li>Summon Number 42: Galaxy Tomahawk under Summon Sorceress</li>  	<li>Use Tomahawk effect to summon 4 token</li>  	<li>Use 2 token to make Proxy Dragon</li>  	<li>Use Tomahawk and 1 token to make Knightmare Goblin beside the Proxy Dragon</li>  	<li>Activate Goblin effect throw away one card and draw one, and then normal summon a random monster next to Goblin</li>  	<li>Use Goblin and the random monster to summon a Trigate Wizard</li>  	<li>Use Summon Sorceress effect to summon Knightmare Corruptor Iblee (because it's pointing to Proxy Dragon)</li>  	<li>Use Iblee and Summon Sorceress to summon Knightmare Gryphon</li>  	<li>Iblee will be summoned on ur opponent's field</li>  	<li>If you prefer, use Gryphon to bring back any spell cards from the grave</li>  	<li>Remember the last token? Use that to summon Link Spider above the Trigate Wizard</li>  	<li>You must also realise that this combo work best when it's a 3 card combo, to make Proxy Dragon work you must have another monster next to it. So for example if you had a swap frog in ur hand, you could normal summon it using Goblin, it throws Ronintoadin into the grave, link it away, and it gives you an extra Ronintoadin available to summon next to the Proxy Dragon.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  Combo 2  Terraforming (or Kyoutou Waterfront) + Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson + any monster you can normal summon with (not Deep Sea Diva or Ronintoadin) <ol>  	<li>Activate Terraforming to search for Kyoutou Waterfront and activate that.</li>  	<li>Normal summon the monster</li>  	<li>summon Destrudo by activating its effect</li>  	<li>Summon Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing</li>  	<li>Use Yazi effect to pop one opponent card</li>  	<li>summon Mare Mare</li>  	<li>Mare Mare effect to summon 3 token</li>  	<li>Summon Linkuriboh and Link Spider</li>  	<li>Use the 4 monsters to summon Saryuja Skull Dread</li>  	<li>Skull Dread draws</li>  	<li>Use Waterfront to search for Kaiju</li>  	<li>Skull Dread special summons the Kaiju</li>  	<li>You will find most times in this combo that you will be able to summon other monsters due to Skull Dread's drawing effect. Such as an extra Toadally Awesome if you managed to draw Swap Frog. Dawn Dragster is also possible to summon next turn as Destrudo is in the graveyard.</li> </ol> Combo 3  Swap Frog + any water monster <ol>  	<li>use frog effect to rid of the water monster, summon the frog and throw Ronintoadin into the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Bounce frog back and normal summon it again</li>  	<li>frog effect throw another swap frog into the grave</li>  	<li>use Ronintoadin effect get it back on the field</li>  	<li>Summon Toadally Awesome</li> </ol> Combo 4 (OTK combo)  Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince + (Optional) Mermail Abyssteus or Mermail Abyssmegalo  The one card combo works when you have Prince and 3 other water monsters in hand. If you have another Abyssteus or Abyssmegalo in hand, it would be a lot easier to carry out the combo. <ol>  	<li>summon Prince, use effect to throw Atlantean Dragoons into the grave</li>  	<li>Prince search for another Dragoons, Dragoons search for Abyssmegalo</li>  	<li>Summon Abyssmegalo by throwing Dragoons and another random water monster from hand</li>  	<li>Dragoon search for another Abyssmegalo</li>  	<li>Summon Abyssmegalo by throwing away 2 random water monsters</li>  	<li>Use Abyssmegalo effect to attack twice by tributing Prince</li>  	<li>Prince effect activates and revives Atlantean Dragoons</li>  	<li>now you have 9000 worth of damage, enough to OTK ur opponent</li>  	<li>This combo improves a lot if you have Abyss-Scale equip spell cards in the deck. I didn't include it in this deck as this deck is mainly focused on bringing monsters that can negate ur opponent. But if you want to OTK, consider adding Abyss-Scale cards into the deck (usually one  Cetus,  one Mizuchi)</li> </ol> &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

I normally do not upload OCG based decks or decks with OCG cards in them since I live in the USA and want to stick to the current meta game we have in the TCG. I have found this Pure Abyss Actor deck to be fun to play and there are many combos hidden within the deck to be discovered for people who are trying this specific deck for the first time. The combos involve the Abyss Actor cards themselves and the extra deck monsters, especially <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>. This deck utilizes all of the Abyss Actor monsters and the Abyss Actor spell cards with no other pendulum monsters in the deck since it is Pure Abyss Actors. Making a build that relies on summoning <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a> going first and setting up interruptions could be a good meta deck once the new Abyss Actor cards come out in the TCG. I have found this deck to be most effective going second because you can actually OTK your opponent on that second turn! One cool combo I love in this deck is when you're going second and your opponent has a monster and you have none while you have <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser"">Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser</a> or <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Extras"">Abyss Actor - Extras</a> in your hand. You can summon one, or both of those monsters and then normal summon if you only special summoned one of the two to make Electrumite and send <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Wild Hope"">Abyss Actor - Wild Hope</a> off Electrumite's effect. Then, you activate a scale and pop it using Electrumite's effect to add Wild Hope back to your hand and draw one. Next, activate Wild Hope in scale and any other Abyss Actor monster for the other scale and use Wild Hope's effect to make the other scale a nine scale. Lastly, pendulum summon four or five monsters and OTK! I love this combo because your opponent just gets OTKd out of nowhere and it's very funny. Hope you enjoy the deck and have fun figuring out all the other fun combos!"

When the Dark Saviors set came out this year, it introduced Vampires, Brandish (Sky Striker Aces), and Skyfang Brigade (Fur Hire). To make things simpler I decided to test out the Mekk-Knight build with the Brandish engine and found out that its actually really consistent in terms of summons. As long as the main field is empty you can spam the brandish spells to get your monsters on the field to special summon the Mekk-knight of your choice and continue the chain. Only problem is whether or not you can get the cards to get that said chain started. If you think this deck is still inconsistent feel free to alter the card list to suit your play-style...

I have come to the conclusion on Spyral Knightmares. This deck is busted. You can link spam insanely going second. This is a going second deck so you want to go second whenever possible. There are so many combos for this deck, good luck figuring them all out. Going to YouTube videos is a great way to learn the combos to this deck for those who are new to Spyral Knightmares. Just type Spyral Knightmare combos on YouTube and you will find a good video that will help you. Or, if you know Spyrals really well then you should have no problem playing the deck. The Knightmare link spam has truly made Spyrals over powered. Enjoy the deck and have fun!"

HOWEVER the limits are very high, i have been in duels were both my opponent and I gain 30,000+ life points, and 10,000+ attack points. This is primary because, my deck focus on stealing the power of my enemy, and using it against them. Without the right hand, you may still lose against fast decks like Fluffal or the new link decks, but your win lose streak will be about even, but with more wins. I love playing with this deck, because of how fun the duels can be, so I hope one of you duelers give it a try :D."
