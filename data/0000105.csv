The ""Battleguards"" are not close to being a popular or even known deck type, but I tried to make something out of it to the best of my ability.</p> <p>Obviously, the deck needs three copies of both ""<a data-name=""Swamp Battleguard"">Swamp Battleguard</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Lava Battleguard"">Lava Battleguard</a>"", since they are what gives the deck its name. On their own, they are rather uninteresting and even in pairs they only boost their stats by a small margin, but with ""<a data-name=""Feast of the Wild LV5"">Feast of the Wild LV5</a>"", we can Special summon the duo for further Xyz and Link summons, or to go into their ""boss monster"" in form of ""<a data-name=""Battleguard King"">Battleguard King</a>"".</p> <p>The ""Star"" series of cards provides some further summoning material, with ""<a data-name=""Tenma the Sky Star"">Tenma the Sky Star</a>"" being Normal summonable without tribute while you control an Earth monster (a requirement that the ""Battleguards"" can provide), while ""<a data-name=""Hayate the Earth Star"">Hayate the Earth Star</a>"" can enter the field via Normal Summon when a Light monster is present. They also bring their friends with the other Attribute with them when summoned, allowing for some swarming and the summon of ""<a data-name=""Kaiki the Unity Star"">Kaiki the Unity Star</a>"", who then can summon the Fusion monster ""<a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a>"" for a surprisingly helpful beater with an in-built search effect.</p> <p>To make summoning some Level 5 monsters a little easier, I included both ""<a data-name=""Overlay Booster"">Overlay Booster</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Super Quantum Red Layer"">Super Quantum Red Layer</a>"" into the mix, both sporting a Special summon effect and being overall useful for the strategy.</p> <p>In the backrow you will find ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" for easy revival, ""<a data-name=""United We Stand"">United We Stand</a>"" as a ghetto OTK option, ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" for board clear, ""<a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>"" for draw power (we play enough copies of everything, so the banish effect is pretty much irrelevant), ""<a data-name=""The Monarchs Stormforth"">The Monarchs Stormforth</a>"" as both removal and tribute summon option if needed and ""<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>"" to gain access to either ""<a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a>"" if you need an added effect on a Level 5 Warrior monster or ""<a data-name=""Giltia the D. Knight"">Giltia the D. Knight</a>"" if you could start a summon chain with ""<a data-name=""Hayate the Earth Star"">Hayate the Earth Star</a>"".</p> <p>The Traps consist of ""<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>"", which stops the opposing effect monsters while lowering their ATK to beatable levels, ""<a data-name=""Wall of Disruption"">Wall of Disruption</a>"" as a better version of ""<a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a>"" in this deck since any damage you can inflict helps in the long run, ""<a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a>"" to steal the opposing defenses, ""<a data-name=""Battleguard Howling"">Battleguard Howling</a>"" for further damage and board control and a ""<a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>"" in case you need to revive another monster.</p> <p>The Extra Deck is mainly Rank 5 Xyz monsters with useful effects, some Links to have certain options available, the ""<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>"" targets as well as ""<a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Shura the Combat Star"">Shura the Combat Star</a>"" for the ""<a data-name=""Kaiki the Unity Star"">Kaiki the Unity Star</a>"" summon.</p> <p>The deck is nowhere near consistent. In fact, it is very bricky and can have some serious issues in certain situations, but that is exactly why I listed it as a Casual deck. If you want the challenge of working with ""Battleguards"" though, this deck can be the way to go. I even made an archetype analysis for the ""Battleguards"" (as well as some other archetypes), which you can find here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/08/20/archetype-analysis-battleguard/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/08/20/archetype-analysis-battleguard/</a></p>"

Ideally you want to go first as this deck struggles pretty hard to break established boards, so your side deck should generally focus more on solving this problem if the many hand traps prove insufficient. You can get to a Butler off of any Prank-Kid, by doing as follows:  - Normal summon any Prank-kid, link into Meow-Meow (which summons a different Prank-Kid from the hand/deck) - Link the Meow-Meow and that Prank-Kid into Bow-Wow-Bark (which summons a different kid) - Link the Bow-Wow-Bark and that Prank-Kid into Dodo-Doodle-Doo, using its effect to search out Prank-Kids Pandemonium (and summoning a different Prank-kid from the deck <strong>which <span>MUST</span> be either Fansies, Dropsies or Lampsies</strong>) -Activate Dodo-Doodle-Doo, adding back the other two materials for Battle Butler from your GY to your hand -At this point, with some combination of Fansies, Dropsies and Lampsies in your hand/on your field, activate Pandemonium to fuse all 3 into Battle Butler (which locks you into Prank-Kids for the rest of the turn, so you'll want to either summon your Eldlich the Golden Lord using his own effect first, or wait until your opponent's turn to summon him using Eldlixer of Scarlet Sanguine/White Destiny) *Side note: when you mill a card for Fansies' effect, just send a copy of Prank-Kids Place since you won't be needing it at that point. Furthermore, make sure to not banish any Prank-Kids from your hand for Rocksies' effect as you need all 3 other Prank-Kids in play to make the Battle Butler.  Technically you can do this combo without Rocksies (instead just going Kid -&gt; Meow-Meow + Kid -&gt; Dodo + Kid -&gt; Dodo effect to add back kids -&gt; Pandemonium for Butler), but using Rocksies allows you to fix a dead handtrap in your hand (like Nibiru) and sets up an additional attribute in the GY for Accesscode Talker later.  Otherwise, this deck works just like your typical Eldlich affair, with Crystron Halqifibrax + Selene to get an easy Accesscode Talker turn 3/4 using Effect Veiler. The Extra Deck is extremely flexible beyond the Halq/Selene/Accesscode package and the Prank-Kids cards, so really you can run whatever you want (I opted here for several links to link away already-used Conquistadors and Huaqueros, but really you could run whatever you want). Furthermore, the Side Deck should obviously be tailored to fit your own personal preferences/needs.  Is this particular combination of decks any better than the countless other Eldlich mashups (Invoked, Dogmatika, etc.)? Probably not, as Prank-Kids are notoriously fragile and are countered by just about every hand trap currently played. That being said, the double Battle Butler wipe is certainly funny to pull off and can set you up for an easy grind/OTK later as your opponent struggles to get enough field presence to power through your Eldlich cards."

The goal of this deck is to power up Firewall Dragon Darkfluid haveing a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Ritual in your gy.  Though expensive, Extra-Foolish Burial can speed this up for the Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz. Foolish burial can be used likewise with ritual. Do note that extra deck monsters who were not summoned properly can not be summoned from the gy.  Your get some Special Summon monsters in the gy by link summoning with them.  Parallel eXceed, Cyberse Clock Dragon, and Cyberse Quantum Dragon can be individually used as material to summon Cyberse Magician. Magician and Cynet Ritual can be searched by Cyberse Witch.  Cyberse Integrator can be used as material for Cyberse Reminder. By detaching integrator you can add Cynet Fusion to your hand to fuse Reminder and Cyberse Synchron (special summoned by Integrator) to summon Diplexer Chimera. Chimera can then tribuw itsself to set up another fusion. Thats 2 monsters in the gy. It does require Armored Bitron/2 Clock Tokens (You can also use 1 Clock Token leveled up Cyberse Synchron), Cyberse Synchron, and a level 3 to execute. Any of these (Excluding Tokens) can be searched using Cynet Mining (can be searched by Clock Dragon), Cyberse Magician, or Armored Bitron (can't summon itself). Backup Supervisor can search for Backup Secretary as the level 3.  Be careful when using Cynet Ritual and try not to banish your key Special Summon monsters from the gy.  Clock Lizard and Clock Spartoi can assin in Fusion Summoning. Cynet Mining , Cyberse Magician, and Armored Bitron can search for Clock Wyvern if you're looking to summon Cyberse Clock Dragon.  Darkfluid's maximum natural atk is 13000. With only 2/4 it can have 8000, enough for an OTK!"

Than ritual S  Nekroz of Brionac tributing Shaddoll Appkallone to search for Shaddol Ruq , which you can use next turn to summon Shaddol Winda with Appkallone and Linkuriboh.

With Negalogia, this deck is able to wipe every board through D/D/D Stone ","Alich, Calcab, and Farfa all have built-in interaction, so going 2nd we'll be able to trigger them by giving up their special summon effect because we run many lv3 fiend extender anyway since Darius needs fiend lv3. From there, Darius effect is super handy as it cant be destroyed by battle and it destroys opponent's monster. Main phase 2 we can rank it up to Negalogia to wipe the board.  Alich/Calcab/Farfa ratio depends on your matchup as they all do different things (Alich is the best in my testing because it negates monster effect and we can clean it with Negalogia). Against meta, its impossible to go Negalogia freely, so we run big staples to combat/make way for Negalogia to wipe board. Also if forced going first, we will heavily dependent on side deck (you can use floodgate or negation backrow).  Pros: Fun take on BA archetype, bunch of removal cards, and strong staples.  Cons: Bad going first, Eldlich/other GY deck will benefit from Negalogia."

Generaider starters: Loptr, Boss Quest, Terraforming.  Your main strategy is to do your Jet synchro stuff + add the Generaider package to get an extra negate &amp; OTK potential.

I also noticed that galaxy photon was pretty useless without afterglow dragon. This deck does not have galaxy eyes afterglow because it is not released in the TCG sadly. I started to put in a lot of other engines together into this deck and had to watch a lot of Yu-Gi-Oh Videos and combos and I got this deck. Some people might ask how to play this deck and how it is even close to a combo/meta deck.  <span><strong>Dogmatika</strong></span>  The reason why I played Dogmatika was because it was just a light engine that stopped everything. And it was a light engine. That's useful to Galaxy Soldier that was almost the only reason why I decided to play it. I unfortunately won't be playing the invoked engine along with it. I'm pretty sure everyone knows how to play dogmatika. If you don't then you should watch this video:<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpbKTbbCs8E</a>  <span><strong>Chaos Galaxy</strong></span>  I can't explain it better than this video. If you don't want to play my weird version of the deck play this deck, it's actually meta worthy. Most of the deck is based around it: https://youtu.be/vID5pVkcz-o  &nbsp;  I think the side deck is self explanatory. The extra deck is covered in both of the videos. Have A Nice Day"

Waiting for the new ""Raiders"" and phantom knights support (ocg now), I realized this build. Very fast and versatile with many skilled combos. The Main one is this by having a Simoon, another blackwing and Blizzard the far north/ or black whirlwind in order to take one more blackwing when you normal.  1. Attivate Simoon's effect. Place whirlwind and add Auster. Normal summon Auster and call back the banished monster by Simoon's effect and add Harmattan for whirlwind's effect (if you preaviously had a whirlwind in the hand, take Blizzard too).  2. Special summon Harmattan without activating its effect on the field and Synchro summon Nothung in the Extra zone. Normal summon Blizzard for Nothung's effect, special summon Harmattan from the GY and add Oroshi the squall from your deck because of black whirlwind. Now attivate Harmattan's effect targeting Blizzard to make it become lv4, special summon oroshi from your hand.  Now you should have:  Simoon, Nothung in the extra zone, Blizzard the far north, the blackwing special summoned by Auster and Oroshi for the monsters and At least 1 Black Whirlwind in the spell/trap card zone.  3. Now, use Nothung and Oroshi to summon Blackwing Tamer Hawk Joe on the field (Absolutely not in the extra monster zone), the use its effect to call Nothung back and then, use Nothung and the blackwing preaviously special summoned by Auster to link summon Raidraptor-Wise strix. Use wise strix's effect to special summon Zephyros from the deck. Then, xyz summon Raidraptor- Force strix by using Zephyros and the lv4 Harmattan as material.  4. Use force strix's effect to add Raiders' Wing to your hand.  Special summon it by detaching Zephyros from Force strix and then, call back Zephiros by returning black whirlwind to your hand (avoiding so the Simoon effect in the end phase). Then, use Zephyros and Raider's wing to special summon another force strix and its effect by detaching Raiders wing to add another lv 4 winged beast monster from you deck (generally Bora or Kris). Then, wise strix's second effect activates and set from you deck to your field the Rank up magic- phantom knight's force.  At this point you should have on the field:  Simoon, Blizzard, Wise strix (in the EMZ), 2 Force strix (one of them without xyz materials) and the set Rank up magic quick spell (you won't activate it this turn).  5. Use Wise Strix and the force strix without materials to link summon Verte Anaconda in the Extra monster zone. Then, use Blizzard and Simoon to synchro summon Borrel Savage Dragon targeting wise strix in the GY to equip him.  6. Finally, use Verte anaconda's effect to send the Red Eyes Fusion spell from you deck to the GY (as Wells as Dark magician and Red eyes Black dragon) ti special summon Dragun of Red Eyes.  7. In the opponent's draw phase, use the set rank up magic on your force strix, remote 6 dark monster from the GY and overlap xyz summon Raidraptor- Ultimate Falcon.  &nbsp;  And this was the dark combos starting by Simoon. Eventuali, you can also start different the and set up the rank up soul shave force instead of the quick one to use it on you turn to special summon Cyber dragon infinity. Then, after you summon red eyes dragun, use the first effect of Cyber Dragon infinity to absorb the verte anaconda (considering that you should have At this point, 1800 Lp because of both the effect of soul shave force plus verte anaconda which can't be' used first the rank up It you want summon Infinity too).  I just considered the Basic combo. In reality, you could have much more than this.  Enjoy!  &nbsp;"

Warning Point triggers when a monster is Summoned, and prevents that monster from attacking or being used as material for a Fusion/Synchro/Xyz/Link Summon, and also negates that monster's effects for the turn. I mainly got the idea to use this in Frogs because that deck is chockful of Normal Traps. Not to mention that it can be searched out by Lilith, Lady of Lament and Trap Trick.  &nbsp;  I decided to name this deck ""Kero!"", the Japanese onomatopoeia for a frog croaking.

The Phantom Knights are now compatible with Raidraptors! Though they don't make up much of a scene in this deck, they can be put to god use with Air Raid. This deck is based around summoning Dark Rebellion then using Rank-Up-Magics. I didn't go to far into the monster traps, as I wanted to focus of quick Xyz summons. Blaze Falcon can be summoned with Rank-Up-Magic Phantom Knights' Force. Air raid can then use it to special summon itself, leaving a path for Revolution Falcon. Blaze Falcon can also be summoned using Raiders' Knight. Astral Force can be used to summon Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon."

Seeing how things would work. Depending on the deck you face is why I have the side deck like it is. Without those cards that help negate or stop searches, your chances of winning are a bit harder. From testing the deck out, I did notice that going just pure DM didn't work as you do need cards like ash blossom and whatnot.  &nbsp;  Basically you want to get as with any DM deck, DMC, Eternal Soul on board and to protect them from destruction. Getting Dragoon helps with negating and to destroy cards. Magicians' Combination for an extra negate, Destined Rivals to stop monster effects. Having Solemn helps with stopping monster summons or a magic/spell effect. Magician Navigation is more used as to get to the grave for an extra negation. Rarely used to actually summon Dark Magician. Nibiru helps with stopping field swarms and such.  Any tips would be very appreciated as I do know the deck can still be improved and whatnot."

You can think of this deck as <strong>Salamangreat Gazelle</strong> the deck since each card in the archetype Special Summons itself in someway. You really want your starting hand to have a lot of extenders so you can go into your synchro and xyz plays. If you want to do link plays, you have to do it before using any of the<strong> Gazelle</strong> effects.  The starters you want to see are <strong>Datascape Rabbit - Tutu</strong> and any way to get <strong>Datascape Gate - Qinglong</strong> into the grave other than <strong>Datascape Servant - Laolao</strong>. <strong>Rabbit</strong> is your normal summon and an extender from grave. <strong>Laolao</strong> summons a <strong>Datascape</strong> from grave so you don't want to summon it at this point since you won't have any in the grave. <strong>Qinglong</strong> banishes itself to search a <strong>Datascape</strong> monster and you should really search <strong>Laolao</strong> at this point so you can special summon the <strong>Datascape</strong> that you discarded from <strong>Qinglong</strong>. From there, your first priority should be making interruptions on your opponent's turn like <strong>Number 3: Cicada King</strong> or <strong>Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys.</strong> The last interruption you want to make is<strong> Datascape Fox - Xianxian</strong> since its <strong>Herald</strong> eff is for your cards too. If you know that your opponent runs <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> you can make <strong>Naturia Barkion</strong> with things like<strong> Psychic Wheeleder</strong>, <strong>Psychic Tracker</strong>, and <strong>Gallis the Star Beast</strong> (these also can act as your extenders).  Every card in this deck is an extender (YEP CRACKED). <strong>Desires</strong> since we NEED to see those extenders.  Interruptions you can make for your opponent's turn are<strong> Datascape Fox - Xianxian, Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys, Naturia Barkion, Adamancipator Risen Raptite, Hyper Psychic Riser</strong> (in dire situations or you bricked), <strong>Desert Locusts</strong> (if you made <strong>Halqifibrax</strong>), <strong>VFD, Number 3: Cicada King, Datascape Phoenix - Fengfeng</strong> (for recovery), and <strong>Datascape Shell - Jiajia. Datascape Gate - Zhuque</strong> is also a negation.  Since we are going first, we are trying to make as many interruptions as possible and since every card in this deck can be <strong>Ashed</strong> we are playing<strong> Called by the Grave</strong>. Also of course we are playing <strong>Barkion</strong> for <strong>Impermanence</strong>.  Going second, we can side in things like<strong> Ghost Ogre, Nibiru, Tactics Talent, Dark Ruler No More, </strong>and<strong> Infinite Impermanence</strong>. Going second, <strong>Hyper Psychic Riser</strong> is like <strong>Dark Ruler</strong> on legs, but don't use it for that since it affects you too. You can also go into the<strong> Aussa</strong> link to get value off your opponent's grave. I don't advise playing the <strong>Wynn</strong> link since there are very few decks that will probably use wind monsters.  The most cracked card in this deck is <strong>Datascape Capital - Jiulong</strong> since it can summon 4 Extra Deck<strong> Datascapes</strong>, but you need to control 4 <strong>Datascape Gate</strong> cards. Unless we see more support for this deck by which I mean more<strong> Gate</strong> cards, I don't see people trying to resolve this effect."

This is a highly experimental deck, but it makes Halqifibrax surprisingly consistently.  Let's talk about the card choices.  <span><strong>MONSTERS</strong></span>  1x Infernity Archfiend - The iconic Infernity card. Unfortunately at 1, and with Lavalval Chain being banned, this card is surprisingly hard to special summon. However, when you do, you get a search, provided you have no cards in hand.  3x Infernity Wildcat - Part of the new support from Phantom Rage! You can discard an Infernity to special this card from the hand, which allows you to both get a tuner on the field without using your normal and empty your hand. You really want to see this in your opening.  3x Infernity Conjuror - Also part of the new support, can special summon itself from the grave with an empty hand. Mostly used as a non-tuner body.  3x Infernity Necromancer - Allows you to special an Infernity from the grave with an empty hand. This can be used to trigger Archfiend, or grab a tuner from the grave for your main combo.  2x Infernity Mirage - Can tribute itself to special summon 2 Infernity monsters from the grave with an empty hand. Great for either starting your combo, or grabbing more resources in the mid-late game.  1x Armageddon Knight - We have so many monsters we want to dump into the grave, so this card is pretty self explanitory.  5x Danger Monsters - The Danger engine is really useful in this deck. The discard effect helps in emptying the hand, and maybe grabbing some extra cards along the way. Worst case scenario, all of them are dark, making them Allure targets.  1x O-lion, 1x Deskbot 001 - Combo pieces. Deskbot isn't the worst thing to draw, since Halq can summon from the hand, but drawing O-lion means you're going to be playing a slow game.  <span><strong>SPELL/TRAP</strong></span>  3x Infernity Paranoia - More new support! Allows you to tribute a dark to special an Infernity of the same level from your deck. Also allows you to add back Infernity monsters from the grave on later turns. Amazing with Conjuror or Wildcat in hand, both giving a Halq summon. Since the tributed monster doesn't have to be an Infernity, you can also tribute a Danger monster for either another level 3 or to set up an Archfiend for later.  3x Allure of Darkness - Draw power. Also allows you to empty your hand.  1x One for One - Gives you either Mirage for summons, or a Deskbot for an emergency tuner.  3x Transmodify - Probably the most controversial card in the deck in my opinion, especially since we really only run 1 target for it. The Archfiend summon is SUPER important, however, and I feel like this adds a little bit of consistency to your searches.  1x Foolish Burial, Monster Reborn, Infernity Launcher - We like the grave  One thing to point out about the spell lineup is we don't play any quick plays, meaning all of these can be set before you use them to empty your hand. Remember this, it comes up often!  3x Infernity Suppression - With an empty hand, this stops monster effects! Can be used aggressively on your opponents turn to stop effects, or more commonly, to stop hand traps on your own turn. As good as it is, it only works with an Infernity on the field, which can make it dead sometimes.  3x Infernity Barrier - Stops everything but summons. Same as above, but the negation is incredibly good, it feels wrong not to run this at 3.  1x Infernity Break - Not great removal, but removal nonetheless.  <span><strong>EXTRA</strong></span>  1x Halqifibrax, 1x Linkross, 1x Metal Marcher, 1x Barricadeborg Blocker, 1x Auroradon, 1x Herald, 1x Borreload Savage - Combo Pieces. I'll link the main combo below!  1x Omega - For the rare times we can make an 8 and can't use Borreload Savage  1x Goyo, 1x Coral Dragon, 1x Infernity Hell Archfiend, 1x Desert Locusts - Level 6 Synchros are braindead to make in this deck, with both Coral Dragon and Desert Locusts being Halq targets on your opponents turn.  1x Accesscode, 1x Knightmare Unicore, 1x Knightmare Phoenix - General links, to be honest I don't go into these often but they're there if you need them.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>MAIN COMBO</strong></span>  In case you don't know the main Halq combo, this is what I do.  Link into Halqifibrax &gt; Special Deskbot &gt; Link into Linkross &gt; Synchro for Metal Marcher &gt; Special Deskbot &gt; Deskbot and Linkross into Barricadeborg &gt; Link into Auroradon &gt; Special Deskbot from grave &gt; Auroradon special O-lion from deck &gt; Synchro into Borrelsavage &gt; Synchro into Arc Light  &nbsp;  Like I said, this deck is super experimental, but hopefully you enjoy it as much as I have!"

So this is basically just another control deck. Hopefully, I can get used to Magistus and make even better plays. Also, the Side Deck uses a Shaddoll engine and some other cards.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Offers good cycling and removal with cards like Trade-In, Desires, Lightning Storm, et","A go 2nd Gren Maju deck. Overall this deck offers a good amount of cycling and removal, allowing you to get to your key cards and clear the field for a quick OTK. It's very easy to banish 30+ cards in one turn and get a Gren Maju with 10 000+ ATK.  You don't always draw Gren Maju and there's no reliable way to search it, however it's still possible to OTK without it. Most of the time you can OTK on the 2nd turn. This deck doesn't do well against boards with lots of negates or monsters immuned to targeting/destruction, so I'd say it's just a casual deck for fun.  Core of the deck : Gren Maju and Pot of Desires. Don't play these at less than 3.   Hand traps are here to slow your opponent going first, feel free to swap them for other hand traps if you don't like these ones.  Lvl 8 Danger cards combined with Trade-In allow for deck cycling and removal. Bigfoot needs to be at 3 but you can play Thunderbird at 2.  Eater of Millions and Orochi help to banish cards and give access to more removal. Always play them at 3.  Castle of Stromberg offers banishing although slower than the other cards and gives easy access to Hexe Trude for extra removal. Hexe Trude is also a target for Trade-In. You can change the ratios for Glife and Hexe Trude if you want.  A single Kaiju, because it's always good removal and it's a target for Trade-In. Feel free to swap it for something else.  Lightning Storm is an excellent go 2nd card, allowing you to clear the board or backrow if you're playing against a backrow heavy deck. Just be careful not to use Orochi on your opponent's turn or you won't be able to use Lightning Storm. Raigeki is an ""extra copy"" of Lightning Storm.  Extra Deck is filled with Rank 8s as it's easy to go into them. You don't really use it going 2nd since you'll most likely banish it, but going first you can easily put Hope Harbinger or Seven Sins on board for negation or protection. I didn't put much thoughts into it since it's entirely banished most of the time, so you could tinker with it to see what works best.  I don't play Extravagence or Duality because their restrictions restrain the Deck too much. You could play Allure but it's kinda bricky.  I don't play Dark Ruler No More &amp; Evenly Matched because this deck needs the Battle Phase. You could try a Kaiju engine with Interrupted Slumber for more field removal if you are not satisfied with Raigeki + Lightning Storm. Necroface is also an option offering great recycling."

With Rampage and Sieger you have your OTK but with an extra Infinity there isn’t much your opponent can do to stop it.  First determine how many cyber dragons you can get out on the field, if you don’t have a full set to make Sieger, Infinity and Rampage, ditch Infinity if you want to go for the OTK or play save with Infinity and Sieger with some backrow. If you can summon enough you can create Infinity easily with Galaxy soldier or with a Cyber Dragon Vier and Cyber Dragon Drei combo. When you do create him don’t forget to use Nova's effect to get back a Cyber Dragon from your grave if you managed to get one there (can be done by linking Sieger first). After you got your Infinity you can go ahead and create Rampage, since you are now able to negate any one effect, they throw at you. Create Rampage with overload fusion, or Cyberload fusion which is searchable for Cyber Dragon Core, or you can use the new Cyber Pharos card to do it. With that you can pretty much delete your opponent’s backrow and use Rampage his effect to get 3 attacks, buff him with Sieger effect in combat phase and you can attack 3x with a 4200-attack monster. That is often game if you play your cards right.  Quick side note: if you are planning on summoning Infinity do it early because this prevents an unwanted Nibiru being summoned, because then you can simply negate it.  This deck gives you the possibility to get yourself out of the toughest spots and creates its most powerful monsters in many different ways."

Sick of Dogmatika already? Got the Adamancipator blues? Well good news, there's a deck for you!  <strong>Why play Salamangreat in this meta?</strong>  Salamangreat can naturally run a large number of handtraps and removal, meaning it can be tailored to fight whatever is popular at the moment. While not the <em>best </em>deck, Salamangreat can be built to combat <em>many </em>decks. Salamangreat can also shut down most rogue decks with ease.  <strong>Card Choices:</strong>  2 Pot of Desires: 3 bricks too often, and there's a good number of cards in this deck that you don't want to banish.  Salamangreat Fowl: Probably the most contentious spot. This can be replaced with a Jack Jaguar, Lady Debug, or a trap; however, the extender can be useful in setting up early boards.  Gravedigger's Trap Hole/Traptrix Rafflesia: Losing to Nibiru sucks, especially if you just get OTK'd the following turn. Can also be used to stop other hand traps, like Ghost Ogre and Ash Blossom (although if you've made Rafflesia, they've probably already tried to handtrap you)  Ghost Ogre vs. Nibiru: Nibiru used to be the maindeck anti-combo tech of choice, but many decks like Adamancipator can stop Nibiru, and decks like Eldlich, Dogmatika, and Numeron simply don't care if you have Nibiru. We still run it in the side, but Ghost Ogre stops more threats among the top meta decks. It shuts down Numeron especially hard.  D. D. Crow: This can be replaced with Phantazmay or Nibiru if you don't find yourself playing against much Eldlich. However, with Invoked Dogmatika running around, shutting off your opponents from making Invoked plays can be clutch.  2 Lady Debug/2 Flame Bufferlo: You can play 3/1 Debug/Bufferlo if you want, but often times I find that having 6 searches is unnecessary, and Bufferlo can draw into traps or extenders. Also, with Parallel eXceed, you have more cyberse monsters to pitch to Bufferlo, if you find you don't need the eXceed.  3 Cosmic Cyclone: You really, really don't want to lose to Numeron. There's a lot of it these days, so doubling up on ways to out it is good. You can replace these with other hand traps if you aren't facing a lot of Numeron  2 Infinite Impermanence: You can run 3, cutting a Cyclone, Crow, Gravedigger's, or Fowl, but I find that two suffices with all the other hand traps and answers you have.  <strong>Side Deck:</strong>  3 Sphere Mode: Just another way to deal with Adamancipator and Combo Eldlich. This spot can be modified to fit your needs.  3 Dark Ruler No More: See Sphere Mode  3 Evenly Matched: See Dark Ruler No More  2 Phantazmay/1 D. D. Crow: Play whatever you want here. These slots are somewhat extraneous.  <strong>How to play: </strong>  Going first: Build a board and try to set up some backrow. Watch out for Nibiru.  Going second: Accescode Talker and OTK. Any Salamangreat monster and Parallel eXceed is a 5300 ATK Accescode + 3 pops that can attack twice. Not much can beat it.  &nbsp;"
