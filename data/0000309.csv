If all else fails, the Deck does use the dragon links engine with Chaos space, Noctovision Dragon, Dragon Shrine and World Legacy Gaurdragon as backups.

But I would recommend replacing the 3x Solemn Strike with 3x Solemn Judgment.</p><p>Extra deck is built to support both Branded and Eldlich, however you won't rely too much on the 3 Eldlich cards (Constellar and the 2 trains) as the power mainly comes from your branded fusions and Eldlich/Heavenly.</p><p>Keep in mind, Heavenly CAN be used on either turn so it's an easy additional body on the field when they activate a facedown backrow card. Even better when it's been revealed on the previous turn, as you get a +1 in your backrow which is huge advantage for Eldlich style play as you can set ANY spell or trap (although it cannot be activated the same turn, standard ruling applies).</p><p>I wouldn't expect to top any tournaments. But this is a nice budget power hungry deck for casual, or maybe even competitive play in some scenes.</p><p>Side deck is built to counter mirror matches and current meta (tears) with Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror hurting tear cards nicely and Heavy Duster storm a great backrow removal. Galaxy Cyclone is specifically for removing those gritty cards like Mystic Mine (ew) as it can be activated in the GY.</p><p>Not so great against Runick though so, gl if you vs them as they just banish all your stuff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PS. You could probably throw some more Branded stuff and bump up to a 60 card deck for a real mixer, clock out the Eldlich extra deck stuff for Branded things like Masquerade for the burn, but I haven't thought that deeply about this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy</p>"

However, going first may be preferable so you can get Gravekeeper's Trap and/or Shaddoll Schism on board.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And thanks to Reeshaddoll Wendi and Shaddoll Falco's floating effects, it's easy to get Shaddolls on board after using the Ishizu cards to set up your Graveyard and give yourself some field presence. For that reason, one of the Link Monsters chosen for this deck is Proxy F Magician, which can fusion summon using monsters from your field once per turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, because Agido and Kelbek are both EARTH Monsters, you can use them and a Shaddoll monster to summon El Shaddoll Shekhinaga, and mill at least 5 cards in the process.

This is generally enough to stop any GY deck in it's tracks so that an OTK can be achieved next turn with Naturia Ishizu's relentless monster spam.</p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><br />If you've been interrupted too much by handtraps/turn 0 interruptions, get Bagooska out to stall for additional resources and an ideal gamestate.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><div class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><span><span class=""ContentPasted8"">This deck's combos are non-linear, draw-dependent and mill-dependent. This deck's one main combo line features a singular Molcricket. This one card combo grants access to Naturia Beast, and a Molcricket for next turn's follow-up.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><ol><li>Normal summon Molcricket.&nbsp;</li><li>Tribute Molcricket for Camellia.&nbsp;</li><li>Activate Camillia's on-summon effect to mill Sacred Tree from deck to grave.&nbsp;</li><li>Sacred Tree searches Blessing.&nbsp;</li><li>Activate Naturia Blessing to resurrect Molcricket.&nbsp;</li><li>Synchro Camellia + Molcricket for Naturia Beast.&nbsp;</li><li>Activate Molcricket's trigger effect in the GY to summon itself once a Naturia Extra Deck monster is summoned. If you have extra extenders such as Vernusylph cards or additional Naturia blessing, try to get Sunflower and Camellia on the field, since they all represent extra monster negate fodder for Naturia Sunflower to use.&nbsp;</li></ol><div>As for graveyard set-up, Ishizu + Vernusylph cards facilitate that. Every Vernusylph monster discards a monster for it's activation, and Agido/Kelbek are ideal targets to discard, since they both mill 5. Funfact, since Awakening Forests sends to GY from deck any earth monster, if you already have Kelbek + Agido in hand, you can discard it with Awakening Forests' effect to send the other Izshizu card from the deck to mill 10!<br /><br />Normal summoning Diviner of Heralds also sends to GY Agido/Kelbek for a mill 5. This would make her a level 6 tuner, and pairing her up with a level 4 makes a level 10 Synchro of your choice!&nbsp;</div></div><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">Going second, </strong><span class=""ContentPasted0"">opponent's boards are broken by interrupting your opponent at key moments with handtraps like the Bystial cards, Ishizu cards, and Herald of Orange Light.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">This deck easily accesses boss monsters capable of cracking boards and punching over monsters like Baronne, Chengying, Zeus, Accesscode and Underworld Goddess. Kashtira Fenrir is an absolute powerhouse when it comes to breaking boards, and it can be easily accessed from the GY with any Vernusylph card given it was milled earlier.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">If your deck was milled by your opponent, it will help you out on the crack-back during your turn, since a decent GY set-up enables more plays, resources and interruptions for the Naturia player. Every Naturia Sacred Tree milled represents an additional monster on your field to use as Synchro/Link/XYZ material for the OTK!</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</em></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">GENERAL TIPS</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</p><ul><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Before milling with Kelbek and Agido, try to make and activate Abyss Dweller first so that your opponent doesn't plus with your mills.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Remember that using Vernusylph cards EARTH-LOCK YOUR MONSTER EFFECTS FOR THE REST OF THE TURN! Try to use your non-earth effects before using a Vernusylph card. I personally did this misplay several times, often costing me the game, try not to be like me lol</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Try to set up Gravekeeper's Trap as soon as possible. It searches every Earth Fairy in your deck, including the Vernusylph cards! Also, if you have drawn Naturia Sacred Tree, you can discard it with Gravekeeper's Trap to search for both an Earth Fairy and a Naturia card.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If your opponent has locked down the field with a crazy monster floodgate like Bagooska or an unkillable tower like I:P boosted Avramax, use Underworld Goddess! This deck can create Ms. Underworld very easily since it readily spams the field with so many monsters like no tomorrow with the Naturia, Vernusylph and Ishizu cards working together.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If you make Chengying, its effect to banish your opponent's card in their field and GY can be triggered as a quick effect by the Ishizu cards Mudora and Keldo, as well with the Bystial cards.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If you use I:P Masqurena + Bystial Druiswyrm on your opponent's turn to make Knightmare Unicorn, you can remove two cards at once (one targeted shuffle, 1 targeted/send of monster).&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If you get interrupted too much and you're in a bad position, make Bagooska to stall for resources.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">The most interchangeable cards in the deck are the Bystial cards (when you're not facing a light/dark deck) and the herald cards (Diviner and Orange Light). If you wanna cut the deck to make it more compact, you can take out these 10 cards to make this deck a 45 card deck.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Decks that counter Tearlaments are usually also bad match-ups for this deck - like Floowandereeze and Dracoslayers (the variant that turbos out Necrovalley). Be sure to side appropriately for those match-ups.&nbsp;</li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">I'll be honest, when I watched the two most recent YCS this ""Tear Zero"" format, I wanted to take a break playing competitively for a while. Everything felt overwhelming, boring, similar and crazy. Our favourite decks that we piloted were decimated and thrown aside by the unstoppable mermaid juggernaut. Let's not forget the back-to-back chain link 10s in Tear mirror matches (Pak vs. Hani feature match anyone?)! While it's enjoyable for some duelists, I can say with confidence that a 1 deck format with mind-numblingly long turns and chains is not for me.</p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">However, when I discovered Naturia Ishizu, it offered to me a breath of fresh air I needed from the stale competitive match-ups, and hooooo boy is it fun to play and pilot! It's perfectly unique, competitive and interesting all at once while being able to play toe-to-toe with the strongest decks of the format. The immense synergy of Naturia, Ishizu and Vernusylph creating this Earth-attribute symphony is just so incredible!</p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><span>I'll try out my luck with these cute bugs, flowers and eldritch horrors at my Locals, and hopefully it reinvigorates my passion for competitive Yugioh in this ""Tear Zero"" format.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><br class=""ContentPasted0"" />GLHF Duelists!</p></div><div><br /><br /></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

If a game is forced to time, you are basically guarenteed a loss because your lifepoints will always be lower at the end of whatever phase the game might be in outside of maybe your battle phase.</p><p>That being said. the name of the game is move fast. Shutdown your opponent in the first turn and push for game as soon as possible. going second is a challenge for this deck but not undoable. and when you do know your going second, the evenly matched cleans up nicely&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite play is to prioritize getting at least 2 level 4's on the field at the start of your turn 2 using alert in the opponents end phase. xyz into raider's knight and raider's knight into Arc Rebellion. with usually at least a rextrum or two kentregina's on the field, Arc Rebellion gets HUGE and can swing over any attack position for game. Warning Point helps with this if you catch your opponents off guard when they summon something in attack position looking to use it for a special summon.</p><p>-AA ZEUS is a nice followup with all the xyz access this deck provides.</p><p>*Its important to note you should prioritize getting sonic in the grave as soon as possible or fusing off from the field to mitigate battle damage as Diplos/Therizia are easy targets to swing over if you have been paying lots of life.</p><p>-Recovering with this deck is sometimes hard because you dedicate all the gas in early game. Sometimes its best to scoop and get into the side deck if they shut down your board as it will be a race against time to secure game 3 and you can side in more effective traps for whatever matchup you face&nbsp;</p><p>All in all I think this decks weakness is itself when it comes to competitive play. between the OP effects (like a walking skill drain in rex) and multitude of negates, winning isnt usually the issue. I find myself going to time more often then i like and getting handed a loss even when i have complete control of the board. Definatly my favorite rogue deck by far.</p><p>There is absolutely nothing better than pissing off meta decks playing a bunch of traps"" -Rlyhightimes</p>"

YAY!,"<p>The deck basically uses the Vernusylph and Exchange of the Spirit archetypes to help bolster the Naturia cards with rank 4 support and constituency boosting.</p><p>Firstly Naturias the stars are the new cards mole cricket and camellia. Basically you either get cricket out by sending tree to graveyard via foolish burial goods, Mudora setting gravekeper's trap to discard a sacred tree bricking your hand, or curious on a follow up play. One for one also works for this if you draw into it. Once you get cricket on board you tribute it with its effect to special camellia which let's you send sacred tree (the graveyard effect of tree is not once per turn) to search naturia blessing which you will use to redice cricket and syncro naturia beast. Then the other effect of cricket will trigger letting you revive cricket, and from there you can keep him on board for the opponents turn or you can link him off for linkuribo since cricket will revive himself once an opponent summons from the extra deck.&nbsp;</p><p>That's the basic combo from there the idea is on opponents turn once cricket is revived you can use his tribute effect again to grab an appropriate naturia for the situation (vein for s/t negate, sunflower for monster, stinkbug to skip battle ect.).&nbsp;</p><p>That's the basics of the naturia's so for verns and ishizus basically they are ment to support but they have there own quirks. Starting with verns they help bridge the naturia and ishizu cards since the discard and revival effect works for both archetypes and the help the ishizu cards with the discard requirements. Awakening forest helps by sending a earth to grave which while letting you not commit your normal summon also sets up ishizu plays or let you mill to potentially hit tree. Flourishing hills is an extender to let you get to misting seedlings which let's you search any ishizu or vern off of the discard effect. Thawing mountains is the least impactful since it is neither a level 4 or the most impactful for the effect it can potentially let you draw into a starter if you brick opening.&nbsp;</p><p>Ok to cover the ishizu/exchange of the Spirit cards. The reason I'm not running full of each is simple this deck is built with some future proofing in mind namely it is to reflect how the ocg has the archetype with keldo and agido at limited, and while the tcg banlist doesn't mirror the ocg I'd rather adjust to the hit sooner than later. Firstly mudora who I feel does most in this deck he can special himself from hand by pitching a earth fairy and doing so sets gravekeepers trap from deck which either let's you unbrick a hand with sacred tree in it for beast combo while getting and ishizu monster to hand for an easy rank 4 or a kelbez/keldo for the opponents turn. Mudora and keldo also have nice synergy with the deck since they can banish themselves to shuffle 3 cards back into the deck as a quick effect (5 if you run exchange of the Spirit and its in the gy.), and this let's you either interrupt an opponents play if there deck relays on cards staying in the gy for effects, or to shuffle your own naturia cards back into the deck for follow up namely sacred tree, camellia, naturia blessing.&nbsp;</p><p>Typically depending on your hand you should be able to make beast and possibly a rank 4 so the deck has rank 4 options to make use of it bagooska and Dweller are fairly straight forward they help with locking down the opponents so you can follow up on your turn, cowboy is ment for a more competitive setting to help win a tie, and redoer is the most iffy rank 4 but he generally will be annoying to get rid of and can steal opponents cards off there deck/give advantage if they hit a spell, and zeus us pretty straight forward of a board is in the opponents favor attack with any of the xyzs and then clean up with zeus or hold it and make the opponent commit.&nbsp;</p><p>The syncros are not as pronounced as some other lists I've seen but I talked with some mutual players and they thought that to many if the high lv syncros aren't really achievable unless you luck into a good hand that has an extra blessing to use to syncro on the opponents turn. With that in mind barkion and beast are pretty straight forward they are great in and out of archetype for s/t negate. Chengyang admittedly has the extra blessing scenario in mind but even if you make it on your turn chenyang has a interesting interaction with keldo and mudora since they banish themselves to shuffle other cards that means you can control when you can use Chengyangs banish to a degree which I find to be a fun interaction on top of it being generally good and the level isn't much of an issue to go into. Psychic end punisher is generally a good back up boss if just need something that's hard to get rid of with a good statline.</p><p>Lastly the links i:p let's you get into unicorn on the opponents turn to interrupt and your likely to see this since cricket in grave can bring itself back if you don't already have the other material on board, and same idea for cerberus for monster removal. Curious is well a curious pick for the deck but the main deck is all earth and runs 3 different types between the naturias and the other 2, and anything in the extra deck that us earth is also an extra type, and the idea is as a follow up play if we have a somewhat depleted board we assemble curious to send tree and we can either blessing back a cricket for 2 potential material which will be enough to make borrelsword dragon. Borrelsword is nice and can help close a game but in all honesty accesscode talker is a better for for the combo since you can just link anything with curious for accesscode, but this deck is ment to be more budget friendly and I personally do not like how accesscode is the easy answer for a boss monster for a deck.</p><p>I'll quickly cover the side deck basically it's to help for first turn plays depending on what I'm facing, pankertops is a staple going second and he's another small world bridge into cricket, vein is ment to replace sunflower against s/t focused decks, same for cosmic Cyclone and harpies either duster, evenly matched makes a good board breaker to a going first opponent that over extends opening up, and gozen match isn't perfect but since the entire main deck is earth it works just fine and anti spell turns off decks that have alot of s/t reliance/ openers.</p><p>I'm happy a deck that was a meme is in a usable spot its not meta or the best, but I hope to find some success with a deck I just like.</p>"

The other end board options are going for the synchros, namely Zoroa, the Magistus Conflagrant Calamity and locking your opponent out of activating effects based on what is equipped to Zoroa and then backing him up with the charmer/possessed spell and trap line, the Dogmatika members though it is very possible and consistent to end on both Zoroa, the Magistus Conflagrant Calamity and a link 2 in the same turn if you open with the right cards.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>One of the free agent cards is Gravekeeper's shaman. What you do is send Gravekeeper's shaman off of magicians souls and then summon the souls (you can make this more consistent by adding more illusions/Rites). From there summon any level 4 or lower earth monster, in this case we have every nefarious eater of nefariousness, Familiar possessed - Aussa and the Magistus of Grimoire Crowley who can change his attribute and then send the souls and the traptrix to the gy and that will let you summon awakening of the possessed nefariouser archfiend from the deck who's effect is monster reborn on any level 4 or lower so bring back a monster and then link summon away awakening of the possessed nefariouser archfiend and another monster which will then trigger archfiends search effect which will add Possessed partnership, a trap that can summon any 1500 def spellcaster from hand or gy and if you control 2 or more face-up monsters with a different attribute, it becomes non targeting face-up removal as well. This can also be used to summon both Eccelsia, Zoroa, etc who is also in this deck. So what you get is a consistency engine from magicians souls with doubles as both extenders and draw power, A blanket negate all activated monster effects in the gy on a passive effect from gravekeeper's shaman and a powerful removal trap that doesn't target and can be used to summon other cards if needed. This combo is very strong against any deck the uses a lot of monster effects in the gy. This namely includes Tearlament which when timed right (likely after a large mill or they've normal summoned) can end the Tearlaments player's entire game.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous's use is more simple since she is both an extender and a soft super poly enabler by summoning Fallen of Albaz from the hand or deck, making her an amazing surprise option and double removal that can potnetially not eat up your normal going 2nd and removal 2 monsters at once if Ecclesia is summoned using possessed partnership. Incredible Ecclesia also lets the deck run the Albaz fusion monster line up which is very strong as a whole and gives the deck more options and even lets you summon or search Dogmatika monsters by sending titaniklad the ash dragon off of the effect of mirrorjade the iceblade dragon after summoning it by using an oppenets extra deck monster.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Overall the deck is a lot more powerful then it let's on and makes the best use of all the 1500 defence spellcasters has released over the years </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>and the support that Konami released with the Charmers structure deck</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> to make a deck with tons of options, adaptability and tech options that can take on even the strongest of meta decks </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>thanks to how powerful it&rsquo;s lock down can potentially can be and it will only get better as Konami releases more spellcaster themes and cards with the prized 1500 def stat line.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>"

Literally any strategy that uses a spell or trap card can start to build advantage with these cards. The extra cards do add up, overwhelming your opponent until they have nothing left. Unfortunately their ceiling was unjustifiably capped, they weren't xenophobic but with no modern, generic, fiend support they had no true way of recovering if your opponent could overwhelm your interactions...</p><p>But um these Labrynth cards are like really good. They have an actual win condition and are pretty consistent in achieving said condition. Beyond being good, they provide generic fiend support... and they mainly run through trap cards... you see where I'm going with this?</p><p>Beyond the already amazing Labrynth, the new ~Muckraker From the Underworld adds a huge amount of flexibility and recovery to the deck. With it we can use a Tour Guide to get into a Musket names and get off to the races.</p><p>I was having a lot of fun with this concept, it was very powerful, very flexible and very fun. Playing it made me feel blissful almost serene in a way. And then I had an idea that damned this deck to hell. Because we have quite a few ways in engine to trigger a Kelbek or Agido... and the recovery of these cards are pretty insane between cards like ~Big Welcome Labrynth or ~Labrynth Set-Up and ~Magical Musketeer Wild or ~Magical Musketeer Doc... so if we were to oh I don't know discard a copy of Keblek off a Muckraker and mill 5 cards... we'd essentially have a second hand to work with in theory.</p><p>This story is why I bring my sins before you. I tried to make it cool by adding in a little artifact package to add more fairy names and keeping in line with the trap theme. :)&nbsp;</p><p>Replays:</p><p>LV8 OTK<br /><a>https://duelingnexus.com/replay/9748c847-c5f2-40c6-9d96-94470999f214</a></p><p>VW<br /><a>https://duelingnexus.com/replay/bca7cf03-c04d-4d64-be0e-ff44b1d01349</a></p><p>Sky Strikers</p><p><a>https://duelingnexus.com/replay/6a8d3406-8063-43b2-84b8-dc2fc2526314</a></p>"

Yes, Fossil Tear is an overhwlemingly stronger deck, but Fossils are just as fond of having their monsters sent to the Graveyard by card effect. This deck was named after one of the most famous fossil specimens in America: Sue, one of the largest and most complete <em>Tyrannosaurus Rex</em> skeletons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Strategy-wise, this deck still prefers to go second, especially due to the 9 hand traps, 2 copies of Lightning Storm and 1 Harpies' Feather Duster. However, the Level 4 EARTH Fairies all provide you with 2 options for Rank 4s. Minerva the Exalted Lightsworn can mill 3 cards for potential Graveyard setup, and Bagooska can be summoned in Defense Position as a potential floodgate. This means if you need to go first, you can sit on Bagooska to lock your opponent's monster effects down for a turn or two.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the best cards in the deck is Aussa the Earth Channeler. She can discard herself and another EARTH monster to search an EARTH monster with 1850 or less ATK. If the other monster that got discarded was Agido or Kelbek, you can then activate their Graveyard effects to mill 5 cards. If you use Aussa's search effect, you can't activate the effects of non-EARTH monsters for the turn, which means you won't be able to use either of Minerva's effects.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And your best normal summon for this deck is Mathematician, since he can mill a Level 4 or lower monster upon Normal Summon. This means you can mill Weathering Soldier to search Fossil Fusion or a card that mentions it, Shell Knight to search Gaia Plate the Earth Giant, or Agido/Kelbek to mill 5 cards. The best part is that Mathematician has less than 1850 ATK and is an EARTH monster, which means that Aussa the Earth Channeler can search him.&nbsp;</p>"

Need to see her in the opening so theres many ways of getting to her with Small World, Pot of Extravagance and Branded in High Spirits.</p><p>Optimal opener is probably Cartesia + Schmietta + Creation + any other witchcrafter spell. Ends on Vice Master, Verre, Bystreet, Golem Aruru in hand with an incoming Haine on your opponents turn.</p><p>Kinda need to go first because this deck cannot play through negates 9 out of 10 times.</p><h2>Deck Breakdown</h2><h3>Main Deck</h3><p><strong>1x Witchcrafter Golem Aruru: </strong>Good card, uncommon piece of interaction that many decks aren't prepared for, no need to have more than 1.</p><p><strong>1x Witchcrafter Madame Verre: </strong>The ""boss"" of the deck, almost every game the aim is to sit on this card, 1 copy is all you need.</p><p><strong>1x Witchcrafter Haine: </strong>Solid card, secondary summon to Verre.</p><p><strong>1x Witchcrafter Edel:</strong> Decent card, there are times when you open a big Witchcrafter and cartesia so having Vice-Madam summon Edel to reborn them comes up often enough to include her.</p><p><strong>3x Witchcrafter Schmietta:</strong> Best small witchcrafter, easy 3 of.</p><p><strong>3x Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous:</strong> The way to Vice-Madam, need to see her as often as possible.</p><p><strong>1x Witchcrafter Pittore:</strong> Not very good, mainly used for the witchcrafter name but grave effect can be useful in some turn 1s.</p><p><strong>1x Witchcrafter Potterie:</strong> Worst small witchcrafter, if Vice-Madame is on your field your hand probably won't be empty. Only played for more names for small world and Vice-Madame.</p><p><strong>3x Witchcrafter Genni:</strong> Close second to Schmietta, another easy 3 of.</p><p><strong>1x Witchcrafter Bystreet: </strong>Pretty decent card, mostly searched by Schmietta so one copy is fine.</p><p><strong>1x Witchcrafter Scroll:</strong> Bad card, played for the Witchcrafter name.</p><p><strong>1x Instant Fusion:</strong> Pretty good in this deck, Restrict can be used as a hand trap negate or as fodder for Vice-Master. If your hand is really bad you can just discard it for one of the small witchcrafter's cost.</p><p><strong>3x Pot of Extravagance:</strong> Digger for cards, preferred over desires because of the many one of's in the main deck.</p><p><strong>1x Ready Fusion:</strong> Fodder for Vice-Master or discard material. Could maybe be increased depending on consistency of getting to Vice-Madame.</p><p><strong>1x Reasoning: </strong>Mills for witchcrafter spells and traps and put up and extra body which this deck can struggle at doing.</p><p><strong>3x Small World:</strong> A way to get to Cartesia or any other monster if your hands good enough, everyone's a spellcaster.</p><p><strong>1x Witchcrafter Collaboration:</strong> Bad card, only played for the Witchcrafter name.</p><p><strong>1x Witchcrafter Confusion Confession:</strong> Bad card, look at Branded Fusion, only played for the Witchcrafter name.</p><p><strong>3x Witchcrafter Creation: </strong>Good card, searches all your Witchcrafters. Either used to get the Schmietta to hand or to search Golem and trigger Vice-Madame.</p><p><strong>3x Witchcrafter Holiday:</strong> Pretty decent card, playing 3 helps the stickiness of the big Witchcrafters.</p><p><strong>1x Branded in High Spirits: </strong>Good card, used to search the Cartesia.</p><p><strong>2x Chaos Scepter Blast: </strong>Really good piece of removal, probably the most cut-able card if you want more defensive options from hand traps.</p><p><strong>1x Witchcrafter Draping:</strong> Bad card, only used for the Witchcrafter name.</p><p><strong>1x Witchcrafter Unveiling: </strong>Bad card only used for the Witchcrafter name.</p><p><strong>1x Witchcrafter Patronus:</strong> Okay card, searches your spells and recycles your banished monsters. Searchable with a Schmietta dump and Vice-Master add. Better used to add banished spells from Genni's effect to hand.</p><h3>Extra Deck</h3><p>3 copies of the important ones because of the Extravagance. If you opt for Desires instead then you'll have more space here but Witchcrafters tend not to use the extra deck that much anyway.</p><p><strong>3x Master of Chaos:</strong> Branded in High Spirits target.</p><p><strong>3x Witchcrafter Vice-Madame:</strong> The actual boss of the deck, does a lot in speeding up the usual Witchcrafter plays while adding a little more power.</p><p><strong>3x Sanwich:</strong> Ready fusion target. If you increase ready fusion in the main deck then add more targets here, swap out the link monsters.</p><p><strong>3x Milenium eyes Restrict:</strong> Instant fusion target, monster effect negate or fodder for Vice-Madame.</p><p><strong>1x Black luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos:</strong> Can sometimes come up in a more drawn out game where you need a sticky monster. You can revive back your Verre/Haine that you used to make this.</p><p><strong>1x Underworld Goddess of the Closed World:</strong> Vice-Madame can rack up a lot of monsters on field quickly, use them to go into this if your opponent sits on any hard to remove monsters.</p><p><strong>1x Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians:</strong> Revive your spellcasters.</p><h3>Side Deck</h3><p>These are some options that you might see in a regular Witchcrafter list or just some good tech options.</p><p><strong>Magicalized Fusion:</strong> Prefered Cartesia as the way to Vice-Master because she can be searched easier than Magicalized Fusion.</p><p><strong>Secret Village of the</strong> <strong>Spellcasters: </strong>Stops your opponent from activiating spells but then the only way to trigger Vice-Madame is your own monsters, limiting your timing options. Also always the potential of locking yourself.</p><p><strong>Magician Souls:</strong> Really only helps in later turns with card advantage and there was enough spellcaster fodder for Vice-Madame.</p><p><strong>Chaos Scepter Blast:&nbsp;</strong>Like I said in the main deck part, a really good removal option so if you want one more then knock yourself out.</p><p><strong>Spell Chronicle Package:</strong>&nbsp;Banishing 5 Witchcrafter spells then drawing them off Patronus feels really broken, but it's too slow and with Vice-Master recycling even just 1 or 2 Witchcrafter spells is really easy now. Without Spell Chronicle, I also cut Foolish Burial Goods and Metalfoes Fusion. The draw 1 or dump a Witchcrafter spell/trap just wasn't worth including. 3rd best package here.</p><p><strong>Magician's Restage Package:</strong>&nbsp;This package was cut half for lack of space and half for lack of good ways to get Restage into the grave. Without Foolish Burial Goods and Magician Souls you are left with Reasoning and discarding for the small Witchcrafters cost and opening hand space is already tight. To me this is the second best package to put into the main deck from these side deck options.</p><p><strong>Defensive Package:</strong> Called by, Crossout and Handtraps. This deck loses, hard, to ash or a monster negate on Cartesia. If your wanting a slightly more competitive version then swap in these cards. I'd take out the offensive Chaos Scepter Blast and go over the 40 cards but you can mess about with the ratios that you like best. The best package from here to improve the deck list.</p><p><strong>Optimal Combo</strong></p><p>Thought I'd layout the combo with the ""best"" hand I mentioned above.</p><p>Normal Cartesia</p><p>Cartesia Effect to Fusion Vice-Madame using herself and Schmietta.</p><p>Activate Creation, chain Vice-Madame to special a Witchcrafter</p><p>Summon a small witchcrafter, search Golem Aruru</p><p>Schmietta effect in grave, Chain Vice-Madame to add Creation back to hand.</p><p>Schmietta dump Bystreet or Holiday (if you have Bystreet in hand)</p><p>Small Witchcrafter effect, discarding your other Witchcrafter spell</p><p>Special Witchcrafter Madame Verre</p><p>End Phase, add spells back to hand/spell trap zone</p><p>End board should be Vice-Madame, Verre, Bystreet + 2 Witchcrafter spells and Golem Aruru in hand with 1 other card that you opened.

The whole idea is to find fast ways to get your main cards (Dark magician and chaos monsters) on the field to tap into your extra deck, to cut off your opponents support lines.&nbsp;</p><p>THE HOPEFUL WAY THAT IT WORKS:&nbsp;</p><p>A starting hand of spells and traps that allow you to get dark magicians out of your deck and onto the field ASAP. A good combination to have is having Secret Village of The Spellcasters with any of your spellcaster monsters (i.e. Dark Magician) on the field to stop your opponent from using spells. (Credits to HypeUp for the card idea). ((Use with risk of losing monsters and not being able to use spell cards). After your dark magicians are on the field, you can either start linking summoning to build up to someone like Black Luster Soldier-Soldier of Chaos or Underworld Godess of the Closed World. Added in for some extra umph and support is Ebon Illusion and Ebon High magician if your into XYZ, and some generally powerful fusion cards. Once beatstick negate cards are on the field,&nbsp; take control of the board and take the win.&nbsp;</p><p>EXTRA GOODIES JUST IN CASE:</p><p>In case the deck bricks and you get a poor starting hand, I added 1 Magikuriboh to get Dark Magician back onto the field, and a personal favorite spell card of mine, Piercing The Darkness. The idea is if you can't really get into your extra deck, to have eternal soul on the field combined with your Dork Magicians. That way, you can at least&nbsp; hope to out muscle your opponent while waiting for the opprotunity to get back into your extra deck.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for using this deck if your interested, let me know what you think or if I should go back and revise anything! -D1pyy</p>"

Summon all the signer dragons turn 1. Also, I put in a bunch of upgrades to the dragon, just in case you don't get the combo pieces, and synchron explorer for follow-up plays. You may switch out Synchron explorer, Life Stream dragon, Power tool braver dragon, (if you do, switch out Moon mirror shield) shooting star dragon, Accel synchron, Starlight Junction, Hot red dragon Archfiend abyss, Or phantasmal lord for any card(s) you wish.&nbsp; Also, if you want, you may switch out scarlight red dragon archfiend for red dragon archfiend/ hot red dragon archfiend, blackfeather darkrage for black-winged dragon, or black rose moonlit dragon for black rose dragon, I just found them more useful in most situations. Here's the combo</p><p><br />Junk converter and any tuner+ any of the level 2s I put in the deck+ - All signer dragons.</p><p>First, your gonna wanna use junk converter to add junk synchron from the deck to hand, then normal summon it and use it's effect to special summon Junk converter from the graveyard. If you have Synchron carrier, normal summon that first. If you have caligo crow or Doppel warrior, special summon them. next, synchro summon junk speeder using junk synchron and the level 2 you special summoned In your extra monster zone, and special summon Stardust synchron, junk synchron, and assault synchron. Use Stardust Synchron's effect to add Stardust illumination from your deck to your hand, then use it to send stardust tail from your deck to your graveyard. next use assault warrior and junk speeder to synchro summon Black rose dragon, then use jet synchron to synchro summon black-winged Dragon using itself and Black rose dragon, in your extra monster zone. use jet Synchron's effect to add junk servant to your hand, then special summon it. Use stardust synchron and junk servant to synchro summon scarlight red dragon archfiend. Use stardust Synchron's effect to tribute scarlight red dragon archfiend and special summon itself. use assault warrior to special summon it back to the field and use stardust tail to special summon itself. use stardust synchron and stardust tail to synchro summon stardust dragon and use the stardust tails effect to special summon a token. Use junk converter and Junk synchron to summon Dark Dimension Soldier. Then use junk converters effect to special summon Junk synchron back from the graveyard. Activate Stardust illumination in your grave to banish it and increase the tokens level by one. Then use the token and Junk synchron to Synchro summon Garden Rose maiden. Use dark dimension's effect to special summon assault synchron from your banish zone, then use it to synchro summon Power tool dragon. Use power tool dragons effect to search Fleuret de fluer.

Also helps with link plays given you have so many monsters on main phase 2. One card that may do well on this deck is Apolloua, if you prefer that card over something like Berserker of the Tenyi or Bagooska. Accesscode is a bit difficult to make cause it requires effect monsters, so that can also be switched out for something else. If you like any rank 4s that require 3 xyz material, it's easy to get those out as well. Bagooska is mostly meant for stalling until your next turn when you can finish off your opponent. If you wanna play Gagaga Cowboy, that's an option, though it doesn't deal enough to finish them off, usually.</p><p>A few decent cards, if you don't like Doom Dozer or Aztekipede, are Beetrooper Sting Lancer and Tree Crown Armorperor Beagram. Sting Lancer might be a decent option for going second, which is the entirety of this deck, as well as anti-some-GY-effects. Beagram is good for protecting ballpark, or just a free special summon.</p>"

Use Buster Whelp or trap tricks to get your prolonged. Use that effect to get Buster Dragon to the field. In really good situations you can use a combo move of Destruction sword fusion &amp; your opponents material to get the Buster Blader fusion monster out. or use sage with eyes of blue to either search buster whelp or sack The Maiden with eyes of blue to spam out 2 Blue-eyes which opens up the option to go into Number 100 Numeron Dragon for a massive 9000 damage! We also have the Branded Fusion which allows you to use the aforementioned monsters to create powerful fusion dragons of the Albaz archtype. I find going for Bastard of Ashen Dragon by using Buster Blader or Blue-Eye Jet Dragon to help with getting some monsters in the grave &amp; make a pretty strong turn one monster. It used to have Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King of Calamity in the Main but I moved it to the extra deck becuase it was just one of the cards that was relativley easy to summon if I start with Prolog &amp; Chain Resonator, but it just isn't as versitile as the other extra deck cards. You can readd it if you want. I'm not living &amp; dying with the XYZ monsters in the extra deck. They are nice in certain cercomstances but maybe aren't worth the 3 slots they use up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, I'm sure people could refine this deck even better because I am not very good at deck building. This deck is far from perfect but I genuenly enjoy playing with this deck.</p>"

This deck has <strong>5 starter pieces</strong> that also play into one another whilst being and having decent exstenders giving this deck a lot of synergy, you are <strong>primarily</strong> going for <strong>E</strong><strong>xosister boss monsters</strong> due to the <strong>restrictions</strong> from <em><strong>martha</strong></em> and <em><strong>vadis</strong></em> however there are times when you do need magistus monsters, as <strong><em>each magistus</em></strong> monster can<strong> steal, negate, or destroy </strong>Extra Deck Monsters&nbsp;and spell/trap cards. The magistus boss monster isn't half bad either as it can be a big beat stick and <strong>shut down</strong> plays from extra deck cards based off the card that is attached to it. Alternative Boss monster for this deck are Quintet magician and Underworld goddess, as one is a <strong>board wipe</strong> and <strong>can't be destroyed by card effects</strong> while the other can <strong>negate and stall and tribute</strong> your opponent's monster, works really well with I:P as you can cause disruption during your opponent's turn. Honnorable mentions for disruptive/boss monsters are ruddy rose or Chengying as they can help out by puting use into Dimension shifter if you see him in your hand whilst having cards in your graveyard. Chengying is a good general card and ruddy rose can possibly give Dimension shifter more value as it does bannish all cards in both gys, it could also take advantge of having sauge de fleur or evil thorn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Combo Plays:</p><p>Litterally everything can combo into eachother, just be mindful when using Martha or Vadis as they lock you into exosister for the turn, General combos are:</p><p>S.Summon Martha and xyz summon into kaspitell or mikails (your preference) add pax and elis for guareenteed magnifica or for extended plays</p><p>N.summon zoroa, S.Summon another 4* spellcaster from your hand Synchro summon your boss magistus monster or extenders/negates, OR xyz summon Kaspitell or Mikailis, Grab pax to get martha, or just get martha with kaspitell, Xyz summon your opposite option use effect to grab another extender for later, Xyz summon mikailis and Kaspitell into Magnifica.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With Rillionia, same thing as zoroa except you&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;<strong>to&nbsp;</strong>grab trimagistus</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>with summoner monk, same thing as Zoroa except you <strong>Have to</strong> have a spell card in your hand</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, summoning the alternative boss monsters is harder but can be a game changer in your duel.</p><p>For <em><strong>Ruddy rose</strong></em> and <em><strong>Chengying</strong></em> You have to have a <strong>normal summon open</strong> and have zoroa on the field or S.Summoned with Trimagistus or monk (who should be on the field already or is also S.Summoned by Trimagistus) then tribute Monk or another monster S.Summoned by Monk or Zoroa With Dimesion Shifter then, synchro into those monsters.</p><p>For <strong>Quintet Magician</strong> very <em><strong>rewarding</strong></em> to summon but it is the <strong>hardest</strong> to summon, and unless you can play and search or have magicalized fusion in your hand ready your going to have a hard time with this one. If you plan to use magicalized fusion I recomend playing <em><strong>1-2</strong>&nbsp;</em>Keeper of dragon magic as he is a lv 4 and can search ""fusion"" or ""Polymerization"" but he is a&nbsp;<em><strong>Dragon</strong></em> which can ruin ur magistus plays. If playing without keeper you need Zoroa and/or Monk and/or Rillionia, a non-copy 4* spellcaster, trimagistus, and a throw away spell card. there are exceptions depending on your hand variation which I will go over.</p><p>if you <strong>Don't </strong>have zoroa:</p><p>Activate trimagistus, S.Summon Rillionia or Monk and nomral summon the other, use both effect to grab fusion spell card and Zoroa, use Zoroa effect to equip artemis, S.Summon 4*star W/ zoroa effect, use artemis to grab crowley, then Fusion Summon.</p><p>if you&nbsp;<strong>Don't</strong> have Rillionia:</p><p>Samething as before just switching places with Rillionia and Zoroa.</p><p>if you <strong>Don't&nbsp;</strong>have monk, you must have 2 4* spellcasters or 1 and a Pax instead of a throw away spell:</p><p>activate Trimagistus, S.summon Rillionia or zoroa normal summon the other, equip artemis, use artemis to grab crowley, use Rillionia to grab fusion spell, fusion summon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Weaknesses: Hand traps Go BRRR on this deck, back row cards do get annoying but are much easier to deal with. Going with the Alternate Boss summons, depending on what your summoning, is quite the risk as it can and will burn through ur mats from your hand, field, and/or graveyard. In my opinion with the way I've made this deck tho its somewhat comfortable going second and having Dimension shifter turn 0/1 works wonders against your opponent and their hand traps. you could also run carpedivem to negate monster effects with each xyz summon and add another layer of protection to your exosister and spell/trap removal.</p>"

The Liquid Soldier can help you dig for a Reload or Shell allowing you to dump either into the grave, and Shell can be used as a fusion material for Nova Master. Volcanic Doomfire is mostly in the deck because it's hilarious and an easy discard fodder or fusion material if you can't keep Reload on field, though if you are it does close out games along side Absolute Zero and Nova Master.</p><p>I made this deck in the hopes MBT would see it.

Now in the new BROL set we get a very intersting card that helps boost consistency.</p><p>The main principle of the build is limiting the amount of bricks played and increasing consistency as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>This should explain many of the ratio choices. And without delay let's analyze some of them:</p><p>Elemental HERO Stratos: Now most people that bother with HEROes, know that Stratos is a mandatory 3off. Well they aren't wrong but limiting our copies of Stratos helps reducing our normal summon slots and increases our lets say ""flex spot"" for adding more consistency boost cards. Apart from that with the release of EN Shuffle we have one more way to go to Stratos if needed and thus we limit his copies.</p><p>Elemental HERO Shadow Mist: Shadow Mist is a classic 2off in Omni HERO decks. However, Neos decks have one more way apart from Foolish Burial or Vision HERO Vyon to mill Shadow Mist, that way being EN - Engage Neo-Space. Well in the Ishizu format Shadow Mist is really important since she's able to search Mask Change with her effect, so you may want to increase her copies. Keep in mind though, that the deck can get to work with even 1 copy.</p><p>Elemental HERO Spirit of Neos: In my opinion, this dude is the best card in the deck. He can search most of the cards we need for our combos (Neos Fusion, Instant Contact, Favorite Contact, Engage Neo-Space and EN Shuffle) and that's why he is at 3. This is also the reasoning behind the ratios of Neos Fusion, Instant Contact and Favorite Contact. Apart from that don't you guys worry when it comes to summon him, since Cross-Keeper, Engage Neo-Space and EN Shuffle exist.</p><p>Elemental HERO Brave Neos / Dark Neos / Grand Neos / Air Neos: The first 3 guys are targets for Neos Fusion since they let us mill Neos and a Neo-Spacian monster and use them as Favorite Contact fodder. Dark Neos more specifically is also a good target for Instant Contact since he can provide fodder for Mask Change and lead to Dark Law, or even negate some monster effect&nbsp; (with his own effect). Air Neos on the other hand exists in the extra deck as a finisher and he is summoned solely by Instant Contact (providing that Neos is on the field or in the GY)</p><p>Concerning the side deck, to be honest it's a really hard case. As you can see most of the deck consists of engine cards and thus siding is hard. All the choices, are cards that can help keep the meta decks in check. In general though keep in my mind that Bystial cards are the ones damaging HEROes more.</p><p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy playing the deck and as always we are open to suggestions on how to make the build better!</p>"

I was intrigued by their Egyptian design, and by Zolga's connection to Obelisk in particular<span class=""TextRun SCXW252036371 BCX0"" lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" data-contrast=""auto""><span class=""NormalTextRun SCXW252036371 BCX0"">&mdash;</span></span>being one of the three monsters depicted in the art for the spell <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=5253985"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/5253985.jpg"" data-card=""5253985"" data-name=""Soul Crossing"">Soul Crossing</span></a>. Like the Monarchs, Zolga has a tribute-specific effect, albeit a thoroughly underwelming one. Still, he wanted to be sacrificed for something, and he wanted there to be other Fairy monsters in play... maybe there was a way to fit Obelisk into some kind of Egyptian-themed Fairy deck? I thought that would be pretty perfect.</p><p>But after constructing and discarding a number of unquestionably terrible decks that looked like the old swarm-and-stall builds I used to try with the Egyptian Gods, I had to give up on that idea. The pieces just weren't there. I went back to the Monarchs build, imperfect though it was.</p><p>THEN something called the Tin of the Pharaoh's Gods came out, and unleashed upon the world two new Obelisk cards: <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=85182315"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/85182315.jpg"" data-card=""85182315"" data-name=""The Breaking Ruin God"">The Breaking Ruin God</span></a> and <a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=79339613"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/79339613.jpg"" data-card=""79339613"" data-name=""Soul Energy MAX!!!"">Soul Energy MAX!!!</span></a>&nbsp;(three exclamation points, that's right.) These two cards were clearly designed to be used together to warp Obelisk onto the battlefield, feed him two tributes, and then deliver a downright nuclear payload of field-clearing, graveyard-obliterating, player-burning damage for game.</p><p>I added them to the Monarchs deck, and when that combo worked, it was glorious. Absolutely glorious. The deck was already running <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=35726888"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/35726888.jpg"" data-card=""35726888"" data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</span></a>, which worked nicely enough with the fact that both cards have in-graveyard effects, but it wasn't reliable. In fact, the deck was performing worse than ever. Having cut six cards to make room for two new three-ofs, the deck was now a mangled build of two different strategies that barely overlapped and mostly just got in each other's way.</p><p>So I started looking around for a new home for the big blue smashy God, and I remembered <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=31525442"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/31525442.jpg"" data-card=""31525442"" data-name=""Zolga the Prophet"">Zolga the Prophet</span></a>.

I took a look at the new Ishizu cards, and I started to get this feeling. I didn't really believe it would work at first, but the more I read and reread this bizarre set of cards that depended completely on one of the most laughably pointless cards in the game, the more I started to think this could be an Obelisk deck.</p><p>So, I put it together. I playtested it on duelingnexus.com, and... it works. It works perfectly. At this point, I have no doubt that these cards were designed with each other in mind.

However, I do enjoy making dumb things, so here we go.</p><p>I like plunder and think that the resource loop as well as lockless interaction on the opponents turn seems to add harder negates and such to tear which at is very fluid but sometimes may need something extra. Plunder negates, shuffling back plunders for lys fusion, using blackbeard to tag things out, just a lot of little incidental synergies I think might be interesting to explore.</p><p>Firstly, card reasoning. Tear is brazy so no explanation there. I cut down the package a little because I want to try and fit a slightly more robust plunder lineup. Dangers are here for extra bodies, interaction, and just generally more ways to get plunder/tear moving. Decided to stick with the four stars only for extra opportunities for dweller or bagoozka as needed. Perlieno is expensive and I don't own it so would only buy one. You can defintley mix numbers around, cut dangers for ishizu, etc etc. However, this is where I am at.</p><p>Secondly, why this. I think this legit does have something decks right now not might have, which is hard negates with BEEG MONSTA's. Plunder was always weird due to handtraps. However, way less handtraps now, plus the fact that you can still use the plunder portion of the deck under abyss dweller and shifter seems kind of neat.</p><p>Third, what can this do? Currently still in the hard idea phase here, but for example: xenolock into plunders on your turn, get a blackbeard on board with a plunder in hand at the very least. Say you have one more tear in hand. Activate blackbeard to tag into a ship on their turn, no xenolock, so you just get to play the entire deck(just keep track of whitebeard as that's the one hard lock on your opponents turn you have). Cartesia is an infinite fusion loop, so why not have that for lys as well for another option! also, instant fusion for mudragon is a water 4 star that does stuff, so another great addition to the toolbox. Yes floo is scary cause of wind, but that's why we have everything else.</p><p>I'm still playing around with this for funsies, but feel free to krib this and make something actually good and lmk how it goes, would love to see if plunder can hang before windship!</p>"

The Invincible! The Unbeatable! Brick Eyes! :D,"<p><strong>This deck build of Blue-Eyes is mainly about Fusion Summoing</strong>, but <strong>it can still play just as a standard build of Blue-eyes as well</strong>. You're main focus is to go into<strong> your boss monster Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon </strong>you can go into <strong>Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon</strong>, but <strong>its risky and should only be done </strong>when you know<strong> you've got game</strong> <strong>and/or</strong> <strong>destroy your opponents cards</strong> to get through their ""Defences"" by <strong>OTKing them like normal</strong>. You'll be summoning<strong> Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon</strong> &amp; adding your <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</strong> in <strong>hand</strong> or setting them up <strong>in your Graveyard</strong>. Your <strong>Spell card</strong> <strong>Ultimate Fusion</strong> will <strong>shufflle </strong>your Blue-Eyes to the deck to summon out which ever Fusion you need, by doing this you get to also<strong> destroy face-up cards </strong>your opponent controls<strong> </strong>up to the number of <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon used from the field as material</strong> which is neet. To search out your Fusion card you'll be using <strong>Bingo Machine, Go!!! </strong>this card<strong> can also search out the rest of your Blue-Eyes cards</strong> that you may need <strong>IF it meets the criteria listed below</strong>, but this<strong> by chance</strong> since your opponent <strong>picks one of the three cards you chosen randomly</strong>. Your<strong> fairly common Extra deck plays</strong> will be <strong>Linkuriboh </strong>&amp; <strong>Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon</strong>. Linkuriboh helps by having <strong>something on board</strong> if you can't Synchro Summon Spirit Dragon at the <strong>start of the due</strong>l &amp; sends any of your <strong>Level 1 monsters</strong> mainly <strong>the eggs</strong> to the GY like <strong>The White Stone of Legend or&nbsp;</strong><strong>The White Stone of </strong><strong>Ancients</strong> if you need a Blue-Eyes monster in <strong>Hand or on Field</strong>. Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon helps by interacting with<strong> your opponents plays in GY or on Field</strong> with a good defense stat it can also go into your other<strong> Light Dragon Type Synchro Monsters</strong> if needed. Your only Trap card <strong>Ultimate Creature of Destruction </strong>is a great way to protect your Blue-Eyes monster from <strong>battle or by card effects</strong> since it makes it <strong>Unaffected</strong> by card effects except its own <strong>for a turn,</strong> it's also a good <strong>discard foder</strong> for <strong>The Meladoy of Awakening Dragon</strong> or <strong>Twin Twisters</strong> since it will <strong>come back</strong> to be a <strong>one time use</strong>&nbsp;at least if you <strong>Normal or Special Summon</strong> a Blue-Eyes White Dragon, but it <strong>banishes itself</strong> when it leaves the field. I'll point out one of our imposter in the Extra Deck that is <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong>, seems like it doesn't fit because <strong>how are we able to summon it</strong> since its a <strong>level 8 requiring 1 Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner Synchro Monsters</strong>. Well it's <strong>simple</strong> by having <strong>Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon</strong> around we can <strong>use its effect during our turn</strong> to <strong>Tribute itself</strong> to bring out our other Synchro monster <strong>Black Rose Moonlight Dragon or Ancient Fairy Dragon</strong>. By having <strong>Moonlight Dragon</strong> on the Field and <strong>Normal or Special Summoning a level 1 Tuner monster with Monster Reborn</strong> Synchro Summoning it or with <strong>Fairy Dragon</strong> effect by Special Summoning a <strong>level 4 or lower monster in your hand</strong>, but mainly it would be <strong>best to go first </strong>with this setup due to you <strong>giving up your Battle phase</strong> because of Fairy Dragon effect &amp; <strong>you can't attack</strong> anyways because you're going first. Also if you Synchro using <strong>The Whiite Stone of Ancient</strong> you can just Special Summon <strong>Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon</strong> pairing Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon during the <strong>End Phase </strong>providing <strong>protection of destruction effect </strong>to your cards <strong>on field except itself so keep that in mind</strong>. Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon is good <strong>with monster negation &amp; gaining ATK if battling a Level 5 or higher monster</strong>. <strong>One final tip</strong> for the deck, if you stumble upon a <strong>Skill Drain like card</strong> &amp; don't draw into your Twisters to out it then <strong>use Dragon Spirit of White to Banish it</strong>. But simply <strong>""how""</strong> may you ask, well as long as <strong>these requirements meet in this situation</strong>; Your opponent <strong>must control a monster</strong> for this to work, and have <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon in hand</strong>, you'll simply need to <strong>summon</strong> Dragon Spirit of White to then <strong>attempt to Banish</strong> that Skill Drain card to <strong>then Chain</strong> on top of your summon to then<strong> tag out</strong> your Blue-Eyes in hand tributing Spirit of White to the GY <strong>since its no longer on the field</strong> the effect resolves <strong>without issue since </strong>Skill Drain wasn't able to get to it because <strong>it left the field by tribute</strong>. That is all, if you<strong> liked</strong> the Deck Profile, <strong>Please leave a Like &amp; Comment</strong>. You may also<strong> feel free</strong> to add me on <strong>Discord</strong> if you have <strong>any</strong> <strong>questions</strong>, <strong>NEXUS#6644</strong></p>"

Cyberdark Chimera and Cybernetic Horizon help make this deck's OTK combo much more consistent, and the Therion King, along with Cyber Dragon Infinity, makes going first plays more viable when forced into them by your opponent. Powerbond is a flavor win as well as a great payoff for our boss monster, Chimerateck Rampage Dragon. With the buff from Sieger, you can deal a total of 18900 damage with just this one monster. A few tips for playing with this deck, Use your excess spells, such as Lightning storm and Raigeki, as well as Cyberdark Realm at times, to bait out negates. This allows you to open up the field for your actual combo, which is vulnerable to Ash and the chain-blocking options available for this deck are sub-optimal. Optimal play is Normal core get Horizon, send Herz and Chimera to grave off of Horizon, which will let you send Cyber Eternity to grave as well. Payoff is getting Nachster and OG Cyber Dragon to hand, discard CD to Nachster effect and SS Nachster and Chimera in Defense Position. Discard any spell or trap in hand to add power bond from deck to hand, you may now FS from grave as material cause of Chimera. Now link summon Sieger using Nachster and Chimera, banish eternity to protect your Fusions for a turn, activate power bond using Cyber dragon and Nachster as material making 4200 attack Rampage, activate Rampage effect send two Light Machines from deck to grave, giving it two additional attacks this battle.

This deck aims to bring the most imaginative summoning method to the forefront yet again!,"<p>This consistent Pendulum deck tries to (most importantly) get two monsters on the field to summon ""Beyond the Pendulum"". After this, the deck simply summons a lot of monsters and summons big negates. ""Beyond the Pendulum"" also neagtes the effects of cards in the pendulum scales, allowing the use of ""Performapal Monkeyboard"" without it being a scale 4. The number of spells played in the deck facilitates ""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"", and if you draw duplicates then the ""Magicians' Souls"" engine helps a lot. ""Instant Fusion"" is a free extender, which in combination with ""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"" can summon a copy of ""El Shaddoll Winda"" that will not be destroyed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pros: Doesn't die to ""Bystial"" monsters, boards are consistent to make and hard to break, can play through disruptions</p><p>Cons: ""Dark Ruler No More"", floodgates, dealing with an established board at times</p>"

Their mechanic of being Different Dimension Demons gives them really interesting arts fitting of their Arc-V origins. Control, aggro, combo, syncrho, the choices are up to you. This specific deckbuild uses as many functionally relevent D/D cards for you to toy around with. <br /><br />&nbsp;D/D's are surpringly modular as a pendulum deck because they can adjust number of hand traps, the tight extra deck space, and side board. Experiment w/ ratios: Some meta decks use bare core &amp; 15+ hand traps). I think one of the best things about DDD decks is that they have a very linear line of play in each opening hand, but no match will have the same end state on turn one. Look up some other meta decks to find the one you like.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong><u>Main Deck:</u></strong> Your goal is to set the pendulum scale or search stuff with Dark Contracts to go into Link monsters</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Then you can start pendulum summoning to Link arrow zones and Swarm the Board. Otherwise, try to fusion or synchro summon a big board of negates. D/D/D decks are cool in that they include almost every monster type ( with the exception to the niche ones like toons, spirits, gemeni, etc.).&nbsp; D/D decks are some of the most difficult decks to pilot well; Declan Akaba makes the deck look so much easier than it really is. There are spreadsheets and hour-long YouTube videos explaining the combos. Good luck. Deck core below:</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Pendulum monsters (lvl1-4 are essential. Open with these most games) &nbsp;</em></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dd savant Kepler 3x (lvl 1, scale10, 0 atk) (note pendulum scale decreases: destroy or play long game)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (can find with Piri Reis map, one for one, small world, etc. Searches the entire DD engine on summon)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dd savant Copernicus 3x (lvl4 scale1) (send DD monster or Dark Contract with Patent license to GY) versatile</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dd gryphon 3x (lvl4 scale 1) versatile extender/utility (note that as pendulum spell it gives atk boost!)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dd orthros 2x (Pendulum lvl3; stock removal or a special summon): Use to destroy Kepler in Pendulum zone</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that this is a tuner, which can tune up to a lot of good things. Pendulum not restricted to DDs!</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Other pendulum monsters</em>: mostly great extenders, late game cards, Not so good in opening hand</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ddd oblivion king abyss Ragnarok; lvl8 monster (best PENDULUM ability, synchro material, stock removal)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dd savant Thomas (good late game; gets pendulum monsters back and cheats out a lvl8 monster) Also buff!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Non-pendulum DD Monsters</em>: Mostly extend into the extra deck. Varies from tuners to fusions.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dd vice Typhon: Use as synchro material or cheat out flame high Genghis in GY</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dd swirl slime 3x (fusion in hand to get Genghis or any fusion monster) 2x Genghis = rank 6</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dd Necro slime; only works in GY! (fusion extender) Possible foolish burial target along with Lamia.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dd lamia (extender with dark contract esp Patent license in GY). This is the only D/D dark tuner in the deck, so use it wisely. Alternatively, use hand traps as tuners for a more generic synchro lvl 8/10 like Baronne De Fleur</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Non monster cards</em>: Note that many pendulum monsters gives boosts for Dark Contracts in GY and on Field. They are great lore wise because the dark contracts summon the Different Dimension beings, but remember:</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dark contract with the gate 3x: Most essential tutor. You get to search once per turn! Eat/prevent the damage</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dark contract with patent license (send to gy to boost up Lamia, Gryphon etc. Also extra deck punishment)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dark contract with the swamp king (fusion cheater)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ddd headhunt (awesome removal hindered by the fact that it needs a DDD monster, not a DD monster)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dark Contract with eternal darkness* (side deck trap as not all decks need to target or special summon).</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Support/Staples/Side</em>: Archfiend eccentrick (Pendulum monster/removal), your usual Called by the grave, hand traps, etc. Small world is insane. Cosmic Cyclone, Pankrytops (not usually many creatures), Battle traps etc.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For consideration: DD Savant Newton(Scale10/recursion) Dark Contract with Witch, DD Lilith, DDD LaPlace</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong><u>Extra Deck:</u></strong> With Pendulum Decks, you want to link summon so you can start pendulum summoning extra deck monster to Link Monster arrow zones. Monsters can also be pendulum summoned from hand to ANY unoccupied monster zone so long as they are between the pendulum scales. Keep reusing extra deck!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ddd abyss king Gilgamesh 3x (once link summoned you can start your engine) Let your opponent kill it!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ddd flame high king Genghis (spell/trap negate) Genghises also revives DD monsters in GY</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ddd flame king Genghis 2x (get two out and you have a rank 6 which you can go into Caesar</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ddd oracle king d'arc (gains life from Dark contract rather than take damage. Big Saint. Stops burn decks too!)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ddd cursed king Siegfried (lvl8 Synchro summon, stop floodgates, also use it to regain life. Not great&hellip;) Rank8!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ddd King deus machines 2x (busted summon atop ANY DDD monster! Not just XE Summon) Destroy contract</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Use to set the pendulum scale, summon w/ Gilgamesh) Monster steal opponent&rsquo;s monsters in chain.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ddd marksman king tell (XE summon on top of a rank 4. There&rsquo;s no other way to summon this)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ddd wave high king Caesar (XYZ summon to monster reborn GY monsters) (XE Summon or let die to tutor)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Ddd wave king Caesar (lvl6 XYZ Summon). Mostly used to give 1800 atk boost to another DD Monster</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">If you have money to burn, add these generic staples: Baronne de fleur, Divine Arsenal Zeus, Link monsters</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Play this deck based on 40 card deck ratios: 1 card = garnet, a card you want to be able to search out of your deck rather than draw, 3 cards are engine generators, etc. Small world or Piri Reis Map searches for any engine, so try it out. Fear Ash or Effect Veiler or Imfinite Imperm, Nibiru you can try a crossout designator combo.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Pendulum decks are very unique to their own archetype and often have very specific strategies that apply to themselves and are difficult to make pile decks with. Anti-spell fragrance defangs any pendulum deck.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">DDD decks constantly want to extend into the extra deck, so your worst enemy is really Artifact Scythe Lock.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">A good pendulum has around 60-80% pendulum monsters due to the necessity of being able to pendulum summon from hand. Some DDD decks can use the bare minimum core as previously mentioned alongside Crossout Designator but these decks can be bricky. This can be accomplished because DDD decks only need to the link monster Gilgamesh to start the engine.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">You have 3 main goals to accomplish with this deck based on your opening hand: DDD decks really want</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">-Gilgamesh: Once you get 2 DD monsters in the main monster zone, you can link them into Gilgamesh which can Set the pendulum scale to 1/3 and 7/10 to pendulum summon more monsters or bigger monsters: &nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">-Synchro 10: (Baron De Fleur or Beelzeus or Alexander): You&rsquo;d be surprised how often you can get a lvl1 tuner and a total level 9 non tuner monster on the field. Just be sure to Set pendulum scale to Orthros and Keper (3 and 10) but remember to destroy the pendulum scale with Orthos if you do so.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">-Genghis: Use as an extender either to special summon monsters in the GY or just tune up or XYZ summon.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">-Rank monster: Ultimately, once you get one XYZ monster, XEish summon Deviser King Deus Machinex</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">2 Lvl 4&rsquo;s or 2 Lvl6 extra deck monsters is usually the way to go: Rank into Marksman King Tell into Deus</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">-example hand1: Dark Contract, Copernicus, Headhunt, Swirl Slime, Othros. Search for Gryphon to have 2 summons to link into Gilgamesh. Set pendulum scale 1 and 10. Pendulum Summon 2 lvl 4s and a lvl2. Synchro summon a lvl10 boss monster. If Ash Blossomed, Swirl Slime to summon Genghis. Set headhunt. Pass.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">-example hand2: Necro Slime, Vice Typhon, Orthros, Gryphon, Kepler. Multiple routes: 1)Gilgamesh route Kepler + Gryphon. Rank 4s. 2) Pendulum scale Kepler Gryphon. No recover from Vieler, Ash, Imperm.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">2) Typhon Route: Pendulum scale Keper + Orthos. Pendulum Summon Gryphon. Discard Necro Slime, draw 1.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Tribute Summon Vice Typhon, Special Summon Lvl 7 (newton). Link away. Fusion Summon.

In fact, Dinowrestlers only work if they go into combat. It's not like there are ways to return cards to hand, destroy on main phase, banish cards, etc. are there? (Please don't try to build a competitive version of this deck; they don't even work well in formats such as Common Charity).</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Your ultimate goal is to link climb into bigger boss monsters or shotgun out dinowrestler Pankrytops. In most cases, Pankrytops hurls himself at opponent&rsquo;s cards, but in a dinowrestler deck, he can hurl the other dinowrestlers! </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">In order ensure that you actually go into combat, throw in 3 skill drains and maybe a solemn or two. Skill drain got reprinted so much at the end of 2022 that it's affordable!

Half of the dinowrestler are hand trap battle traps that summon themselves and protect your other dinowrestlers.

Otherwise, try to link summon 1 with parallel exceed in hand and shotgun out a link 3. Scareclaw Tri-Heart x1 is pure BS and xenophobic against anything that&rsquo;s not a link monster. World Dino wrestling really doesn&rsquo;t do that much even in a pure build (just use lost world a better combat boost) and really just belongs in the graveyard, so use Extra Foolish Burial. Ultimate Conductor Tyranno and Animadorned Archosaur are just extra boss monsters to deal with because Misc is in the deck and a budget card.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This is one of my casual decks that I&rsquo;ve made as good as possible without overclocking it by using cards such as Forbidden Droplet and hand traps.

The core of a Dino deck is very similiar as is the main strategy: find double evolution pill to special summon Ultimate Conductor Tyranno (UCT) after destroying multiple Babycerasaurus or Petiterandons; use Ultimate Conductor Tyranno to book of moon all your opponent's creatures and smash through them. They get very interesting in how they get there and how they utilize their deck ratios: The entire core of a dino deck can be stripped down all the way to under 20 cards with only 3 or so cards that are needed in the extra deck. Some tournament meta decks strip the core and shove in all the hand traps to watch out for and 3 crossout designators, some people try Dino Albaz, Dino Eldlich, etc. There are so many ways to build dino decks, and anyone who says Dino Dekcs are stale hasn't played enough dinos or just been squashed by UCT too many times. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>This variant of Dinos tries to cover all its bases. uses the scrap engine as extenders and 4 cards for True King as Extenders and the Dinomorphia route as protection. The latter 2 engines are very small but highly synergistic. This Dino deck prefers going 1st just to open a board of floodgates., negates, and destruction. Even though Dino decks can OTK quite easily, this deck does not do well going second against a board of negates or floodgates. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>INDIVIDUAL CARD/ENGINE BREAKDOWN:</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>DINO Engine: </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Main Deck engine</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>DInos need their normal summon and are thus essential to get as much ash bait as possible. <br />Example strategy: Fossil Dig: Find Misc. Discard Miscellaneousaurus to protect your dinosaur monsters. Banish Misc from GY to special summon animadorned Archosaur, destroy dino in hand, find Double Evolition pill. Link Away with a link 1, Banish both a dino and the Link 1 or a hand trap to special summon UCT. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>The strategy can also be accomplished through Souleating Oviraptor, but oviraptor is more prone to Ash and Effect Veiler hand traps and leaves you with a dead board. However, Oviraptor is a level 4 and can be much more versatile on the field for the extra deck. As far as dinos in eggs go, Baby finds almost engine starters, Petite is used to find Dinowrestler Pankrytops or Dogoron for a big body on board. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>&nbsp;SET ROTATION: </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>3 Lost World// Dragonic Diagram // Mystic Mine// Magical Midfield Breaker <br />My philosophy with set rotation is that you should have 5 total fields in the main and side deck where just one terraforming is not enough. Any less is a brick. Set rotation is great for knocking out an Opponent's field spell or preventing them from activating any field spell at all. As such, they can stop decks that need a field spell such as Numerons or field spells that kill dinos such as Necrovalley and Zombie World.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>LOST WORLD </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Lord world is kind of busted. Prevents you from gettting hit with Lightning Storm, evenly matched on turn 1, slows a D/D/D deck in its trail, etc. My favorite play is going first game 2, activating lost world,&nbsp; and then flipping a Rivalry of Warlords I had in the sideboard, locking my opponent into Dinosaur monsters they weren't using.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Mystic Mine helps you build resources and can be knocked out with your own field spell; lord knows when KONAMI will ban it in the TCG</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>TRUE KING: </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>2 Cards </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>True King Lithosagym + Dragonic Diagram: Synergizes with Dinos because they let you destroy monsters as card effect, killing dino babies in hand.

If you get hit with Nibiru or a Raigeki, you have to rely on your backrow as protection. I don't own a Terrizia as of October, but it's a card I want. It was $30 for a while when it got scalped in May after doing well in Master Duel, then stabilized back to $10 a few months later, but it just doesn't do enough for me splash down $10 for the card.

Best when used as a special summon. It&rsquo;s a way to spam out level four creatures for Ranks and Links summons. Scrap Golem x1 can be replaced with Scrap Chimera depending on your build. Usually people use one Golem and One Chimera because once you link away into scrap dragon, you can special summon one golem and keep comboing off. However, Golem is a garnet and the Chimera can easily be used for Rank 4 monsters. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Expensive cards to consider: Link 4 monsters: Appouloussa: Goddess of the Bow: Mainly used to negate Nibiru. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Accesscode Talker + link 3s; surprisingly easy to link climb in this deck. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Side Deck: Strategize going first cards and your typical backrow/Dimensional Barrier cards.
