This deck is pure chaos and I love it. The amount of plays are as endless as the amount of times you will misplay the deck which in my opinion is all the reason I love it. This is the first deck where the more I played the more I wanted to play it just so I could perfect my plays with it. There is something about playing a deck that has so many options that is just so enticing, then piecing together strategies to ultimately make your opponent succumb to your enormous brain is just the Crème de la Crème.

Enjoy the deck and the video!"

Special summon from the graveyard with Mokey Mokey King effect.

Stray Mokey Mokey- Use this to retrieve Mokey Mokeys out of your deck to discard them with spells. Use to retrieve Mokey Mokey Smackdown.

Mokey Mokey Smackdown- Set up on the field when you're ready for the OTK.

Mokey Mokey King- Special summon with summoner of Illusions. Then crash the king to special summon the up to 5 Mokey Mokeys. If a special summon on the opponent's turn it will be destroyed no matter what and it will set up your field for your next turn.

Summoner of Illusions- When the graveyard and field are set up. Set and let it be destroyed. If not destroyed flip on your turn. Special summon Mokey Mokey King. Crash summoner if still on your field before Mokey Mokey King.

Honest- Hand trap. Can be pulled with Nova Summoner or Shining Angel, but make sure if you are on your opponent's turn that they have no more attacks. Then activate its effect and bring it to your hand.

Nova Summoner- Crash to Special Summon another copy, Shining Angel, Mokey Mokey, Marshmacaron, or Marshmallon. Do this to thin the deck. Also, this tactic is used as a defense wall.

Shining Angel- Crash to get Nova Summoner or Mokey Mokey. Marshmacaron, or Marshmallon. Do this to thin the deck. Also, this tactic is used as a defense wall.

Marsh monsters- Defensive wall.

Destruction cards- toss away Mokey Mokeys.

Supply Squad- Usefully draw cards due to how this deck wants to crash its monsters.

Pot of Duality/Sales Pitch- Draw a card that helps with various situations.

Spirit Barrier- Let's use crash with no downside. Also a good defensive wall.

Moon Shield- Use to over power opponent's strong monsters.

Graydle Eagle- Use to steal an opponent's monsters.

Duster/Raigeki- Bomb cards

Solemn- negate

Extra Deck cards- Situational cover. Can be reworked.

The Side Deck cards are what I'm running right now with Stray Mokey Mokey not out yet."

Is it very good, not really. Is it pretty fun, kinda. Is it funny to beat an opponent running","Ok, so the crux of this deck is understanding how to summon your big boss monsters. This is a going first deck but it also has things like Forbidden Droplet, Nibiru and Maxx C in order to be able to go second. Honestly depending on your hand you might be thankful that you went second instead of first.

For your link and XYZ monsters, Five Star Twilight and Multiply are your BEST friends.

In order for Five Star Twilight to function you need to tribute a 5 star monster, hence why Linkslayer and Red Hared Hasty Horse are in the deck. Both of their effects are ok but they are mostly for Five Star Twilight.

Weirdly, your strongest attacking main deck monster is Kuribabylon but its also not going to be super strong unless it's late game or after a bunch of link summoning after Five Star Twilight was activated.

Zeus + Downerd + Nightingale are in this deck mainly as a back up in case everything goes bad and you can only summon two level 1 monsters. If that is the case, just summon Nightingale, attack directly, summon Downerd and summon Zeus on top of that. That should be a two material Zeus that can clear the field twice."

This is made for Master Duel. Shout outs to Steven, who thinks that Magic is better than Yu-Gi-Oh.

The appeal of Fur Hires is that they have monsters that can special summon other Fur Hires, and both activate special effects when they're summoned. This deck attempts to load a good amount of ""summoners"" while also having a few contingency plans in case you don't draw a summoner and a summonee. Fraktall can be cycled to get Rugal or Shuraig out, the Tri-Brigade spells and One for One can search out cards you need, and Card Destruction and Pot of Desires help to make your opening hand better.

The end state of the board is probably Shuraig and Rafale or Folgo. The Knightmares and Apollousa are there in case you need 'em, they're not completely necessary."

Is the ""h"" just because of how it's spoken? Nevermind...","This deck goal is to get 2 floodgates (extra deck lock and colossus) + 1 omni negate or at least 1 extra deck lock + omni.

Short long story: the main thing is Zefra + Amorphage, the rest are either searchers or Dogmatika. Dogmatika is replaceable, but i didn't tested other options (maybe hand traps or more Odd-eyes engine). Extra deck is just filled with situational Dogmatika cards and some generic links that you probably will never use.

In the side deck again i just added some ""might add"" cards, except for <a data-name=""Yu-jo Friendship"">Yu-jo Friendship</a> that card is just funny.

Is the ""Mister No"" of pendulum decks, so the strategy is pretty simple: just negate what ever key-play your opponent gonna make.

To archive this goal the deck have 3 ways to say NO to whatever the opponent gonna play:

-With 15 hand traps (ofc): no need to explain those, right?

-the Counter traps: is the easiest way this deck gonna say NO to everything, other than the stable search at the summon of Zefraniu (<a data-name=""Nine pillars of yang zing"">Nine Pillars of Yang Zing</a>/ <a data-name=""Zefra divine strike"">Zefra Divine Strike</a>), the 3x of <a data-name=""Guiding Ariadne"">Guiding Ariadne</a> allow you to goes +3 in combo with <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>: by activate his effect of destroying a card on your field to add a face up pendulum monster from your extra deck to your hand, trying to have always Ariadne as target in the pendulum zone, you gonna activate Ariadne searching effect, which will force your opponent to add to your hand one of the Counter Traps you have in your deck, + in late game the other copies of Ariadne let you activate the remaining Solemn Cards free from life point cost as the pendulum effect allow you to activate counter traps without any activation cost.

-Extra Deck monster: this gonna take little bit more to explain it since the deck have different way to brings powerful synchro,fusion and link omni negate monsters on the field, so let's see it one by one and how this deck is able to bring them on the field:

<span> <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a></span>: Special summon from our pendulum zone by his own effect Abyss Actor-Curtain Raiser ( or <a data-name=""Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm"">Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm</a> by his own effect by sending it to the Graveyard with the 3x of <a data-name=""Dragon Shrine"">Dragon Shrine </a>or Foolish burial), then normal summon <a data-name=""Performapal Skullcrobat Joker"">Performapal Skullcrobat Joker</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Performapal Skullcrobat Joker&quot;&gt;Performapal Skullcrobat Joker&lt;/a&gt;,"">,</a> with his effect we gonna search one of the two copies of <a data-name=""Harmonizing Magician"">Harmonizing Magician</a>and if we are able to pendulum summon it we gonna special summon with his effect from our deck <a data-name=""Dragonpulse Magician"">Dragonpulse Magician</a> , after that we gonna summon Electrumite using Skullcrobat and Curtain Raiser (or Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm) as link materials, on the first Electrumite effect at the summon we gonna send to extra deck face up <a data-name=""Chronograph Sorcerer"">Chronograph Sorcerer</a> or <a data-name=""Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver"">Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver </a>(doesn't matter which, wont change the combo we just need to have both in the hand), now we gonna use Harmonizing Magician and Dragonpulse as XYZ meterials to summon         <a data-name=""Timestar Magician"">Timestar Magician </a>and use his effect to add from our deck the remaining copy of Chronograph Sorcerer or        <a data-name=""Performapal Odd Eyes Dissolver"">Performapal Odd-Eyes Di</a><a data-name=""Performapal Odd Eyes Dissolver"">ssolver</a> to our hand; now we gonna activate the second effect of targeting and destroy (hopefully Aridane as target) of Electrumite on our field to add to our hand the extra deck copy of Chronograph Sorcerer or Performapal Odd Eyes Dissolver, at this point we will have Chronograph wand Dissolver in our hand and Chronograph will activate his self summon effect and gonna summon Dissolver from our hand, then we gonna use Dissolver fusion effect and use Chronograph as material and BOOM! Vortex is on the field ready to say NO to everything.

<a data-name=""Baronne De Fleaur"">Baronne De Fleaur</a> : So this is gonna be easier; we need to normal summon any monster on the field then special summon <a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a> from our hand or Graveyard (by using Dragon Shrine or Foolish burial) by paying half of our life point, use both monsters on the field to summon <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> ,with his effect we gonna summon <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> , now we gonna use both of our monsters to special summon <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a>, which will summon 3 level 3 machine wind token and will trigger the self summon effect from our graveyard of Deskbot001 allowing us to summon Baronne De Fleaur. We can also summon Baronne with <a data-name=""Zefraxi, the tresure of yang zing"">Zefraxi, the tresure of yang zing</a>'s effect that will turn in to a tuner another Zefra monster on the field (Zefraniu) allowing us to do a 6+4 summon with any lvl 4 monster we have on the field .

<a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>: Just Harmonizing and Dragonpulse magician if you have an Odd Eyes Dissolver or Chronograph in you starting hand an you don't need to search one of them with <a data-name=""Timestar Magician"">Timestar Magician</a>.

<a data-name=""F.A. Dawn Dragster"">F.A. Dawn Dragster</a>: Basically we just need Destrudo in our hand or GY and target a lvl 4 or 6 as target to be able to summon it.

<a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of The Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of The Goddess</a><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of Godness:"">:</a> Is a pendulum deck, is really easy to have multiple monsters on the field but is more like a situational monster to summon.

Well those are the main combos of this deck, you can also remove some hand traps to bring in it an Endymion engine to have a little bit more main deck power if you like, well see ya!"

Trains have never had much luck going first, UNTIL NOW.

Your standard going first plays will either be Super Dora for that 4000 booty, or setting up good backrow with Heavenly Prison.

I don't main Dramaturge, personally i prefer adlibitum (free fusion summon) but you can change them as you wish. Solemn is good going 1st maybe i'd side deck it for super poly or smt (personal preference) You can use kaiju's instead of nibiru (personal preference).

I just got into master duel and I decided I liked the Twins. from my minor understanding of the decks basic strategy. (definitely need some help and improvement) the strategy that I find doing the most is simple enough:

Normal summon one of the classic twins

then Special Summon her counter part

bring out one of the Evil twins based on the situation

use its quick effect to bring back the opposite (Evil twin Ki-sikil summons Lil-la and vice versa)

link out its opposite evil twin then revive the first link twin you summoned. you get to use its effect now because you control its counterpart.

this is a split here. you can either go into the Master duel twin boss monster if you have it in your hand or a way to search it.

or you can go into abomination.

&nbsp;

that is quite literally the extent of my knowledge for the main leading strategy. I know how to comeback sometimes but that is it. currently this deck has carried me to gold 2, I have not played past it because I am here to ask for potential improvements. I am here to ask for general card suggestions and information/ideas on other strategies.

They make a lot of summons per turn, so they can pretty easily make verte for Mirrorjade. I included the Brave/Adventure enginge because I could really, adds some extra power to the deck.

Combos:

The Tri-Brigade classic: Activate Fraktall, send Kitt, send Nervall, Search Keras, and either special it from hand, pr just hard summon. If special summoned, you can banish 4 for Shuraig, banish one, then either sit on it or link Keras with the Shuraig and make Bearbrumm for revolt, or Ferijit, then special a Lyrilusc and combo from there. If Keras is normal summoned, you can just make Ferijit and Lyrilusc combo from there.

Lyrilusc goodstuff: You have one Lyrilusc in hand and bird call. Add Turquoise Warbler, special it and the Lyrilusc in hand, for example, Cobalt Sparrow. Sparrow effect triggers, search Sapphire Swallow. Special Swallow from hand with a Nervall or something, then lyrilusc combo from there.

Common Questions:
No Beryl Canary? I had quite a few issues with being bad at the game, and accidentally triggering it, and locking out Verte and Mirrorjade.

Judgement of the Branded? I put it in because you can send Albion, and end phase search Judgement. So you can banish one monster, end phase set judgement, then wipe the rest of their monsters next turn.

No mercourier? I couldn't be asked to read lmao, you could probably cut the Brave/Adventure engine and put it in + some handtraps.

Do your parents love you? I'm not playing mystic mine, so yes.

I only placed 1 card for each to make room, <strong>below this I will have the recommended copy counts that you can get away with.</strong> But first, some ground rules for the list.

Actually, there is only one. To qualify, <strong>a card has to see major use across many different kinds of decks. </strong>With that said, it would be easy for any experienced player to list off, for example; all of the best Rank 4 XYZ monsters, or all of the best floodgates. So, I hope you understand that I couldn't include all of that!

Welp, below is the card copy count. I will have a rating from 1 to 3 for each card. 3 being for the most necessary staples and 1 for the least relevant. Also may have explanations for some cards!

That said; however, the deck's still all kinds of fun to pilot and use to navigate gamestates that most other decks would have issues with. You play an answer to every situation in the Extra Deck with this build and if it's missing, it can probably just be teched in over something else!

<strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Easy Starts</span>: Buzzsaw Shark or a combination of any two cards that summon themselves out gets you rolling. Your opening play should always consist of making a Rank 4 either disrupt or defend going first.</li>
 	<li><span>Interaction</span>: Since the deck's lines all just primarily feature ways to turbo Rank 4s, a good chunk of the deck's dedicated to simple interaction in the form of staples and handtraps.</li>
 	<li><span>7 Colored Fish?</span>: It's a Normal Monster- which helps with getting around the summon limit in a lot of instances! Due to this status, it's also synergistic with some alternative choices in deck building that we'll cover by the end.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Rank 4 Chunkiness</span>: If you fail to open Buzzsaw Shark (or it gets disrupted) or fail to find an extender in addition to a normal summon, you'll be behind by quite a bit. While this isn't a super common occurrence, it can set you back in a duel pretty far. Fortunately, the toolbox options in the Extra Deck help with comebacks.</li>
 	<li><span>Specific Extenders</span>:  To improve the ability to turbo out Rank 4s more consistently by turn 1, some cards like Ice Knight, Goblindberg, Kagetokage, and ZS Armed Sage were added and while they absolutely do their job perfectly, a good portion of the deck tends to conflict with some of their effects. It's important to keep these in mind when determining the starter for each line, especially if you happen to have Silent Sea Nettle or Silent Angler in hand!</li>
 	<li><span>Prone to Disruption</span>: Most decks will want to interact with you by your second summon, before the Xyz touches down. Sometimes they'll interact with you on the Xyz Summon itself. Either way, when this happens and you don't have follow-up in the form of an extender, it can be quite rough. It's one of the caveats of playing a pseudo-traditional Xyz strategy in a format with capped summons.</li>
</ul>
Now with that out of the way, let's get into some of the demo setups you'll be wanting to aim for.

<hr />

<strong>OPENERS</strong>

The hand quality and/or number of extenders in the hand will always make the permuations of the gamestates more or less challenging to emulate; though, this much was obvious. That being said, in the 1st turns of the duel, you ideally just want to have a conga line of Xyzs rolling out. This can be enabled by the following:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Defensive Line: Having Hope: </strong>Leading with Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark isn't the worst thing you can do, especially if it's made using Buzzsaw Shark. Being able to threaten a 1k drop across the board on top of resurrecting your one card starter makes it exert some pressure while also doubling as a decent attacker. It shines best alongside others or backrow.</li>
 	<li><strong>Exosister Avatar:</strong> The introduction of Exosisters left much to be desired for their status in Trinity; however, their Xyz Monsters are great if you have the space. With Traptrix Rafflesia gone and this list not featuring Bagooska, if you're aiming to prevent a specific aspect of your opponent's gameplan, then turboing Mikailis is up your alley. Pick up the Exosister Arment and set it. During your opponent's turn you can either tag into Usophiel who prevents GY effects (and if she survives, is just a compulse) or Jibrine who is more of a supportive card to help you push for early lethal if your opponent's off to a slow start. If you happen to open Arment, simply make Jibrine instead and open up the option of tagging into Mikailis for her Quick Effect banish! Kaspitell's also great, but is more specific to certain match-ups.</li>
 	<li><strong>Post-Siding Negation Snowball:</strong> The other two options are really solid and should cover most of your average experiences with the deck; however, post-siding, if you notice that your opponent's list is extremely reliant on Monster Effects to resolve to get their engines rolling, you can opt to side in The Iris Swordsoul, Giant Hand, Ice Barrier, and the Ice-Bound God. These cards all serve as very easy ways to prevent those effects from going off while also generating a lot of pressure and recurring advantage in some way (besides Giant Hand). Paleozoic Marrella and Swordsoul Emergence help get to each of these side strategies faster.</li>
</ul>
As you can tell, the openers and lines can be pretty linear. Most of the advanced tactics comes from summon management using the non-Effect Monsters and choosing the right Xyz for the job. Rarely will your opponent be generous enough to give you a second or third chance at answering their board.

<strong>MIDGAME &amp; CLOSERS
</strong>

There's only a few real setups to aim for if you find yourself in the midgame grind or aim to end the game outright.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Drill Driver Vespenato: </strong>This card's basically another copy of Number 37; however, it's also a piercer! Its utility usually comes up whenever you unfortunately cannot find Whitefish Salvage nor Avarice.</li>
 	<li><strong>Valiant Shark Lancer: </strong>This card when paired with Abyss Dweller or Number 37 can easily close out games pretty quickly. Unfortunately, due to its Rank being 5, the setups for it are mostly specific to Buzzsaw Shark, Lantern Shark, and Penguin Squire. However, if achieved successfully, you have now earned yourself a Quick-Effect monster pop. Usually an opponent should aim to take out your Dweller or Number 37 because it turns of Valiant from being a Quick-Effect and removes both forms of pressure at once. When this happens, you'll be able to stack your deck with any sacky option of your choice. I recommend White Mirror, Whitefish Salvage, Pot of Avarice, Instant Fusion, and Monster Reborn.</li>
 	<li><strong>Graydle Dragon:</strong> This isn't super consistent to pull off but can be a bit easier if you side in the Ice Barrier engine to find Squire more often. When Graydle Dragon resolves in this deck, you should almost always be using it to clear two cards. Don't settle for just one, Tornado Dragon or Light Dragon @Ignister can do that instead. Graydle Dragon also being able to float is massive as well- although the monster will just be a generic material more than anything else.</li>
</ul>
Games should usually resolve themselves by midgame. The grind game in this deck isn't the best per se.

<hr />

While simple in nature, the deck's playstyle favors decision-making and proper risk assessment for problem solving. There's no Numeron Dragon OTK for you to get out of situations easily. Things will have to take patience and proper identification of win conditions to achieve consistent victories with this deck. Here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere:

<em>Tenyi Core, Piercing the Darkness, Dogmatika, Dinosaur, Traptrix Myrmeleo, Super Team Buddy Force Unite!!, Performage Core, Sea Monster of Theseus w/ a Synchro 9, Legacy of the Duelist, Number 101 &amp; C101, ZEXAL, and a whole roster of Rank 4s to slot in instead like Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!
</em>

Thanks for reading, and I hope this has convinced you to give the deck a try! It's a lot of fun to innovate on and revisit a modern classic like this in today's Trinity. I hope you have a fin-tastic time trying it out!"

It's pretty obvious that the ban list is quite different in Master Duel than it was in the TCG or OCG at this point in comparable metas, and in many ways it is quite favourable to the deck. Drytron is literally full power, and the archetype already has a lot going for it - Heralds are obviously really strong, Benten abuse is insane, Eva is nuts, and it can toolbox the extra deck to really play to what you like, or already own. There are a couple of big downsides to the deck, namely Skill Drain monke Eldlich, but much more importantly, the strong presence of Maxx ""C"", as well as Gamma's increased presence despite a semi-limit (BO1 means you have to main the tech). So, it's a struggle - you literally can't run enough outs for Skill Drain and Maxx ""C"" at the same time, particularly with the pretty close to required number of consistency cards and combo pieces. However, there's a really strong reward if you could solve those problems. This version is a compromise leaning on the ""dodge Lich"" side, which loses hard to Droll but has pretty solid game against Maxx ""C"". You could consider different ratios, depending on what you see, where you are on the ladder, and your own playstyle. I will be making suggestions for alternatives, budget options, and cards to consider.

Drytron, for the uninitiated, is a combo deck based on abusing Drytron monsters and generic Fairy ritual support from a variety of archetypes. Your basic goal is to use Drys to tribute Benten as many times as possible to get as many searches as possible, and you're trying to ritual summon a Herald as early in the combo as feasible to protect the combo while holding up interruptions. Your final goal is to fill your hand using Eva, which can be sent from the deck in a variety of ways.

So, I want to talk about interruptions. Obviously, beating Maxx ""C"" is important to me. I usually rely on around 5-7 cards to beat Maxx ""C"". This list is quite in the middle, on 6. Herald of the Orange Light is like Gamma without the restrictions or the brick... For a cost, which is pitching a Fairy. You search these throughout the combo, as a back-up in case Herald gets Kaiju'd or something. But they're also really here to be your anti-handtrap cards. In order to facilitate these, we are also running 14 Fairies, 3 Heralds and 11 other cards. You could run Called By, which would give you some game against random Drolls, and it would be good - I decided it conflicted too much with the 1 of Extra-Foolish, and that I'd rather run Ash on the basis of being an actual hand trap, wheras the other interaction spots are filled by Spell/Trap removal to answer floodgates. Maybe I get Ordered, but at least I can out the Skill Drain. I'm also on 2 Lancea, high impact in some matchups, at least useful in most, and it helps meet the criteria for having random Fairies in my hand for Orange Light. You could maybe get away with running Called By over Lancea, but I'd suggest running 1, because it can be game sometimes, and you can just search it. I think when you're deciding what hand traps to run, you have to be really worried about being able to out most floodgates, and have game against Maxx ""C"", and I don't think there's space for a ton of interaction in the deck. Gamma is another great option in this deck, especially if you're hurt for Ultys.

So, for Dry names I'm on 2 Alpha, 2 Zeta, 1 Gamma, and 1 Delta. Alpha Zeta is full combo, and it is insane, but you have so many consistency cards, both in the main and in the Extra deck. You're going to full combo with a ROTA + either Alpha or Zeta, whereas 2 Alphas are just sad Alphas. In total we have 10 consistency cards that search out your missing Dry name - 3 Cyber Emergency, best ROTA, 1 Foolish Burial, cause Drys are insane, 2 Nova and 2 Fafnir, with the basis being seeing either of these in multiple are bad, but they're slightly better as a pair, and each is better in different situations even though they're both effectively copies of your HOPT Nova, and 2 Mathematician, the decks main NS starter. Mathman is run over Scrap Recycler here because it can send Eva in addition to Drys, but recycler has applications if you want to use Scrap Wyvern into Nightmare Unicorn going second, so if you have Wyvern there are upsides to running Recycler. I do think access to Eva is way more important. Also, Recycler is a fine budget option - 90% of the time corporate can't tell the difference. There may be hands where you don't want to start with Mathman - your basic combo can search out Diviner of the Heralds for great value, which also helps make Beatrice, and in addition if you don't need Mathman to get plays started, holding onto it to send Eva or play through an interuption is probably correct anyways. Diviner is a fine combo starter in its own right, if you have Zeta you send Arc Light to search Benten, if you have Alpha you send Arc Light for the Ritual Spell. We're running 2 of the Ritual spell, because A) you do need this to do your combo and do want to just see it sometimes, and B) you can search out and use multiple copies of the ritual spell, or even hold a copy for follow-ups.

The next part of the deck is just 5 copies of Benten. You want to hard see Benten, and in the absence of Benten you want ways to search Benten. If you don't have Benten it is optimal so search Benten. If you're searching with Benten, Benten searches for Benten, and it is sometimes correct to just chain Benten. We're running a 1/1 mix of Prep and Extra-Foolish. Prep is great, and you could consider 2, but I've found often you can't pick up 2 Ritual spells when you see both copies of Prep anyways, and when you can you can rarely use the spell for much anyways. Plus, the first copy of Extra-Foolish may put us off Called By and occasionally gimp Cosmic, but it is also access to the Ritual spell, which really is the secret key to unlocking this deck, how do I get the ritual spell, as well as high-level rituals, such as Herald of Ultimateness, and occasionally the Drytron 12s (its a ritual you can search that you can tribute to ritual summon, then ritual summon from the GY...)

There's a small Cyber Angel package here. Idaten is crazy, you can abuse Idaten to ritual summon so many times and just Link climb and make Xyz monsters. Natasha is for the grind game, a tool to link climb into Accesscode for a big finish, but also weirdly fine as this sort of passive value engine. It's way better in a world with 3 Benten, and people swear by it with 1. Ultimateness could be Perfection if you're looking for a budget option - it is effectively doing the same thing. While it is worse in many ways that actually literally do really matter, it's also just so busted despite that that in most games you won't notice. Its also searchable with Prep, if you're on 2 or 3 Prep (it's still fine, it's not a HOPT). Likewise for the Drytron ritual - the Ulty is way better as a card, but the Secret is fine and has fringe utility, and 90% of the time corporate can't tell the difference. Its literally just searchable tribute fodder. For Ultys in the main you literally only need 1 Diviner, and 1 of the Ritual spell, if you're looking to start out in Master Duel - in the Extra deck you'll want to build a good collection of pretty generic extra-deck cards most likely, but in a pinch I'd say you only really need 1 Beatrice, 1 Herald of the Arc Light, 1 Mu Beta Fafnir, and 1 Linkuriboh - if you have to choose 1 choose Beatrice, not because it is that good in any other deck (BA? more like BO) but because it is core here. After that, you can fill the deck with whatever generic Link monsters you have - the real goal is just Ultimateness negates, as long as you can Link Idaten away after searching a bunch with Benten and making Ultimateness/Perfection you're doing it right ;)

I think the deck has some meta-game challenges that make it exciting to deck build, but a lot harder to play than in the TCG. But in terms of pure unadulterated power it is hard to get better than Drytron, and I do think the format has the tools for Drytron to be a contender within it. I also think that while it is a slightly complicated deck at first, it is actually pretty quick to pick up and very rewarding to play. I'd also call it a good budget entry option to Master Duel for experienced Yu-Gi-Oh! players interested in Master Duel, but not looking to spend a lot of money."

With <strong>Prediction Princess</strong> being relatively low-profile to most players, especially the players who've been introduced to the game through Master Duel, nobody truly understands how to play against it effectively until they start using their brain and actually read your cards. Because <strong>Deus X-Krawler</strong> doesn't have an Effect that triggers upon it being flipped face-up, despite it being a Flip Monster, your opponents, who have never seen the card before, will usually not realize that it is basically a one-sided <strong>Skill Drain</strong>. Due to this, you can cheese a lot of games strictly because your opponent refused to read. <strong>Prediction Princess</strong> is a really fun Ritual Deck which revolves around <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> and you aim to utilize <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>, <strong>Deus X-Krawler</strong>, and an assortment of Rank 9 Monsters to run your opponent out of resources and plays.</span>

<span>We run 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> because she is the centerpoint of the Deck. During the End Phase, she Summons a Flip Monster from your hand or GY and as HOPT and only 1 Effect per turn, you can flip a monster on the field face-down or flip one face-up. Not only does this activate the Effects of your Flip Monsters, but it can also prevent some of your opponent's Extra Deck Summons by flipping a key monster face-down. 3 <strong>Impcantation Chalislime</strong>. This card basically Summons an <strong>Impcantation</strong> from Deck at the cost of pitching 1 card (which can be itself), and you usually do not have to worry about the 2500 burn during the End Phase since you are most likely Ritual Summoning right after anyways. It gives you greater access to your <strong>Impcantations</strong> for Ritual Monsters and Spells and it can be searched off of<strong> Preparation of Rites</strong> which is great. 1 <strong>Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended</strong>. If your opponent targets a monster you control with an Effect, you can discard this to negate that. <strong>Tarotrei</strong> is a prime target for removal and negation because she enables all of your plays. <strong>Sauravis</strong> can protect her from <strong>Effect Veiler</strong>, <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>, <strong>Paleozoic Dinomischus</strong>, or basically anything relevant that targets. It can easily be cut for gem reasons, but if you have it, it is just another layer of protection. 3 <strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong> of course as a staple. 3 <strong>Spirit of the Fall Wind</strong>.<strong> Tarotrei</strong> needs at least 1 Flip Monster in rotation for her to do her magic and because you usually never Normal Summon in this Deck, <strong>Spirit of the Fall Wind</strong> is a good choice for those reasons as it searches Flip Monsters upon Normal Summon. 3 <strong>Impcantation Talismandra</strong> and 2 <strong>Impcantation Candoll</strong>. <strong>Talismandra</strong> searches Ritual Monsters and <strong>Candoll</strong> searches Spells and because<strong> Impcantations</strong> can Summon each other from Deck, because we are running more Ritual Monsters, running more <strong>Talismandra</strong> means more access to <strong>Candoll</strong> and Ritual Spells. 2 <strong>Deus X-Krawler</strong> and 2 <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>. <strong>Deus X</strong> is a one-sided <strong>Skill Drain</strong> as long as it remains face-up after being flipped and it can search<strong> Tarotrei</strong> if it is destroyed. <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> is a HOPT <strong>Pot of Greed</strong>,<strong> Giant Trunade</strong>, <strong>Raigeki</strong>, or <strong>The Forceful Sentry</strong>. Usually, you are using the <strong>Giant Trunade</strong> Effect to go for game or the <strong>Raigeki</strong> Effect to board wipe. The <strong>Pot of Greed</strong> Effect rarely does come up, but <strong>The Forceful Sentry</strong> Effect is good for preventing your opponent from potentially gaining advantage while you are in a winning board state. More often, you would like to see <strong>Deus X</strong> more than <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> since<strong> Deus X</strong>'s one-sided<strong> Skill Drain</strong> is much stronger than something like a <strong>Raigeki</strong> from <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>, but they are the 2 best Level 9 Flip Monsters so it's fine.</span>

<span>For the Spells/Traps, 3 <strong>Pre-preparation of Rites</strong> and 2 <strong>Preparation of Rites</strong>. <strong>Pre-prep</strong> searches out <strong>Tarotrei</strong> and <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> so 3 is most optimal. As for <strong>Prep</strong>, it searches either <strong>Chalislime</strong> or <strong>Sauravis</strong> and it can recycle a Ritual Spell if need be, but as it doesn't get you immediate access to <strong>Tarotrei</strong>, 3 can be bricky. 3 <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> which Summons <strong>Tarotrei</strong>. Also, on the turn that it wasn't sent to the GY, it can banish itself to add a <strong>Tarotrei</strong> to hand. This reduces the need to constantly see <strong>Impcantations</strong> and <strong>Pre-preps</strong>, so that is pretty nice. 1 <strong>Impcantation Inception</strong>. This card basically is a 4th copy of <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> if the situation ever comes up. 3 <strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong> as it is just an all-round great searcher card. 3 <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which Summons 2 Level 9's (<strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> and <strong>Deus X</strong>) from Deck if you target <strong>Tarotrei</strong> with it. This can give immediate access to a Rank 9 or it can be used to put Flip Monsters into rotation for <strong>Tarotrei</strong>. Also something to keep in mind is that you can Book 1 monster Summoned by <strong>Monstrosity</strong> to prevent it from being destroyed during the End Phase. <span>However, despite the destruction during the End Phase being mandatory, in Master Duel, it actually happens after the window in which you are allowed to activate <span><strong>Tarotrei</strong></span>'s End Phase Effect, so you will not be able to Summon the other monster back which is really unfortunate</span>. However, the destruction will trigger <strong>Deus X</strong> which allows him to search a <strong>Tarotrei</strong> for next Turn. Lastly, we have 3 <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>.<strong> Imperm</strong> cannot be banished by <strong>Called by the Grave</strong> in the same way <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> can be, so it is a better card for disruption.</span>

<span>The Extra Deck has 1 <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>, 1 <strong>Number F0: Utopic Future</strong>, and 1 <strong>Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</strong>. These are great cards to go with Xyz Decks, but you can definitely only choose to play the 1 <strong>Zeus</strong> for budget reasons. 3 <strong>Number 92; Heart-eartH Dragon</strong>. This card is usually fodder for <strong>Prosperity</strong>, but it is pretty hard to out if you do ever make it unless your opponent is actively running removal. 2 <strong>Phantom Fortress Enterblathnir</strong>. This card is removal, and just like <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>'s <strong>The Forceful Sentry Effect</strong>, it can be used to hinder your opponent further while you are in a winning game state. 3 <strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong>. This card is absolutely insane for removal. 3 <strong>Nine-Lives Cat</strong>. This is mainly just for budget purposes, but its revival Effects can come in handy. 1 <strong>True King of All Calamities</strong> which is absolutely insane because it was banned in the TCG and OCG for a reason. I would advise against playing <strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong> because it doesn't accomplish much in this Deck other than being a beefy body. Another potential Rank 9 you can play is <strong>Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton</strong>, but you would rather make that early in the game which this Deck usually falls to Xyz later on in the game.</span>

<span>More cards I would recommend playing would be <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> since this Deck isn't the greatest trying to break a massive negation board without help. <strong>Called by the Grave</strong> is good against <strong>Ash</strong>, <strong>Veiler</strong>, and <strong>Droll</strong>. <strong>Maxx ""C""</strong> is great for draw power which is very useful in a Ritual Deck. <strong>Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</strong> is a free Level 9 monster on board if there is a monster in the EMZ and it can act as removal for your opponent's monster in the EMZ. It gives good Rank 9 access and is pretty good removal. <strong>Kaijus</strong> are another great choice for this Deck. <strong>Thunder King</strong> and <strong>Mecha-Thunder-King</strong> are the only Level 9 Kaijus and both are Summonable off of <strong>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</strong> and both give Rank 9 access. <strong>Mecha-Thunder-King</strong> can also bring itself back during the End Phase as a OPD and it can act as another body on the field or Rank 9 access for next turn. <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> is great because you can get back a <strong>Tarotrei</strong> your opponent destroyed. <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong> and<strong> Lightning Storm</strong> are good against backrow and so is <strong>Red Reboot</strong>. This Deck only has access to backrow removal in the Extra Deck, so having some options in the Main Deck is good if you can afford it. <strong>Whirlwind Weasel</strong> and <strong>Guard Dog</strong> are <strong>Imperial Order</strong>/<strong>Royal Decree</strong> and <strong>Vanity's Emptiness</strong> respectively, but they are not that optimal to run as it hurts consistency massively and they can be seen as more of a hinderance than an asset.</span>"

It's consistent &amp; flexible on options of which fusions you wish to summon depending on the situations. I made this deck purely just for fun and testing the flexible summoning potential. Every monster card can fuse with or into one another

Only downside I seem to have with this playstyle is while you can easily get out 2-4 monsters and/or fusions on any given turn, you can sometimes end up having an empty hand (which hinders Paladins negate effect unable to be activated)

I've tried adding draw power cards like Maxx C and other various options, but I found that bringing out ""The Dark magicians"" fusion is more consistent for getting cards to hand.

I enjoy playing with this deck and I'm always open to feedback and suggestions to make this even better

Enjoy!"

( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=Su-mpNPeQDE&amp;t"">https://youtube.com/watch?v=Su-mpNPeQDE&amp;t</a> )

So remember how everyone and their cousin wants the fusion snek gone for reasons that have to do with deck fusion? Well the saints on the day of our lord had came to me to give some reprieve on that solution, and they told me to try it on HEROs. Now while this archetype has a long track record of having some of the most laughably bad monsters, spells, and overall track records out of any anime based archetype that came out of the Yu-Gi-Oh franchise; it is needless to say that most of the archetypes that came out of the original Yu-Gi-Oh animes (DM, GX, 5Ds, and Zexal) were all either lackluster or straight up bad up until after their initial airings. However HEROs tend to be more of a tragedy of their own, mainly because of how archaic the fusion summoning was up until this point; the fact that it took many years for HEROs to get solid support it needs to speed itself up; and the fact that it had multiple banlist hits from <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Elemental HERO Stratos</a> to even the grand jewel of all fusion cards, <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>.

Now to note on where and why I think that HERO will be one of the few fusion decks to survive against the banning of <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda </a>is quite simple: it's because this deck doesn't simply run need to run it at all. Arguably, I can say that the reason it was in HERO builds to begin with was to further increase versatility and speed at board building. Truthfully however even without it the speed has taken a slight dip, but doesn't mean that the versatility from the snek has left them. Especially now with Despia and Branded builds running around, the opportunity for HEROs to approach the situations at its pace has come; hence why I have with two silver bullets that can be used for Super Polymerization: <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a> and <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a> (as one can wipe boards ASAP, and the other can snipe potential threats from any Dark monsters a quick pace). Next part involves what changes I added for the maindeck as a whole (to which there isn't too many, the ones I made are quite decent nontheless). First off instead of Celestial and Dasher, comes Malicious and Denier; simply because I find this to be a lot more consistent than to wait and pray for an empty hand. Next comes the introduction of <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Drawhand"">Destiny HERO - Drawhand</a>: one of the newer Destiny HERO monsters (released in 2020) that if special summoned by an effect of a HERO monster (which is a lot likely), you and your opponent can draw a card; but if this triggers with <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dark Law"">Masked HERO Dark Law</a> on the field, he banishes one random card from your opponents hand. Then comes the addition of <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a> because I'm not playing a lot of handtraps. Finally, there is nothing really serious that changed about this deck at all, and until it happens that either branded expands into opening itself more than the Dark/Light attribute, or there is someone that can make HEROs into a defensive deck; this might be where they be stuck being for a very long time..."

Utilizing both older support and new toys from recent sets like Burst of Destiny, Grand Creators and Battles of Chaos, R3NK Adventurer turbos out Extra Deck heavyweights like Utopic Draco Future, Baronne, Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer and Divine Arsenal Zeus!

With a 52 card pile featuring 14 handtraps, even your handtrap ghost girls are starters, since they are simultaneously tuners and level 3 monsters!

Facing an already established board? No problem, the new Ghostrick support allows for an easy 4 material Zeus to reset the board! Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer’s +2 draw for the following turn usually finishes the game off with Accesscode Talker!
<p><span><strong>ARCHETYPES, ENGINES AND DECKBUILDING</strong></span></p>
This deck’s defining characteristic are level 3 monsters because they spam the board en-masse, are easy to special summon and because of their amazing utility.  There are three types of level 3 monsters in this deck, each with their own use and strategy:
<ul>
 	<li>The <strong>Adventurer </strong>cards in the Main Deck consist of 10 cards:</li>
</ul>
<em>3 Aquamancer of the Sanctuary, 3 Rite of Aramesia, 1 Wandering Gryphon Rider, 1 Fateful Adventure, 1 Dracoback and 1 Foolish Burial</em>. The Adventurer Engine is used in this strategy to provide blanket protection and bait from interruption. More importantly the easy to summon and search Aquamancer of the Sanctuary is level 3!
<ul>
 	<li>The <strong>Ghost Girl</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 9 cards:</li>
</ul>
<em>3 Ash Blossom, 3 Ghost Ogre and 3 Ghost Belle</em>. Each of these ladies can be used in a pinch as a level three to get your plays started. They are also tuners, and they can be used to make Halq or Baronne!
<ul>
 	<li>The <strong>Level 3 Monster Spam</strong> cards in the main deck consist of 19 cards:</li>
</ul>
<em>3 Emergency Teleport, 3 Psychic Wheeleder, 3 Psychic Tracker, 3 Junk Forward, 3 Kagemucha Knight, 1 P.U.N.K Madame Spider, 1 P.U.N.K Dangerous Gabu, 1 Danger! Tsuchinoko, and 1 Danger! Jackalope</em>. These level 3s easily summon themselves to the field in one way or another. The optimal target using Emergency Teleport is Madame Spider, which searches a relatively free trap interruption from deck.

<em>There are other sets of cards in this deck that support their boss monster, or the strategy as a whole: </em>
<ul>
 	<li>The <strong>Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer Package</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 3 cards:</li>
</ul>
<em>1 Destiny Hero Celestial, 1 Destiny Hero Dasher, and 1 Fusion Destiny</em>.  <em>1 Verte Anaconda and 1 Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</em> are in the Extra Deck. These cards are garnets, but they lead to a very potent boss monster, Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, and a +2 draw and free special summon the following turn.
<ul>
 	<li>The <strong>Ghostrick</strong> cards in the maindeck consists of only 1 card (most cards for this package reside in Extra Deck):</li>
</ul>
<em>1 Ghostrick Shot. 1 Ghostrick Alucard and 2 Ghostrick Angel of Mischief</em> are in the Extra Deck. Being one of the one of the win conditions for this deck, these cards can create <em>Zeus</em> and <em>Number F0 – Utopic Draco Future</em> with just two level 3 monsters. Ghostrick Shot is recyclable with Alucard, giving you a monster reborn for Ghostricks every turn so they can serve as materials to make your Extra Deck bosses. Ghostrick Shot also turns into a 3 material Zeus, as explained later in the combo section.
<ul>
 	<li>The <strong>Staple</strong> cards in the maindeck consists of 10 cards:</li>
</ul>
<em>3 Crossout Designator</em> and its targets; <em>1 Impermanence, 1 Nibiru, 1 Droll and Lockbird, 1 Artifact Lancea, 1 Effect Veiler, 1 Called by the Grave and 1 Forbidden Droplet</em>. Designator can also negate the commonly used Adventurer cards, if your opponent happens to use it.

This deck is 52 cards so that there is the least possible chance to draw into this deck’s 7 bricks: Ghostrick Shot, P.U.N.K Dangerous Gabu, Wandering Gryphon Rider, Fateful Adventure, Dracoback, D-Hero Celestial and D-Hero Dasher. If you draw Ghostrick Shot, the Utopic Draco Future combo is dead. While drawing most bricks wouldn’t be catastrophic, it is less than ideal – hence the 52 card deck.

I intentionally didn’t include Auroradon/Deskbot 001 combo in here, since I anticipate it will be on the future banlist. I also think that Anaconda and the Adventurer Engine will get affected by the future banlist, but these two synergize with the deck so much I had to use it.

A card to add for consideration in R3NK Adventurer is <em>Small World</em>, since it easily searches <em>Aquamancer of the Sanctuary</em> with any level 3 in the deck. Another engine to add can be Illusion of Chaos + Magician Souls for extra draw power and another free body on board.

&nbsp;
<p><span><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></p>
The gameplan with this deck is to spam the board with as much level 3s as possible, then proceed to turbo out boss monsters from the Extra Deck. Any two level 3s monsters make Utopic Draco Future, Accesscode, Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, and Zeus.

Ideally, this deck likes to go first so it can make a board, interrupt the opponent, then OTK the turn afterwards. Going second this deck can easily turbo out a 4 material Zeus or play through interruption to OTK with Accesscode.

<strong>GOING FIRST,</strong> the R3NK duelist can make a board consisting of Utopic Draco Future, DPE, with perhaps some handtraps in the hand. If a hand is amazing, the end board can also consist of Baronne or an intact Adventurer Token + Gryphon Rider combo.

Everybody and their mom already know the Adventurer, DPE and Halq/Accesscode combo, so I’ll only be explaining the combos to make Utopic Draco Future and Baronne.

<strong>2 level 3 monsters -&gt; Utopic Draco Future:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>XYZ summon Ghostrick Alucard using the two level 3 monsters.</li>
 	<li>Overlay Ghostrick Angel of Mischief on Alucard.</li>
 	<li>Detach Ghostrick Alucard from Angel of Mischief to search Ghostrick Shot from deck.</li>
 	<li>Activate Ghostrick Shot to resurrect Alucard from GY.</li>
 	<li>Overlay Ghostrick Angel of Mischief on Alucard.</li>
 	<li>XYZ Summon Number F0: Utopic Future. Alucard will activate once sent to the GY, and retrieve Ghostrick Shot from GY (follow-up for next turn).</li>
 	<li>Overlay Number F0: Utopic Draco Future on Utopic Future. (With leftover material on board, you can make Baronne, Anaconda-&gt;DPE, or if going second, go for Zeus/Accesscode).</li>
</ol>
<strong>Adventurer Engine + Level 3 Tuner -&gt; Baronne: </strong>

Creating <strong>Baronne</strong> is hand/situation dependent, but this deck can still make her fairly regularly. There are two ways to create Baronne, and both involve using up leftovers of the Adventurer Engine:
<ol>
 	<li>Any level 3 tuner + Gryphon Rider creates Baronne. If Baronne uses up her negate, she can tag back into Gryphon Rider during standby phase for another omni-negate!</li>
 	<li>Alternatively, the level 4 Adventurer token + level 3 tuner + level 3 non-tuner can make Baronne.</li>
</ol>
<strong>GOING SECOND</strong>, the R3NK duelist can slow down the opposing player with handtraps then break the board with Zeus. The battling monster of choice here is Fortune Tune since it has protection. After the battle phase it can be overlayed by our favourite Zeus pilot Downerd Magician for an extra Zeus activation. Once the board is reset, you have a choice of building your board as if you’re going first.

<strong>Ghostrick Shot is a 1 card 3 material Zeus</strong> if Alucard is already in the GY. This set-up (Alucard in GY and Shot in hand) is usually accomplished the turn after you create Utopic Draco Future. The combo is as follows: Shot resurrects Alucard -&gt; Banish Shot to attach a Ghostrick card from GY to Alucard. Overlay Alucard -&gt;Downerd-&gt;Attack -&gt; Zeus. This turns Ghostrick Shot into a 1 card fieldwipe!

If you feel confident you can OTK, this deck can play through interruptions, generate 8000+ ATK and easily clear the board with Gryphon Rider’s bounce, Baronne’s destruction effect and Accesscode’s multiple destructions so you can swing for game!

&nbsp;
<p><span><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></p>

<ul>
 	<li>Before you start off with your opening plays, try to bait out your opponent’s handtraps/interruption by using the Adventurer cards first.</li>
 	<li>Don’t forget that Crossout Designator can negate other staple cards as long as the same cards are present in your deck – notable examples being Called by the Grave, Rite of Aramesia and Destiny Hero Celestial.</li>
 	<li>If all your plays are stopped, try to at least get two monsters on field so you can make Anaconda -&gt; DPE. If you survive until next turn, you can potentially make a comeback with the +2 draw and special summon that Celestial and Dasher provide in the GY.</li>
 	<li>Once you complete making your Utopic Draco Future, you can use your Adventurer Token + Gryphon Rider to make Anaconda-&gt;DPE. If your opponent tries to stop Anaconda, Utopic Draco Future will negate their handtrap!</li>
 	<li>A Baronne with a spent negate can tag back into Gryphon Rider during Standby Phase for another omni-negate, given that the Adventurer Token is still on the field. Also, if you want to play offensively, she can tag back into a tuner you can make Halq -&gt; Accesscode!</li>
 	<li>Unfortunately, this deck is ridiculously expensive ($1200USD as of this writing) and there are stronger ways to use the boss monsters in R3NK Adventurer in other decks (Swordsoul or B.A.S.E.D for example).</li>
 	<li>This deck loses hard to floodgates like Gozen Match and Skill Drain. This deck’s answer to these floodgates is Dracoback. If facing a floodgate-based opponent, be sure to side in backrow removal.</li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span></p>
After watching MBT’s Youtube Ghostrick video on Youtube (check him out, he’s hilarious), it has motivated me to create my own rank 3 spam creation. After MBT issued a challenge for another duelist to put the Ghostrick -&gt; Utopic Draco Future combo in another deck, so I took it!

Also, I’ve been playing too much JRPGs, and the I wanted to create a deck based on the stereotypical questing party – with R3NK Adventurer being the result! I strongly believe in projecting my imagination in my duels with the things I like since it greatly enhances my love of the game, so I imagine every duel with R3NK Adventurer as an exciting journey to defeat the villains (nerdy I know lol)! Baronne, DPE, Utopic Draco Future, Accesscode and Zeus are all members of your questing party, ready to destroy your enemies in your mission to win duels!

I hope you have as much fun as I do piloting this deck online and IRL. And with that, I’m taking this deck to Locals this week, wish me luck! That’ll be all for now, GLHF Duelists!

It can special summon itself to make for Tribute material, you can Tribute summon it for Domain's effect or combo it with Stormforth to get rid of an opponent's card, its discard effect is good backrow removal and a way to get Pantheism or Prime into the GY, and it can act as a serviceable body if you brick and just want to have something on the field.

2 copies of Majesty's Fiend because its 2400/1000 stats allows it to use Tenacity of the Monarchs and Return of the Monarchs, and 3 Vanity's Fiend because its effect is incredibly powerful even though it doesn't have the Monarch stats.

Seleglare can be searched by Ehther, and its effect can be useful for getting a low-atk card away from your opponent for a turn. It can also use Tenacity and Return.

I choose Proof of Pruflas over Squires or Vassals because Ash Blossom can't stop Proof like it can Edea, and I often found myself bricking because I'd draw multiple Squires or cards that search Edea (like RotA or One For One) but no tribute monsters.

I'm probably dead wrong with this list. &nbsp; There are inherent non-synergies within the list. Obviously, Rivalry + Zombie World locks you out of your non-zombies too. The idea is that this should hurt your opponent much more than you. This deck can go first or second. It's a little awkward when you have your going second pieces going first and vice-versa but this deck was made to both be good at clearing boards and also meant to have fairly strong starts / be able to set up locks. Like I said, this is my take on it. Feel free to criticize and suggest changes.</p>"
