Almost every hand is,"There are many more terrrors at sea than pirates and ghost ships, from the depths rise warmongering sea serpents, Fish-people and Sea-people. This is the place where you can see which fish in the seven seas work best together.  I will be covering each and every card / archetype used (Including the side this time), telling you all the info you need to know about this particular deck. I am going to be laying it out slightly differently this time, instead of doing it card by card (for the main deck) I will be doing them in archetypes / groups. If you have any questions about the deck please let me know :), I will not be going over their effects individually unless i deem it neccessary so please check out my 1st Decklist for that.  &nbsp;  <em>- Main Deck:</em> <strong>Atlanteans:</strong> The ""Atlantean"" engine I run is a 3:3:3 of &lt;Prince&gt;, &lt;Dragoon&gt; and &lt;Infantry&gt;. By this point you should already know what they do and why I am running 3 of them, however &lt;Infantry&gt; isn't usually played at 3 and that is what I shall use this section to explain. Running &lt;Infantry&gt; at 2 wasnt very bricky however I run out of Neptabyss targets super quickly at 2, running the 3rd just means I can use &lt;Neptabyss'&gt; effect an extra time before running out of targets. It also means I have an additional face-up pop. I can afford to put an extra copy of &lt;Infantry&gt; in the deck because I took most of the bricking cards out of the deck. The other 2 cards are staples to any ""Atlantean"" deck and I shouldn't have to explain why they are being played at 3 xD.  <strong>Mermails:</strong> Some people might be confused with my choice to run the Mermail engine at 3:1:1 as it is usualy run with 1 copy of &lt;Gunde&gt; aswell. I decided not to run the gunde as I would see it too often and never be able to use its effect at the right time, I would also like to see alot of other cards in the deck over this card. The other 3 cards are the same, &lt;Teus&gt; is a starter we want to see in our starting hand as much as possible, &lt;Pike&gt; and &lt;Megalo&gt; are searchable so they are played as 1 of's.  <strong>Deep Sea:</strong> I run both cards at 3 for a 3:3 ratio, technically both of these cards are starters for the deck with &lt;Diva&gt; being the primary NS of the deck and &lt;Minstrel&gt; being a ditcher for dragoons. I am running &lt;Minstrel&gt; at three because its so versatile: it deals with handtraps, has multiple ways of ditching ""Atlanteans"" and it can recur WATER monsters back from the GY to the deck with the primary target usually being &lt;Dragoons&gt;.  <strong>Frogs:</strong> Like the ""Mermail"" engine the ratios I am using may surprise some people. With a 2:1 ""Frog"" monster ratio the deck does not draw into them all that much, which is the idea. This strategy is great for both &lt;Toad&gt; plays and extending other WATER plays, however &lt;Swog&gt; doesn't activate the ditch effects of my""Atlantean"" cards and so it can cause issues with the starting hand. Regardless I have had great success running this ratio, but if you wish you could add another &lt;Swog&gt;.  <strong>Honourary AtlaMails: </strong>As is tradition I am running a 1:1 ration of &lt;Moulinglacia&gt; and &lt;Lappis&gt;. I shouldnt have to explain why but they are both searchable of dragoons. With &lt;Moulinglacia&gt; hand looping the ooponent and being a level 8 (Synchro plays)  he is great at gaining advantage over the opponent, Whilst lappis is Useful for rounds when you don't see &lt;Diva&gt; for the &lt;Halq&gt; plays.  <strong>Generic Water:</strong> A ratio of 2:1 is used to help make Synchro plays after first turn and extend combos. &lt;Spirit&gt; is an extender that can help make &lt;Bahamut&gt; or a Link monster.  <strong>Spells</strong>: For draw power I run a 3:2:1 ratio of &lt;Moray&gt;, &lt;Aria&gt; and &lt;Avarice&gt; respectively. &lt;Moray&gt; is a +0 card advantage but it cycles through the deck reliantly with the amount of Water monsters in the deck the only issue this card has is if you draw it as a top deck. &lt;Aria&gt; on the other hand is a great top deck and an amazing draw card as it allows you to add either &lt;Dragoons&gt; or &lt;Infantry&gt; depending on what is neccessary. It can also add &lt;Diva&gt; or &lt;Neptabyss&gt; but this isnt as good a search. I also use 1 &lt;Avarice&gt; which is useful for Longer grind games, it recurs &lt;neptabyss&gt; and other neccessary pieces. As a tech choice I run 1:1 of &lt;1 for 1&gt; and &lt;Instant Fusion&gt; as they extend the plays I can make or free up a NS. Instant fusion can be used both agressively and defensively in this deck dependant on which Fusion you summon. As Interuption I play 1 &lt;Called by&gt; and 3 &lt;Chalice&gt;. The 1 of is to add a 4th way of preventing the deck from being hand trapped and the 3 of is to stop your opponents plays. Now you may be wondering... ""Why is he using chalice, just use imperm!?"". &lt;Chalice&gt; is a BTEC imperm and it works really well, besides not being able to stop your opponents first turn play if you go 2nd it works the exact same way. In fact &lt;chalice&gt; is what comes out when Dark Ruler + Imperm have a card baby. It can be set and activated to stop opponent plays during their turn or if you are going second you can bait a negate / prevent an opponents monster from using its effects. &lt;Chalice&gt; is one of our SD targets, but I will get to that later...  <strong>Traps</strong>: Oh would you look at that... there aren't any xD  <em>-ExtraDeck:</em>  <strong>Fusions: </strong>&lt;TrishF&gt;, &lt;Mudragon&gt; and &lt;Restrict&gt; are all fantastic fusions for this deck all though it is unlikely you will summon 2 of them :( &lt;TrishF&gt; is an essential part of the &lt;VFD&gt; combo and can be reliably summoned on the 1st turn, his effects are useless to the deck but his lvl isn't. &lt;Muddragon&gt; Is the defensive side of &lt;Instant Fusion&gt; I was talking about earlier in the article. His effect prevents your monsters from being targeted by your opponent's effects and he is a level 4 so once he has finished protecting your monsters he can be linked or xyz'd off the board. &lt;restrict is &lt;Mudragons&gt; Offensivc counterpart to &lt;Instan Fusion&gt; and can be used to get rid of some pesky monsters on the field, because it is a level 1 it can be used to summon &lt;TrishS&gt; or &lt;TrishF&gt;.  <strong>Synchros: </strong>&lt;TrishS&gt;, &lt;Croc&gt;, &lt;Dragite&gt; and &lt;Whale&gt; all have their places in my deck as solid 1-of options. &lt;TrishS&gt; and &lt;Croc&gt; are both Lvl9 so they are used as material for &lt;VFD&gt; however &lt;Croc&gt; can also be summoned back by &lt;Coral&gt; making him a recursive destruction effect. &lt;Dragite&gt; is mostly only used against the decks that use pivotal spells, like Mystic Mine or Dream Mirror. as for &lt;Whale&gt; he only gets used every know and then to destroy your opponents field in one swoop.  <strong>Xyz's: </strong>&lt;VFD&gt;, &lt;Bahamut&gt; and &lt;Toad&gt; is what your first turn will look like most of the time. &lt;Vfd&gt; is made with either lvl9 Synchro and &lt;TrishF&gt; really easily. &lt;Toad&gt; is just as easily made with &lt;Bahamut&gt; as &lt;VFD&gt; is, it can also be made with the ""Frog"" engine.  <strong>Links: </strong>With only 4 Link monsters in the deck, they have to be good, and they are! &lt;Halq&gt; and &lt;Linkross&gt; are used to make &lt;VFD&gt; this is especiallyhelped by the tokens that &lt;Linkross&gt; creates. &lt;Coral&gt; is used for recursion and is an all round great Water support card. Lastly &lt;Alacia&gt; is summoned as a searcher for &lt;Teus&gt; for next turn, this can also disrupt the opponent if &lt;Infantry&gt; is ditched.  <em>- Side Deck:</em>  Forbidden Chalice / Aqua Spirit / Moulinglacia are the main deck cards that can be sided the easiest.  &lt;Kaiju&gt; - Side 3 of these cards in when (1) + (2): 1) your opponent has cards that are unaffected by your effects. 2) Your going 2nd &lt;Desert Locust&gt; - Side this card in when: 1) you know your going first &lt;Abyss Dweller&gt; - Side this card in when: 1) You are playing against a deck that relies on thee GY , Like BA. 2) Your going 1st  &lt;Raigeki&gt; - Side this card in when: 1) the deck your playing against spams the board. &lt;Feather Duster&gt; - Side this card in when: 1) your opponent is playing alot of spells. &lt;Dark Ruler&gt; - Side this card in when (1) + (2): 1) Your going 2nd. 2) your opponent builds a big board with lots of negates. &lt;Cosmic Cyclone&gt; - Side this card in when (1) + (2): 1) Your playing against a deck that is reliant on spells and traps. 2) you play against mystic mine. &lt;Mizuchi&gt; - Side this card in when (1) + (2): 1) Your opponent is going 2nd. 2) your opponent relies on non-continous / field spells  Please comment and suggest what things could be improved :P"

You generally want to make Heatsoul + Conflict with Evil Twin Kiskil on the field and Lilla in the grave for your opponents turn. This often involves reviving Kisikil on your turn for a draw, and then linking the two into another Kisikil. If you have access to Challenge, you can make Knightmare Gryphon to floodgate your opponent or Unchained Abomination for more disruption, while still being able to revive the Twins on your opponents turn. Accesscode helps end games, and Saros Eresh Kurnugias can link off a hard to get rid of monster, as well as having some solid protection and negation.  This deck is also a work in progress, and I have various versions with different ratios or cards, such as Cynet Regression instead of Conflict, which does not rely on a Code Talker being on the field and doubles down on the ""pop-and-draw"" aspect of the Twins. One with 3 Code Generator and 1 Sea Archiver as a secondary target, for after Dotscaper has been expended, and one without Lilla Treat, because she wasn't revealed yet.  The deck has a pretty low ceiling, but I find it quite enjoyable. And if you have any questions regarding it, please ask, as my descriptions tend to be pretty basic."

This is more so a stun and control based deck, using the Paleos to fuck wit the opponent as you swarm the field. Deck guide. 3x Swap Frog- graveyard setup and easy special summon, can also serve to get out more with an extra normal summon. great card 3x Dupe Frog- pops up and searches, you'll most likely link it away or something to get it's search off 3x Poison Draw Frog- also gives a nice draw when linked away or tributed for an effect, also doesn't have a once per turn on it's draw 3x Ronintoadin- Again, easy special summon for swarming 3x Treeborn Frog- Can special summon himself for swarming, although using him can be a bit inconsitent due to the Paleos 3x Tradetoad- Monster recovery and graveyard setup in one 3x Ash Blossom- just dont play lol 2x Ghost Ogre- helps to destroy strong shit that the frogs can't get over themselves 1x Foolish Burial- gy setup 1x Monster Reborn- Utilizes the GY for more swarming 3x Canadia- flips down a problem monster so it cant activate it's effects or anything, won't work on links but can still work on problem cards like Conducter Tyranno 3x Dinomischuis- GY setup with the discard and banishes a problem card 3x Marella- GY setup for the other Paleos, so you can set up easier 3x Olenoides- destroys backrow against problem decks like Eldlich 3x Pikai- Draw power and Gy setup, super underappreciated imo 3x Trap Trick- basically searches out your traps way easier if there's one you need but didn't open Extra deck 2x Toadally Awesome- Swarming, GY setup, and negations against decks like Eldlich. Great card 2x Opabinia- searches and allows you to activate Paeleoz from hand, which is amazing 2x Anomalocaris- GY setup, draw, and destruction for cards you can't just beat over 2x Linkurboh- can be linked into from Tradetoad or Treeborn frog, then links into secure gardna 2x Secure Gardna- links into from Linkuribo, helps to stun the opponent heavily 2x Apolousa- Great negates and all around great card 2x I;P masqureana- link up into Apolousa Playing guide The deck isn't super complex or anything, as it doesn't have any long winded combos. You want to set up a strong backrow of Paelos and swarm the field with frogs by dumping them and special summoning them, then going into either A) Toadally Awesome for a normal grind game or B) Apolousa to negate and wittle them down quicker. the Apolousa route takes much more resources but can wittle down the opponent quicker, and Toadally grinds slower and swarms much better but still takes less resources, so it's up to your opening hand and GY setup to which path you want to take. Afterwards, stun your opponent heavily with the Paleos and special summon them later to make more XYZ (or links), to stun your opponent and eventually OTK them. Note: you'll want to go first for the more control based focus of the deck, and the deck costs around 139 American dollars all together, not accounting for the side deck. Also, I think this deck might come into the spotlight more and maybe be a good rouge contender, although time will tell Any suggestions are appreciated. Have a good day"

Pun intended.","Trains ALWAYS want to go second if you have the choice to. If you have to go first Dora is your best hope for survival with 4000 DEF and a protection quick-effect. <ul>  	<li>The Kaiju engine is to help break your opponents board by removing problem monsters and possibly getting you even more level 10 monsters on yours. Three Jizukiru and Gameciel to help the chances of opening one of them, and only 2 Slumbers because if you draw one Kaiju you would make the third Slumber a dead card in deck. One Kaiju card + Night Express Knight + Derricrane is usually enough for an OTK in most cases. Kaiju the problem, summon Express, Special Derricrane, XYZ into Gustav and burn for 2000. Then use Derricrane's effect to destroy the Kaiju, overlay into Liebe, activate effect to make ATK 6000 and punch for game.</li>  	<li>Dark Ruler is also a really good board breaker. Your opponent has a 15 negate board? Who cares!? Dark Ruler them then proceed to run over each of their monsters with Liebe because it can attack monsters up to the number of materials it has +1. This deck can easily spit out a 4 material Liebe to wipe an entire board. Dark Ruler + Slumber also clears boards super fast. You won't be able to OTK but you can at least set up your board to counter what they might do next turn.</li>  	<li>Switchyard is your bread and butter. Don't have the level 10 you need? Just pitch what you don't want and add what you do. Switchyard gets shut down hard by Ash Blossom, but that's where Triple Tactical Talents comes in. They Ash your search, and you say I'll draw 2 anyways, thanks. Switchyard + Pegasus +Bullet Train = 3 level 10s. Switchyard to pitch Bullet adding Derricrane. Summon Pegasus, activate effect to special Bullet from grave chaining Derricrane. If you already have those three monsters in hand, pitch Bullet to add Bullet, then do the combo again. Only this time you activate the second Bullet in hand for 4 level 10s. That's a Liebe and a Dora in one turn</li>  	<li>Urgent Schedule is one of the best cards in the deck. Special summon 2 monsters for free that triggers all of your other monsters and spells? Yes please. Depending how good or bad your hand is, you can easily end on a Liebe with Dora protection. Or, it'll save you during the battle phase by summoning two monsters to absorb some damage. The two best monsters to summon off this are Ruffian and Bullet Train because of their end phase effects to get the cards you need into your hand.</li>  	<li>Skill Drain is usually a sided card in most decks, especially in go second decks because of how slow it is to active it. But it has won me many a duel by making all my monsters giant beats sticks. All the big trains activate in hand and once they hit the field they usually lose attack damage or make you destroy stuff to attack, but with Skill Drain they stay big beaters and basically summon themselves for free.</li>  	<li>One funny combo I pull off once in a while happens when I have Switchyard on field, Urgent Schedule set, a level 10 in the grave, and a derricrane in hand. During your opponent's end phase activate Urgent Schedule to summon two monsters. Then, activate Switchyards effect to summon a level 4 and it becomes a level 10. Summon Pegasus, make it a 10, then activate Pegasus' effect to summon the level 10 from grave chaining Derricrane. Boom, 5 monsters summoned during your opponent's turn and they can't even Nibiru you. Proceed to make Dora first on your turn, then do your Gustav/Liebe combo without worry because of Dora's protection.</li>  	<li>The side deck is basically to help curb whatever is meta at the moment, with the exception of Summon Limit. Summon Limit is the only card I would never change in the side deck. Summon Limit is for when you know they are going to make you go first, or when you feel lucky and throw them off by saying you'll go first. Go first, make Dora, set Summon Limit, watch them die inside when you activate it on their second summon. After that, all you have to do is overlay Liebe as your one summon and proceed to beat everything down.</li> </ul>"

I really like <strong>Tarotrei</strong>, so I wanted to make a deck around her. And what do you know? 2 of the best flip monsters (<strong>Deus</strong> and <strong>Pot</strong>) are both level 9 and possess types and attributes that are different than <strong>Tarotrei's</strong> making them <strong>Monstrosity</strong> targets. I see this deck as a culmination of the best flip strategies available (similar to how PePe was in its prime, making use of the best pendulums available). The only thing I think I missed that deserved a chance was Shaddolls, but they don't have the position interaction of Subterrors, their levels are too small, and let's be honest, when was the last time you saw a Shaddoll player set and pass? They only do it if they have to or if the monster was summoned face-down, but most of the time they will be using the Shaddoll's monsters 2nd effect. Besides, u don't remember Shaddolls for their flip effects, do u? U remember <strong>Construct</strong>. And <strong>Winda</strong>. Fusion monsters. Sometimes summoned during your turn.  Oh yeah, FLIP effects are treated as mandatory effects. So even if the effect is optional, you will never miss timing with FLIP effects.  Putting that aside, let's get into the ratios:  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Monsters</span></strong>  <strong>Nibiru</strong>: Great hand trap, searchable off gallant granite, and can be used to pay the full cost of a ritual. It also helps when going second.  <strong>Deus X-Krawler</strong>: His first effect doesn't matter much, as you'll most likely flip him urself by the time he's summoned. His floating effect isn't a big deal either, but it can search <strong>Tarotrei</strong>. The main effect we want is the floodgate. After being flipped, it doesn't let ur opponent activate monster effects on the field. Continuous effects, as well as monster effects off the field, will not be negated. His other purposes are being a <strong>Monstrosity</strong> target and a big ritual material.  <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>: Lvl 9, so he's a <strong>Monstrosity</strong> target. He also makes for an easy ritual summon. When he is flipped, he gives u access to 1 of 4 effects: <strong>Pot of Greed</strong>, <strong>Giant Trunade</strong>, <strong>Raigeki</strong>, or the <strong>Forceful Sentry</strong>. That's right: all of those effects are on normal spell cards, 3 of which are banned, and the last of which is limited.  <strong>Subterror Behemoth Voltelluric</strong>: Our first Subterror. Same w/  <strong>Deus</strong> and <strong>Pot</strong>, he makes an easy ritual and is a target for <strong>Monstrosity</strong>. Upon being flipped, he can take control of an opponent's set monster until the end of your next turn. This may sound situational, but between <strong>Tarotrei</strong> and <strong>Subterror Guru</strong>, you'll be flipping ur opponent's monsters left and right. Another big thing to note: since you can flip ur monsters during your opponent's turn, you can use take a monster they control during their turn, and keep it until the end of ur turn. Unlike <strong>Mind Control</strong>, u have no restrictions on what u an do w/ the monster.  <strong>Subterror Guru</strong>: When he's flipped, he searches a Subterror card. Then, you can flip another monster on the field along w/ him face-down, becoming a Spell Speed 2 effect if u control another face-up Subterror card. Note that flipping, for example, <strong>Subterror Final Battle</strong> during ur opponent's turn will allow you to use <strong>Guru's</strong> second effect as if it was a quick effect, but only during that chain (unless you had a different face-up Subterror card, of course).  <strong>Deskbot 003</strong>: So ritual-focused decks have this problem: they are not naturally consistent. Thankfully, we have been give loads of Ritual support over the years. I could have had <strong>Manju</strong> here, and don't get me wrong I am considering using him. But why use <strong>Manju </strong>and search half of the requirements, w/o actually providing the fuel for the summon, when i could use a one-card combo and set up the full ritual for free? It takes up a few spots in the Extra Deck, sure, but we never really needed it, did we? We'll get into how the combo works later.  <strong>Subterror Fiendess</strong>: An omni-negate from ur hand if ur able to flip a Subterror face-down, and, while on the field can flip a monster you control (including herself) to special summon a Subterror from your hand or GY.  <strong>Deskbot 001</strong>: Needed for the <strong>Deskbot 003</strong> combo. No, we r not running multiples to mitigate the chances of a garnet, we are running 2 because the combo actually uses 2. Besides, <strong>001</strong> isn't as much of a garnet as in other engines, as even if you draw one of them <strong>Halq</strong> can summon from the hand. Even if you drew both, it still possible to pull the combo off, it would just require a bit of luck.  <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>: The entire reason I made the deck. Her archetype is worthless, but she alone is worth it. Gives you an option of <strong>Book of Moon</strong> or <strong>Book of Taiyou</strong> every turn at Spell Speed 2. Then, during your end phases, you can summon a flip monster from your hand or GY. She is your main target for <strong>WL Monstrosity's</strong> second effect, which is the one you will be using the most, as all of the other level nines in the deck share the attribute of EARTH.  <strong>Nekroz of Unicore</strong>: Part of the Deskbot Combo. Nekroz is one of the best ritual archetypes, and <strong>Nekroz of Unicore</strong> is easily one of the best ritual monsters in the game, negating the effect of all face-up monsters that were summoned from the Extra Deck.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Spells</strong></span>  <strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong>: Practically the only reason the deck is consistent. Able to search both <strong>Tarotrei</strong> and <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong>, but can also grab <strong>Tarotrei</strong> from the GY.  <strong>Terraforming</strong>: Searches <strong>The Hidden City</strong>. If this were a pure Subterror Deck, we would also use <strong>Metaverse</strong>, but since we are not completely reliant upon it, we should be fine.  <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong>: Ritual Spell for <strong>Tarotrei</strong>, searchable off <strong>Pre-Prep</strong>. It has a GY effect that allows you to banish it from the GY to search a Prediction Princess monster (in this case, <strong>Tarotrei</strong>). Note that none of the effects are once-per-turn; it's just you can't use the GY effect the turn it was sent to the GY.  <strong>Nekroz Kaleidoscope</strong>: My favorite Nekroz ritual spell, it lets you use an Extra Deck monster for your Ritual Summon. Part of the Deskbot Combo.  <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>: I've referenced this card a few times already. It has 2 effects for you to pick from. The first allows you to special summon a level 9 monster from your hand. Can't summon a Ritual Monster, but I digress. Its second effect is the more important one. You target a level 9 monster you control and summon 2 level nine monsters from your deck, as long as the attributes and types of the monsters are different than the target's. The only drawback is that these monsters cannot attack and will be destroyed during the End Phase. So what can you do with them? Well, for starters you can flip em face down w/ <strong>Tarotrei</strong> or <strong>Guru</strong>. Or could use em for an Xyz/Link. All goes down to you and what you see as the best option.  <strong>The Hidden City</strong>: Target for <strong>Terraforming</strong>, the core of any Subterror Deck. Upon activation, you can search a Subterror monster. Once per turn, you can flip a face-down Subterror face-up. Lastly, once per turn, you can flip a face-down Subterror face-up to negate an attack.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Traps</strong></span>  <strong>Subterror Final Battle</strong>: I would like to raise this up to 3, but I still have not found a card to take out. It allows you to choose one of four effects and then resets itself afterward instead of going to the GY. The effects are: 1) <strong>Book of Taiyou</strong> for Subterror monsters 2) <strong>Book of Moon</strong> for Subterror monsters 3) Turing the ATK/DEF of a Subterror monster to its combined original ATK/DEF. Note that this boost will ignore all other changes to the monster's stats. No, you can't stack 2 Final Batle boosts on the same monster. 4) Protects all of your Subterror cards from being negated. Overall, a very solid card, searchable off of <strong>Guru</strong>, not once per turn, so setting multiple is not a problem.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span>  <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong>: Used for the Deskbot Combo. A viable target for <strong>Foolish Burial Goods</strong> if you were to include it.  <strong>True King of All Calamities</strong>: <strong>VFD</strong> for short. Easily one of the best Rank 9 Xyz monsters in the entire game. Not sure if I should up him to 3, bring him down to 1, or leave him at 2. I'll have to keep testing.  <strong>Nine-Lives Cat</strong>: Similarly to <strong>VFD</strong>, a great Rank 9 considering the amount of level 9 monsters in the deck. It also allows you to summon monsters from your opponent's graveyard. It also has blanket protection that makes all of your monsters that were summoned from the GY untargetable.  <strong>Gallant Granite</strong>: Used for the Deskbot Combo, but could also search out <strong>Nibiru</strong> if necessary.  <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong>: You probably already know what this card does. The Deskbot Combo provides 2 attributes (<strong>Halq</strong>/WATER and <strong>Auroradon</strong>/WIND). <strong>Linkuriboh</strong> and <strong>Phoenix</strong> may not be summoned every game, but they provide 2 more attributes (DARK &amp; FIRE). Lastly, <strong>Subterror Behemoth Fiendess</strong> is an EARTH monster, leaving only the LIGHT attribute, but we should not need 6 pops. Hopefully.  <strong>Halq &amp; Auroradon</strong>: Only purpose is the Deskbot Combo.  <strong>Subterror Behemoth Fiendess</strong>: Your typical go-to monster after using <strong>WL Monstrosity</strong>. Can advance your game state in more ways than one, unbricking your hand and retrieving resources.  <strong>Knightmare Phoenix &amp; Linkuriboh</strong>: Both are debatable, but I would like to test them a bit more before tossing them out.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Side Deck</strong></span>  The only things I would keep here are <strong>HFD</strong>, <strong>DRNM</strong>, <strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong>, and <strong>TCBOO</strong>. The rest are all ideas and things I would like to put in the Main Deck; do not include them in your actual Side Deck.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Deskbot Combo</span></strong>  Like I mentioned earlier, I could just toss in something like <strong>Manju</strong> and call it a day, but where is the fun in that? Now while things like <strong>Manju</strong> and <strong>Foolish Burial Goods</strong> are things I would like to include, that will have to wait for another day. For now, here is a <strong>Deskbot 003</strong> Combo you can use instead: This Combo requires a singular <strong>Deskbot 003</strong> in your hand. You could also use <strong>Deskbot 001</strong> plus any other monster and make <strong>Halq</strong>, and you would get the same result. Opening a <strong>Deskbot 001</strong> is not a brick; opening 2 of them hurts, but if you can get one of them on the field with a different monster and summon <strong>Halq</strong>, you will be fine. So without further ado: <ol>  	<li> Normal Summon <strong>Deskbot 003</strong></li>  	<li> Special Summon <strong>Deskbot 001</strong></li>  	<li> Link Summon <strong>Halq</strong>, summoning your other <strong>Deskbot 001</strong></li>  	<li> Link Summon <strong>Auroradon</strong>, summoning 3 tokens and reviving both <strong>Deskbot 001s</strong></li>  	<li> Synchro Summon into 2 <strong>Heralds of the Arc Light</strong></li>  	<li> Overlay them into <strong>Gallant Granite</strong></li>  	<li> Activate <strong>Gallant Granite's</strong> effect, detaching a <strong>Herald</strong> and searching for <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong></li>  	<li> Activate <strong>Herald's</strong> effect, searching out a <strong>Tarotrei</strong></li>  	<li> Activate <strong>Auroradon's</strong> effect, tributing <strong>Gallant Granite</strong>, destroying either a card your opponent controls or your final token (just make sure <strong>Gallant Granite</strong> hits the GY)</li>  	<li> Activate the other <strong>Herald's</strong> effect, searching a <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong></li>  	<li> Ritual Summon <strong>Tarotrei</strong> using <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong></li>  	<li> During your End Phase, activate <strong>Tarotrei's</strong> effect to Special Summon the <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> from the GY or the Flip Monster of your choice</li> </ol> And now you have at the very least a <strong>Tarotrei</strong>, an <strong>Auroradon</strong>, and a Flip Monster of your choice (but if you did not have any, you could still bring back <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>). But let's say you had even an ounce of luck with your <strong>Deskbot 003</strong>. If you have one of the following cards: <strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong>, <strong>Tarotrei</strong>, <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong>, <strong>Nekroz of Unicore</strong>, and/or <strong>Nekroz Kaledeiscope</strong>, you can go a step further a set up an active <strong>Nekroz of Unicore</strong>, alongside everything else. So how does it work? So, I can't give you a run-down of every possible route, that would take too long. <strong>Nekroz Kaledeiscope</strong> allows you to use a monster from your Extra Deck as material for a Ritual Summon. The combo above only required 2 <strong>Heralds</strong>. Here is where the third comes into play. Focus your first 2 searches from the combo on getting the Nekroz cards. If you get them before the second <strong>Herald</strong> search, go ahead and start gathering the Prediction Princess duo. Ritual Summon <strong>Nekroz Unicore</strong>, sending your third and final <strong>Herald</strong> from your Extra Deck to the GY, and then activate its effect to search for your final piece of the Prediction Princess duo, and then summon her. Overall, its an enjoyable deck. We are in a combo format right now, where the top decks intend on ending the duel within the first 4 turns of the duel. Hopefully, the format slows down a bit with the December banlist (I doubt it). All suggestions are welcome and appreciated."

A Ghostrick deck dedicated to Angel of Mischief's alternate win con, by stalling and drawing to get her to 10. It's quite horrible and degenerate and I love it. And yes, I hate myself too; don't go and whine in the comments about ""degeneracy"", this is just a deck I made for shits and giggles man. Just run Cosmic Cyclone if you hate Mystic Mine that much. Anyways, deck guide. 3x Mummy- Much more usable than the last deck, since this deck only runs dark monsters. Fantastic extra normal summon 3x Skeleton- hee hee, deck mill/banish go brrr 2x Jiangshi- slow ass searcher, but it's the best you're getting in Ghostricks 1x Yeti- helps stall and protect Angel 3x Witch- Book of moon on legs, helps slow the opponent 2x Yuki-onna- also  book of moon on legs 3x Fairy- Book of Eclipse and monster recovery in one 3x Doll- Book of Eclipse on legs, also special summons and easy monster 2x Jackfrost- Basically attack negation if your mystic mine is dead or if you didnt open one 2x Lantern- see above 3x Mary- easy special summon 3x Ragged Gloves- part of the Phantom Knights engine, buffs and searches 3x Anchient Cloak- Searches, part of the Phantom Knights engine 3x Silent Boots- Easy special summon for an XYZ, part of the engine 3x Mystic Mine- Centerpiece of the deck, stalls out the opponent to get Angel to 10 1x Terraforming- Searches Mystic 1x Metaverse- Also searches/activates Mystic 3x Extragance- Easy draw, 3 of all the XYZ and such so there's not much risk 3x Angel- Get it to 10 lol 3x Alucard- removes set cards for stuff like Altergiest, also ranks up into Angel 3x Socuteboss- Monster removal, rank up into Angel 3x Dullahan- Cripples a monster and ranks up into Angel 1x Linkuribo- Banish lol 1x Unicorn- banish lol 1x Pheonix- banish lol Playing guide This deck, like my other Ghostrick one, is quite simple. Activate Mystic Mine or search it to stall out as long as possible. Use your Ghostricks to either; get enough out to make an XYZ, or set one and pass, as your opponent will most likely be unable to kill it due to Mystic Mine. Afterwards, Flip summon and normal summon, etc etc, and XYZ into Angel. From there, just stall and draw to get her to 10, and watch as everyone at your locals and play group shuns you.

Shame. Anyway, I decided to build my own version of the deck in my futile attempts to make Ghostrick work, because I love Ghostrick. Note that this deck is really more so an expierement, so any suggestions are appreciated.  Deck guide. 1x Mummy- Great extra normal summon, but locks you into dark monsters, which conflicts with the subterrors. I decided to run at 1 to avoid the xenophobia of it. 3x Skeleton- Banishes cards from the top of your opponent's deck, can be a huge mill if you've set up a board 2x Jiangshi- Easy searcher, although it's quite slow 1x Yeti- serves to stall out and protect your weak boss monsters 3x Witch- just easy book of moon on legs 2x Yuki-Onna- pretty slow but still another book of moon on legs 3x Fairy- Book of Moon and monster recovery, fantastic for the archetype 2x Nekomusume- Another Book of Moon on legs... i think im seeing a pattern here 3x Doll- Book of Eclipse on legs, and a nice special summon to set up for more plays 2x Jackfrost- Negates an attack and another book of moon on legs, also special summons himself for later 2x Mary- Easy special summons, helps to get out the XYZ 3x Ultramafus- Easy special summon and interacts well with the ghostricks flipping themselves3 3x Speleogeist- book of moon and cripples and opponent's boss monster, also see above 2x Stalagmo- Nice draw and GY setup, also easy special summon with the ghostricks 2x Umastryx- Easy monster removal and special summons itself with the ghostricks 3x Guru- Reuses flip effects, it's also part of a lock but I forget what the lock is tbh 3x Archer- shuffles monsters into the deck if they're face down, interacts really well with cards like Book of Moon and a lot of the Ghostrick's effects 3x Fiendess- Nice special summon and negate 3x Clash-  Nice stat boost, reuses cards 3x Hidden City- Negates attacks and reuses flip effects 3x Book of Moon- helps the deck as this is Book of Moon: the deck, so 2x Go-Round- Another book of moon that reuses flip monsters 3x Break- nice special summon that can go into an XYZ 3x Succesion- searches flip monsters and such, good card 2x Angel of Mischief- Boss monster lol 2x Alucard- removes set cards to fuck over decks like Altergiest, nice monster to rank up in to Angel 2x Socuteboss- Monster removal and basically eradicates a monster zone 2x Dullahan- Cripples a monster, making it easier to run over 2x Behemoth Fiendess- Nice special summon and GY setup Playing guide It's not super complex. Get out your Ghostricks and use their effects to flip them face down, then special summon some of the behemoths. Afterwards, flip them back up with one of the other card effects and overlay them into an XYZ, rank up that XYZ into a Mischief. Protect Mischief and try to get her to 10 if you want, as you go in for an OTK with the strong behemoths. Any suggestions are highly appreciated, as again, this is more of a test than anything.

Some handtraps a couple of the ""generic goodstuff"" cards could potentially be cut for another beast, beast warrior, or winged beast engine if there were another good one worth running. The extra deck isn't super flexible but Accesscode could be an easy cut for something like dweller, a second Megaclops, or a second Zeus."

All cards are legal as of 11/4/2020.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Strategy:</strong></span>  Your strategy going first should be to turbo out <strong>Shaddoll Schism </strong>(in order to summon <strong>El Shaddoll Winda </strong>on your opponents turn) by sending<strong> El Shaddoll Apkallone</strong> and <strong>Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</strong> to the graveyard using <strong>Dogmatika Maximus</strong>'s effect.  For longer matches you can repeatedly send <strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong> and <strong>PSY-Framelord Omega</strong> to the graveyard using <strong>Dogmatika Maximus</strong>'s effect to pop one of your opponent's cards and then recycle your resources back to the extra deck.  You can stop your opponent's plays using the powerful and searchable trap card <strong>Dogmatika Punishment.</strong>  When you have a clear board, an OTK can be performed by using <strong>Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted's</strong> effect to boost your Dogmatika cards attack power. You can also use <strong>Invoked Augoeides'</strong>s effect to banish a fusion monster from the graveyard to gain a temporary attack boost.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Card Choice:</strong></span>  Both handtraps <strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong> and <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> can be link summoned into <strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong> and then <strong>Secure Gardna</strong>; doing so puts an extra deck monster on the field immediately allowing you to special summon any of the Dogmatika cards from your hand. This makes <strong>Effect Veiler </strong>arguably more valuable over the other popular handtrap <strong>PSY-Framegear Gamma</strong>.  We run two of <strong>Dogmatika Maximus</strong> and <strong>Dogmatika Fleurdelis</strong> as a precaution against banishing them when we activate <strong>Pot of Desires</strong>.  Given the popularity of powerful extra deck monsters such as <strong>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</strong> we play several outs to hard-to-get-rid-of monsters: <ul>  	<li><strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><strong>Strengths:</strong></span>  The deck is very consistent. You can start your plays using just one card such as <strong>Nadir Servant</strong> or <strong>Magical Meltdown</strong>.  There is a lot of room for hand traps or other going second cards depending on the match-up.  Your turn one board is very threatening. You can end on a powerful floodgate and multiple negates (<strong>Invoked Mechaba, El Shaddoll Winda, Dogmatika Fleurdelis</strong>)  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></span>  This deck works works best if you're familiar with your opponent's strategy. You can easily lose advantage if you destroy or negate the wrong cards during your opponent's combo play.  Dogmatika effects can lock you out of the extra deck for a turn. Be mindful of when you cannot summon invoked fusion monsters.  This deck suffers if you cannot resolve <strong>Dogmatika Maximus </strong>because your opponent does not play extra deck monsters.  Your opponent can potentially counter <strong>Dogmatika Maximus</strong> with cards such as<strong> Cyber Dragon Nova</strong> or <strong>Elder Entity N'tss.</strong>  This deck is reliant on searching cards from the deck and sending cards to the graveyard and is therefore susceptible to hand traps such as <strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong> and <strong>Dimension Shifter</strong>."

Means we dont even use Zephyros while ending with the same Bardiche+Redoer(trap mat)+Dark Requiem(3 mat,"After billions of testing, I found that going Force Strix before Wise Strix eats more resource/needs more brick than going to Wise Strix directly. So, we cut all the generic r4nk engines, the only lv4 we need are the Raidraptor ones. I will explain the cards role first, before the combo.  Starters: 3 Tribute Lanius (+1 sending Mimicry), 3 Mimicry (+1), and Raiders Wing (+1 but have to start with Force Strix, it means dead if drawn with Strangle Lanius, best as combo piece). Extenders: 3 Vanishing, 3 Pain Lanius (it can become lv4), 2 Strangle Lanius (we need 2 as combo pieces) and Singing Lanius (dead if drawn with Strangle Lanius). The non-lv4: Heel Eagle, Danger Thunderbird (possible +1 but can miss), and Caligo Claw Crow. The PKs: 2 Silent Boots (to guarantee Bardiche effect, can play 1 tho), and 2 RUM Force, Shade Brigandine (combo piece, can be extender but Redoer will lose its disruption), Fog Blade (extra disruption if we draw either the RUM/Shade Brigandine).  The combo is <strong>Wise Strix+lv4</strong>, but gotta be careful to use the combo pieces cus all of them is once per turn. If we didn't open the starter, it means we have to put 3 Dark Winged-Beast (1 of them is lv4) on field. Wise Strix will summon Mimicry/Raiders Wing (depends on which one we havent used), overlay it with other lv4 we have to Force Strix, use Force add Strangle/Singing Lanius (ss it), use Wise set RUM Force, use Mimicry/Raiders Wing in GY (Mimicry can add Nest/Pain/Strangle), ss the extender, make Rusty Bardiche with Force+Wise Strix, use Bardiche send Boots set Shade Brigandine, ss Shade Brigandine on Bardiche link marker, make Force again with Strangle/Singing + the extender, use Force add another Strangle, use RUM Force banish 3 (dont banish our +1 or Heel Eagle) ss Arsenal Falcon, use Arsenal (dont detach Force) ss Vanishing, use Vanishing ss Strangle from hand, use Strangle ss lv4 from GY, make Redoer with Shade Brigandine on Bardiche link marker, use Bardiche destroy Arsenal, use Arsenal ss Ultimate Falcon, make Dark Rebellion with the remaining lv4 on Bardiche link marker, use Boots GY eff add RUM Force, set it.  On the opponent's main phase, we can use RUM Force to trigger Bardiche while summoning 3 mats Dark Requiem. Pay attention to the combo cus using Strangle effect as starter play kills the full combo (das why its only 2 copies, not 3 ofs despite being generic dark extender). Against Mekk-Knighy/zone reliant deck, we gotta place the Nest/RUM/Fogblade on the free zone or with Ultimate Falcon cus it is immune. We're using D.D. Crow as handtrap cus it's useful in combo while being not too bad against meta (Dogma: Titaniklad/Shaddoll monster, Halq: Martial Metal target/001/Plaguespreader, dino: Miscellaneousarus, Eld: anything, Zoo: Ramram), but bad against Dragoon/Zexal running rampant in TCG.  Pros: Super consistent legit board with follow-up (Nest/Raiders Wing).  Cons: 2 cards combo (3 if we dont open the +1).  &nbsp;"

I desided to try pure Kozmos. They were seemed too slow so I decided to add Artifact Scythe to slow down my opponent as well. Which actually worked pretty well. Going first against a combo deck, scythe just messes them up. Not a meta deck but can kill combo heavy meta decks with just scythe and can OTK them. Going second against combo decks however can be problematic due to the deck being slow and usually needing some setting up with Kozmo Tnican. This deck is also good against control decks.

Using Melffy and rescue rabbits to generate advantages and tribrigade to break apart boards. ,"Use Tribrigade to set up negates and push for games and melffy to enable follow up in the future turns.  &nbsp;  <strong>Fraktall/Tenki</strong>  Look for access to Tri-brigade Fraktall, Fracktall -&gt; Kit -&gt; Nervall  enable you to add Fraktall/Kerass with 3 bodies in grave.  Add Fraktall if you don't have/want to extend, since the 1900 ATK will allow it to survive to the next turn easier compared to Kerass.  Add Kerass for extending plays beyond Rescue Rabbit and later plays, or combining with with a kalantosa in hand.  They will enable you to banish the 3 bodies to summon Simorgh, Bird of Divinity and at end phase summon Mist Valley Apex Avian for a negate.  &nbsp;  <strong>Catty and Puppy(or Puppy)</strong>  If you have Catty and Puppy in hand, there are 2 lines of plays.  Use Puppy to summon Kalantosa to destroy 1 card, and Catty to search Hop Ear Squadron.  Hop Ear Squadron target Kalantosa, summon Herald.  While Herald is a negate, it also banishes monster from the deck and hand sent to GY.  This will sometime force decks to enter the battle phase to eliminate Herald before continuing combos.  Alternatively, search Rescue Rabbit or Kerass for plays next turn or  Alpha, the Master of Beasts, to out threats.  &nbsp;  <strong>Rescue Rabbit:</strong>  Puppy Catty:  Tribute Rabbit, summon Puppy, Catty, overlay into Excited Melffy  Tribrigade:  Tribute Rabbit, Summon Puppt/Catty and Tribrigade Kit.  Overlay for Melffy of the Forest, detach Kit, mill Nervall and add Kerass.  Summon Kerass, Banish 3 for Simorgh, Bird of divinity.  You can also banish 4 for Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen if you plan to use Puppy to trigger its banish effects.  &nbsp;  <strong>Nervall/Kit+Beast/Winged Beast/Beast-warrior:</strong>  Summon Nervall/Kit -&gt;Almiraj  (Kit mils Nervall)  Add Kerass, Pitch fodder, Summon Kerass  Kerass banish 2, summon Raidraptor Wise Strix  Almiraj effect, target Kerass/Wise Strix  Wise Strix +Kerass -&gt;Simorgh, Bird of Divinity  &nbsp;  <strong>Ending Games:</strong>  -Use Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom to summon tribrigade/rescue rabbit locked in hand for additional bodies or Kalantosa to pop a card.  -Use Tri-Brigade Rugal the Silver Sheller to summon monster after the battle phase to return it to your hand.  -Don't be afraid to link Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen for other monster like Accesscode Talker or Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom.  -Omen can search cards like Rescue Rabbits to extend.  -Sandayu summons a large token and is a extra beast body when sent to the grave.  -Use Acesscode Talker to chain block effects of Tribrigade links.  -Alpha, the Master of Beasts can target monster other than himself, you can bounce several cards at once.  -Consider holding back on Fraktall's second effect if you have enough bodies in grave, or use it after you summon Fraktall and use  Fraktall's effect summon a body.  &nbsp;  <strong>Where is Obedience School?</strong>  Obedience Schooled locks you into beast, and the end board for that consist of Excited Melffy and Melffy of the Forest. While powerful at times, generating pops,negates and followups, all requires Excited Melffy to resolve and your opponent to summon a monster. This is a issue since effects that activates on summon cannot be negated until you commit to a herald, which is the last interaction you have.  Compared to Mist Valley Apex Avian, Avian can negate cards at any time in the combo and cannot be targeted while dodging Nibiru. Additionally, the beast lock makes it difficult to break boards going second, taking away access to Access code Talker that pops 1-2 cards, or Omen, who banish without targetting.  &nbsp;  <strong>Where is Nealogia AA-Zeus?</strong>  It is a consideration when you lack enough reach to kill your opponent. I prefer passing on Omen for a banish and a chance to grab cards like Rescue Rabbits and Alpha compare to a board nuke. Please let me know if you feel like its good enough to run!  &nbsp;  <strong>Why the Triple Tactical Talent?</strong>  The deck should have enough handtraps and setup to survive going first, and the Triple Tactical Talent enable you to get information for optimal disruption or get some help breaking tough boards. Do keep in mind about the restriction on tribrigades's link material when stealing monsters.  &nbsp;  <strong>D.D. Crow?</strong>  Its a winged beast handtrap that can be banished for Tri-Brigade. While not quite the format staple it was, many decks still rely on the GY to generate or recur resources.  &nbsp;  <strong>Infinite Negates/Floodgates?</strong>  Barrier Statue is powerful, but its stats are weak. While we want to survive to the next turn, we cannot let the opponent build up boards with several negates since breaking those boards requires drawing above average hands.  Apex Avian and Thunderbird loop is powerful, but add additional bricks to the deck that is doesn't want to draw several of its cards. While you don't want to draw cards like Kalantosa,Nervall, or Kit, they can still help in breaking boards or starting combos. For example, Kalantosa can be used with Ferrijit the Barren Blossom to destroy cards, or overlayed with Kerass to summon Excited Melffy but drawing it alone is terrible. Nervall and Kit can start combos, but require other specific cards.  &nbsp;  Can I run one Kalantosa?  I wouldn't recommend it since having a second one in deck allow you to use it with Excited Melffy and Puppy in one turn.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

It is also has a fun gimmick to it.,"Okay so too jet stream this Fire Kings like being destroyed to use their effects. Main goal is use that Gimmicks to your advantage. Secondly all ""Fire King"" monster share this effect ""If a face-up ""Fire King"" monster you control is destroyed by a card effect (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this card from your hand."" called the ""Fire King Summon"". There are two exceptions without this ability <strong>Fire King Avatar Arvata </strong>and <strong>Fire King High Avatar Garunix</strong>. Thirdly they all have a floating effect upon their destruction.  This Deck has four Boss monsters plus a few option in the Side Deck  <span><em><strong>Boss Monsters</strong></em></span>  <strong>Fire King High Avatar Garunix</strong> likes being destroyed by card effect to only resurrect himself on the NEXT Standby Phase and destroy all other monsters on the Field indiscriminately. However, if he is destroyed by battle he can bring out a different ""Fire King"" monster from your Deck to the Field. <strong>Arvata</strong> would be a good choice because of his resurrection ability. Works well with another copy of himself and <strong>Sacred Phoenix</strong>. This will clear the Field at the start of each turn.  <strong>Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys </strong>is much like <strong>High Garunix</strong> but destroy card in the Spell and Trap card zones.  <strong>Cataclysmic Scorching Sunburner </strong>is basically a 2600, 8 started beat stick. Easy to get out because he can summon himself when one of your fire-type monster(s) is destroyed either by battle or card effect. Then deal half the ATK of one of the FIRE monsters that was sent to the Graveyard.  <strong>Bonfire Colossus </strong>is another 2600, 8 started beat stick, and easy to get out and can trigger any ""Fire King"" monster's effect. Summons himself by destroying two of FIRE monsters that you control on the Field.  <span><em><strong>Other Monsters</strong></em></span>  <strong>Fire King Avatar Arvata </strong>one of the ""Black Sheep"" of the ""Fire King"" family that doesn't do the ""Fire King Summon"". However, he has his own fun an unique ability. Being a Spell Speed 2 quick effect to negate the effect of a monster upon its activation. At the coast of destroying one FIRE monster from either the Hand or Field. Upon his own destruction by any matter, you can Special Summon one FIRE Beast, Beast-Warrior, or Winged Beast monster from your Graveyard, except himself. The catch is the it has its effects negated, and is also destroyed during the End Phase. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Both of his effects are once per a turn. However this is a good way to bring back a <strong>High Garunix</strong> that has been beaten in battle, or bring him out from your Hand with the 1st effect.  <strong>Fire King Avatar Barong </strong>after his defeat by card effect he sends a postcard to another ""Fire King"" monster in the Deck and during the <strong>NEXT </strong>Standby Phase the ""Fire King"" monster whom received the postcard is brought to the Hand. this is a good way to search for ""Fire King"" monsters in particular <strong>High Garunix</strong>, <strong>Arvata</strong>, or <strong>Yaksha</strong>.  <strong>Fire King Avatar Garunix</strong> can bring any ""Fire King Avatar"" monster from your Deck to the Field. However, <strong>Garunix </strong>must be die by your opponent's card effect or in a fight. <strong>NOTE: Arvata</strong>, or <strong>Yaksha</strong> are great targets for this effect.  <strong>Fire King Avatar Kirin </strong>brings another FIRE monster from the Deck with itself to the Graveyard when he goes in any matter. <strong>High Garunix</strong> or <strong>Sacred Phoenix </strong>are okay targets for this effect to set up a combo with <strong>Arvata </strong>or the Spell cards <strong>Onslaught of the Fire Kings </strong>or <strong>Circle of the Fire Kings</strong>.  <strong>Fire King Avatar Yaksha </strong>destroys one card in your Hand or your Field upon his destructions in any matter. This is really good to be able to active any ""Fire King"" monster's effects from the hand.  <strong>Flamvell Firedog </strong>when he defeats an opponents monster by battle you can bring any FIRE monster from your Deck to the Field with 200 DEF or less except another copy of himself. <strong>Yaksha</strong>, <strong>Barong</strong>, <strong>Flame Tiger</strong>, or <strong>Cataclysmic Scorching Sunburner</strong>.  <strong>Flame Ruler </strong>counts as two tributes for a FIRE monster.  <b> Ultimate Baseball Kid </b>gains 1000 ATK for each FIRE monster on the Field except for himself, and can send one FIRE monster you control to inflict 500 damage to your opponent.  <strong>Little Chimera </strong>is an ATK booster for FIRE monsters and ATK bane to WATER monsters.  <strong>Raging Flame Sprite </strong>is a good card all around.  <strong>Fencing Fire Ferret </strong>drags down another face up monster your opponents controls with it and inflicts 500 damage to your opponent at the same time.  <strong>Flame Tiger </strong>is just a 1800, 4 star beat stick. With a decent effect.  <span><em><strong>Spell Cards</strong></em></span>  <strong>Fire King Island </strong>well is a ticking time bomb. By that when it goes boom all your monsters on your Field go boom with it. However your ""Fire Kings"" will like that. Plus the bonus effects. 1st effect ""During your Main Phase: You can destroy 1 monster in your hand or you control, and if you do, add 1 ""Fire King"" monster from your Deck to your hand."" <strong>NOTE: </strong>It can activate ""Fire King"" effects from the hand plus searches for another ""Fire King"". It's 2nd allows you to Special Summon 1 FIRE Winged Beast-Type monster from your hand when you have no monsters on the Field. <strong>NOTE: </strong>You can only use one of these effects per a turn.  <strong>Circle of the Fire Kings </strong>allows you to basically swap one FIRE monsters for another. In other words swapping one of your FIRE monsters for a defeated <strong>High Garunix</strong> back from the beyond.  <strong>Onslaught of the Fire Kings </strong>brings out one FIRE Beast, Beast-Warrior, or Winged Beast monster from your Deck when you don't have any monsters on the Field. However, at the coast of its effect and it being destroyed at the End Phase. Wink Wink ""Fire Kings"" like that. Especially <strong>Hight Garunix</strong>.  <strong>Burden of the Mighty </strong>because this deck lacks ATK power using <strong>Burden of the Mighty </strong>to even the playing Field.  <span><em><strong>Trap Cards</strong></em></span>  <strong>Backfire </strong>does what its name suggest. When your FIRE monsters are destroyed by any means deals 500 damage to your opponent.  <strong>Kickfire </strong>is like Backfire but with counters and your monsters need to be destroyed by card effect. then you can deal 1000 damage to your opponent. <strong>NOTE:</strong> ""Fire Kings"" like being destroyed.  <strong>Phoenix Wing Wind Blast </strong>is nothing overly special just discard a card and place an opponents card on top of their deck.  <strong>Regretful Rebirth </strong>if <strong>High Garunix </strong>is beaten in battle you can bring him back with this card and use its effect at the same time.  <strong>Horn of the Phantom Beast </strong>is an ATK booster for Beast and Beast-Warrior monsters, also gives a +1 hand advantage upon defeating an opponents monster.  <em><strong><span>Extra Deck and Side Deck</span></strong></em>  Are added mostly because they look cool. They are useable but its not recommended. While the Side Deck give option of Boss Monsters that synergize well with FIRE monsters to Swap out <strong>Bonfire Colossus, </strong><strong>Cataclysmic Scorching</strong> <strong>Sunburner</strong>, <strong>Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys </strong>if you want.  Well Hope you enjoyed and Good Luck and have Fun."

IT WILL LOSE TO A WELL TIMED HAND TRAP! <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">So the deck is not linear (as the card advantage all come from drawing cards) besides the opening play of trying to make Halc (which is either rescue cat or figure someway to dump a tuner and another monster from your opening hand onto the field) for Deskbot 1 to Auroradon to Warbluran.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">From there, plays branch out depending on remaining hand but usually, use the warbluran to tribute a token to become lvl 2 and synchro away into librarian. your field should be TG librarian and Deskbot 1.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Now from there, synchro climb your way with Librarian draws and adapt to what you draw with ragin, stardust warrior, Ravenous crocodragon. Use your extra deck monster zone for monsters you know you wont keep on field to keep your main monster zone as free as possible. the easiest way to make Cosmic Blazar Dragon (or Quasar if you like it better) is actually with a Librarian, Unicore and Marshall Metal Marcher (tho Librarian, Ragin and formula also works ofc)</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Your best main deck fabled is Grimro (duh) and Krus (after you have a full GY so it functions as any fabled and also revive unicore in the end after being used as material)</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Dont be afraid to pot of avarice away less optimal creatures as sometimes its neccessary (but usually you would target extra deck monster besides auroradon because thats for Borreload savage dragon, and the next best targets are Grimro and Krus to hopefully draw them again)</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The new Tuner Alfac is similar to Kushano except its a hard once per turn but special summon itself and banish like Ganesha. So with Ganesha its an easy ragin synchro. these two are usually what I get with rescue cat to link into Halc in the beginning</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The Field spell is decent as it dumps kushano (or Alfac) and an extra discard outlet but otherwise its just an extra search target for the other New card, Marchosia (that special itself like Chawa, or be discarded to search the field or trap. both Hard once per turn effects). I am testing the trap card as another search target but probably will cut it.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">everything else is trial and error. again, the deck is not linear because its super reliant on draw (and fixing the hand with grimro after the draws) so it requires a lot of thinking in trying to reach the synchros. but it is very fun to play!</p> PS. it is very satisfying to use Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon to run over a Red-Eyes Dragoon, you should try it!"

Strengths: Consistency, First-Turn Lockdown, and the ability to power thru at least 3 negat","A budget, OG-Style, for-fun rogue deck with lots of pitching and a single go-first strat - but diverse and powerful enough that going second you can power through many boards. For those of you unfamiliar, objective A will be to get out Simorgh using Reprodocus and anything; and then get out union carrier to attach a thunderbird to it.  For the main big bad combo:  Get out simorgh with one-two cards using either crusadia (50/50 chance to extend into full board), or beast/gates, or any number of other cheeky and easy ways (gold sarc, AOD hawk/roar).  Then you want to, if possible, go into elpy. For this you can use: Brotaur Draco (you will always have this available if you do maximus play) Wyverbuster (searchable) Collapserpent (searchable) Or chaos space to search for one, giving you 7/40 chance of having one as your first card drawn, getting one off a draw, etc.  Once you get to this stage you have a few options.  A: if Chaos creator is in hand, you can make Trish, use trish + some ss'd-off-the-banish material to make carrier. Then use creator to bring back whatever you banished from YOUR OPPONENTS EXTRA DECK (or your own if theirs is really that terrible). You could get friggin toad. ABC. W/e they have that you like. With one more SS you can even make I:P masq. B: if chaos creator is NOT in hand, you can do the whole elpy-&gt;brotaur-&gt;red-eyes shabang and banish elpy for the summon, make carrier off of these mats. You will have one material left for pisty if you choose to extend. If  you can access one more dragon (outside pisty eff), you can easily make trish off of a pisty extender - and therefor make I:P masq, and a next-round apoll. C: You got no dragons for the big combo? Big oof. Don't worry, you can probably still make the infinite-negate combo, at least, and maybe at least a Bagooska or No. 38.  Red-eyes errata may hurt, but you CAN instead search out <a data-name=""Lightpulsar"">Lightpulsar</a> (very uncommonly) to get some decent good recursion. If you decide to use curious, which I don't recommend, you can plug it in to your GY for your elpy&lt;-&gt;<a data-name=""pisty"">pisty</a> combos.  The one thing you do NOT want to do is lose simorgh before your end phase - but if you ABSOLUTELY must, you can probably clean board with Almarduke. Best of all: if your opponent tried to nibiru you here, they'll be screwed over. Also, if you rich guys have Nibiru, run a copy of that instead of raigeki in your side."

Preforms well with multiple combos and Dragoon is a easy win card. I've play tested it a lot and play this irl aswell. I hope you enjoy this deck.</span>  <span>Main Deck Card Explanations:</span>  1 Toon Ancient Gear Golem - Mostly used as a tribute for Special Summoning Black Luster or if u need a beatstick with piercing  3 Toon BLS - Main Boss Monster of the Toons, once per turn banish effect, can attack the turn he's summoned, 3000 ATK, always a special summon, If you can get 2 on the field you can pull off a Number 97+Number 100 OTK  2 Toon Dark Magican - Main Card used to special summon monsters or get a Toon Kingdom/Search Card 3 is too cloggy, Plenty of R7 XYZ plays with this and Red-Eyes Toon Dragon  3 Red-Eyes Toon Dragon - Used as a way to special summon big toons from hand(so TDM,TBLS,etc), if nothing to special summon after it attacks its first time I usually xyz with TDM if I can or another Red-Eyes Toon.  2 Toon Cyber Dragon - Just like a Normal Cyber Dragon, free special summon if you have no monsters and your opponent does, mostly used if a field wipe happens, otherwise I use it as a discard target for TDM effect.No Xyzs cause he is the only level 5.  3 Toon Gemini Elf - By far the best OG toon with 1900, a discard effect when she attacks directly and the level 4 helps with a lot of xyz plays. Only downside is if Kingdom is destroyed she's destroyed but she is the only card that is destroyed this way.Xyz plays with THL  2 Toon Harpie Lady - The weakest toon attack wise but she is used for her special summon to pop a spell or trap, then if you've got another THL or TGE on the field theres alot of xyz plays like the Utopia OTK or tornado dragon for another spell/trap pop, depends on the situation.  3 The Black Stone of Legend - Main Combo Starter, tributes itself for red-eyes toon dragon, then RETD effect to special summon from hand.  1 Shadow Toon - Opponent takes dmg for the attack of one of their monsters. Can really help in a pinch if you need it. TDM effect searchs any toon card so if you need it from deck to hand to finish a match that's a good way to do it.  1 Terraforming - search for toon kingdom  3 Toon Table of Contents - main search card, isnt once per turn, search for kingdom, bookmark, or page-flip based on what you already have in hand. If you got all 3 search toon terror,toon mask, or toon breifcase.  3 Toon Bookmark - Search but mostly you just want bookmark in the graveyard to protect toon kingdom.  3 Toon Page-Flip - Free Special Summon, turn one always play kingdom then page-flip for a free special summon of either TDM,TBLS, or RETD.TDM and RETD get you another special summon so in my opinion TBLS is the worst one to get when your opponent picks one randomly to summon but he is still good regardless you just don't get another special summon.Other 2 go back into deck. If playing Irl, shuffle the 3 you chose under the table, have your oppenent chose a card.  1 Double or Nothing - Used for the Utopia OTK. 2 LVL 4 into Utopia Double, Double effect, detach and add double or nothing from deck to hand, summon out utopia on top of double, he becomes a 5000 who cant attack directly, Utopia effect to stop his attack then double or nothing to give him another attack at 10000 but it has to be a monster.  1 Comic Hand - Steal an opponents monster, they become a toon, and can attack directly and are protected by toon kingdoms effect.  3 Toon Kingdom - Banish 3 from Deck isn't too bad but if you're relying on dragoon make sure it isn't either dark magician, red-eyes black dragon, or red-eyes fusion cause that bricks the entire dragoon play. Prevents targeted effects on toons and if they'd be destroyed by battle or card effects banish cards from top of deck to keep them on the field instead so if 3 would be destroyed banish 3 from top of deck.  2 Toon Briefcase - Non-targeted way to deal with a big monster that gets summoned, sends it back to deck so really good for monsters that can't be targeted and can't be destroyed by card effects.  2 Toon Mask - Free special summons if you control toon world, target a opponents monster a special summon a monster of equal or less level.  3 Toon Terror - Omni-Negate Counter trap  1 Red-Eyes Fusion - for dragoon, you either use this if you draw it turn 1 or send it to graveyard with Verte Anaconda, like I said earlier if either 3 of the cards get banished say bye to dragoon.  1 Red-Eyes Black Dragon - only used to fuse for dragoon  1 Dark Magician - I play a Red Dark Magician for style points, only used to fuse for dragoon.  That's it for Main Deck Explanations on to Extra Deck.  <span>Extra Deck:</span>  Number 38:Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy - Used for the Numeron Dragon OTK or as a way to steal your opponents spells for materials and prevent attacks on weaker monsters.  Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon - Cannot be destroyed by card effects and inflicts 500 every time your opponent activates a card or effect.  Mecha Phantom Beast Draccosack - detach for 2 tokens, tribute 1 per turn to destroy monsters but cant attack the turn he does, if theres a token he cant be destroyed by battle or card effect.  Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon - OP Broken Boss Monster Card - If you summon this say GG and shake your opponents hand.  Number 11:Big Eye - Take a opponents Monster, cant attack turn it takes one.  Predaplant Verte Anaconda - main way to get dragoon unless you draw red-eyes fusion, pay 2000 life points and send red-eyes fusion to graveyard to fusion summon Dragoon. a simple link 2 for a boss monster.  Utopia Lighting - if utopia gets negated, go into lightning  Utopia - Part of the OTK combo with double, negate and double or nothing for 10000 into a monster  Utopia Double - detach, get double or nothing to hand, then special summon a utopia with double attached as material and the 1 attached to double, utopia gains 2500 with double as material but can attack directly  Time Thief Redoer - can distrupt opponents plays  Tornado Dragon - pop spells/traps  Number 101: Silent Honor Ark - detach 2 to steal a monster as material for this card  Evilswarm Excition Knight - Field Wipe if opponent has more cards  Number 97 - detach to summon Numeron Dragon with Number 38 as material on Numeron  Number 100:Numeron Dragon - detach to gain attack, with number 97 out he becomes a 9000 atk but with number 97 the effect locks you into attacking with numeron  <span>Side Deck</span>  If you wanna play pure toons add pot of extravagance in for the dragoon cards and switch out dragoon and anaconda for another red-eyes flare metal dragon and blackship of corn.  There is to many combos to go into but I hope you learned some plays from the explanations. Main play is 2 monsters on the field for verte anaconda to get dragoon turn one.Thanks for reading :)"

If you would suggest any (preferably cards that cost $20 or less each) what would you suggest to help cover some of the glaring weaknesses or common decks that others would be playing.  I just got back into the game last month after over a decade of not playing so help would be greatly appreciated.

With the introduction of PHRA, we get access to Plufiness the Uncoventional Commander, who allows you to banish a Metaphys Ascension from Deck to increase his Level by 1. This allows for Metaphys to have another playstarter, while buffing his Level up by 1 to combo with Hop Ear Squadron. The Crystrons are included to allow the deck to have ways to get Metaphys bricks out of hand, or get Thunder Dragondark searches more easily."

The goal is to bring out either Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon or Archfiend Black Skull Dragon, both of which are heavy hitters. Beelze is a good alternate strategy by means of Rokket Tracer for his staying power, however, his lack of protection against lockdown effects tends to make him a little less useful against stall decks. Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon though lacking in protection is a great beat stick especially against stall decks that force this deck to play the long game."
