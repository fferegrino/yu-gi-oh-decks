The general strategy is the same for most RR decks, summon Big Bird, make opponent sad. ATK for game.

With Arsenal Falcon out, as long as your opponent can't stop you, you can get some pretty large damage. 3 RR materials on it means 3 attacks during the battle phase."

""Fur Hires"" are a rather spammy beatdown-focussed archetype. Their overall goal is to fill the board with a number of monsters and use their trigger effects, which activate upon entry of other ""Fur Hires"" in case of every monster from Level 1 to 4, or trigger effects that check how many different ""Fur Hires"" you actually got on the board in case of monsters from Level 5 to 8. In addition to that, the smaller ""Fur Hires"" are all able to summon a differently named ""Fur Hire"" monster from the hand, while the bigger ones either bring some sort of protection for the crew members or negation effects. The huge number of monsters that is amassed by playing this archetype correctly can then be used for Extra Deck summons to strengthen your board presence or simply be rammed into your opponent's face for an OTK. When I was building the deck, I focussed on their spamming capabilities over making them more control-oriented. The key card is definitely ""<a data-name=""Folgo, Justice Fur Hire"">Folgo, Justice Fur Hire</a>"" and he should be the first Extra Deck card you want to summon if no other, more immediate problems are staring you in the face from the opposing side of the field.</p>
<p>Aside from chain summoning ""Fur Hire"" monsters, you can use the ""<a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>""/""<a data-name=""Reproducus"">Reproducus</a>"" combo to Special summon ""<a data-name=""Folgo, Justice Fur Hire"">Folgo, Justice Fur Hire</a>"": Use ""<a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>"" during the opposing End Phase, use two the tokens (choosing two that are not directly under the Extra Monster Zone) during your turn to summon ""<a data-name=""Reprodocus"">Reprodocus</a>"" and change the type of whatever ""<a data-name=""Reprodocus"">Reprodocus</a>"" points to into anything other the Beast (since the ""<a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>"" token is Beast-type) or Dinosaur (since ""<a data-name=""Reprodocus"">Reprodocus</a>"" is Dinosaur). Use the three monsters left on your side of the field to summon ""<a data-name=""Folgo, Justice Fur Hire"">Folgo, Justice Fur Hire</a>"", while still being able to choose a sizeable number of the archetype and not using up your Normal Summon nor any ""Fur Hire"" cards in the process. Another option featured in the deck is the use of the ""Sky Striker"" engine, which summons a token via ""<a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones"">Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones</a>"", then uses the token to summon ""<a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Kagari"">Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</a>"", who then recycles the card for another token which leaves you with a Warrior and a Machine monster and therefore an easy ""<a data-name=""Folgo, Justice Fur Hire"">Folgo, Justice Fur Hire</a>"" after your Normal Summon.</p>
<p>After you got enough of ""<a data-name=""Folgo, Justice Fur Hire"">Folgo, Justice Fur Hire</a>"" and his plays, you are more than welcome to go into other options like ""<a data-name=""Archnemeses Eschatos"">Archnemeses Eschatos</a>"" for an easy beater with an awesome effect, your archetypal big boy in ""<a data-name=""Rafale, Champion Fur Hire"">Rafale, Champion Fur Hire</a>"" with added negation or ""<a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a>"" for yet more draw and spam for further extension. The newer ""Tri-Brigade"" Extra Deck monsters can also help strengthening your board: ""<a data-name=""Tri-Brigade &lt;a data-name=&quot;Rugal the Silver Sheller&quot;&gt;Rugal the Silver Sheller&lt;/a&gt;"">Tri-Brigade </a><a data-name=""Rugal the Silver Sheller"">Rugal the Silver Sheller</a>"" can trigger the effects of your smaller ""Fur Hires"" during the opposing turn by being able to summon a Beast, Beast-Warrior or Winged Beast monster from your hand while als weakening the opposing board if he leaves the field for whatever reason, meaning that using him fo further Link summons if possible. ""<a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen"">Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen</a>"" can provide a sizeable amount of banishes if you play your cards right and have enough monsters to assemble, but in the worst case scenario he is still a 3000 ATK beater with one banish for free.</p>
<p>Other than that the deck is filled with options that allow you to continue playing more monsters after your opponent's negates or even just to get more monsters ready. ""<a data-name=""Mayhem Fur Hire"">Mayhem Fur Hire</a>"", ""<a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Rookie Fur Hire"">Rookie Fur Hire</a>"" all work in a number of situations and can provide playstarters if the first try was negated or if the effect were annulled.</p>
<p>Granted, the deck itself is nowhere near competitive, but is still able to negate fairly competently while still being able to net an OTK once in a while.

&nbsp;

The strategy is:

1. Get as many monsters on board as possible. Use Jizukiru to get rid of your opponent’s best monster. If you have other Jizukiru’s in your hand, special summon them.

2. Link summon into Borrelsword Dragon

3. Activate Overload Fusion to banish the Cyber Dragon monsters from grave to summon Chimeratech Rampage Dragon. Use both of his effects.

4. Attack with both Borrelsword and Rampage. Typically, this is enough to win.

5. If Borrelsword and Rampage don’t get the job done, activate Cyberload Fusion during the battle phase to special summon Cyber End Dragon or Cyber Eternity Dragon and swing for game.

I play 3 Machine Duplication and 2 Cyberload Fusions because they form a nice loop of recycling Cyber Dragons and prevent Machine Duplication from being completely dead as a late game top deck. The chances of bricking are worth it, and I can search Cyberload with Core."

Hope you'll have fun by stunning your opponent from playing. This deck is very aggressive and consistent.

Just spam Xyz monsters onto the field.

This deck heavily relies on its normal summon. If you don't have an extender after your normal summon is <strong>Ash Blossomed</strong> or negated somehow, your turn is basically over unless you have an extender in your and even with that, your turn won't be as great as it would've been. Your starters include <strong>Beautunaful Princess</strong>, <strong>Buzzsaw Shark</strong>, <strong>Lantern Shark</strong>, and <strong>Tin Goldfish</strong>.<strong> Beautunaful</strong> gets you to<strong> Buzzsaw</strong> or<strong> Lantern Shark</strong> from deck. <strong>Lantern Shark</strong> and <strong>Buzzsaw Shark</strong> get you to rank 3's, 4's, and 5's. <strong>Tin Goldfish</strong> isn't the best starter, but it does do the job well especially if you have the right extenders.

Your extenders include <strong>Beautunaful Princess</strong> (off of <strong>One for One</strong>), <strong>Left-Hand</strong>/<strong>Right-Hand Shark</strong>, <strong>White Stingray</strong>, and <strong>Xyz Remora</strong>. <strong>Tuna</strong> summons <strong>Buzzsaw</strong> or <strong>Lantern Shark</strong> from deck (the one whose effect you haven't used yet). <strong>Left</strong> and<strong> Right Hand</strong> are like midgame extenders; you really don't want to open with them. <strong>White Stingray</strong> is a very nice extender and recycler. <strong>Xyz Remora</strong> is best used to remove the materials from an Xyz monster and since you do, you special summon the 2 materials from grave an now you have 1 more xyz monster. The Xyz monster with no material can be used for<strong> Full Armored Crystalzero Lancer</strong> if it was a rank 5.

<strong>Lifeless Leaffish</strong> is just a fish target for your special summons. It can send your<strong> Left-Hand Shark</strong> from deck to grave to have an extender if you also control <strong>Right-Hand Shark</strong>. It can also recycle 3 fishes for you to draw 1 card.

<strong>Foolish Burial Goods</strong> send <strong>Xyz Revive Splash</strong> or <strong>Fury of Kairyu-Shin</strong>. <strong>Revive Slash</strong> banishes from grave to rank up a water xyz monster you control.<strong> Kairyu-Shin</strong> protects against board wipes. <strong>One for One</strong> is for<strong> Beautunaful Princess</strong>.<strong> RUM</strong> is for <strong>Number C101: Silent Honor DARK</strong> or <strong>Number c103: Ragnafinity</strong>. <strong>TTT</strong> since <strong>Called By</strong> is Limited (this deck rather play <strong>Called By</strong> but its more of a brick at this point). <strong>White Mirror</strong> for an extender and searcher. <strong>Whitefish Salvage</strong> recycles fish and floats into a fish when destroyed. <strong>TT</strong> since we are playing <strong>Kairyu-Shin. </strong>

Extra Deck: <strong>Abyss Dweller</strong> is of course great for its effect and it is water support. <strong>Bahamut Shark</strong> summons <strong>Toadally Awesome</strong> (which is at 2 now). <strong>D/D/D Wave High King Caesar</strong> is a non opt <strong>Solemn Warning</strong> that you can rank up into with <strong>Xyz Revive Splash</strong>. <strong>Number 101: Silent Honor ARK</strong> since it is for <strong>RUM</strong> and it's removal.<strong> Number 103: Ragnazero</strong> since it's a <strong>RUM</strong> target and more removal. <strong>Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark</strong> since it floats into a monster (also Manga ZEXAL is waaaay better than the anime).<strong> Number C101: Silent Honor DARK</strong> and <strong>Number C101: Ragnafinity</strong> for your<strong> RUM</strong> targets. 2 <strong>Toads</strong> for<strong> Bahamut Shark</strong>. 2 <strong>Valiant Shark Lancers</strong> as <strong>Dridents</strong> and a <strong>RUM</strong> stacker. Also <strong>Mistarboy</strong> since water deck.

Side Deck has the staple himself,<strong> Nibiru</strong>, along with your third copy of <strong>Fury of Kairyu-Shin</strong> and <strong>Xyz Revive Splash</strong>. <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> for going second removal. Your second and third <strong>TT</strong> for <strong>Kairyu-Shin</strong>. 2 <strong>White Howling</strong> for spell decks. Finally, 3<strong> Infinite Impermanence</strong> as disruption."

My first version of this combination.","This deck can go for crazy combos. If you mill enough Mezukis you can build almost every board. The strenghts  of this deck is, that it has many possibilities going first.
You can summon things like Apollousa, Doomking, Avramax, Archlord Kristia or Rank 8 XYZ. The weakness is the lack of constance. If your mills are bad or your hand is to bricky this deck will suck. But summoning the new Chaos Ruler will help alot. After he arrives the combos can go on."

some card notes:

Mahad: Servant puts him to the top, and can draw him (assuming theres a dm/g out already) and if you activate it their endstep, draw and summon it, you could be looking at a draw 3 with servant banish. Also jfc there are so many Dark monsters rn, boy can smack through an eldlich or a savage dragon.

Girl: If you don't run at least a copy, the dark magicians cant float at all, also sending her off of souls isn't unreasonable if you don't have an eternal soul at the ready for DM, you can bring her back with it too, buuut if you weren't using it to make verte you'd be summoning DM lets be real. Could be a REBD if you want the second pop

Keeper: If you're holding DM, it's a one card dragoon! if not, it searches REF for next turn (if they negate the effect activation so you're not locked into fusions, you can use it and either souls or apprentice to make verte, which remains a instant dragoon)

Blue Boy: haha draw engine go brrrrrr

Eye of Timaeus: So the downsides, it has to target a DM, and you cant search it at all, but you don't need a second material, it makes all your fusions, and all it requires is an on board DM, it's probably not actually good enough, but god if it doesn't feel great singing its name to the eye of the tiger while slapping down a dragoon.

Secrets of Dark Magic: Quick play poly, searchable, use it after you spend all your attacks to get in for lethal.

&nbsp;

Big eye: Steal their shit and hit em with it, probably could be some link 3 instead

Selene: Super easy to make, then jumps right into Accesscode, giving it 3k boost"

From this we can use these cards to make link summons from almeraj to crystron Halqifibrax to search Deskbot 001. From this you can make Auroradon to trigger deskbot 001 in grav to bring it back onto the  field from grav to essentially make VFD. After we made this combo, using cards in hand and draw advantage from comboing into VFD we can use the effects of Dogmatika. This makes it more consistent for Dogmatika to trigger their effects onto the field.

Cant get more meta then this deck, but it","<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Very consistent build of the new Dogmatika archetype in combination with the invoked boy. Dogmatika is currently a decent archetype but needs support from other cards/engines to make it competitive. Iblee and sangan are in this list for consistency and to create a 'softlock' with winda. Both cards also set up the dogmatika combo the same as aleister does. Additionally if meltdown/terraforming gets ashed you still have a decent NS with those cards. Iblee and sangan are no bricks, bc. you can send them with shaddoll apkallone, forbidden droplets or mechaba even if you have aleister as your NS. They basically add consistency and multiple options in matchups to the deck. &lt;3

<strong>DISCLAIMER: </strong>The ratios of the cards are not final! Needs more testing to 'perfect' the build -&gt; Comment if you know better ratios of the cards used :)

------------------------------------------------------------

<strong>Tbh. you dont need to run the invoked engine in this deck!</strong> Its just very compact so you can maindeck a bunch of handtraps to play against the other meta b***s**t.

In addition i decided to run iblee and sangan. Both cards do basically the same as aleister, just differently. 4Head

<strong>Sangan is worse than aleister</strong> as a starter but searches a handtrap/ecclesia for the next turn.

<strong>Iblee is arguably better/worse than aleister.</strong> But iblee sets up a 'softlock' with iblee on opponents board and only 1 SS with winda (+ shaddoll schism disruption). In addition iblee prevents handtraps like nibiru, impermanence, phantazmei, gamma, and more... By itself iblee absolutely destroys meta decks like eldlich, bc. they usually dont play an extradeck link card (in high level competitive play) to out it. -&gt; Free win going first!

-&gt; <strong>Both cards do not interfere with aleister as the better NS.</strong> You can still send sangan/iblee from the hand to resolve the shaddoll apkallone, forbidden droplets or mechaba.

&nbsp;

<strong>Other cards than the invoked engine could be (no complete list):</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>3x sangan + 2x tour guide to search even more handtraps or Ecclesia in the EP</li>
 	<li>3x mekk-knight orcust girsu with a very small orcust engine -&gt; but plays get very complicated, bc. orcust locks into darks; but it is possible to do combos: e.g. galatea + crescendo or just dingirsu for protection</li>
 	<li>3x iblee + cynet mining -&gt; again iblee is super underrated as a 1 card NS that stops handtraps</li>
 	<li>3x formud skipper with parallel exceed -&gt; but needs min. 2 extra deck spaces</li>
 	<li>3x trickstar candina + corobane + light stage</li>
 	<li>gizmek, cyber dragon, time thief, true draco,...</li>
 	<li>.... pretty much any 1-card engine that does something usefull and has a dark/light attribute</li>
</ul>
<strong>PS:</strong> Sidedeck is garbage -&gt; basically just cards good against eldlich, bc. i hate this deck with a burning passion

Thanks for reading and you are beautiful &lt;3

<span>-If you have Ice Bell in starting hand use its effect so you end up with Crystal Wing without using Normal Summon. If you also have Aleister you can Normal Summon it to go to Invoked Raidjin.</span>

<span>-Use Cyber Dragons to go to Infinity or use them from the hand for Invoked Mechaba.</span>

<span>-Use Ash Blossom for Invoked Purgatrio.</span>

-<span>You can also use Invocation on 2+ Cyber Dragons in your hand to go into Chimeratech Rampage Dragon that can pop back row and gain aditional attacks.</span>

<span>-Try to control the Duel with Mechaba, Crystal Wing and other negates.</span>

Today I created a Heroic Challenger Deck. This Deck revolves around using multiple Heroic monsters to bring out their Xyz monsters. Their best card, <a data-name=""Heroic Challenger - Thousand Blades"">Heroic Challenger - Thousand Blades, can bring out any of the Heroic monsters from the Deck, but for it's cost, you are restricted to Summoning only Heroic Xyz monsters for the rest of the turn, which is kind of a bummer, but understandable. But despite this, they were overall not as bad as a Deck I thought it would be. Below are some tips and things you should know about the Deck.</a>

 	<li>This Deck can be at it's best when going second. Going first isn't terrible for the Deck, but they do not have as many options. The best move you should perform if this happens is to go into <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>, <a data-name=""Heroic Champion - Gandiva"">Heroic Champion - Gandiva</a>, <a data-name=""Heroic Champion - Excalibur"">Heroic Champion - Excalibur</a>, or even Kusanagi if you want.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>Starters: Photon Thrasher, Heroic Challenger - Assault Halberd, Goblindbergh, and Neo Space Connector. Lightning Storm for going second if opponent has a troublesome board.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>The Side Deck has the rest of the archetype along with other cards that work well with the Deck. Do whatever you please with it.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>For those who don't know how Isolde Combo works with Deck: Normal Summon Connector, then use it's effect to Special Summon Aqua Dolphin (Dolphin's effect isn't mandatory). Use them both to Link Summon Isolde, then use effect to add any HEROIC (since we will be bringing out Thousand Blades). Use Isolde's effect to send 4 Equips to GY, then Special Summon Thousand Blades. You can also use her effect for any other ones, but I mainly use her for Thousand Blades.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

That's all. Enjoy the Deck! :)"

I´ve been back at the game and had the chance to playtest the beautiful Cyber Dragon Deck in real life against the current strongest Meta-Decks like Adamancipator, Eldlich, Dragonlink, Salamangreat and so on.

So I tried the basic build with 3x Cyber Dragon and 3x Machine duplications but I felt I briked alot because I had either 2 machine dupes in every turn in hand or 2 cyber Dragons included one machine dupe so there where like 3 cards always that hold me up from playing the game consistent.

For my new strategy I was thinking about how many handtraps the current top tier contestors play and how can I build a viable CyDra-Deck that can compete with them?

Let us look over the Deck:

Monsters:

1x Cyber Dragon = your target for  herz or Nachster

3x Core = Basic Game-Starter who searches you any spell or trap, usually searches plant or emergency for your herz/soldie

3x Herz = Target to get on the grave and has synergie with Galaxy Soldier

2x Nachster= You want him in the grind game or after you get nibirud in the with summon what is rare because you have Infinity always on your 5th

1x Vier = target for cyberload fusion or just chainblocking core !carefull he can destroy your plans to 5th summon Infinity and get Nibirued

3x Soldier = basic play into infinity and our rank 5

2x Jizikiru = clean out the opponents board from their boss monsters and you can use him for fotrtress dragon

1x Pankratops = great going second card with removal

3x Ash = holds enemy from detaching or just searching from deck

3x Veiler = usefull against Needlefiber and to stop your opponents monster from their effects + target f or galaxy soldier effect

3x Gamma = nice handtrap stops Opponent from play and can quick end their turn

1x Frame = target for gamma

Spells:

3x Emergency = basic searcher

1x Revsystem = reborn for your cydras or ss from hand

1x Plant = searches your galaxy soldier from deck or herz if needed in hand

1x cyberload = target anaconda or give tickle out last dmg for the otk

1x overload = basic target anaconda for your rampage

1x one for one = combo starter and extender

1x foolish = extender and bait for ash

Traps:

1x Overflow = good removal

2x evenly = I don´t got 3 otherwise I would run 3 of them great if you can´t otk that turn or need to clean board

1x red reboot = for the otk and anti trap from your opponent

3x Imperm = negates one effect and is pretty necessary

Extra:

Almiraj = Basic target to get core in grave for plant

Relinq = generic link 1 perfect target for herz and nachster can also soak the kaiju you place to your opponents side

Anaconda = Basic OTK enabler

Sieger = another otk enabler and also protecting your cydras with 2.1k boost

2x Nova = basic rank 5 target, second effect is nice if get nibirued to early

2x infinity = why not, more infinity more negates

2x Rampage = basic fusion target to otk and remove 2 or more

1x Drill Driver = new monster want to test it but seems nice with getting one level 5 back

1x Twin = Can OTK with Cyberload Fusion

2x Megafleet = removal from linkmonster

1x Fortress = removal all machine monsters amazing against orcust and also good if the enemy controlls a kaiju from you

Side:

I put the Dragoon engine in it because we want him as soon as he is released.. more negates more consistency with Anaconda. I would switch Effect Veiler for this Engine and in my Extra Deck maybe the Drill Driver

Can be played like Beat or Control depending on how the situation demands. I opted for 2 Card Destruction to hard counter Exodia... but this is pretty debatable. Now I would probably cut one in favor of at least one more Judge Man. Siding into Soul Exchange is more consistent against an Exodia deck anyway, as smokescreening into Standard is normal enough.

We are using <strong>Forbidden Droplets</strong> to negate your opponent's monsters' effect and to halve their ATK to start building up the OTK. We have <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> if we don't open <strong>Forbidden Droplets</strong> or if we have backrow to destroy. <strong>Red Reboot</strong> for traps. <strong>Nibiru, Ash Blossom</strong>, and <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> to disrupt your opponent. This deck doesn't need that much engine cards just like <strong>Salamangreat</strong> so you can play a lot more handtraps and disruptions for going second.

Your main starter is <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight</strong> since it gets you to <strong>Curse of Dragon, the Cursed Dragon</strong> which gets you <strong>Spiral Fusion</strong> which gets you <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons</strong> (an abomination of a localization if you ask me). That is then the full OTK. <strong>Spiral Fusion</strong> gives your <strong>Gaia</strong> fusion 2600 more ATK and another attack. <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons</strong> then gains 2600 more ATK when it destroys a monster by battle. You can also have it lose 2600 ATK to target 1 card and destroy it. <strong>Artillery Catapult Turtle</strong> gets to to <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight</strong> or <strong>Curse of Dragon, the Cursed Dragon</strong> from your deck.

Field spells include <strong>Gateway to Chaos</strong> and <strong>Charging Gaia</strong> to search <strong>Gaia</strong> cards and <strong>Charging Gaia</strong> also gives you battle phase protection. <strong>Set Rotation</strong> because there is no reason not top play it in this situation.

<strong>Spiral Spear Strike</strong> is for piercing and a sort of ""win-more draw power.""

<strong>Sky Galloping Gaia the Dragon Champion</strong> to search <strong>Spiral Spear Strike</strong>. <strong>Idaten</strong> and <strong>Shura</strong> because why not. <strong>Knightmare Phoenix</strong> to destroy spells and traps. <strong>Proxy F Magician</strong> to get to some Fusion Plays. <strong>Soldier of Chaos</strong> because it good.

There isn't much to explain about this deck since OTK decks relatively are very simple."

Banished cards essentialy act as a second graveyard where you can utilize the effects of cards such as The Chaos Creator, Thunder Dragonduo, and Chaos Space to recycle cards which you have already used and banished.

Step 1 is to get Nopenguin either on the field or in the Graveyard. He will be very important for later.

Then, if you draw an Aquarium Stage, you should totally activate it. Then set either Penguin Soldier or Nightmare Penguin face down. Their effects send cards from your opponent's field back to the hand. Except they don't, because the effect of Nopenguin will Special Summon itself from the GY, and then any effect that would cause a monster to return to the hand will banish it instead. Then, thanks to Aquarium Stage, your WATER attribute monsters won't be destroyed by battle.

If you're worried about some useless face-up penguins crowding up your field, don't worry. Book of Moon, Book of Eclipse or Ghostrick Doll can make sure they go back face down so you can use their effects again.

Once you've crippled your opponent's deck, you'll need to attack. That's why this deck had options. Tributing one monster will allow you to summon Great Emperor Penguin, which will allow you to Special Summon two other penguins. There are also plenty of Rank 3 and 4 Xyz monsters in the Extra Deck to use, though these can be swapped out with any you prefer. We just need something to attack with once we've banished all your opponent's important cards.

Royal Decree is also in this Deck, because most of the cards that would stop this strategy are Trap Cards, and we don't really need Trap Cards in this Deck anyway."

This can easily be achieved with its many searches such as Wicckid and Alembertian, which is gotten to via Link Disciple and Link Devotee. But in the scenario where you have to first you can change your Final sigma into a I:P, a set Superfactorial with Diameter in GY for an extra negate and any hand trap you have drawn. The deck can play through quite a few disruptions and in the grind game, it gets really hard for your opponent to out Final Sigma. All in all its a fun OTK deck that core is relatively cheap if you buy 1 Alembertian. I hope you enjoyed, bye."

The Deck has some versatility as you can use different Elemental Heroes for different purposes.

One of the few boss monsters can make sure your opponent isn't able to use any floating effects like Sangan as it will be banished instead of being sent to the GY thanks to the effect of Elemental Hero Dark Law, on top of that whenever your opponent draws or searches their deck for a card(s) they will randomly have to banish one card from their hand.

Elemental Hero Anki can make sure you can keep attacking more than once, when it destroys a monster by battle and sends it to the GY, however be aware that this will not work when Elemental Hero Dark Law is out as it will also circumvent the effects of monsters you control that rely on destroying and sending other monsters to the GY.

Elemental Hero Acid can make short work of your opponent's backrow, while Elemental Hero Blast can cut a monster's ATK in half and is also able to send a spell/trap card back to your opponent's hand at the cost of 500 LP, once in either player's turn.

&nbsp;

I'd just suggest trying the deck out and seeing for yourself.

You have to hit level 1 extenders on your way through the combo, but the card draw really helps, and you set up Roland into Charlemange very easily. The advantages to this engine (over Romulus Dragons) are access to Calamities is that your Gearfried is significantly more powerful and reliable, and you can search without stretching yourself too far in deck building. The disadvantage is lack of good access to great 1 card starters - the deck relies so heavily on Fire Warriors that trying to run Neo-Space Connector or Amra Knight engines seems iffy. It also generally ends on smaller board states, though you could argue making Calamities a lot of the time is better than a board full of negates (I'm not 100% sure this is the case, but it's true often enough).

Added Smoke Grenade of the Thief and replaced the Fire engine with the Aqua Dolphin engine, giving us 5 ways to rip cards out of our opponent's hand. This slightly reduces the level 1 count of the deck, but the deck is a very flexible combo deck, so making Calamities slightly less often isn't such a big deal (especially with Gearfried as an easy level 9)."

Orcust is still super strong and with these 3 engines combined you can not brick, go first or second and win! In testing the deck did extremely well and this is 100% competitive just like my other decks I post for you guys. Going first you can do full Orcust combo and / or end on Mechaba, using Aleister to make Almiraj, then set <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> under Almiraj and special summon any Mekk-Knight then with Almiraj and that Mekk-Knight you go into <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star"">Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star</a> <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight of The Morning Star"">and search Succession and special summon back the Mekk-Knight. From this point you can use the two Mekk-Knights to go into </a><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Spectrum Supreme"">Mekk-Knight Spectrum Supreme</a><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight of The Morning Star"">, which is a cool tech I like because he is hard to get over. Also, ending on Mechaba after that. Although if you have an extra monster you can use it and the Mekk-Knight special summoned from Succession in the previous step to go into IP. Then use Invocation to banish Aleister plus the Mekk-Knight to fusion summon Mechaba. You can also do full Orcust combo, it just depends on your hand. During your opponent's turn you can use IP's effect to use itself and Mekk-Knight Morning Star to go into the Mekk-Knight Crusadia Link 4. It will be almost impossible for your opponent to get over considering you also have a Mechaba / Orcust stuff on board. Going second you just special summon the Mekk-Knights and OTK using cards like </a><a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight of The Morning Star""> and Purgatrio etc... The cool thing I like about this deck is Blue Sky can search Girsu, which is normal summon for full Orcust combo. Pretty crazy huh?! If your opponent somehow stops you from playing going second, sometimes you will be able to use the Orcust engine to continue playing and OTK through. Hope you guys enjoy!</a>"

Because Ghostricks give accesses to easily searchable book of moon like effects while letting you abuse cards like <a data-name=""Altergeist Multifaker"">Altergeist Multifaker</a>.

<strong><span>How does the deck Play?</span></strong>

.           The Decks goal is at a bare minimum to use free special summons of 1v1 3 monsters to make <a data-name=""Ghostrick Alucard"">Ghostrick Alucard</a> into <a data-name=""Ghostrick Angel of Mischief"">Ghostrick Angel of Mischief</a>. This lets you 1.) Get a free Ghostrick name on the field, 2.) Search a Ghostrick Spell/Trap for free, and 3.) Leave an open normal summon for a Ghostrick Monster to lock your opponent. Optimally the deck searches <a data-name=""Ghostrick Scare"">Ghostrick Scare</a> and sets <a data-name=""Ghostrick Nekomusume"">Ghostrick Nekomusume</a>, This is a recur-able Book of Moon that turns into a flood-gate that flips all level 4 or higher monsters face down.

With the regular rank 3 toolbox cards like <a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse"">Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse</a>, and<a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow""> Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a> can help provide additional negates/ card destructions to help solve matchups. The deck also plays a small Burning abyss engine, because with any 2 level 3 monsters you can get access to <a data-name=""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss</a>, he lets you send <a data-name=""Graff, Malebranche of the burning Abyss"">Graff, Malebranche of the burning Abyss</a> to special any of the Burning abyss monsters in your deck letting you extend your plays this turn and gain recursion for the next.

<a data-name=""Altergeist Multifaker"">Altergeist Multifaker</a> is my favorite tech in deck letting you get additional value off of any trap card. It might seem weird at first to tech Multifaker with so few trap cards in the main deck but that is such a small problem due to how searchable the Ghostrick spell/trap line up is. A small thing to note is that while <a data-name=""Ghostrick Scare"">Ghostrick Scare</a> can’t always be activated <a data-name=""Ghostrick Night"">Ghostrick Night</a> can always be activated, so sometimes it’s worth it to search night instead if Multifaker is in your hand and you can’t get a face down Ghostrick monster on the board.

I’ll also mention here that<a data-name=""Marauding Captain""> Marauding Captain</a> is a very good card in this deck that lets you special summon a Ghostrick monster ignoring its' must be set condition, while also being a level 3 monster.

&nbsp;

<strong><span>What Weaknesses Does the Deck Have?</span></strong>

Outside of raw power and dependence on going first the deck is relatively decent. It’s surprisingly consistent, Book of moon Effects are very powerful in the current game, and the deck even has decent recursion. Looking at the current state of Yugioh sometimes it’s just not enough to have a few floodgates and disruptions.

&nbsp;

<strong><span>What to do Going Second?</span></strong>

&nbsp;

Side out the Ghostrick main deck cards, Side in handtraps. Spam monsters to get to links like <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> and try to OTK."

That's what cards like ""Coffin Seller"", ""Nightmare Wheel"", ""Bowganian"", ""Lava Golem"" are for. Adding to these the classic cards Marik uses to stall the opponent, like ""Holding Arms"", Vengeful Bog Spirit"", ""Mirror Force"" and ""Metal Reflect Slime"", makes of his deck a force to be rockoned with. Also, the recent support around this last card: ""Reactor Slime"" and ""Egyptian God Slime"" make possible a whole new play around ""MRS"". (EGS run at 3 because Reactor Slime allows for recovery of MRS which is alone required to summon its fusion"".

The strong calibers are here represented by ""Helpoemer"", ""Legendary Fiend"" and ""Masked Beast Des Gardius"".

However the strong point of Marik's deck is represented by its egyptian god: ""The Winged Dragon of Ra"". Almost useless some time ago, now it has been relaunched greatly in the game by the new support that makes use of the very strong effects Ra had in the anime: ""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"" and ""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Immortal Phoenix"", but also the spell cards ""Ancient Chant"", ""Blaze Cannon"" and ""Millenium Revelation"", that allow for good search power and recovery of Ra from the grave. ""Monster Reincarnation"" to boost even more the recovery of your god card from the grave and of those monsters like ""Juragedo"", which is much better to have back in hand rather than special summoned.

Also the classico common cards of the Duel Monsters era remain: ""Pot of Greed"", ""Graceful Charity"" and ""Monster Reborn"", a key card in this deck."

Though it does not make use of all the new Red-Eyes support, because it would be out of character for Joey, whose deck is more focused on warrior monsters and luck cards. In that regard, in this deck you'll find ""Fairy Box"", ""Time Wizard"" and its beautiful two fusion evolutions: ""Time Magus"" and ""Time Magic Hammer"". Along with the remaining Hermos fusions: ""Goddes Bow"", ""Rocket Hermos Cannon"" and ""Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword"", the deck also runs two new fusions that may very well be run by Joey: ""Re-Eyes Slash Dragon"" and ""Gilti-Gearfried the Magical Steel Knight"", which are a good balance between Joey's Red-Eyes play and its warriors.

The deck runs numerous warrior monsters: three copies of Blue Flame Swordsman, which give a very good performance when played with ""Marauding Captain"" and ""Valkyrian Knight"" (that even though not part of Joey's cards I added to the deck because of its good interactions with the above said cards).

Then the classic Jinzo, Gearfried and its evolution and, to conclude, some support for Red-Eyes used by Joey in the anime: ""Paladin of Dark Dragon"" and the very good ""Lord of the Red"". Manju of 10.000 hands to ease their summon. ""Fusion Reserve"" to recover Polymerization and work faster on your fusions."

&nbsp;

First of all: <strong>This Deck is not handtrap proof</strong>, you may play around one or at most two but more then that or a Nibiru is a dead end usually.

<strong>Consistency is lost to reach the needed DMG to FTK for a Tag Duel</strong>, if you only play 1 vs 1 I would recommend to build the 40 card Deck from the original post. There are a lot of different cards splashed in, except for the combo enablers, because every Main Deck Monster effect is a HOPT.

<strong>There is no specific combo, except for the last</strong> <strong>steps.</strong><strong> </strong>I'll mention important parts below.

<strong>This Deck includes OCG and TCG exclusive cards: </strong>Decode Talker Heatsoul (OCG), Code Exporter (OCG) and Scrypton (TCG). I would cut out Scrypton but need to replace it with something, so that the Deck still works.

&nbsp;

<em>Q&amp;A:</em>

<strong>What is the main play?</strong>

Link climbing. Most of the Deck consists of monsters that special summon themselves or act as extenders. You will need enough Link monsters in your GY, so that the <strong>combined Linkrating equals 28</strong>.

<strong>Why consists the Deck of 48 cards.</strong>

After trying to optimize it I noticed that a 40 card Deck could never be enough to mill for Cyberse Clock Dragon. You have to mill 30 cards from your Deck, <strong>after</strong> Link climbing like crazy and searching through your Deck countless times. 48 cards gives the best consistency (seeing your important Combo cards in the Starting Hand), while having enough to mill at the end. It depends sometimes, how you combo of, keep track of your Deck Size, because Cyberse Clock Dragon <strong>can't mill more</strong> then you have in your Deck.

<strong>Which cards are important?</strong>

The only important card is <strong>Cynet Codec. </strong>It is searchable with <strong>Micro Coder</strong>. Lady Debug and One for One can search Micro Coder so you are basically playing 10 copies of Cynet Codec.

<strong>Garnets?</strong>

<strong>Starliege Seyfert </strong>(if you don't have already Levianeer in the hand) and <strong>Catapult Turtle. </strong>Depending on the Starting Hand you can get rid of 1 Garnet with Cynet Mining (also searchable with Micro Coder: <span>search it only if you already have a Cynet Codec in hand</span>)but opening both Garnets is a Combokiller.

<strong>How does the FTK work?</strong>

Cynet Codec is your endless extender. Link climb until the combined Link rating of your Link monster on the Field and in the GY equal 28, keep track of your Deck Size that must also be in the best case scenario 30 at the end of Link climbing.

<span>Important: <span>While almost any Effect locks you into special summoning Cyberse from the Extra Deck, Transcode Talker's effect locks you entirely into Cyberse. <strong>Do not activate Transcode Talker's effect to special summon from GY. </strong>Otherwise you can't summon Levianeer and Catapult Turtle for the finishing blow.</span></span>

You will need 1 copy of <strong>Clock Wyvern</strong> in your hand: searchable with Cynet Codec, when summoning <strong>Excode Talker.</strong>

You will need <strong>Cynet Fusion</strong> in your hand: searchable with <strong>Clock Spartoi.</strong>

You will need <strong>at least 2 monster including at least 1 Link </strong>on your field after finishing the Link grind.
<ol>
 	<li>Activate Cynet Fusion and Fusion with Cyberse Clock Dragon with Clock Wyvern and 1 Link monster on the field.</li>
 	<li><strong>Do not </strong>activate Cyberse Clock Wyverns effect yet.</li>
 	<li>Link into <strong>Clock Lizard.</strong></li>
 	<li>Activate Clock Lizard's effect.</li>
 	<li>Bounce Cyberse Clock Dragon back into the Extra Deck and choose your Fusion materials from your GY. <span>Now you have to count the combined Link rating of the Fusion materials, those must equal your remaining cards in your Deck and has to be at least 30. You climbed for 28 because Clock Lizard is a must play and also a Link 2.</span></li>
 	<li>Summon Cyberse Clock Dragon again <strong>and activate his effect.</strong> Mill 30 cards from your Deck (best case, because we need Catapult Turtle, Starliege Seyfert and Chaos Dragon Levianeer in the GY. It could happen that if you have 31 cards left in your Deck and mill only 30, that on of those 3 is missing. <span>Better mill everything, then bricking</span>)<span>.</span></li>
 	<li>Cyberse Clock Dragons ATK increases for 30k points, all in all 32,5k.</li>
 	<li>Activate Starliege Seyferts GY activate and add Levianeer from GY to hand.</li>
 	<li>Special Summon Levianeer from your hand by banishing <strong>only LIGHT monsters</strong> from your GY.</li>
 	<li>Activate Levianeers effect and special summon Catapult Turtle from GY.</li>
 	<li>Use Catapult Turtle's effect and tribute Cyberse Clock Dragon.</li>
