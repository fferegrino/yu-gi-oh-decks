<span>The main play behind Flundereeze is starting a train of Normal Summons every turn while maintaining an oppressive board, especially on your opponent's turn. I imagine this archetype as Ursarctics if they were done right. :,)</span>

<span>Note that the Normal Summon train consists of resolving every HOPT effect of your Flundereeze monsters while also recycling themselves from being banished. It won't be interrupted by removal, but negates will shut them down. Be careful that you can't stop the train to set up a Spell or Trap and then pick up where you left off without another way to Normal Summon again.</span>

<span><strong>PROS:</strong></span>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1-card bread &amp; butter combo.</span></li>

I have been playing HEROs since Stratos came back to 1 in September 2018, three years ago ever since as my main deck. When Stratos was unlimited I played him at three and played 3 e-call. Over time I have realized that he just really does nothing. This came up to me after my friend and I have been playing each other for so long. He used to negate Stratos and I would just combo off afterwards with Faris or fusion destiny that was in my hand. He stopped negating Stratos and waited until I would use faris and negate him. I was then dead in the water unless I drew my 3 of Fusion destiny. If I go Faris first and he negates, what am I going to do with normal summon Stratos? The only real thing I could do is search honest neos and attack if going second. I could search the evil hero if I had one but they too much for 1 card and will probably be reprinted soon. All I am trying to say is that Stratos is not the best normal summon in the deck. I have discovered that Vyon is my favorite thing to normal summon and that I don't even like doing the Faris combo anymore.

Normal summon Vyon send Shadow Mist is essentially the same thing as Normal summon Stratos, they both search any HERO monster. But the kicker is that Vyon has a second effect that you can use immediately after by banishing the shadow mist and searching a polymerization. Which is +1 in card advantage making Vyon so much better. The other notable differences between the two is that Vyon is dark so he can be used to make Dark Law, especially when the opponent uses Effect Veiler or Infinite Impermanence on your Vyon when he uses his effect. Sure you can mask change Stratos too to dodge the negation but you have to make Masked Hero Blast which takes up a whole extra deck slot and just isn't as impactful as Dark Law. Stratos is still a good card and I believe that two in the deck is a good number to run. I love searching a Stratos during combo for a followup in the next turn to blow up my opponents back row, its just so satisfying. He is also a great target for A Hero Lives and it hurts when you have only 1 Stratos and it is in your hand when you want to resolve A Hero Lives using him so I like two. He is also an Elemental Hero which is important when making any of the omni heros with super poly. That is why I prefer 2 Stratos 3 Vyon. As for the other potential normal summons, Liquid and Solid soldiers, I feel like Solid Soldier is just a win more card that is really clunky and I always find myself siding him out every game. Liquid soldier is my favorite card in the deck. I really can't play the deck without him anymore. Liquid being a draw 2 discard 1 twice in one duel gives me so much flexibility. I rarely use his normal summon effect unless I either have to or I am searching mask change with shadow mist turn one which does come up sometimes, especially with the one card combo of Fusion Destiny. So I run zero solid soldier and one liquid soldier.

For the rest of the Vision HEROs, even though I said I don't like the Faris combo anymore, I still opt to run 3 since it is an excellent bait card for handtraps/negates. If they let the effect to place a vision hero resolve then I can sit on the increase and then normal summon vyon and combo off from there. If they target my vyon I can tribute it with increase to dodge the effect and summon another one from my deck. Sure it can't use its first effect again but it can search poly too. The cool thing is if you run two polys you can search them both since Vyon's second effect is a soft once per turn. I don't find myself searching Faris and sometimes don't even use it's second effect if I want to summon anaconda or use super poly later in the turn. Often I am not even able to use Faris' second effect since I draw increase ALL THE TIME!!!! I will never bring increase back to two even if it is a garnet I don't care. I hate seeing the card. It's not like you lose just because you draw it since you can still discard it or use it as fusion material and get it in the grave for the grind. That's why I run 3 faris and 1 increase.

As for the Destiny HEROs, I used to run plasma ALL the time and loved the card. It was my favorite card. As I played when quarantine was over, I found myself never summoning the card and it just being a brick in my hand all the time. I summoned him one time and just got nibirued. It is just such a fragile card that takes too much to make so I cut it. I do miss the card but when Burst of Destiny comes out I will make a deck with it. The rest of the Destiny HEROs in the deck are pretty standard. 2 Malicious 1 Dynatag and 1 level 4. I usually play drawhand but I never really used his draw effect since I never wanted to give my opponent a card so I switched him out for Decider. It's effects can be super helpful in select match ups whereas drawhand is really only good with droll, which I don't have. I have never really used Celestial so he could be a good choice too. The cards are really bricky but Fusion Destiny is too good to pass up.

I run 8 hand traps. 3 Ash 2 Belle and 3 Impermanence. Just my preference since they are 3 very versatile cards that work in many scenarios at locals. 8 is a great amount to open at least 1 which is what I want in this deck. One of my favorite cards in the deck, Super Poly, I run at three. It has been an amazing card for me that has won most of my games. Whether I am fusing both of my opponents monsters in my draw phase going second, Using one of my monsters (preferably liquid soldier to draw two discard 1) and an opponents when they only have 1 big monster/ just don't meet starving venom or mudragon criteria, or using both of my monsters during the battle phase to OTK my opponent. Such a good card, especially since I can just set it going first. You can't do that with cards like lightning storm, Kaijus, or Dark Ruler. I either main deck cosmic cyclone or rivalry, I am still not sure which one. Maybe I should do half and half. My side deck is really rudimentary and mainly just for my locals.

When I win the die roll I usually choose to go first even though my end board is usually just Sunrise Vyon pass. In the past I usually overextended and lost to nibiru all the time. Nowadays I almost never go over 4 summons unless I know my opponent doesn't have Nibiru or I just don't care and can play through it. You can easily OTK using only 4 summons during the main phase in this deck.

The main combo I use is normal summon Vyon send Shadow Mist search Liquid soldier then banish Solid soldier search Poly. If I have a HERO monsters in my hand that I don't need I will use it and Liquid to make sunrise, otherwise I would use the Vyon and Liquid. Chain link 1 Liquid Chain link 2 Sunrise add Miracle Fusion draw 2 discard 1. usually I set some cards and end my turn there if going first. If I need Mask Change and have Fusion Destiny in my hand I will do the combo of making Dangerous with Shadow mist and Malicious then banish mali to summon mali link into cross bring back mali search liquid normal liquid special shadow search mask change set mask change pass turn.

Anyways how I play the deck is basically just using Liquid Soldier as a draw engine to draw handtraps and powerful cards like Super poly to interrupt my opponent and OTK them. I hope you like my decklist and sorry if this explination is rough, I am doing it in one take and not polishing it much. I just wanted to write out whats on my mind and I want to look back at this list in the future when new cards come out and this list will be a memory of past formats. Thanks."

With just Elemental Hero Blazeman and Mask Change in the hand, Blazeman and use it's 2nd effect to send Shadow Mist from the deck to the grave simultaneously activating Shadow Mist's Graveyard effect to search any HERO from the deck and allowing Blazeman to be sent to the grave with Mask Change to summon Dark Law. Alternatively Elemental HERO Solid Soldier or Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier can quickly summon Shadow Mist from the hand or grave respectively fulfilling Shadow Mist's special summon requirement to search a Mask Change from the Deck.Â </span>

<span>The support throughout the deck focuses heavily on quickly getting to the right strategy for the duel with many cards that can quickly search the deck including Masked Hero Dian in the Extra deck who can destroy an opponent's monster to special summon Shadow Mist directly from the deck.Â </span>

<span>Traditional fusions also feature in the deck providing excellent support with Elemental HERO Sunrise at the forefront immediately bringing Miracle Fusion straight from the deck to the hand while offering a solid second effect and a nice attack point boost to your HEROs. Miracle Fusion can be utilized with the right pieces in the grave to immediately fusion summon Elemental HERO Absolute Zero which if paired with Form Change to summon Masked HERO Acid can wipe the opponent's field or Elemental HERO Gaia which additional to its useful effect can pair with Form Change to Summon Dark Law. Fusion Substitute features as my polymerization of choice being able to be searched by Blazemans 1st effect and allowing the deck to recycle fusion monsters in the grave and provide a free draw.Â </span>

<span>Plenty more options are possible throughout the deck to adapt as needed to your opponent's plays.</span>

<span><span>hO<span>w</span>Ev<span>E</span>r,</span></span> I've made some changes since then. <a data-name=""Salamangreat Miragestallio"">Salamangreat Miragestallio</a> has been out for a while now and I think I've grasped a better feel for when and how to use it compared to last time.Â  Because of that I've cut some cards and added some others, alongside some regular changes to the deck like updating handtraps, improving on some ratios, etc.

&nbsp;

Up until recently I played both <a data-name=""Salamangreat Fowl"">Salamangreat Fowl</a> and <a data-name=""Sea Archiver"">Sea Archiver</a> at 1 copy each. Both can ""chainblock"" very important effects like Wolf's monster recursion and most notably, Gazelle's mill. I played Fowl mostly since it got a shiny new print in Ghost from the Past but have now cut it in order to play Archiver at 2.

Archiver is fantastic. Not so fantastic that I want to see it constantly, it is ""only"" an extender after all, which I'm not too dependent on, but being able to send it with <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a> or <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a> without losing out on it's effect is fantastic and chainblocking not when you perform a Link Summon (which is when a lot of chainblocks happen, Gazelle or Exceed block Bale, Bale blocks Buff, Exceed also blocks Wolf) but instead on the summon after. <a data-name=""Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf"">Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf</a>'s recursion triggers when a monster is summoned in it's zone and <a data-name=""Salamangreat Gazelle"">Salamangreat Gazelle</a> triggers on its own summon, which can be summoned to the zone a link monster points to. That means that Sea Archiver can increase the odds of some of your most important effects to go through.

But wait, there's more. Sea Archiver, like <a data-name=""Salamangreat Spinny"">Salamangreat Spinny</a> is a Level 3 that banished itself if it leaves the field after having used its effect to extend. With Miragestallio, this is no longer an issue. So not only do you get to chainblock your valuable effects with this card, it also servers as an extender the following turn, which is were Salamangreat was already difficult to stop.

&nbsp;

The presence of Miragestallio also made Bufferlo a much more attractive target for Cynet Mining. Miragestallio is essentially a Gazelle in the ED. Of course, you could also add Gazelle off of Cynet Mining and try to go into a r4nk play, but if you can't do that, you can always draw 2 and summon Gazelle afterwards. Or just take the +2 over the r4nk anyways, depending on the deck you're facing and how addicted you are to Dopamine.

&nbsp;

Since last time I've dropped <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>. It's just not as necessary anymore with Miragestallio around and this version is more backrow oriented. It's essentially ""Overextending, the Card"".

I've since also added Ghost Belle back to the deck. It's a good handtraps and still nice to see past turn 1 since moving cards from the GY is a mechanic that's not only used to build boards but also by established boards. I played around with cutting Belle and instead playing Will at 2 and the Solenms at 3 each but I like the look of this deck as is.

Solemn at 2 might seem a little weird but 4 is more than 3 and I don't really care which if these Solemns I see. I play a lot of backrow, so Judgment isn't just a worse Strike in this deck, they both have their strong suits and I'm usually happy with either, so I'm playing 4 instead of 3, that simple.

I also changed the Heatleo to Knightmare Phoenix. People are siding Contact ""C"" against Tri-Brigade and you can't really out it without Phoenix. Lost me a YCS game and I'll be honest, that stung a little. I think I won't say goodbye to that card for a while now.

Also finally fixed the Foxy, Spinny ratios. I still think 3 Foxy is fine in Bufferlo decks, since it's another target for Bufferlo but if you only play 5 copies out of the 2 cards, yeah, I'll admit you should play 3 Spinny - 2 Foxy.

&nbsp;

These were my thoughts behind the changes I've made, I don't think there's much else to say and I think after my fourth Salamangreat list it's okay to not write half a book for once, so I'm outta here. See you on the next one.

Oh, anyone else keeps forgetting the word Buffalo? I was thinking earlier how the real animal's spelled and it took me a solid minute to not think of 'Bufferlo' for once."

And if you just power up Daredevil you have a monster with 6400 atk on board with 2 other big bodies to wipe out your opponent."

The deck was built to cover weak points of most other decks, the many kuribohs allow for little damage to be dealt to the user of this deck. Red-Eyes Dragoon allows for quick negates and it allows you to slowly take apart your opponent field ( Destruction dragon serves the same purpose. .) The multitude of trap cards is if your opponent has better cards; this deck also has your stereotypical lava golem. Mystic mine and gravity bind are for the purpose of stalling the opponent until dragoon or destruction dragon can be summoned. You can use the combo of, scapegoat- wait a turn using stall tactics than summon linkuriboh, you can do this twice. (you need to have kuribohrn in your hand to pull this off.) Once your opponent attacks you can use the remaining scapegoats to special summon linkuriboh again (due to its effect.) than once its effect is used up than use kuribohrn to bring linkuriboh back."

<strong>Your win conditions:</strong>

-<strong>Ophion</strong> hard counters whatever you're facing.Â  You can kick back and relax, just do whatever you have to do to make him stick.

-<strong>Ophion</strong> doesn't counter whatever you're facing, but <strong>TCBOO</strong>/<strong>Gozen</strong> or even <strong>Macro</strong>/<strong>D. Fissure</strong> does.Â  Basically the same scenario above.Â  Make your floodgate stick, and beat over things.Â  You probably make <strong>Ophion</strong> anyway, because it's <strong>Evilswarm</strong> and that's just what you do.

-You stunned them with <strong>hand traps</strong>, and they leave a board with a 2k or lower ATK monster that you <strong>Utopia Double OTK</strong> over.Â  <strong><em>Congrats on not making Ophion</em></strong>.

-You make <strong>Origin</strong>, and your opponent just really wants to try their shiny new <strong>Destroy Phoenix Enforcer</strong>, and they keep making you +1 because they haven't seen this deck in 8 years.Â  That or you made <strong>Exciton</strong>/<strong>Raigeki'd</strong> under <strong>Origin</strong> and got a huge plus, those are always nice.

<strong>Ophion</strong> still beats a lot of things by itself, assuming you can protect it from things like <strong>Cerb</strong>, <strong>Unicorn</strong>, etc.Â  Room for 9 hand traps.Â  I run <strong>D. Shifter</strong>, <strong>Ash</strong>, and <strong>Imperm</strong> with a set of <strong>Droll</strong> in the side.Â  <strong>Gozen</strong> is a must since it generally checks whatever <strong>TCBOO</strong> doesn't.Â  You can probably swap <strong>Judgements</strong> for <strong>Strikes</strong>, but I like <strong>Judgement</strong> for floodgate protection.Â  <strong>Torrential</strong> is fun to play with considering <strong>Origin</strong>, making it an incredibly viable tech choice.Â  I like <strong>Prosperity</strong> over <strong>Allure</strong> by far, since you can pitch 6 from your extra pretty safely to give you a lot of flexibility from that search.Â  You're very vulnerable to <strong>Ash</strong> considering <strong>Prosperity</strong> and <strong>Rabbit</strong> getting hit hurt a ton, but that's just life.Â  The deck is 8 years old at this point, this was the best I can do, give me a break.

<strong>Other Notes:</strong>

-Keep <strong>Mandragora</strong> in the side, it's not worth the main slots.Â  You pray that you go 1st and establish <strong>Ophion</strong> Game 1.Â  <em><strong>Focus on nothing else.</strong></em>

-<strong>Thunderbird</strong> is trash, don't run it.

-<strong>Allure</strong> is OK if <strong>Prosperity</strong> is out of budget.

-<strong>Iron Dragon Tiamaton</strong> is still very fun, and can easily lock your opponent out of both Links and Level 5's if you summon <strong>Ophion</strong> to your EMZ, and lock out theirs with <strong>Tiamaton</strong>.Â  Tech it in for casual play, but it's probably not viable for competitive play, especially after you first drop it."

With new Nordic support from Battle of Chaos set and Brave Token. Combo and matchup is in the video down below.

There are 2 combo lines being used here.

<strong>4-3-3</strong>: <strong>Ivaldi+Gullinbursti+Tanngnjostr</strong>, in this line it's better to make Thor because it provides 2 recursions (Thor eff and new trap eff).

<strong>4-4-2</strong>: <strong>Ivaldi+Alviss+Vanadis send Mara</strong>, in this line it's better to make Loki/Odin because we use both Nordic Alfar tuner and Nordic Ascendant tuner (2 recursions: Loki/Odin eff and Alviss GY eff). This combo line is added because Zeus is able to wipe the 4-3-3 line endboard and turns off both the 2 revives (Thor eff and new trap eff), despite the combo giving more advantage.

&nbsp;

<span><strong>Main Deck</strong></span>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>3 Alviss</strong>: One of the best normal summon because we will have guaranteed recursion if it's in the GY. It got great GY eff, so we run 1 each of the Aesir at least to freely choose which one is perfect for the situation. The first effect is kinda niche, as you need to send 1 monster you control, means you will lack material for regular synchro summon as <strong>Alviss effect is not treated as proper synchro summon</strong>.</li>
 	<li><strong>3 Ivaldi, 1 RotA</strong>: The new Nordic support, best normal summon because it allows the 4-3-3 line to get full advantage (add this card back from GY via Gullinbursti, summon it next turn).</li>
 	<li><strong>2-3 Gullinbursti</strong>: Only 2 because it cannot add itself back if using the 4-3-3 line, especially if you run smaller Nordic lineup, you don't really wanna draw this name on the first turn if you only open 1 Nordic monster.</li>
 	<li><strong>2 Tanngnjostr/Tanngrisnir</strong>: Just another Nordic name, but play 2 since its needed in 4-3-3 line to summon from deck.</li>
 	<li><strong>1 Vanadis, 1 Mara</strong>: For the 4-4-2 combo line. Vanadis is a Nordic Ascendant for Odin revival, while Mara is a Nordic Alfar for Loki. Mara also allows Halqifibrax play (either for Selene Accescode or Shooting Riser sending Aquamancer or Token Collector).</li>
 	<li><strong>1 Nordic Relic trap each (Gungnir and the new Valinn)</strong>: Valinn is super good negation with revival (1 eff per turn) while Gungnir doesn't need Aesir name to interrupt.</li>
 	<li><strong>I don't run the new Nordic Relic spell Hildskjalf</strong> because the e-tele eff locks us to Aesir (yeah the link 1 is Nordic, can't summon that) and the GY eff negs us because it needs a shuffle back. We'd rather run more Nordic monster than drawing Foolish Burial Goods to achieve the same.</li>
 	<li><strong>Regular Brave Token lineup</strong>: 3 Aquamancer, 3 Rites of Aramesia, 1 Foolish Burial, 1 Journey of Destiny, 1 Wandering Gryphon Rider, and 1 Dracoback the Dragonsteed equip.</li>
 	<li><strong>3 Hippo Carnival</strong>: Seems random but you can chain this to summon 3 tokens as link 1 Gullveig banish fodders.</li>
 	<li>The rest is just staples.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>2-3 Gullveig link 1</strong>: Only 2, because it's hard to resolve the third one, and by that time we're already lose/win anyway.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Aesirs</strong>: 1 each for Alviss play, but play more Thor and Loki. Thor gives you potential bait/crackback if summoned via Alvis GY eff. Loki recurs any trap by reviving itself, it means the opponent has to think if they want to remove our trap before removing Loki as Loki can add it back, while at the same time Loki is protected by our link 1 Gullveig making it harder to remove before the trap. Loki creates a mindgame, huh nothing new.</li>
 	<li><strong>Halq play</strong>: Selene, Accesscode, Shooting Riser</li>
 	<li>The rest is just generic toolbox.</li>
</ul>

if u want to play more Handtraps (actually 3), kick max. 1 <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> and some Copies of <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a>

with the Extra-Deck, be free to create one. Maybe I will later add a pattern.
but: u have access to Rank 4 and 6 plays ( maybe Rank 8, but not recommended, you don't want to Rank away your <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a> )

Strategy is, to special Summon <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a> with <a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Art"">Advanced Ritual Art</a> or <a data-name=""Chaos Form"">Chaos Form</a>. Then give your Opponent one Impcantation-Monster in defense position and deal 8k piercing DMG :D

Search for Ritual Monster:
- 3x <a data-name=""Bingo Machine, Go!!!"">Bingo Machine, Go!!!</a>
- 3x <a data-name=""The Melody of Awakening Dragon"">The Melody of Awakening Dragon</a>

&nbsp;

so I play a few test rounds, there is a high Chance to summon <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a> and u can play through 1 to 2 Handtraps. This depends on your draw luck.

try first to bait some Handtraps with Search-Spells to make sure that your Impcantation-Combo works"

<span>Este es un mazo con el que muchas estrategias basadas en efectos de cartas que, ya sea que activen cuando son enviadas cementerio o que activen estando en el mismo, tienen bastantes problemas; o si juegas un deck combo con mas de 4 invocaciones pasaras un mal rato ante la poca capacidad que tendrÃ¡s de reciclar recursos del cementerio. Esto es gracias a que la principal fortaleza de esta baraja es BANEAR con cartas como Dimension Shifter, Macro Cosmos y Dimensional Fissure no importa si va de turno 1 o 2, si no tenemos como evitar la activaciÃ³n/resoluciÃ³n de los efectos de estas, se nos hara muy complicado el duelo conforme pasan los turnos; lo que beneficia a los Ritual Beast, pues son capaces de jugar alrededor de este ban con cartas como <em>Ritual Beast Tamer Wen,</em> su magia rÃ¡pida <em>Ritual Beast Return</em>, y algunos de sus monstruos de fusion, que son capaces de<em> regresar al Extra Deck</em> e invocar de forma especial 2 de sus monstruos baneados estos son <em>Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin,</em>Â <em>Ritual Beast Ulti-Apelio </em>y <em>Ritual Beast Ulti-Cannahawk</em>. </span>

<span>Aunado a esto, aprovecha lo anterior para escalar en los link con <em>Harpie Conductor</em> ya que solo necesita 2 mounstruos de viento y asi llegar a <em>Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty </em>con quien en la End Phase invoca otro floodgate en la forma de <em>Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds, </em>con lo que se acaban las invocaciones especiales de todo aquello que no sea atributo viento.</span>

<span>Ya para finalizar aunque no menos importante, si todo lo anterior falla siempre esta la vieja confiable de usar kaijus y quitarse de inicio algÃºn monstruo molesto, para asi poder usar los efectos del <em>XYZ Lightning Chidori </em>con quien no solo podremos quitarnos algun Set que tenga el oponente, si no que tambien podemos reciclar nuestro kaiju al desacoplar un material a Chidori y mandar nuestro kaiju al tope de nuestro mazo.</span>

<span>Para conocerlo mejor, solo descargarlo y pruebalo en tu app/programa para jugar YGO! en linea.</span>

<span>Nos vemos y..., Buen Duelo.</span>"

The Strat for this deck is to gain control of your opponent with setting traps, using revival spells, special summoning level 8 and going into controlling XYZ monsters. Use these Big monsters to intimidate your opponent and scare them out of attacking, I will say this now I can brick but there are many different stats for this deck. Darkwurm is in this deck too because of Dark Rebellion Dragon which has some great effects and makes it easy to beat over big monsters."

I made some techs like sauravis to protect, punishment as a very versitle card with no downside in this deck, you can send shuraig to search for a flunder, arc light for some protection, omega to recycle a card, or n'tss for another pop.

Side deck is some other techs that I didn't have space for.

Overall I really like this deck, but it also is very overhyped."

1x <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> (Send some stuff to the GY, primarily acts as a pseudo rota for the PK extender)

2x <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> (Counter every DARK deck and some more!, this card is searchable in this deck and is at least a 2 of)

1x <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> (Can act as a better Called by the Grave in a sense that the monster brought out is a fusion, can be searched AND be used in a specific 1 card combo)

<strong>Engines-</strong>

&lt;!--more--&gt;

3x <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> (It is quite useful in generating card advantage and minimizing your fusion costs)

<strong>The Garden-</strong>

&lt;!--more--&gt;

3x <a data-name=""Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio"">Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</a> (One of the 7 normal summons, is crucial in a lot of combos but is very fragile to negates, good thing that we have some stuff that mediates that right?)

3x <a data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew</a> (Yep, i just typed that out of my head, it is one of the 7 normal summons and is a GREAT card to stabilish control once Predator Counters are all over the field)

1x <a data-name=""Predaplant Spinodionaea"">Predaplant Spinodionaea</a> (The last normal summon and not that great, however he is useful in his ways and can put a single counter on the field, largely useful in going second situations)

3x <a data-name=""Predapractice"">Predapractice</a> (Search spell AND extender, honestly the card is quite bad but i managed to make some use out of it, in this specially crafted decklist it is phenomenal)

1x <a data-name=""Predaprime Fusion"">Predaprime Fusion</a> (My ""third Super Polymerization"" but for free!, is used whenever you have a Predaplanning pop setup of just need a way to quick fuse to escape targeting)

3x <a data-name=""Predaplanning"">Predaplanning</a> (One of your wincons honestly, this card is the whole reason i made this control build, can send a target as cost and splatter Predator Counters all over the field)

1x <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a> (<a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> target)

1x <a data-name=""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss</a> (An enabler of the Phantom Knights engine and can protect your monsters, is a part of some combos)

1x <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> (BIG snek, is a surprise Super Polymerization)

1x <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a> (Is another enabler of the Phantom Knights engine and can setup 2 negates, such wow, very useful)

<strong>Theory-</strong>

&lt;!--more--&gt;

This deck aims to control the board by placing Predator Counters which in turn make monsters affected by them level 1 and basically abusable by the user.

<a data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew</a> can use monsters with Predator Counters DARK and usable to fusion summon

<a data-name=""Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra"">Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra</a> can kaiju those same monsters away with no response for your opponent

<a data-name=""Predaplant Spinodionaea"">Predaplant Spinodionaea </a>can summon a Predaplant from the deck if he battles a monster with lower level than him, all within the damage step

<a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> is the deck's main wincon, negating the effects of all monsters your opponent controls with a counter and can also put counters herself huh!

<a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a> is the secondary boss monster who can negate a special summon from the extra, primarily Xyz, Synchro and Link, AND turn into a giant behemoth under certain conditions

<a data-name=""Predaplanning"">Predaplanning</a> is the main wincon of this deck along the aforementioned monsters, being able to set up and send a plant from the deck as cost and put counters is highly unassuming, only certain people will acknowledge this card as a real threat so it will mostly pass without any interaction.

<strong>Combos-</strong>

&lt;!--more--&gt;

Well, here are some simple combos that have a HUGE payoff, let me explain them:

<strong><em>Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio + Edge Imp Chain:</em></strong>

<em>Normal Ophrys-&gt; Send Chain as cost-&gt; Special Cobra-&gt; Cl1 Cobra,Cl2 Chain-&gt; Add Patchwork + Instant Fusion or any Fusion card-&gt; Make Cherubini using Cobra and Ophrys-&gt; Activate Cherubini by sending Ancient Cloak-&gt; Search Shade Brigandine via Ancient Cloak-&gt; Summon Shade-&gt; Make Bardiche-&gt; Activate Bardiche, send Boots then set Fog Blade-&gt; Activate Instant Fusion-&gt; Summon Winda-&gt; Activate Patchwork-&gt; Add Chain + Fusion Sub-&gt; Activate Fusion Sub-&gt; Make Dragostapelia or the second Winda-&gt; Search the second Fog Blade via Boots-&gt; Activate Fusion Sub by shuffling Winda back to the extra deck thus drawing a card-&gt; set the second Fog Blade. (End Board: 2 Monster Negates/Winda/+3 Card Advantage)</em>

<strong><em>Predaplant Chlamydosundew + Edge Imp Chain:</em></strong>

Normal Summon Chlamydosundew-&gt;Fusion into Chimerafflesia using Chain and Sundew-&gt; Activate Chain's effect thus adding Patchwork-&gt; Search Polymerization and Chain via Patchwork-&gt; Make Dragostapelia using Chimerafflesia and Chain-&gt;Seach a Fusion Spell via Chimerafflesia next standby. (End Board: 1 Negate/Predator Counter Placement/+0 Card Advantage but Superpoly Searchable)

<strong><em>Cordyceps Combinations:</em></strong>

It can be easily sent to the GY via <a data-name=""Predaplanning"">Predaplanning so sending it to the GY is not a problem.</a>

The combos with him include but are not limited to:

Spinodionaea + Chlamydosundew: Special both-&gt; Put a counter via Spino's effect-&gt; Fuse via Chlamydosundew into Starving Venom/Triphyoverutum or Chimerafflesia. (End board: 1 Big Fusion, Your Opponent is negged 1)

Sarraceniant + Chlamydosundew: Special both-&gt; Fuse into Chimeraffleia or Starving Venom-&gt; Search a Predap card. (End board: 1 Big fusion + Any Predap card)

Darlingtonia Cobra + Sarraceniant: Special both-&gt; Search any fusion card if you didn't proc Darlingtonia before or she was in your starter hand-&gt; Fuse into Starving Venom or Chimerafflesia-&gt;Proc Sarraceniant for any Predap card. (End board: 1 Big fusion + Any Predap card)

<strong>Math-</strong>

&lt;!--more--&gt;

As a going first deck, i did every calculation based on 5 cards on hand.

<strong>You have 43% of opening 1 normal summon</strong>

<strong>You have 59% of opening 2 normal summons</strong>

<strong>You have 12% of opening 1 normal summon + Predapractice</strong>

<strong>You have 16% of opening 2 normal summons + Predapractice</strong>

<strong>You have 16% of opening 1 Oprhys Scorpio or Chlamydosundew + 1 Edge Imp Chain</strong>

<strong>You have 24% of opening up to 2 Oprhys Scorpio or Chlamydosundew + up to 2 Edge Imp Chain</strong>

<strong>You have 14% of opening 1 Oprhys Scorpio or Chlamydosundew + 1 PK engine card</strong>

<strong>You have 25% of opening up to 3 Predaplants + up to 3 Predapractice</strong>

<strong>You have 10% of opening any of the normal summons + Instant Fusion or Called by the Grave</strong>

<strong>You have 34% of opening a normal summon + Predaplanning</strong>

<strong>You have 40% of opening a staple + a normal summon</strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>End-</strong>

Well, this is the end, the deck is still in development and awaiting any support from konami, thus i hope that i will get some anime cards like Lilyzard or Ivy Bind Castle.

The problem with the deck is the lack of in archetype extenders and ways to stop your opponent's plays, the amount of resources needed to make Dragostapelia is also a problem, if she was easier to do like Chimerafflesia then i wouldn't be mad at it.

Thank you for your time here and hope you have an interesting day."

This deck is pretty good at interruption,swarming and recovery which I'd likely recommend for beginners and intermediate players. Although banish Myutants are much popular than Dogmatikas given that Dogmatikas itself are more expensive cards, it doesn't take away the fun of going toe to toe against with both rogue and meta decks. It's easyÂ  to use that it just follow the same pattern as the Shadoll Invoke where you usually start with Aliester, here you starts with the smaller myutants waiting to get to get interrupted by Ash, Veiler or Impermanence then proceed to Almiraj then Dogmatikas. Swarming is pretty easy and just like Shadoll Invoke, you have to keep in mind to fusion first before using the dogmatika cards. The synergy of this two archetypes is really high given that Myutants are the offensive stance while Dogmatikas set the GY and field for defensive purposes. Extra deck monsters are versatile depends on the situation,.you got toadally for recovery , Titaniklad for the dogmatika setup, Pegasus and Harbinger for defense and lastly, Numeron dragon for offense which you can fully utilize it's effect even if it got destroyed by card effect (Presumably you can set Myutant Cry or any Myutant traps from your GY). Overall, this is the peak iteration of my Myutant build I've been making for months. Hope this helps, good luck and have fun."
