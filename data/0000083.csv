Borreload Savage Dragon is in the deck list as well, it's almost 100% needed but its expensive so you could replace a few Rokkets with Rokket Synchron and replace Savage with Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss which can simulate the Negate situation although slightly harder to pull off. Hopefully both combo replays reflect how strong this deck is with its end boards going first or second.  This obviously isn't my first Rokket list as i'm always adjusting and adapting it to what i feel is good or is needed against the meta. Like all combo heavy decks you can very easily be interrupted by Nibiru or have all you work come to naught by Dark Ruler No More which is sadly something you can't really work around. Knightmare Phoenix is your closest out to Mystic Mine without the Side Deck, hoping you can use enough materials to have the same amount of monsters as the opponent to get the Phoenix effect.  Expect a few more Rokket Deck Lists in the future as Eternity Code brings a new card in Noctovision Dragon which is a great extender for this deck and its only a Common."

Yes, yes, I know. Cyberdarks are infamous for being real bad for many reasons. Upon further inspection, however, one would notice that its speed and overall playstyle are the main offenders to its bad reputation. This build aims to patch up these problems by incorporating play stoppers and disruptions to slow the game down a bit, as making the archetype faster would just hinder its consistency and performance. The use of a small Shaddoll engine does synergise well with the deck, and offers a lot of value for resources. If you are interested in knowing why these specific tech cards were chosen or how the strategy works in practice, feel free to watch the video posted!  This deck is part of a YouTube series calledÂ <em>TRULY TRASH? -</em> videos based around trash tier Yu-Gi-Oh! archetypes. Each video contains replays, analyses, and deck techs as well as the reasoning behind choosing such!

At this point you triggeredÂ  the second effect of Wise strix that makes you set a Rank up magic spell from your deck, so you set Rank up magic soul shave force.  Step 3: Now you use the effect of Zephyros from you GY by returning one card on your field to your hand (usually Black whirlwind, Pinpoint landing or Bora the spear) and special summon Union carrier  Step 4: Special summon Simorgh, bird of sovreign using Wise strix and Force strix as materials.  Step 5: Use the effect of union carrier to equip the Simorgh with myst valley Thunderbird from your deck and then use the set Rank up magic soul shave force to summon Cyber Dragon Infinity. Attivate its effect and absorb union carrier.  Step 6: In the end phase use the effect of Simorgh to special summon Myst Valley Apex Avian from you deck in a zone Simorgh points to and entry your opponent becomes Angry while you negate everything he does!  This was the basic guaranteed combo, but you can also end your turn with mother addizionale monsters like Borreload Savage Dragon and Time thief redoer to improve your negation power. I've also put 3x of Lightning storm to prevent disadvantage by starting second and to put out your opponent' spell/traps cards in order to have the conditions to use Simorgh's effect in the End Phase. Obviously, you can substitute it with other cards from you side deck like Crossout designator, ash blossom and/or Nibiru As Wells. The motivativation because I pur 2x of Pinpoint landing is quite simple: draw power on your turn and the opponent's turn when you attivate the effect of Myst Valley Thunderbird and because it's a continuos spell that you can make go black to your hand by the effect of Zephyros."

Just wanted to propose a Cyber Dragon deck more ""Meta Friendly"", not only a pure Second Turn FTK, because going first, nowadays, can be a better option if you can control the board.  &nbsp;  It keeps its power to OTK but with just more control.  &nbsp;  If you're going first:  Try to discard ASAP Herz, so you can get a Cyber Dragon. You can use galaxy soldier most of the time (prior) or Nachster (but be carefull with this one cause you won't be able to summon predaplant verte nor pleiades).  Summon Nova, bring back cyber dragon, try to get a third lvl 5 on the board (Nachster for exemple, when you special summon it, you can special summon a cyber dragon from GY). If you're T1 with overload fusion, get Rampage Dragon, use its effect to send Turtle to the GY along with Herz if you hadn't already, and then summon Pleiades with Cyber Dragon + Rampage dragon.  If you haven't overload, summon predaplant before using Herz first effect (which you should not use T1) or Nachster effect, and summon Rampage Dragon last, sending Turtle.  Try to get Cyber Repair Plant fast, so you can get another Light Monster (most of the time Galaxy Soldier, or whatever monster your hand is lacking, like Nachster or Cyber Dragon or even Herz for discard effect). If you haven't any Cyber Dragon monster in the GY, summon Almiraj to send one. This last one, if you have no other option, can be kept on board to protect one of your monster on opponent's turn, but it's not a priority move.  If you have a Core in hand, it will be your prior normal summon, to get Revsystem or Emergency or Repair Plant.  &nbsp;  Next, it's all about surviving the opponent's first turn without loosing too much. HT like Ghost and Ogre can help, Infinity, Pleiades, and you can skip the Battle Phase with Turtle in the GY.  &nbsp;  Next, try to summon another Rampage Dragon by any means (along with Sieger), so you can:  &nbsp;  -clean the opponent's Spell/Trap board.  -Sieger's effect on it  -Attack three times with 4200 ATK.  &nbsp;  Don't forget to use infinity to get rid of an opponent monster. You can use Pleiades too, to clean up a bit. Don't forget Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon, you don't need any Polymerization to summon him, and you can tribute an ennemy link monster (most of the time). Use Fortress when you're using Jizukiru if you can't do anything else (but normally, Infinity's here).  Here are two replays showing a ""good"" going first match:  &nbsp;  <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyTuAC276Q0</a> <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJI0M5HT5C4&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>  Going second, is the same as T3 before, Infinity to clean, Rampage Dragon to clean and burst, Sieger to help doing this.  Here are three more videos showing a FTK (almost for one, he surrended at T3 :p) going second.  &nbsp;  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx7x3khr5pM&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hry65VGHXMc&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> (this one is against a player)  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB5i9QS_ajo&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> (against evil eye, he surrended :p)  &nbsp;  Q/A:  -Why three Galaxy Soldiers? Cause it increases the prob to draw it at the start, and the third one isn't a dead weight.  -Why no Super Polymerization: Because i'm focusing on going first here, so this card isn't really helpfull, and i don't have monsters using this (i have overload and predaplant, it's enough)  -Why no Ash and Blossom, and putting Ghost Ogre? I know that Blossom is better, but you can't discard it (fie monster), Ghost Ogre is a Light one so it can be used in multiple ways.  -Why Reasoning? Well, this card is a gamble, but the deck uses a wide variety of monsters with differents lvl: they can all be usefull on board, and the chances that the opponent (especially going first) picks the good one are really low.Â  Â Try not to use it first, as it can discard usefull spells, but you have at least 2 copies of each, so it shouldn't be a problem.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  So i hope you enjoyed this presentation, and that you'l enjoy this deck online, if you have any feedback, feel free to comment :)  &nbsp;  Have Fun!  &nbsp;  Updated 25/04/2020: -1 overload, + 1 Super Pol (TCG only), -1 revsystem, +1 evenly matched, -1 cyber eternity, - 1 auroradon, +1 earth golem, +1 mudragon,"

Additional you should play with a convertible Side deck because people will make you go first if they know what you are playing so put some Solemn Jugment's and Strike's as well as Torrential Tribute's and Summon Limit's or Gozen Matches.  Another thing that you can do is swap out the one Yosenju Izna and the two Yosenju Secret Move for three copies of Superpolymerization and obviously put some targets for it in the Extra Deck like Starving Venom Fusion Dragon, Mudragon of the Swamp, World Chalice Guardragon Almarduke and Diplexer Chimera."

","Lego Adamancipators focuses on the Board Building and recursion potential of Earth Monsters, using Block Golem and all Earth Main Deck monsters (besides Nibiru, but that's a hand-trap anyway) to create card advantage through the Excavation mechanic. <ol>  	<li>Alongside the obvious triple copies of each Adamancipator Tuner, I use half the GoGoGo engine, Gigas and Dwarf, for their natural ability to recur themselves from the grave when combined, coupled with their rank 4 status to not only make a Gallant Granite, but also pitch to Doki Doki to cheat Analyzer from the Deck. They can also be used to make Abyss Dweller, which can come in very handly against certain decks such as Eldlich.</li>  	<li>I use two Block Dragon, because it's a strong card to open with, possibly getting all 3 Tuners from the deck (though most often, grabbing Seeker and Researcher, plus a Gigantes to extend), and running two takes into account a Called By or DD Crow, allowing a possible Union Carrier or Gallant to fetch the second if it fails.</li>  	<li>Another staple, Gigantes is just a very good card for extending, or getting a second level 4 to make Gallant Granite and begin my plays, but it's also a brick on Excavation, so I only run 2.</li>  	<li>2 Koa'ki Meiru Guardians allow for an early protection from Nibiru, if they're excavated. I'm playing around with running 3, but deck space is relatively tight, given how important it is to open with a Tuner.</li>  	<li>Block Golem, my own little pet tech and one of the focuses of the deck, turns an excavation from a +1 into a +2, which is absolutely incredible, turns Adamancipator Signs into a ""bring back 2 monsters from your grave"", and matches the Tuners for a +1 when cheated out by Doki Doki: even better, if both Gigas and Dwarf are in the grave, by resurrecting only one of them and another monster, the other can also be brought out by it's effect, becoming a +3, so I run 3, to maximize the chance of excavating it. The card does come with a caveat, however: in order to use Block Golem's effect, all monsters in the grave MUST be Earth Attribute. Because of this, zone placement becomes important, as I don't want to send any of my Link Monsters to the grave until I'm ready to commit to my final board, or have enough resources that Block Golem is no longer needed. With the current build, that isn't a terribly difficult thing to pull off, but it's something I always need to keep in mind while starting a combo.</li>  	<li>Barrier Statue of the Drought is part of an interesting combo, which can not only be excavated, but also be searched at the end on a combo by resurrecting an unused Tuner with Signs (usually a Researcher or Seeker that Halqifibrax brought out, and couldn't activate). The best example of this is a line of play I shoot for when I've opened an Adamancipator Signs, Researcher, and one other rock monster (Seeker also works here, if you open a Doki Doki along with it to bring Analyzer out.) At minimum, by starting with the Rock Monster, then specialing Researcher, so long as I hit the excavation, I'll have 3 rock monsters on the field. I can link Researcher and one of them off to create Halqifibrax, summoning Seeker from the deck (or Researcher, if Seeker was first), then link Seeker and the normaled monster into I:P, and link those two into Mekk Knight Crusadia Avramax, who now cannot be destroyed by card effects because it was link summoned with I:P Masquerena. Finally, I use Signs to bring back Seeker (or Researcher), putting Barrier on top, and excavate Barrier to the field. This line of play locks the opponent into only Special Summoning Earth Monsters, and they can't just normal summon and attack the barrier to lift that restriction, because Avramax protects it, and Avramax cannot be outed by any Kaiju except Kumonga (who is not normally played), so long as Barrier is on the field. This board can end on <em>far</em> more, as well, as that was considering the bare minimum of play: with skillful and careful play, one can viably create a board of Avramax, Block Dragon, Dragite/Savage (Dragite only if you think your opponent may have a Raigeki effect, so that your spell/trap negate is protected by Block Dragon), Barrier Statue of the Drought, and an Apollousa. Given, one or more of those may be missing, depending on excavations and the strength of the opening hand, but I've managed to assemble that board several times.</li>  	<li>3 Cosmic Cyclone, because in the situation that I go second, I don't like scooping to Zombie World/Rivalry, Summon Limit, There Can Only Be One, etc.</li>  	<li>Double Summon is another contentious tech, and one I haven't fully committed to as of yet. I only run two, at the moment, because I never want to see two of them, and many times, the card will not be needed: however, when I do open it, it can be a life saver after my opponent stops my starter, and can also unbrick hands that completely lack a Doki Doki or Tuner, because most of those hands are mostly level 4 Rocks, which I can summon two of the make a Gallant Granite, search Block Dragon, then banish two in my hand and the one that was dumped into the grave for Granite to summon Block Dragon. Then, I link the two off for I:P, grabbing Researcher, Seeker, and any level 4 I'm fine with banishing in order to bring Block Dragon back out, banishing Gallant, its other material, and the level 4 in my hand, so that Researcher can special herself, followed by Seeker, because Researcher is out. Then, it's into the combo, with a hand that had effectively 0 combo pieces.</li>  	<li>Yes, I will still effectively lose to Dark Ruler No More, but that's just how Adamancipator is.</li>  	<li>Finally, just getting into a small bit of math, the deck runs 15 excavation targets. Given that 12 of those cards- all of them except Doki Doki- are suboptimal to open with, it's a decent ratio, at a soft 30% of the deck, probability putting it at 1.5, or 1-2 cards average per opening hand. Meanwhile, using that number, after taking 5 cards for the opening hand, there'll be a roughly 38.6% chance to excavate one of those monsters on my first excavation (13.5/35), running roughly 1.93 excavatable monsters per excavation, a very balanced ratio that, most times, will allow me a choice between two of them. So far, this ratio has kept my hands and excavations relatively consistent, but it's still an ongoing process to perfect it.</li> </ol>"

As result this deck doesn't include usual Genex staples like Genex Blastfan, Genex Ally Duradark, or allure of darkness. However, the deck does function way better than other Genex decks despite this.  So the main focus of this deck is to build a board with a few negates, and the way it achieves this is through double summon and the symphonic warrior engine to give you an extra normal summon and get more monsters on the field while maintaining a good had advantage, such as through searching Genex monsters with Genex monsters and T.G. hyper librarian. Things to keep in mind about this deck is that it's combos end on Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon almost all the time, it fills up the board fast, and it summons Mecha phantom beast O-lion a lot, so be careful when you use Mecha Phantom Beast O-lion's token effect because using it early may mess up your plays.  You can use Genex Recycled to copy a name of a Genex monster in the grave, preferably Genex turbo, then use Machine Duplication to summon two of those monsters from the deck, which if you copied Genex turbo, you can instantly make Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier.  Genex power planner is there only if you have an additional normal summon, to easily synchro summon Martial Metal Marcher with phantom beast O-lion, or if you brick and have no combo starters in your hand, which happens on occasions, but not nearly as often as one might think.  Genex Turbo can search out Genex Oracle which can then special summon itself, allowing you to link summon Crystron Halqifibrax.  Genex Ally Birdman can allow you to get an extra tuner on the field and allow you to re-use the effects of Genex Turbo, Undine, and Power Planner, increasing hand advantage, especially if you have an additional normal summon sense Genex monsters don't have hard once per turn effects.  And to get the most out of Genex Undine if you can only normal summon once, follow this guide: Normal summon it to send Crystron Phoenix to the grave and search for Genex controller. Banish Crystron Pheonix to summon a token and special summon link spider with it, then use link spider's effect to summon Genex Controller and link summon Crystron Halqifibrax to special summon a tuner. You can further extend this combo by special summoning Mecha phantom beast O-lion with Halqifibrax to synchro summon Accel Synchron and special summon a token, then send Jet Synchron to the grave to decrease it's level by 1 and synchro summon F.A. dawn dragster. then you can summon Jet Synchron and link summon for Auroradon, tribute one of its tokens and itself to summon another phantom beast O-lion from the deck, and then synchro summon Borreload Savage Dragon and equip Auroradon for a total of two negates on the field and a 4050 beater.  Pot of Avarice is probably the deck's only form of recovery, so use it wisely.  The side deck is pretty open, but most of the cards in there are for going second sense this deck dies off of a single negate, so feel free to add cards you feel are better suited for it."

I built all three options for the TCG, but if u play Online or TCG/OCG, there is a fourth option which includes the Predaplant-Dragun-Engine. Just include DM, RE and R.E.F in the Main-, and Predaplant and Dragun in the Extradeck. (Kick out 3 of the equipspells)  The other two options obviously are Exodia FTK, and Apex Avian Lockdown. Exodia is of course the most inconsistent but still works very well. Apex avian is pretty consistent but i like Zexal best for beeing the most consistent.  Strategy is simple: Summon two samurai, isolde, battle shogun, gateway, skulldeat, generate plus, build a board of naturias, cristalwing, apollousa and zexal."

It is Consistent and Durable against the Meta.,"This is a version of Salads (Salamangreats) that doesnât have Apollousa for those that canât afford to buy a card(s) that expensive. This deck is very consistent and itâs durability is crazy good.  The main strategy is to set up a defensive board first turn to help with disrupting or going for the OTK on your next turn. If youâre going Second, You can play still play defensive, still go for the OTK, or remove their board and have some offense but not an OTK.  &nbsp;  Depending on who you are facing and/or what you have in your hand determines what 1 of 3 ways that you can will set up your board. Regardless of either, always try to get the Rage or Roar if You did not draw into them.  1) Get Bagooska our in defense mode. Yes this will effect you as well, but you can easily work around it because most of your Salad monsters effects activate in grave and once you have your Links, you donât have to worry  2) Bring our Abyss Dweller to disrupt your opponent from activating effects from grave.  3) Bring our Transcode Talker and co-link with Wolf. If you send Roar or Rage to grave, donât Reincarnate Wolf until you bring him back out with Transcode Talker. If you are getting Roar, use Wolfs effect not Roarâs so that it doesnât get banished yet. I would only use Roarâs effect if I reincarnate a different Salad Link or if I have both Rage and Roar in grave. Which in that case, get Rage with Wolfâs effect and then Roar via reincarnation.  I have Knightmare Unicorn for those monsters that canât be destroyed by battle/card effects.  As for the side deck, use what you have that is good against the meta.

Combo is kinda consistent, because its only <strong>Deadreef+any lv4</strong>. So we play 3 Deadreef (dumps ""big fish""), 3 Beautunaful Princess + 1 One for One, 2-3 Summoner Monk (searches Deadreef and fulfilling the combo but needs spell in hand), therefore we play roughly 9 Deadreef and the rest is just lv4 water extender.  The combo is we summon Dugares (on extra zone) with Deadreef (after sending big fish) + any lv4, use Dugares revive big fish, use big fish discard 1, ss 4 fishes from deck (preferably every copy of Deadreef in our deck as it provides us draw from GY), make Bahamut Shark ss Toadally, make Gallant Granite search Adaman Researcher (or Nibiru if we draw Researcher), ss Researcher, make F0 with Gallant + Bahamut, make Halqifibrax with Researcher + Dugares, ss O-Lion, make Crocodragon with O-Lion + big fish, use Crocodragon draw and chain O-Lion ss lv3 wind machine token. Now you can use Deadreef draw from GY, making us draw 2 in total from our combo.  On opponent's main phase, we can banish Halqifibrax for any synchro tuner (can be anything, depends on you) while having the lv3 wind machine token as the non-tuner for synchro summoning during your opponent's turn. Some synchro tuner can be used during your opponent's battle phase (like Crystron Quandax).  <img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/9/94/Shark-MDDG.png/257px-Shark-MDDG.png"" alt=""image"" />  Expected board:  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/IDnCQOG.png"" alt=""image"" />  Replay:<a> https://bit.ly/3bwIc9o</a> (you can replace Dragite with any synchro tuner play)  Pros: Good consistency, multiple negations and disruptions, able to run Deepsea Minstrel to see and snipe opponent's hand, can run bunch of handtraps.  Cons: 2 cards combo, follow up play aint too good, Dugares effect skips your next main phase 1, Beautunaful Princess misses timing if summoned with White Mirror.  Cards to think of: Silent Angler (good lv4 water extender but conflicts with Researcher), other sharks (most of it aint too good), other synchro plays (I put the example on side deck)."

Double Plaguespreader to for Halquifibrax. Always, Always make Chaos Ruler first because he dumps 4 and gets a search that can be utilized with Popperup. Popperup can get cards out of hand and Uni-Zombie is a great opener. Best normal summon is probably Lumina since she can discard herself and revive herself while also setting up the graveyard. Mezuki is always graveyard fodder. Small Block Dragon engine to allow for going into Dingirsu to give the negations some protection. Long combos but it's not like a specific line because of Lightsworns so it's more like just discard and see what happens. Plaguespreader plus any level-4 for a charge warrior which is a free draw then that gives you an easy Crystal Wing. This deck has next to no recursion, loses to Nibiru, Ash Blossom, and heavy negate boards so feel free to use the side deck for cards like Dark Ruler No More and Super Poly. Have fun spitting out heavy negations. Even with brick hands during my testing the worst board I came out with aÂ  3 counter Apollousa so there's defenitely choke points but the deck is very very conistent due to Block Dragon's existance. Side Deck is all going second cards and anti Hand Traps. Revival Golem is just Block Dragon food and potentially a free summon off of any Lightsworn Card or could even be used with Plaguespreader if you have no cards in hand.  I am very open to suggestions and differences to the extra deck. I personally think it's tight but the only cards that aren't preforming are Curious and Saryuja, while Saryuja has gotten me to special summon Zombie Master for more extension."

Fuse your HEROes into the one that's going to save the day and strike down the villain. The wide range of monster effects and spells means you can constantly mix up and change strategies.  Opponent got a high powered monster beating you down? Not to worry, with your wide range of HEROes, use <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> to take their monster and fuse it into your own powerful warrior to beat them down.  You also have the Masked HEROes ready to swap in to bring in their own effects. Don't forget your change and super poly cards are all quick play, meaning you can summon numerous monsters at almost any phase of the game!  Try it out and find what combinations work well for you, a couple recommendations:  Summon <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Absolute Zero"">Elemental HERO Absolute Zero</a>, and then play <a data-name=""Mask Change"">Mask Change</a> to summon <a data-name=""Masked HERO Acid"">Masked HERO Acid</a> to completely wipe your opponents field.  Use a light monster to summon <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Sunrise"">Elemental HERO Sunrise</a>, then play <a data-name=""Miracle Fusion"">Miracle Fusion</a> to summon <a data-name=""Elemental HERO The Shining"">Elemental HERO The Shining</a>, giving you twoÂ  monsters on the field, which each get a boos from Sunrise, and The Shining gets a further ATK boost from your banished monsters. If that wasn't enough, when the Shining is destroyed you can add the cards you banished back to your hand.  If your opponent has summoned numerous monsters, fusion summon <a data-name=""Vision HERO Trinity"">Vision HERO Trinity</a>. Trinity is unable to attack directly but can make up to three attacks on monsters and on the turn its summoned his attack doubles to 5000. Combine this with <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Honest Neos"">Elemental HERO Honest Neos</a> to raise up to 7500, then if you have The Warrior Returning Alive you can repeat the process to boost up to 10000, and attack for massive damage."

I personally consider this as a swarm deck because of one card: Eternal Soul.  Eternal Soul is a card where on either players turn, can summon a Dark Magician from your hand or graveyard.  Then, Eye of Timaeus will allow you to summon either the following: Dark Cavalry or Dark Magician the Dragon Knight.  For powering up all of your DARK attribute monsters, Wee witch's will do just that.  I also have played this deck on Yu-Gi-Oh! Dueling Nexus and a similar deck in Yu-Gi-Oh!

The main combo I wished to achieve was set 2 pass, with portal and a properly-summoned Phul in grave, and to do so, all we need is a Hagith summon. Scrapping bad cards, we're left with 12 main-deck archetype cards, not running any more megaliths than absolutely necessary to facilitate the combo every time. The Godo engine with 2 Glove and Onomatopoeia alongside 3 Magileine and 1 Petingcessoeur allows us to summon Gallant Granite with 80% of hands. A small Dragma package allows us to extend upon these plays, getting a negate, a search and/or a pop depending on what you send.  We pass to our opponent, watch them develop their monsters, using traps if under dark ruler, or using Phul to summon Bethor to pop, and depending on how broken your hand is, I:P'ing into either Apollousa or Unicorn for further disruption.

Pros: <ul>  	<li>Still has normal access to the consistent Marincess link climbing engine, able to end on Great Bubble Reef or Wonder Heart with 3 equips in one turn with most hands.</li>  	<li>The deck only locks into WATER, thus you have access to many great WATER extenders such as Aqua Spirit, Crusadia Arboria, Fishborg Launcher, Crystron Halqifibrax, and more!</li>  	<li>Capability to generate tons of card advantage due to the self recycling nature of Marincess and the draw power of Great Bubble Reef. As long as you don't get OTK'd, you can still rebuild a broken board!</li>  	<li>Decent protection with the ability to easily make a towers-like boss monster, and good disruption with Marincess Wave, basically an archetype impermanence.</li>  	<li>Strong recent WATER synchro releases that can easily be gone into, such as Adamancipator Risen - Dragite and Deep Sea Princess Prima Donna.</li>  	<li>Many possible combo paths to get into Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier.</li>  	<li>Turns out some of the best XYZs are WATER too, such as Abyss Dweller. The Bahamut Shark + Toad package is a good option too.</li> </ul> Cons: <ul>  	<li>Fragile deck, can play around a couple disruptions with the right hand but still easily stopped.</li>  	<li>Relies heavily on managing your Link arrows, place things in the wrong zones and your combos can be cut short.</li>  	<li>Gets absolutely dumpstered by Nibiru, as the standard Marincess link climb puts you way above the Nibiru threshold.</li>  	<li>Relies heavily on the field spell. It's easily searched with Sea Angel and also easily retrieved when destroyed, but it'll be under fire quite a bit and hard to get back when banished (but not impossible due to Deep Sea Princess Prima Donna).</li>  	<li>Has a hard time against an established unbreakable board going second, as the true extensions of the Marincess board going into Synchros and such are usually only doable on your second turn unless your hand is just that good.</li> </ul> Synergies to keep in mind: <ul>  	<li>Great Bubble Reef gets really big when you banish a lot of things. Many monsters in this deck banish as part of a cost, effect, or condition. Aqua Spirit and Scrypton banish a target to summon themselves, Mandarin and Sea Archiver banish themselves upon leaving the field after their extension, etc. Also, banishing your opponent's cards counts too, hence Trishula immediately buffs Great Bubble Reef by up to 1800 ATK.</li>  	<li>If you use backrow removal in your deck, use Cosmic Cyclone. Not because banishing spells and traps makes them harder to get back, but because it gives you higher chances of Deep Sea Princess Prima Donna's ability to summon from the deck to be live.</li>  	<li>Deep Sea Princess Prima Donna can get back something you banished with Pot of Desires upon leaving the field, at least according to how EDOPRO rules it.</li> </ul> KEEP IN MIND:  This version of the deck focuses on the combos of the deck. In order to make it more competitive and replacing some of the cards with hand traps and the like, replace copies of extenders that are heavily reliant on having another resource to extend off of, such as Pascalus, Aqua Spirit, etc. Good things to sub in are Called by the Grave, Infinite Impermanence, and your favorite hand traps."

Like, either keep Destiny HERO - Malicous at 2 or 3! Make up your mind!  &nbsp;  Also, I got a new laptop recently, so I can make some deck profiles more often. This is a HERO deck I made after the banlist for Master Rule 5 was dropped. I replaced Destiny HERO - Celestial with Destiny HERO - Drawhand, because I've gotten more use out of Drawhand overall. Not to say that Celestial is bad, I just don't wind up using it very often.  &nbsp;  I decided to name this deck ""You Say Run,"" after one of the songs from the Boku No Hero Academia soundtrack. My strategy for this deck is pretty simple--either go first and set up a lockdown with Destiny HERO - Plasma, or go second and OTK my opponent.  Here's a link to You Say Run! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYZIUtDAFIw  &nbsp;"

There are 2 ways to play this deck you can fill the field then go into heatleo or pyro to obliterate your opponent or you can play just blasting your opponent with your back row and monster affects. I play one or the other depending on what type of deck I am up against.  Here is an example of a combo  1 activate pot of desires  2 normal summon foxy  3 Special Summon (now will be refered to as SS) fowl  4 SS balelynx wth foxy  5 SS gazelle  6 send spinny to GY with gazelle's affect  7 play salamangreat sanctuary  8 SS spinny  9activate foolish burial and send jack jaguar  10 activate jack jaguar and return foxy to the deck and SS  11 SS apollousa with spinny, gazelle, fowl, and jack jaguar  12 activate will of salamangreat to summon fowl  13 SS sulight wolf with balelynx and foxy  14 activate salamangreat circle to get meer  15 use meer's affect to summon it in zone of sunlight  16 activate sunlight to add gazelle for next turn  17 SS heatleo  18 SS heatleo with heatleo  now you have a very strong board built up and even if it comes down (which would be very hard) you could build it up again that is what I like about salamangreat no matter how bad they get hit they always get back up.  &nbsp;"
