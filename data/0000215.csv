It's a simple Pendulum Beatdown deck that likes to use Normal Monsters to profit off of Pendulum effects like Dragoons of Draconia to get searches and such.

Nirvana High Paladin is only really summonable with Magicalibra or Hallo Hallo's Pendulum effect, I just like to keep him there as a boss monster though he can easily be switched for any other monster the deck can make that is cheaper than him.

Besides that it's easy to make the 3 Dracoslayer Extra Deck monsters within one turn if you have enough resources though it's nothing game breaking considering the deck doesn't try to set up anything remotely interactive. It just tries to play the game and will be sad if negated so please don't negate it. Not like it could hurt you if it actually tried so why not let it have some fun"

Yes, what you just saw in the deck summary (if you even read it that is) is 99% true. Cyberdarks can indeed end on two omni-negates. crazy, right?

And before you ask, Yes, it is indeed not pure Cyberdarks, unless you consider Cyber Dragons to be part of the deck (which is Konami's intention) then yeah it is pure... relatively.

Now! Let's start talking about how to build boards with enough edge to cut through my depression.

&nbsp;

<em><strong><span>DECK DESCRIPTION.....</span></strong></em>

Here i will be talking about each card in the deck, what purpose does it serve and how to use it correctly.

First we talk about the main deck monsters, starting with.....

&nbsp;

Cyber Eltanin: Can't be normal summoned/set and can only be special summoned from your hand by banishing all light machine-type monsters from your field and gy, when summoned that way it gains 500 for each card banished by it's effect and sends all other **monsters** on the field to the gy.

This guy is just a personal preference of mine to be honest, solely because it's a board nuke and i love those. It's not crucial at all to the deck's main gameplan, so you can remove it for anything else if you feel like it.

&nbsp;

Cyber Dragon: Ah, ""Cyber Dragon"" the og format warping machine. Doesn't really need an introduction, it's mainly here to summon ""Cyber Dragon Nova"" then go Into ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"" using ""Machine Duplication"" and because it's an extra target for ""Cybernetic Horizon"". If you were to remove it for something else you might as well remove ""Machine Duplication"" as well.

&nbsp;

Cyberdark Chimera: Now we're getting to the juicy core cards. ""Cyberdark Chimera"" is quite possibly the most important card in this deck. Basically what it does is that it let's you discard a spell/trap card to add ""Power Bond"" from your deck to your hand and then it allows you to banish monsters from your gy to summon a ""Cyber"" fusion monster, Also when it's sent to the gy it allows you to send to the gy a ""Cyberdark"" monster with a different name to the other ""Cyberdark"" monsters in your gy and face-up on your field.

This guy has it all gy set-up, searching and lets you miracle fusion. Needless to say it is absolutely crucial to the deck's gameplan and an absolute 3of.

&nbsp;

Cyberdark Edge, Cyberdark Horn, Cyberdark Keel: the reason i placed these 3 in the same section is because they're literally in this deck for the same reason, their names. Honestly you can get away by playing only two of these, i just play all 3 for thematic purpose.

&nbsp;

Cyberdark Cannon: Now back to the juicy core cards. This suspicious looking dragon is basically the rota Cyberdarks so desperately needed, it allows you to discard it from your hand to search a machine ""Cyberdark"" monster, also it has some other effects while it's equipped to a monster, those are not really worth mentioning. It searches ""Cyberdark Chimera"" and gives you an extra ""Cyberdark"" name in the gy, an obvious 3of.

&nbsp;

Cyberdark Claw: another juicy core card. This guy is basically ""Cyberdark Cannon"" but for ""Cyberdark"" Spell/Trap cards. You usually use it to search ""Cyberdark Realm"" or ""Cybernetic Horizon"", both are cards we'll get into later. Also same as Cannon, two equip effects no one cares about. Obvious 3of is obviously obvious.

&nbsp;

Cyber Dragon Core: The third most juicy card in the deck. It's ""Cyber Dragon Core"" i believe we all know what it does by this point, searches a ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap card when normal summoned and has a gy effect that rarely matters. Core is basically ""Cyberdark Claw"" but you normal summon it and it searches almost every single Spell/Trap card in your deck, you will usually search ""Cyber Eternal"" which is another card we'll get into soon enough. As with most ""Cyber Dragon"" decks Core is a 3of.

&nbsp;

And that concludes the main deck monsters. Now we head to the spells.

Starting with.....

&nbsp;

Overload Fusion: It's basically your miracle fusion. Fusion summon any Dark Machine monster by banishing materials from your field or gy, pretty self explanatory. I run it as a ""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"" target to make comebacks and stuff, feel free to replace it with something else.

&nbsp;

Power Bond: Your main fusion spell, there is a lot to unpack here. ""Power Bond"" allows you to fusion summon any machine monster using materials from your hand or field and it doubles the original attack of the fusion monster summoned, however during your endphase you take damage equal to that monster's original attack. This is what ""Cyberdark Chimera"" searches. needless to say it's a hard brick, you absolutely don't wanna see it in your hand and if you do see all copies of it in your hand you might as well scoop. You generally need 1, but i play 2 because i always draw it in my opening hand.

&nbsp;

Cyber Emergency: This is your Rota. ""Cyber Emergency"" allows you to add any ""Cyber Dragon"" or any Light Machine that can't be normal summoned/set from your deck to your hand. Your main search targets are ""Cyber Dragon Core"" and ""Cyber Eltanin"". Even if you don't play ""Cyber Eltanin"" you still want to see this card in your hand as much as possible, ""Cyber Dragon Core"" is that important, and you can discard it with ""Cyberdark Chimera"" if need be, so it's never a brick. Play 3.

&nbsp;

Cybernetic Horizon: Well well well, if it isn't the second most juicy card in the deck. ""Cybernetic Horizon"" requires you to send to the gy a Light and a Dark ""Cyber"" monster one from your hand and one from deck, then it allows you to send a ""Cyber"" fusion monster from Extra Deck to the gy and then it lets you add any ""Cyber"" monster from your deck to your hand. You're almost always gonna send ""Cyber End Dragon"" and one of the level 4 ""Cyberdark"" monsters other than ""Cyberdark Chimera"" to search either ""Cyber Dragon Core"", ""Cyberdark Claw"" or ""Cyberdark Cannon"", Also it's always treated as a ""Cyberdark"" card. Now let's recap here, a cost that's basically gy set-up, an effect that's also gy set-up and a search AND it's also searchable. This card is insane, play 3 and nothing less, I would play 4 if i could.

&nbsp;

Machine Duplication: I think we all know where this is going. ""Machine Duplication"" doesn't really need an introduction, everyone knows what it does but I'll say it for newcomers, it allows you to target any machine monster you control with 500 or less attack and then you summon up to 2 monsters with the targeted monster's name from your hand or deck. You can target ""Cyber Dragon Core"" with this card (Since it's name becomes ""Cyber Dragon"" while on the field or gy) to summon 2 ""Cyber Dragons"" from your deck and then go into ""Cyber Dragon Nova"" Then ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"". As i said with ""Cyber Dragon"" if you're gonna cut it might as well cut ""Machine Duplication"" since both are just ways to make ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"", and don't contribute to the deck's main gameplan that much.

&nbsp;

Cyber Repair Plant: Now this one's a classic. ""Cyber Repair Plant"" allows you to search any Light Machine monster or shuffle it from the gy into the deck if need be, also if you have 3 ""Cyber Dragons"" in your gy you can use both effects. This one isn't very crucial to the deck, i play 3 because i like it and it helps recycle your ""Cyber Dragons"" to make ""Machine Duplication"" useful, but you can play 1 or 2 if you like.

&nbsp;

Cyber Eternal: It's literally just ""Return of the Dragon lords"". ""Cyber Eternal"" Let's you special summon any ""Cyber"" fusion monster from your gy ignoring it's summoning conditions but you have to properly summon it first, also when a ""Cyber"" fusion monster you control would be destroyed by battle or by a card effect you can banish this card from your gy instead. It may not seem like it but ""Cyber Eternal"" is crucial to the final endboard of this deck, and it's probably the main reason ""Cyber Dragon Core"" is in this deck. Play 3.

&nbsp;

Cyberload Fusion: This one probably gave a certain Duel Links player some ptsd flashbacks. ""Cyberload Fusion"" allows to fusion summon any fusion monster that lists a ""Cyber Dragon"" monster as a fusion material by shuffling monsters from your field or Banished zone, also you can only attack with that monster for the rest of the turn. I mainly use this to summon ""Chimeratech Overdragon"" and ""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"" same thing with ""Overload Fusion"". Feel free to cut it for something else.

&nbsp;

Cyberdark Realm: The fourth most juicy card in the deck. What ""Cyberdark Realm"" does is that when it's activated it allows you to add any ""Cyberdark"" monster from your deck to your hand, also during your main phase it allows to normal summon a ""Cyberdark"" immediately after the effect resolves. It's another rota and double summon as well. Your normal off of this is always gonna be ""Cyberdark Chimera"" and your regular normal summon is always gonna be ""Cyber Dragon Core"". Needless to say play 3.

&nbsp;

And that concludes the main deck. (Yes traps are not real and no ""Cyberdark invasion doesn't count shutup)

Now we head for the extra deck,

Starting with......

&nbsp;

Cyberdark End Dragon: Is this God? No, it's just an extremely edgy dragon. Ooooh boy, there sure is a lot to talk about here, let's start shall we? First of ""Cyberdark End Dragon"" Can only be fusion summoned by using ""Cyberdark Dragon"" and ""Cyber end Dragon"" as materials OR you can summon it by sending a Level 10 or lower ""Cyberdark"" fusion monster equipped with ""Cyber End Dragon"" you control to the gy, Also it is unaffected by your opponent's activated effects, meaning it dies to stuff like ""Skill Drain"" and ""Destiny Hero - Plasma"", Also once per turn it allows to equip one monster from either gy to it, not a quick effect. This embodiment of mediocrity leaves me unsatisfied and sad, don't get me wrong it's good it's really good but it just doesn't do enough for a monster with such legendary status, anyways i could stay here and rant all day or i can talk about cards and i choose to do the latter. While the summoning condition might seem hard to accomplish, it is surprisingly relatively easy to do granted it wastes most of your resources but still if it works it works, the effects are above average at best it's not unaffected against everything which can be a problem at times and the gy equip thing while useful could have been better, also you can revive it and protect it from battle by using ""Cyber Eternal"". All in all, this is your boss monster and you play 1 of it.

&nbsp;

Cyber End Dragon: Ah, the og Train stable. ""Cyber End Dragon"" doesn't really need an introduction, you summon it using 3 ""Cyber Dragons"" and it's a 4000 atk beater that inflicts piercing damage. You rarely if ever summon it, it's main uses are being sent to the gy via ""Cybernetic Horizon"" and equipped to ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"" to summon ""Cyberdark End Dragon"". Not much to talk about here.

&nbsp;

Cyberdarkness Dragon: N E G A T E. ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"" is fusion summoned using 5 ""Cyberdark"" effect monsters, when summoned it equips a Dragon or a Machine monster from your gy to itself, also it can negate and destroy any card your opponent activates by sending any equip spell on your field to the gy. This guy is pretty crucial to the deck, it helps summon ""Cyberdark End Dragon"" and also is a non-once per turn negate, it can also be revived with ""Cyber Eternal"" which is how the endboard comes to be.

&nbsp;

Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon, Chimeratech Overdragon, Chimeratech rampage Dragon and Chimeratech fortress Dragon: boy that's a lot of names. The ""Chimeratech"" monsters don't really need an introduction either, but I'll skim over their effects real quick. ""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"" allows you to send a ""Cyber Dragon"" and a monster in the Extra Monster Zone from either field to the gy to summon itself, gains 1200 attack for each material used. Break boards. ""Chimeratech Overdragon"" Fusion summoned using a ""Cyber Dragon"" and any number of machine type monsters, gains 800 attack for each material and can attack that many times as well. Big number hit hard. ""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"" Fusion summoned using any 2 or more ""Cyber Dragon"" monsters, when summoned targets and destroys Spell/Trap cards up to the number of it's materials, also can allow to send up to 2 Light Machines from your deck to the gy to gives 1 additional attack for each. Small number hit many times. ""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"" Allows you to send 1 ""Cyber Dragon"" and any number of machine monsters from either field to the gy to summon itself, gains 1000 attack for each material used. Break boards again.

&nbsp;

Cyberdark Dragon: You literally never summon it. I have no idea why this is here it quite literally serves no purpose at all. Actually remove and play something better.

&nbsp;

Cyber Dragon Nova, Cyber Dragon Infinity: N E G A T E. I'm not even gonna talk about these two, if you don't know what they do you shouldn't be here to be honest. All I'm gonna say is that if you were to cut ""Cyber Dragon"" and ""Machine Duplication"" you should probably cut these two as well, unless you decide on playing ""Galaxy Soldier"" or something.

&nbsp;

Cyber Dragon Sieger: Now this is what i call battle prot. ""Cyber Dragon Sieger"" it's name becomes ""Cyber Dragon"" while on the field or gy, also once per battle phase if it didn't attack during this battle phase it allows you to target a Machine monster you control with 2100 or more attack you control that monster gains 2100 attack but neither player takes battle from ""Cyber Dragon Sieger"" during the turn you use this effect. Sieger doesn't seem like it does much but it simply existing helps this deck a ton, first off you link summon it by sending ""Cyber Dragon Core"" and ""Cyberdark Chimera"" to the gy, thus triggering Chimera's effect to foolish, and it's battle phase is very useful as well.

&nbsp;

Predaplant Verte Anaconda: No, you're not summoning Dragoon shutup. If you really want me to explain what verte does you should go watch YouTube or something. You use Verte to send either ""Overload Fusion"" or ""Cyberload fusion"" to aid you in the otk. That's literally it.

&nbsp;

And with that every single card in the deck is finally done. But we're not done yet, now i have to explain the combo move by move, so let's start.....

&nbsp;

<em><strong><span>THE MAIN COMBO.....</span></strong></em>

First you gotta have ""Cyber Dragon Core"" or a way to search it in hand and you gotta have either ""Cybernetic Horizon"" or ""Cyberdark Realm"" in your hand, you must have one of them and at least a way to search the other, you also gotta have any other monster and any other spell/trap card in your hand. Now let's make an imaginary hand, shall we?

Your hand is: ""Cyber Dragon Core"" ""Cyber emergency"" ""Cyberdark Realm"" ""Cyberdark Edge"" ""Cyber Dragon"". You go first and you do this....

1)Activate ""Cyberdark Realm"" and Search ""Cyberdark Claw"". 2) Activate ""Cyberdark Claw"" discard it and search ""Cybernetic Horizon"". 3)Activate ""Cybernetic Horizon"" send the ""Cyber Dragon"" in your hand and ""Cyberdark Horn/Keel"" from your deck to the gy, then send ""Cyber End Dragon"" to your gy and Search ""Cyberdark Cannon"". 4)Activate ""Cyberdark Cannon"" discard it and search ""Cyberdark Chimera"". 5)Activate ""Cyberdark Realm"" to normal summon ""Cyberdark Chimera"". 6)Activate ""Cyberdark Chimera"" discard ""Cyber emergency"", or any Spell/Trap card in your hand, search ""Power Bond"". 7) Normal Summon ""Cyber Dragon Core"", it's effect activates and you search ""Cyber Eternal"". 8) Link Summon ""Cyber Dragon Sieger"" using ""Cyber Dragon Core"" and ""Cyberdark Chimera"". 9)Activate ""Cyberdark Chimera"" to foolish a ""Cyberdark"" monster. 10)Now you have enough materials to summon ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"", activate""Power Bond"" and summon ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"", it's effect activates and you equip ""Cyber End Dragon"". 11) Send ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"" to the gy to summon ""Cyberdark End Dragon"". 12) Activate ""Cyberdark End Dragon"" to equip any card to it, except ""Cyber End Dragon"" and ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"". 13)Activate ""Cyber Eternal"" from your hand to bring back ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"", it's effect activates and you equip ""Cyber End Dragon"". And that's the combo. Your board now is ""Cyberdark End Dragon"", ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"" with two equip cards on field meaning two negates and ""Cyber Dragon Sieger"" for extra attack if needed. Not half bad for good ol'edgy Dragons if you ask me.

&nbsp;

<em><strong><span>AFTERTHOUGHTS.....</span></strong></em>

Don't really have much to say here that I didn't already say before except for some stuff. This is extremely flexible for the way you build it. I decided to go for a more consistent and thematically appropriate build, doesn't have much stables and dies if you sneeze on it. But a lot of the cards here can be removed and replaced with stables or even better tech cards. If i have one thing to say it's that Konami did a relatively good job with ""Cyberdarks"". Also yeah this deck dies to droll hard.

&nbsp;

Ah Finally, it's over. This took like 6 hours for me to make which makes all the more sad that no one is probably gonna read all that, not that i blame them LoL. But now I return to being depressed.

&nbsp;

<span><em><strong>THE END.</strong></em></span>

Genex Neutron is usually used to search for Cube, Cube along with Thrasher and Trident Warrior for a level 7 Synchro to search an equip spell with Cube.

Then you usually try to equip Sigma with whatever you have (hopefully a Mage Power searched with Cube and whatever Vylon Equips you have), attack with it to equip Tryce for another attack, attack again for a second Mage Power.

If you have Element and another Equip in hand, search for Kay'Est and turbo out Omega

Otherwise there's also the Epsilon Turbo option

The deck is not supposed to be anything gamebreaking, just some way to make Vylons look like they might work in some kind of format that is so far away from anything meta you would still assume you might lose if the deck contended in 2013 but hey, I just wanted to have fun and keep the whole thing affordable"

Please understand.,"The strategy with this deck is pretty standard for Witchcrafters
<ul>
 	<li>Begin the summon chain with Potterie, Schmietta, Pittore, Genni, into Verre, Haine, or optionally Aruru if you're feeling frisky</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Dump Bystreet into the GY with Schmietta's effect. If it's already there, get Holiday, Draping, or optionally Aruru into the GY instead</li>
 	<li>Use Pittore's effect to get an extra draw. Try not to be greedy with it if you don't have a witchcrafter card in hand</li>
 	<li>Use Potterie's effect if your hand is empty to get something in-hand (if you have duplicate spells in the GY for example)</li>
 	<li>Alternatively: You can use Reasoning and/or Card Destruction to quickly dump resources into your GY</li>
</ul>
My go-to is to get Madame Verre and Witchcrafter Bystreet on the field during the end phase of my first turn, with Aruru in-hand if it is at all possible. Against a lot of decks, Verre is able to hold her own since she's able to do untargeted monster effect negates and boost her ATK/DEF during the damage step, and Bystreet protects her from destruction once per turn. Haine is a good alternative to Verre since she's able to delete problematic cards, but I've that bringing her out first is less consistent than Verre. The strategy cares less about which one gets out first, so much as it does chaining the effects at the right times.

Also, most of the non-witchcrafter spells are there for Verre's ATK/DEF boosting effect, but depending on the situation, they can all be useful."

Going first you're a strong Trap deck, but going second you have the tools to break boards, and I like that dual nature a lot. I'm still a little foreign to Cyber Dragons - unlike a lot of the decks I've investigated they don't seem that intuitive for me to play. Still, there's a lot of room for Spice and I like that a lot.

So, for cards, we have 3 Cyber Dragon. I'm running all 3 because of Machine Duplication, but also because Cyber Dragon is an important tool for breaking boards going second, important enough that I'm still clowning around with 1 Toon Cyber Dragon, the 4th copy of Cyber Dragon, though it doesn't work for all purposes it helps make Megafleet and Nova just fine, but too many seems cloggy, since it isn't a card you want to open multiples of. Then 3 Cyber Dragon Core. Core + Machine Dupe is your main combo starter, and thanks to the Cyberdark engine 1 Core also makes Shenshen or Draco Berserker, which is pretty cool. Obviously we're on 3 Cyber Emergency to search it. Cyber Repair Plant is not a card I'm high on but you need to search it or see it for some combos, so 2 seems reasonable. All 3 Herz make the deck. Herz is a great tool for recovering resources, is a Machine Dupe target, and searches Cyber Dragon to fuel Galaxy Soldier, which makes Nova into Infinity. 1 Nachster, because it is searchable, this is a cool little tool you don't mind seeing in your hand, but 1 of them seems fine. Then we have the Cyberdark engine, 1 Realm, 1 Chimera and the 1 Power Bond. This Otk going second is pretty stupid, and it is a tool for going first as well, which is nice, and it is just a nice option. Power Bond is a card I always thought people should consider running anyways, and being able to search it and banish from the GY for it is a huge push. 1 Cyberload Fusion, its a searchable fusion card that recovers banished resources, it comes up. 1 Stardust Synchron so we can make Synchro plays. 1 Jizikiru, because it is searchable. I'm on 3 Cybernetic Overflow and honestly, it either feels like the best card in the deck or the worst. If you've made Cyber Dragon plays and kept resources for it to banish the card is incredible, but where it suffers is when you see it without gas. Still, I think this is probably better than Compulse or Punishment or something like that in this deck, so 3 makes sense. The next card is spicy, but when you think about it it makes a lot of sense. 3 Machina Overdrive with 1 Machina Citadel to search. So, while this engine requires you to run a brick, even just the shuffle draw effect of the card is huge in the deck, and can shuffle back cards that are banished or in the GY. This card is a dream to pitch to Cyberdark Chimera, but it's also pretty good on its own. Being able to wipe your opponent's board at SS2 is a good effect, and it shuffles the brick back into your deck to draw you a card. In low-end boards this represents a crucial piece of interaction vs the opponent's board that is very easy to turn on. On high end boards you can often maneuver it so that you have an extra card to send to get this interaction. And when pitched or removed the shuffle draw effect is completely valuable in its own right. I think this engine makes sense to run in basically any machine deck that isn't already running too many bricks. Cyber Dragon is barely any bricks, most of your cards are live, even if some are only as live going second. Then Solemns because Solemns.

In the Extra Deck, I have 2 Nova and 2 Infinity. It's a soft once per turn on all of their effects, so rather than running the Chronomaly and Constellar monster I think putting up a second Infinity is pretty good when you can, and I particularly like the second copy for the grind game. This deck can win out of nowhere, but it can also just grind turn after turn until the opponent is out of resources. AA Zeus also helps it do this, being a thing you can make with Infinity after attacking. Infinity can attach any attack position monsters to help Zeus get extra materials, which is clutch, and if you don't OTK there are few things more dangerous than a Zeus, even with only 1 activation. For links we have 1 Cyber Dragon Sieger, this is mostly here just to be another copy of Cyber Dragon for Overflow, but also helps us break boards by increasing monsters attack points, at the cost of them dealing no damage. 1 Double Headed Anger Knuckle, because its recursion effect is actually good, it is generic to make, and it makes the Citadel into less of a brick, since you can use this to summon the Citadel, use the Citadel to make Sieger, and then if this ever gets popped or beaten over you revive the Citadel. I think this card is bad in Cyber Dragons unless you're playing Machina Overdrive, but it makes the Citadel less of a brick, and is accessible in your normal combos. 1 Almiraj. Usually you don't want to make this, because doing so means you probably aren't playing through Nibiru, but it's an important card since Repair Plant needs a Cyber Dragon in the GY to activate. For the fusions, it's just Chimeratech monsters. Fortress Dragon can be huge in Machine mirrors, it usually doesn't come up but you need it just in case. Megafleet makes our Cyber Dragon monsters into removal using just summoning mechanics, which is pretty good, and worth running 2. And then Rampage Dragon, which you want a second copy of, since you'll sometimes use this in your normal combos to make Synchro plays, and want a back-up or follow-up copy. Making this with Power Bond is your main tool for closing out games, and 1 Core does that. For Synchro, we need an 8 that doesn't require too much setup, and that is Draco Berserker, and we can also make 9s commonly enough that we need a 9, and the best generic 9 right now is Shenshen IMO, so we're running that. You could cut the Synchro package and the deck would still be just fine, and I considered playing Called By The Grave over the Synchros, but I felt there was space in the deck and extra deck to just make the combos less linear and more flexible, which is something I strive for.

So in testing a few things have come up. Machina Overdrive has actually been pretty good, and Overdrive + Overflow is pretty close an OTK, since you can use Citadel to clear their front row and then Overflow to clear their backrow. It does suck that Overdrive can be hit by Ash Blossom, but also generally people burn up their Ash on your turn while you're setting up your board. What I really like about the engine is how it dramatically improves the deck's grind game, and games where you see multiple copies it really feels like you can play forever, though I'll concede Citadel is basically a really bad brick in the deck, so your milage may vary.

While the automated tagging has put this as an OTK deck, and the deck does have OTK potential when it goes second, this version is really more of a control deck, and you're going to want to go first in game 1 all of the time. The OTKs help you have game going second, but you're really trying to make Infinity + backrow more often than you're trying to go for the OTK. The OTKs also really help close out games with your follow-up so they're worth keeping in the deck even if you're going first, especially since the Cyberdark engine still has implications going first.

The deck can make Synchro plays but you shouldn't go out of your way to put up Shenshen or Draco Berserker. These cards are fine in their own right, but usually if you're going first and have the option of searching Overflow or using up your Power Bond to make Synchro plays you should be searching Overflow. However, Shenshen is one hell of a floodgate in a lot of matchups, so if you identify that the Shenshen is good it is a nice option to go into that is usually available. But the majority of the time you should be saving the Cyberdark cards for the turn you go for the kill. Having said that, there's no other single card I'd rather run over Stardust Synchron, and I really did dig deep into the card pool looking for alternatives. If I'm going to have extra spots in the main and extra deck I might as well run the Synchro package and diversify the deck's toolbox.

Repair Plant is better than I gave it credit when initially building the deck. While it is a little bit awkward, the ability to search Galaxy Soldier in particular, as well as doubling as Cyber Emergency in some of your combos, is really quite good. I still don't want to run 3 of the card, but I'm inclined not to cut it back to one after testing, the card's generic search effect is really quite strong for Cyber Dragons.

Toon Cyber Dragon has been fine. When you see it going second you're happy it is in the deck. Not being Cyber Dragon for Overflow makes it literally worse than Cyber Dragon in the deck, but that aspect rarely comes up. You usually either have plenty of Cyber Dragons to banish or basically none. You can side it out when you know you're going first, or when Megafleet seems bad, like against strategies that don't put up Link monsters. Same for Jizikiru, it is a hedge that you run when you're going second and cut when you know you're going first."

You can replace the Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer engine with Dragoon engine but if you wan,"Dream Mirror has gotten a lot of flack (justifiably) for being pretty bricky and gimmicky. But Dream Mirror has recently gotten a new support which makes it a hundred times better than what it used to be.

I'm going to cut it short here. Your main strategy is on a 1 and 2 card combo. Having either Neiroy, The Dream Mirror Heretic or both Neiroy and Chaos Creator

You use Neiroy to get it's LIGHT counterpart onto the field &gt; Special Summon Sprite onto the field and add Dream Mirror of Chaos to your hand (and if it's already there) add Morpheus, The Dream Mirror White Knight &gt; Then activate Dream Mirror of Terror and use Sprite's effect to summon Mara to Special Summon a monster from your hand &gt; Then link Mara and Neiroy into Artifact Dagda or Anaconda. &gt; Then fusion summon Tormentor. If you have Chaos Creator, special summon it before using Anaconda's effect. From there you can go into many other combos which you'll most likely figure out on your own.

This is currently what I've been working with, limiting to just the cards I have IRL plus the new cards. It's super recursive, but needs to be able to search wave (which we either have another link monster or main deck monster that hasn't been revealed yet, so there is still hope.

&nbsp;

The new link 4 outshines all of the other link 4's by both being removal and negation (however only removal on your turn and negation on the opponents). Hopefully this can be a good starting point for anyone who wants to try the deck out!"

""Dinosaur Power Deck""
focused on mainly low level
Dinosaur-Type monsters
and high level Dragon-Type Monsters.
His dueling strategy involves offensive
Beatdown tactics, concentrating on using
igh ATK-powered Dinosaur monsters to
bring down his opponent's
Life Points as quickly as possible.
In addition, he makes use of a
confluence of Dinosaur-support Magic
and Trap cards to augment on the
brute power of his Dinosaurs on the dueling field.
Though his signature cards are centralized around
Dinosaurs, his strongest monsters tend to be
Dragon-Types, such as the Red-Eyes Black Dragon,
Serpent Night Dragon, and Tyrant Dragon
(probably because, at the time, there weren't that many
strong Dinosaur type monsters).

The game starts when you send a Orcust monster to the grave, normally in the first turn you will send Orcust Knightmare or World Legacy - ""World Wand"".

In World Wand case you would be going to link summon Lib the World Key Blademaster that can give you a extender, go for this if you have a good hand with a lot of ways to keep putting bodies for you links.

If you send Orcust Knightmare to the GY and have a monster in your field ~activate Orcust Knightmare ~send World Wand from your deck ~Activate World Wand ~Summon your banished Orcust Knightmare ~Link into Galatea, the Orcust Automaton ~Activate Galatea effect ~put World Wand back in the deck and set a Orcust Crescendo. Orcust Crscendo is a omni negate. This is the only combo that i found that is consistently while playing but also i many times ended having to make a choice between Orcust Crescendo or Orcustrated Return to extend my combo.

But anyway, the deck is not as good like i thought, but is funny and the card desing is very unique.

The thing with instant fusion is that it DESTROYS the monster with means that if you have Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star in the end fase, you can Negate Instant Fusion destruction effect giving you El Shaddoll Winda that is a Summon Limit in monster form.

Turbo dragoon/secret village lockdown for free. Not only does this deck make dragoon and secret village but the pendulums work in such a way that making verte before pendulum summoning makes dragoon a free card, you can see boards like Dragoon/Verte/Clear wing synchro dragon/draco berserker/secret village. Thats spell lockout with +3 negations and a quick effect to banish 1 monster ontop of having the already overpowered Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon."

It doesn't have an exact ""combo"", but usually you want to Normal Summon Rod, and somehow get Dark Magical Circle in your hand, and usually you want to get either Magician's Navigation or Eternal Soul, a Dark Magician in your hand, and then use it as response. The Apprentice Illusion will help with boosting your monsters' attack, and searching Dark Magician directly. Really, for a rogue deck, the deck isn't bad. But it is most of the time very fragile. Once the deck can really get going, you can easily put 5-6 monsters on the field in one turn and smack your opponent for more than game."

If swapping to make a legal deck that uses handtraps, swap PoG, surface, &amp; the 2 water hazards.

Main goal of the deck is to slam down Cosmocroix early to lock up opponent's monster effects. Agel can draw either Cradel card, depending on what you need, but if you have Cosmocroix or Icejade Cradel in hand, add the field, if you have Inion Cradel or Terraforming in hand, add Icejade Cradel instead.

Sea serpent cards in the deck are the basis for all the synchro monsters, with Diva being able to pull one of 2 ways to synchro to 7 or going into Halq to which pulls another tuner (usually Minstrel) and any one of 4 tuner synchros. Clear Wing helps protect Cosmocroix, Dragite negates backrow, Brionac is used to setup Moulinglacia as it allows you to choose how many water monsters go in your grave &amp; provides minimum 1 target for Moulinglacia to discard.

XYZ's are much more difficult to get out as most require Acty to summon as it's the only level 4 in the Main Deck. Should you be able to summon them, Number 37  can work in tandem with Cosmocroix to make your opponents lose 4600 attack for 2 turns. Silent Honor ARK helps remove big Extra Deck monsters while bypassing destruction protections, Bahamut Shark &amp; Toadally Awesome combo sets up a spell/trap negation, Leviair helps pull back icejades that have banished themselves and allows for some recursion in the deck, and Abyss Dweller is mainly for if you no longer have Cosmocroix &amp; your opponent is trying to use grave shenanigans.

Called by  &amp; minstrel provide protection against Ash Blossom which is one of the worst handtraps for this deck as you need to pull a cards from deck w/ agel unless you  open with a perfect hand. Side deck provides additional protections in the way of instant fusion/restrict or dragged down/dimension shifter. Infinite impermanence is among the best cards in the side deck to switch out for as it stacks w/ Cosmocroix to prevent monster effects even on the turn they're summoned, letting you stun your opponent.

It does mean giving up Scythe, and it conflicts a little with Tuning Magician and Selene, but on the other hand if your game is Necro-Goon, Necro Apollousa-Bagooska-Dragoon seems like upside. Of course, the downside is you're pendulum, there isn't a lot of space for hand traps or other interaction before you settle on Necrovalley, and none afterwards.

So, we've got 2 separate pendulum engines in the deck, a large Pendulum Magicians Engine, and a smaller Darkwurm engine. For Magicians I'm on 3 Wisdom Eye, the best Pendulum Magician and a card you want to open, 3 Oafdragon Magician, our main low scale and a way to recur monsters from the extra deck, 3 Double Iris, because sometimes you'll want to pop this to get an extra interaction, 1 Tuning Magician for combos with Halq and Selene, 3 Harmonizing Magician, the second-best magician in the deck, an instant Needlefibre off of its pendulum summon, 2 Skullcrobat Joker which is just fine, it is technically a consistency card, then 1 of the Time Pendulumgraph for the extra interruption, 1 Star Pendulumgraph, technically a consistency card, also technically searchable protection, 3 Pendulum Call to pitch Darkwurm and search us our pen magicians, and lastly 3 Duelist Alliance to search Pen Call and Double Iris.

For the Darkwurm engine, we're on all 3 Darkwurm and all 3 Odd-Eyes Revolution Dragon to search Darkwurm, and the Supreme King Gate Zero, a necessary brick for Darkwurm. I felt like consistency was key in pendulums and like Pen Call pitch Darkwurm was a combo I wanted to see often enough, this is just guaranteed scales and easy access to a strong combo where both pieces are searchable.

For our last package, we're running Dragoon. Look, I just... okay? The deck is great at making Apollousa + Bagooska but Apollo + Dragoon is probably more appealing to end on in a lot of circumstances, and when it pushes to Dragoon + Apollo + Bagooska + Necrovalley that seems pretty scary to confront. Note that the Rank 4 can be easy access to a 4-5 material Zeus through Utopia, and that Apollo can often be Unicorn-Accesscode, so the deck has the tools to break boards with that package.

7 copies of Necrovalley. While it does make some sense to run more, I think you do flood out with excess copies more often when you do that, and the space in this deck is real tight, especially with Dragoon, and your odds of seeing a copy at 7 are high enough that it'll probably be there in at least 1 of your games if it is actually good. The reason we run 1 of the spell and 2 of the Commandant is that the first copy of the spell is better for Selene's purposes, but being once per turn makes the second copy worse.

So, just gonna run through the deck real fast. 1 Halq, just an easy to summon extender that enables combos. 2 Selene, because of Necrovalley you aren't using the second copy as often but you still want it for follow-ups when you didn't draw Necrovalley. 1 Apollo, your big boss monster, typically ends on 2 negates, but with Bagooska back-up it can actually get them. 1 Unicorn, and 1 Accesscode are a nice little package of board breaking cards that can also deal with set backrow. Dragoon also helps break boards, but is an omni-negate and also has very good protection that make it annoying. Tornado Dragon is here to pop our own Double Iris and that's about it, but it can also help take down backrow. Bagooska is here to protect Apollo, since we're summoning it at few negates. Abyss Dweller is here in case we pop off without Necrovalley. The last cards in the extra deck are Utopia into Zeus, with 4 or maybe even 5 materials."

OTK. Current/post BODE meta.,"Welcome back to to yet another updated Gren Maju build. With the way the current and likely meta is going to shape once BODE becomes TCG legal, I felt the need to shift from a handtrap Golden Castle based build to a more grindy and even more LVL 8 oriented build. Crossout Designator made handtraps even less effective as well all know. Also with the current meta running more Veiler and Imperms, the OTK that would often be provided by Dragubilon and Numeron Dragon is a lot harder to achieve, and Golden Castle simply burns too much through a 40 card build to risk using anymore.

The deck has seen a marked increase in LV:8's with the additions of Gadarla (vital for Barrier Statue spammers), Gamecial and Alpha. Kaiju's are often my go to to get rid of annoyingly tough to remove omni-negates and other interruptions (Dragoon/Enforcer/Baroness/Ultimatness.. you get the idea). Looping Alpha with Kaiju's is often a good way to eat through several layers of interruption and Alpha being a 3k beatstick allows it to clean up most of what is left. With this increase in LV:8's brings additional drawing power in the form of Trade-In, being useful not only to draw additional cards, but also activate the Danger monster effects should the need arise. Interrupted Kaiju Slumber provides both removal as well as ensuring I can get to a vital Kaiju to further prevent the opponent being able to regain a board. Gizmek/Eater Of Millions and Pot Of Desires as we all know do the job of deck thinning and banishing to allow Gren Maju to swing. Additional facedown removal from Eater is also at times of great benefit. Eater has been moved up from 1 in my Golden Castle builds to 2, to have a more balanced method of winning. Lightning Storm, Harpie's and Pankratops provide excellent removal as well.

Not much really needs to be said about the side deck. I'm pretty much happy with it as is. Dingirsu/Zeus are as strong as they've always been with non-targeting and non-destructive removal. Sanaphond has really come into it's own, as shutting off graveyard revival prevents Enforcer from coming back via it's own effect, as well as shutting down a great deal of the meta's ability to rebuild boards from the grave. Lancelot is surprisingly good with it's ability to poke directly for 2k damage. With life points likely to be low on the opponents end most of the time, this can often be critical. The added negating of any type of activation is a little bonus as well. N'tss to punish Dogmatika. Knightmare's Phoenix, Unicorn and BLS can come up from time to time, but Zeroboros/Accesscode are mainly there as additional win cons and to be honest lack of any real alternatives that fit with the deck. Out of everything in the Extra, these two I can't say have ever come up, nor have there been situations where they could've helped. But you never know, may find some uses at some point.

Dimension Shifter is sat in the side deck. Although still immensely strong and crippling to the vast majority of decks, without knowing the impact of Flunder's on the meta, I would rather have a reasonably solid 40 card main deck that is decently effective against everything (of course the die roll greatly skews this) rather than have a few cards that are utterly useless Game 1 when dealing with what could be frequent matchup. Ra Sphere is 3 Kaiju's in one, and is one of the few cards capable of flat out cleaning Drytron and the monster portion of Phantom Knight boards, which could otherwise prove tricky, if not impossible to get around. Can also come in handy against Swordsoul, as they can have three monsters on board as well. Being a normal summon is also helpful should I walk into Barrier Statue +2 monster boards, and doesn't usually interfere with the deck's strategy, as everything bar Gren Maju is a special summon anyway. Double Twins and Red Reboot are additional backrow coverage, whilst DD Ground, Summon Limit and Imperial Order all provide the ability to completely stun all the match ups i'm likely to face.

Btw, i filled the unused space with Deskbot shenanigans.

Destruction sword alone can't do much against a non-dragon deck, so if you are going against these kinds, try aways get you Crystron and proceed to the <strong>Deskbot combo:</strong>

Jester Confit + any tuner (except deskbot 001); special summon Jester and normal summon the monster ~link summon Crystron Halqifibrax ~with Crystron effect special summon Deskbot 001 from the deck ~link summon Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon ~After Auroradon have summoned his tokens, special summon Deskbot from your GY ~Synchro into Cupid Pitch and rise its level ~Activate auroradon effect and destroy 2 tokens ~Summon Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing ~after summoning his tokens summon Deskbot again ~Synchro Summon Borreload Savage Dragon using Cupid Pitch and a token ~chain Cupid and Borreload effects ~Summon the Creation Resonator that you just added ~Synchro into Baronne de fleur ~Synchro Summon Herald of the Arc Light ~set any traps that you might need and end the turn. 3 omni negates plus your traps and hand traps.

If you are going against a deck using DPhoenix Enforcer you can change the combo a lit to get Clear Wing Synchro Dragon and negate his destruction effects.

I am using 3 Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman to mill cards needed to fusion summon, thats why i ain't using many Destruction Sword Memories.

<strong>Destruction Sword Combo:</strong> If you managed to get any Dragon monster in the GY and have PDS in hand, set it, in the opponent turn activate it and send 1 DSM and your Buster Blader to immediately after been send, activate DSM effect and fusion Buster Blader, Dragon Destroyer Swordsman that together with the Buster Dragon you also summoned you get a board stun akin to skill drain, but more like a plasma, since it's one sided. This can be used in conjunction with the deskbot combo.

!UPDATE: i changed some cards and the monst important I CHANGED A IMPORTANT PART OF THE COMBO COMBO, so if you have read the combo in the first version make sure to read again because this is much better now. Have a good day.

!UPDATE2: YES. I CHANGED THE COMBO AGAIN AND NOW THIS IS THE LAST TIME. The new combo have Barone de Fleur included. I was oscilating with the combos because theres so many variables and other ideas in this site but today i found the best, i guess. Also i included the DESTRUCTION SWORD COMBO. Have a good morning.

Sorry for any grammar mistakes.

Any suggestions are welcome.

OK, so when Guardian Chimera was shown to be a real card, I was blown away. The artwork was amazing, the effects were strong yet balanced, and the summoning condition made sure it wasn't overpowered. I chose to put this in a Fluffals deck for two reasons.

One, Fluffals are good at getting a bunch of monsters in their hand, and two, Guardian Chimera is a go-second card, while Fluffals are a go-second deck. And due to the obvious killer doll theme, I decided to name this profile ""Deck of Chucky."" Which is ironic, considering that I saw a Chucky movie on TV last week.

&nbsp;

Anyways, this deck is NOT meant to go first. Your only first turn play is summoning Frightfur Sheep, or getting Edge Imp Scythe and getting a Fluffal monster--ideally Fluffal Penguin--into your hand. You want to go second, especially since some of the monsters in this deck WANT to be sent to the Graveyard. Edge Imp Chain, Fluffal Cat, et cetera."

Hope it brings you new ideas, this is the most fun deck I've been playing since launch.
I like the card ratios but I'll show you the differences you'll find in other builds:
3 Sting Lancer and 3 Scout Buggy = many builds only use two of each. I like to maximize the Beetrooper monsters because they are the best cards in the deck along with the Resonance Insect and they always give you an advantage so I want to see them in my starting hand, not to mention that in more grind matches their third copy shows up a lot.
Kaiju is the card that I feel the most that cutting from the main deck is good because there are a lot of hands that I brick with it. I think Parasite Paranoid is a card that plays the same role as Contact ""C"" in most cases that are in matches against Salamangreat and Ignister that have Link 1 that need Cyberse monsters to be summoned and especially against the Tri-Brigade it's practically another copy of Contact ""C"" that you lock a Link monster from it after the first effect you lock on Beast-Type resolves. Another deck that I've taken a lot of value from is against ABC when he activates Union Hangar to equip from the deck. The only matches that only Contact ""C"" works are on decks focused on the Archetype name like Zoodiac and Prank-kids so I use a copy in the side deck.
Parasite Paranoid also shines in random situations like for example the opponent activates a monster effect that targets an Insect you control like Double Dragon Lords (if it doesn't send it as a cost to the GY) or ABC Buster Dragon among others functioning as a protection to your move. Another interesting situation is it protects your monster from being destroyed by battle, for example you pass Seraphim Papillon with 2 counters verses Eldlich and you prevent the Golden Lord from attacking you and Papillon is guaranteed to use the effect twice and stay alive for the turn. The third important situation of Parasite Paranoid is you equip it on any monster on the field that will be sent to the GY either to Link Climb or destroyed by battle or card effect and then use its second effect to summon usually from the Doom Dozer ignoring the summoning Condition which has been helpful to me 2 times.
The last engine thing I did was take out the Battlewasp Twinbow and use Butterfly instead because that way the Underworld Goddess is much easier to happen because I easily put 3 effect monsters on the field and use Opponent's Apollousa or I:P Masquerena as material which I really like this option because Apollousa is a big problem for this deck since most of the monsters you summon have very low atk and Butterfly have 1200atk who can already get the Wind Barrier Statue or a Herald of the Arc Light. His being Wind also improves the situation of you being on Gozen Match because it's much better for you to try to play with the Wind monsters as you play Cicada King, Shinobi and Papillon and try to survive until you get an out. Not to mention that it makes a difference if you have more Bugs in GY and Butterfly is perfect to be banned at any time. If you draw multiples you simply discard the second with Picophalena's effect.
The extra deck of the nine Insect cards that I highly recommend using because it always has utility, Shinobi is the only one that I never use its effect but to my surprise its continuous effect cannot be targeted by attacks has saved me a few times in grind game with simplified gamestate.
As for the generic monsters I highly recommend you use Almiraj because it makes the Resonance Insect a live card at the same time you have enough game volume to leave it on the field and use only one zone to play and thus protect yourself from cards like Chuche, Punishment and Torrential Tribute taking the opponent by surprise. Phoenix and Trisbaena are other excellent cards in this deck and indispensable, Trisbaena you have several ways to trigger its effect, the main one is the Beetrooper Formation, but you also have Sting Lancer, Doom Dozer and this guarantees you to win backrow which is the main deficiency of this deck. Otherwise the other Extra Deck cards can be any other utility card like Knightmare Cerberus or Unicorn, Unchained Abomination etc. The choices of tech cards in the main deck as well as the side deck are just options that I present, you can assemble it according to the meta. Just be smart with Nibiru because sometimes you lock Bugs and you can't use it but it's a price to pay to survive and take the turn back.
What I expect from the new support are more Advantage Enabler or monsters with Floating effects and especially a Link 3 or Link 5 with interaction effect even if it's a Pop every turn like the Phoenix Enforcer does. I expect a link that gives properties to the Invincible Atlas like for example: Insect monster that was made using this card as material gains this effect: Once per turn, if an Insect is summoned in a zone that this card points to: send a card that your opponent controls for the gy. I think it's perfect because this deck summons on the opponent's turn and Atlas is currently a very weak win condition, it's not just because it has dragoon protection that it's competent. I would also like a link 2 that does Picofalena's work, but it doesn't need to discard cards and equip a Banned Insect on it to keep looping the resonance insect in the grind game, because locking on insects is more interfering than helping because there's not much where go since the Insect type has very weak extra deck cards that don't help you put pressure on the field. But the big problem with this deck is that you need to use a lot of bad extender to make combo so this deck deserves to extend like Dragon Link which gives you an advantage as Noctovision makes Chain Block and draws cards and also an efficient way to deal with spells/traps which is horrible these days."

Very simple deck revolving around getting out Golgonda, and stacking that Xyz Monster into Zeus during M2. It's got a few interesting tech choices in such as King of Feral Imps, and Machine Duplication.

Not meant to be competitive, but one could easily cut one of each four star Springan, and some of the traps to add hand traps.

Opted to throw an experimental brew in the sideboard. Been playing around with Fallen of Albaz since he was also reprinted. Small engine, but it seems like it's got potential."

<span>It's been quite a while since the last one and don't worry, I don't plan to write this one exclusively in Nickelback song titles.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>New Fish in the Ocean</span>

<span>Marincess was never a bad archetype to begin with. That was in large parts thanks to their Cyberse typing which in and of itself boosts the powerlevel of any of its given archetypes. Still, it felt like these fish were floating around the East Blue rather than the Grand Line if you know what I mean. They could pack a punch, take a bite but all in all weren't all that frightening.</span>

<span>But guess what, we're swimming with the big boys now. There's plenty of fish in the Ocean and the Ocean just, got, bigger. Let's talk support.</span>

<span>The Goodies:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Marincess Springirl"">Marincess Springirl</a></span><span>: Or <a data-name=""Marincess Spring Girl"">Spring Girl</a>? Either way this card's great. It's a level 4 extender with a trigger effect if sent to the GY, allowing for more *in deep, echo-y voice* CHAINBLOCKING. It can mill cards from the top of the deck equal to the number of Marincess monsters you control. Lemme translate. ""Here's another shot at Wave"". So many cards can recycle from the GY, this is an add effect with an attitude.....or additude SORRY</span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Marincess Sleepy Maiden"">Marincess Sleepy Maiden</a></span><span>: What's this? Another extender? Konami is going wild today. It's biggest weakness is its level. It's a *gags* Level 5 *shudders*. It's a pretty free extender, requiring no banishing or a set amount of Marincess monsters on the field. Any Marincess equals 2 Marincesses with this tired gal. The problem is that the Marincess Link-1s need a Level 4 or lower Marincess monster, don't ask why.</span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Marincess Dive"">Marincess Dive</a></span><span>: And for the third card I present you: An..extender? Did Konami really just print three in-archetype extenders? Who of you madmen sold their soul to Konami again, huh? Leaving aside the large amount of firstbornes Konami is bound to receive in about 2-3 business days, this card is actually pretty bonkers. It's a Special Summon from the GY for your non-Link Marincess monsters or, if you already control Battle Ocean it straight up Special Summons from deck. That means that drawing Battle Ocean doesn't actually make you brick since you can then add this to hand instead using Sea Angel. This card also allows <em>any</em> Level 4 or lower Marincess Monster to enable a Link-4. Without the Field Spell but if you're loaded with handtraps and a Wave, who cares?</span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Marincess Aqua Argonaut"">Marincess Aqua Argonaut</a></span><span>: I don't know if here name is derived from a certain useless goddess of if she used to accompany Jason on their search for their golden Feeces. Fleeces. I mean Fleece. Something golden that's not poop. Anyways she's the newest Link-4 and despite her name is pretty dang useful. She Special Summons one of her equiped Marincess Links in order to negate a Spell/Trap card or effect. Pretty cool. The worst part about her is that you now need too decide between her negate and Bubble Reef's draw. If that seems too hard just go with your heart, your gut or whatever is found beneath, whichever one helps.</span></li>
</ul>
<span>The Oopsie Daisies:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Marincess Bubble Ring"">Marincess Bubble Ring</a>:</span> This card is a situational attack negate and I think that's all that needs to be said. Very slow, very weak, someone was hesitant to give up their firstborne and this is our punishment. Thanks..</span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Marincess Circulation"">Marincess Circulation</a></span><span>: This trap is kinda like Snow. You swap one WATER Link for a Marincess Link with the same rating. Super duper situational. While it's cool to think that you could use Aqua's S/T negate or draw a card with Bubble Reef and then tag them out for the other I'd really prefer any other card in my deck over this one.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span>What's remained</span>

<span>Let me start by saying no two Marincess decklists are the same. They tend to be very different from one another. Some might play way more extenders, some may still be on the Frogs. For this one I took my old version and updated it accordingly. I'd consider my decklist to be quite teched while some prefer it simple. However I like the tech choices and I think they're strong. I'm not gonna go over my Dinomiscus or Fury-Torrential ratios, I've done that in the past already. It's the same idea of running a good amount of handtraps, some backrow to protect your tower for a strong turn 1 that exceeds the standalone Marincess combo line to then finish off your opponent with an unfair amount of ressources on the following turn.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>What's changed</span>

<span>For starters, I added the new stuff but I think you figured. Sleepy Maiden is a one off for me since it doesn't equal full combo, is ""just"" an extender and this deck plays plenty. It's nice to have tho. Springirl is another three off since it's Level 4. I upped Pascalus up to two copies, although even three would be viable now. There are way more targets and she tooo can climb into a Link-4 now. Also, her recursion matters more as there are more good S/Ts which can be recursed. Dive's a three off for me since it's just really powerful. I added Sea Nettle since there's plenty of WATER boss monsters now to OTK and turn 1 it's just the best Level 4 extender.</span>

<span>I got rid of the frogs. What I didn't like about them is how win more Swap Frog felt. You needed a really good hand if you wanted to summon Toadally Awesome within 5 summons. And summoning Toadally after your combo felt very win more since at that point any form of extra interaction is great. Swap is very heavy on the ressources and with the new Level 4 Marincess and the Spell which can also be used to summon a Level 4 I found that this decklist can summon Toadally way more consistently that the previous one, which relied on pretty much exactly Swap and a good hand. Of course I've previously neverleaned hard into the Level 4 extenders but now I feel quite confident in cutting the Swaps without lowering this decks ceiling.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Access who?</span>

<span>I admit, I'm still on the Talkers. But great news, this deck is now completely viable without spending 200 bucks on four arrows. There are so many extenders now in this deck that it's no longer reliant on Accesscode to close out games. Don't get me wrong, Marincess still lack a way to out monsters without attacking into them but you can extend into way more bodies now and since you'll have so much ED space you can run a larger r4nk engine with cards like <span><a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Number 4: Stealth Kragen"">Number 4: Stealth Kragen</a></span> with two <span><a data-name=""Kragen Spawn"">Kragen Spawn<span>. The Kragens also count as a means to remove monster during the MP, making OTKing without Access all the easier.</span></a></span></span>"
