It's the Archfiend Guy again :D

This deck is all about recycling, reviving, searching and destroying with some of the biggest Archfiend monsters around. Archfiend Empress is a fantastic 2900 beater that can protect your other fiends, and also revive stronger Archfiends from the grave. Use cards such as Rhino Warrior, Cherubini and Void Apocalypse to fill the grave with monsters, and recycle your Dark Spirit of Banishment and Malice to Special Summon them back to the field. Combine this with Call of the Archfiend, and that almost guarantees two forms of summoning per turn, making it difficult for your opponent to deal with.

I have tested this deck, and its crazy good. I hope it can get at least 10k views like my first did. I think it got more than that though. Spread the word to your friends. This deck is really good. Its just a basic Trickstar deck but it really works against the meta, trust me and it hardly bricks. Its a going first build. I want to mention a couple of things you guys might be questioning about my card picks... So first off, the extra deck... ah yes it may be a little confusing at first but <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> is a good Ghost Reaper target PLUS it can be summoned off <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>'s effect when its sent to the graveyard. This is a countermeasure against Dogmatika! Same with <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>. A lot of the extra deck is Ghost Reaper targets because in my personal opinion, Ghost Reaper is really strong and slows down most decks or completely kills them. Also I know you see <a data-name=""Life Stream Dragon"">Life Stream Dragon</a>, its a beatstick from Needlefiber's effect! You can summon it from Needlefiber's second effect, tagging out for Life Stream Dragon. I wanted to make good use of Needlefiber and not just have it as a Ghost Reaper target because late game it can come up where you have only handtraps and you can summon 2 ashes for example, in the grind game to make Needlefiber and then during your opponent's turn tag out for Life Stream. And lastly, <a data-name=""Trickstar Magical Laurel"">Trickstar Magical Laurel</a> is good for extending your combos and its searchable via <a data-name=""Trickstar Candina"">Trickstar Candina</a>. <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> in the side deck because of dinosaurs. Hope you guys enjoy and stick around for more! Signing out, MindReader..."

as possible. and summon sera then you may end your turn.

&nbsp;

If you're lucky enough  and you drew The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine you can

activate it immediately then it will trigger the effect of sera then special summon any traptrix monster

from you deck I prefer traptrix mymeleo to trigger its effect after special summoned and it will also

trigger the effect of Traptrix Sera to set one ""Hole"" Normal Trap from your Deck Then Special Summon
Traptrix Rafflesia to protect your Traptrix Sera in any kind of destroy effects.

&nbsp;

if you Go Second Turn just play defensive and Summon Atrax and Set any cards that protect Atrax Such as
Compulsory evacuation Device or Storming Mirror Force then all your hole trap keep that all in you Hand

and you may End your Turn.

PS.Because of Atrax effect. Your opponent cannot negate your normal trap, not just ""hole"" trap but any Normal trap.

Isolde Halq provides all the stuff required. Idaten the Conqueror Star further ties the deck together because it can use the Fishermen as material and searches them or Overlay Booster for free Isolde. Combo is we get to Isolde, add Gearfried or any missing Fisherman, use Isolde send equip ss Grappler Angler, make Halq ss 001, make Auroradon ss 3 tokens, ss 001 from GY, make Herald of the Arc Light for early negation, use Auroradon tribute itself and 1 token ss O-Lion, make Vanguard Roland, use O-Lion chain Roland, ss token, make Borreload Savage, at the End Phase add warrior by sending 1 equip from deck.

Important/multi-functional cards are run at maximum copies, such as 3 Red Layer (best starter, Idaten fodder or free monster for Isolde), 3 Vyon (as both Polymerization or high lv warrior for Idaten material thanks to D-Hero Malicious), 3 Polymerization (unbricking the high lv monster for Idaten), 1 RotA (for Vyon or Fire Flint Lady for extender), 3 Durendal (for Fire Flint or Red Layer).

2 Fishermen (as spare if they're used as Idaten material), 2 Overlay Booster (Idaten target for Isolde, 2 for spare if it's used as Idaten material), 1 Kaiki the Unity Star (extender if we have Gearfried, tribute fodder for Fisherman II). The rest are just combo pieces and staples.

Pros: Themed, consistent, okay board with followup.

Cons: Many high lv bricks."

Thus eldlich cards are a great target for danger or lightsworn to be discarded or milled into the grave.

Thus, the strategy of this deck is to:

1: summon/special summon lightsworn and danger monsters (or use the effect of spell cards like hand/card destruction and reasoning) to discard/mill eldlich cards, jet synchron, and mecha phantom beast olion into the grave.

2: use the tuners (lightsworn raiden,  jet synchron, mecha phantom) to abuse crystron needlefiber and auroradon to summon A: Blazar or B: Borreload Savage and Herald or C: otk with knightmare unicorn + accesscode talker. The Blazar combo is in this video: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/qb_zKsaAXZw"">https://youtu.be/qb_zKsaAXZw</a>

3: use the search/revive effect of the eldlich cards in the grave to set up eldlich disruptions.

The main deck has no hand traps, thus the side deck is filled with handtraps. In the case that a player using this deck is playing a match against a combo deck and he/she knows that his/her opponent is going first, they can side in the handtraps, replacing filler pieces and making this a pure lightsworn eldlich deck with a lot of handtraps. What to side out is the player's choice, but I would suggest keeping the lightsworn engine and the parts of the crucial combo pieces (jet synchron, mecha phantom, deskbot 001) that allows the auroradon combo."

A lot of decks are playing combo and are unprepared for the grind game, and IMO, Eldlich control is the best grindgame deck in the game right now, provided you build it for that. People argue Salamangreats can grind further, since they don't have to banish their traps, but Eldlich can overwhelm them with more interaction in the early game, and go for the kill with Trains.

I started with basic Eldlich numbers, 3 Red, 1 White, 3 of each (good) Trap Monster, 3 Lord, 3 Eldland, 1 Countertrap (this will never change till these are hit on the banlist, or new trap monsters are printed). I also think 3 Lost Wind is really core to control builds of Eldlich - they help improve the deck's grind game, and actively want to be binned for Golden Lord or Souls. 3 Souls are the deck's normal summon - why run a brick when you don't have to? These are the main card advantage engine of the deck, and a great combo with Cursed Eldland. The last of the trap suite is slightly spicy.

I knew I wanted to run Dinomiscus this format in control. It's a generic answer to any card that can be targeted, it bins Golden lord, but more importantly, it banishes Golden Lord as well as Block Dragon. The extra effect of summoning a monster to use as material is generically useful as well, and gives the deck access to Eria the Water Charmer Gentle. Solemn Judgement makes a lot of sense. I was considering Compulse or the Trap Hole that banishes, but honestly, you should always run the Solemn cards before those. Judgement and Strike are both cards which uniquely answer a variety cards on generic counter traps, but I chose 3 Judgement and 2 Strike, because the deck already has a lot of monster effect negation, even if it's only on field negation.

I'm running Veiler instead of Gamma because the deck wants to grind out games, and be able to activate hand traps after the first turn while on the board. Gamma felt dead for this slower game plan a lot of the time. Also, this way only Ash Blossom and the Eldlich cards are hard once per turns, meaning seeing multiples of cards is less bad.

Side deck is a bunch of going second cards to break boards and cards to get rid of backrow. I'm very confident in this main going first."

<ul>
 	<li><span><strong>Deck Type: Stun/Lock</strong></span></li>
 	<li><span><strong>Key Cards: Mystic Mine/Spatial Collapse</strong></span></li>
 	<li><span><strong>Optimum Opening Hand: Barrier Statue of the Heavens, Ojama Trio/Trap Trick, Ojama Duo/Trap Trick, Spatial Collapse, Rivalry of Warlords.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<em><span>Since the dawn of time, the occasional anti-fun nut job has come along and sucked all the interactivity out of this game. </span></em>

<em><span>I aim to do exactly that with this build.</span></em>

<em><span>We have had champions like Jeff Leonard sneak wins with Mystic Mine, a card of that causes unfathomable groans from anyone who sits opposite it. Regardless, one can not argue with its power, but it needs a little something else. After hours of brewing I come to you with this, this concoction of several stun and forgotten relics of a forgotten era to help end your opponents hopes before they draw their first card.</span></em>

<em><span>Mind Collapse focuses around a personal favourite of mine; 'Spatial Collapse', a card that restricts both players to having 5 cards max in play at one time. Fill up your opponents field with tokens, slap down a barrier statue or throw up a rivalry and the game is essentially over. Very few decks have the space in the extra to keep utility cards that might be able to remove the tokens being light beast critters, with the only out being Ojama Emperor and who would be running that?</span></em>

<em><span>Lets not forget Mystic Mine however, a card that is a win condition in and of itself. While it isn't the end of the game if we don't see it, it makes stalling out for our Final Countdown/Cauldron of the Old Man win condition far more manageable. </span></em>

<em><span>Impermanence and Ghost Reaper help us going second, as well as disabling any problem monsters that might negate our Mine if it comes to that. </span></em>

<em><span>The extra deck is filled with an extravagance board, with the most common outs (light and high use links) filling the spots so we can easily ghost reaper a play starter or extender and limit the ending opponents field.</span></em>

<em><span>Overall its relatively consistent at setting up some sort of lock turn one (outside the opponent having spell trap removal, which is a standard weakness of these type of decks) but it is in no way competitive and, thanks to our extra deck, is way too expensive. You could easily lower the price by swapping out  the extra deck for any old cards since they will just be banished for extravagance, and by that same token swap out the reapers for Ash Blossom, Nibiru or Dimension Shifter. </span></em>

<strong><span>Pros</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><span>Can consistently set up a lock turn one.</span></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><span>Has a good match-up against most meta decks.</span></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><span>You could make Jeff Leonard proud.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<strong><span>Cons:</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><span>Dies to MST/Twin Twister etc.</span></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><span>Reasonably expensive given its a casual deck (though can be altered).</span></strong></li>

&nbsp;

So Altergeist and Guru are two pretty well-known control decks. I think anyone who's been to locals has probably run into one of these decks before, and probably has a few choice words for anyone who plays these decks. So how's about we mash them together and make everyone mad?

&nbsp;

The deck can brick, all decks do. But a good hand allows for you to play Guru at first, and then pop off with Altergeist during your opponent's turn. <strong>The perfect hand is: </strong>The Hidden City, Subterror Guru, Subterror Final Battle, Solemn Judgment, and Altergeist Multifaker. Even if you get Ash Blossomed, you can get Guru on the field with two set back row, and Hidden City. But again, that's a perfect hand.

Honestly, you're just looking to play one side of the deck, and drop the other side either during your opponent's turn or right when you're backed into a corner. The side deck is built in a way that should allow you to switch to either Guru Control or Altergeist Control for games 2 and 3."

<em>Pot of Extravagance:</em> Playing 3x Pot of Extravagance for the only reason of seeing it as often in the start hand as possible, I would never activate it twice in a duel, because the Deck actually needs it's Extradeck. Extradeck is filled with double and triple copies of important cards to decrease the probability to banish everything that you need. PoE is in the end a ""gamble"" that you may lose sometimes, not often but there's still a certain % to banish everything you need. Always banish 6 for the +2 draw, banishing only 3 is a 1 for 1 exchange with no benefit at all. Also PoE may help sometimes as a bait to get rid of an Ash Blossom, if you already have everything you need to play - just making sure to have an exchange.

<em>Numeron Network and Numeron Wall:</em> none of both are Ash'able because Wall doesn't add to hand, it straight up activates and Network sends as cost. If going 1st and able to play the Numeron play just summon 3 Numeron Gates and go into S0 (Nibiru proof play and lockdown for 3 turns). If going 2nd summon 4 Numeron Gates and OTK, this is the only OTK you have in this deck and it actually is pretty viable. You can find online charts for the calculations, in what scenarios you are able to OTK or if your opponent will survive this round. At this point I would just pass on a video, skip to 4:50 to see the chart. <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOg2GYk1f4o</a>

Also Numeron Wall can protect you from getting OTK'd.

<em>Rikka Xyz: </em>Your main control monster is Teardrop the Rikka Queen, besides S0. Kanzashi the Rikka Queen is decent and if possible should be made after Teardrop, regarding Duelingnexus I have encountered a bug that you can't summon from your opponent GY's as in the replay I wanted to summon BEAWD but couldn't choose it.

<em>Terraforming, Mystic Mine and DRNM:</em> Terraforming can be either a Ash bait, enabler for the Numeron play or complete Shutdown by searching Mystic Mine. Having Mystic Mine in the Start hand is basically a free negation bait or a Shutdown for grinding against Combodecks. DRNM is supposed to break boards with Numeron Gates: summon 4 clear whatever you fear and go into S0.

<em>Rikka Traps:</em> Decent but not a must have - searchable via Petal and situational super cards, running only 1-1 because they might brick and either way playing enough control overall. Rikka Tranquility is supposed to make an Xyz, may be sided out for something superior if the duels ain't really grind-heavy. 1 Rikka Sheet in Sidedeck because it is actually a good Trap for the reason alone it is searchable.

<em>Rikka effects in general:</em> In my replays I have never used an effect to optional tribute a Plant to gain the additional effect, because most of the time it may sound decent but is overall a disadvantage in my opinion.

<em>Extra Deck breakdown:</em>

Nibiru, Lightning Storm, DRNM, Summon Limit against Combo Decks

Lightning Storm, Heavy Storm Duster, Cosmic Cyclone against Backrow heavy Decks.

Royal Decree, Red Reboot in addition to the Backrow heavy Decks but specific for Trap heavy decks as Eldlich variants."

Welcome to Prank-Kids,","Infinite combos and recycling like you would not believe in this deck. You can literally summon either of your boss monsters and board wipe during your opponent's turn without incurring cost thanks to Meow-Meow. It's a 1-card free combo off of any Prank-Kids monster to get a crazy set-up. If you start with any extra resources in your hand (an extra monster, fusion spell, field card, pretty much anything) you can generally combo into both of your boss monsters during your opponent's turn and completely destroy any hope they had of even playing the game.

The ratios I play are pretty standard, the deck just flows like this. I play 3 of the field spell and Terraforming just to bump my odds to 16 cards in my deck that will let me get off my combo. Thunder Dragon Fusion is pretty essential just so there's less fear if I'm forced to banish one of my Prank-Kids off of Rocksies. I saw someone else using The Last Warrior From Another Planet and Cyber-Stein, and I thought it was neat, but not strong enough to include in my main deck, so I've put it in my side just in case I ever want to pull it out, but to be honest, I almost never have to side deck, just because there's not much that can play through this deck (I think I've only ever had to when playing banish-eccentric opponents just to get a second Battle-Butler). If someone can successfully stop the combo early enough, Prank-Kids are done for, but I already play Ash and Called By The Grave at 3 each, and that's about all I've ever really needed.

If I had to change anything, I'd just make space in the side deck for more hand traps and negates, maybe add Infinite Impermanence or Lightning Storm, but realistically, those cards are way too expensive for me anyways.

Always try to go first with this deck just to get your set-up, especially since Meow-Meow can only banish itself during your opponent's turn.

The biggest counter to this deck that I've seen is anything that banishes. Dimension Shifter, Dark Law, Dimensional Fissure, and Macro Cosmos just make me want to die.

If you have any questions about combo tutorials or any ratios that I play, leave a comment down below and I'll try to explain!

With new banlists and new cards coming out (some are still in foreverstuckmode (cries for diviner of the heralds)), the darklords are slowly coming out of their shells and into a more modern setting. Youre still stuck trying to grind out as many Dl s/t as possible, so this deck wont ever really reach peak until they release a 2021 field spell like the Draitron one

Saffira is a funny ritual, and most Dl monsters are high lvl so any ritual summon is ez enough. That said, pre prep and ritual sanctuary help with searching for both the spell and monster you wish to use.

Ankuriboh is one of the most busted kuriboh because it gets to SS from your grave. What do you SS? Superbia. Then a fairy since no timing interruptions.

Athena is a bad card in most cases. In here, she can send 1 fairy monster you control to the GY, and get back 2 with Superbia."

Basically, you are trying to get out the <strong>Sun Dragon Inti</strong> and <strong>Moon Dragon Quilla</strong> loop. Nothing else to say except that there is a Charmer engine using their new cards.

Full Combo is ""<strong>Supay, Duskwalker</strong>,"" ""<strong>Ascator, Dawnwalker</strong>,"" (with cards for their discards) and <strong>Nefarious Archfiend Eater of Nefariousness</strong>. ""<strong>Supay, Duskwalker</strong>"" and ""<strong>Ascator, Dawnwalker</strong>"" Special Summon themselves after you discard a card. Then they Special Summon their respective tuner monsters which are <strong>Supay</strong> and<strong> Fire Ant Ascator</strong>. From here, if you have og <strong>Archfiend Eater</strong>, you can Special Summon him as you control a Spellcaster. Then, you can Special Summon<strong> Archfiend Reaper</strong> from your deck by tributing a spellcaster and an earth monster. You should really choose to tribute either ""<strong>Supay, Duskwalker</strong>"" or ""<strong>Ascator, Dawnwalker</strong>"" and <strong>Supay</strong> or <strong>Ascator</strong>. Both <strong>Supay</strong> and <strong>Ascator</strong> float into something (<strong>Ascator</strong> summons a level 5 from the grave and <strong>Supay</strong> summon<strong>s Oracle of the Sun</strong> from Deck).<strong> Archfiend Reaper</strong> summons back a level 4 monster from the grave which should be the tuner you tributed. Then once you use <strong>Reaper</strong> for the synchro summon of<strong> Inti</strong> or <strong>Quilla</strong>, he can add a <strong>Possessed</strong> Spell/Trap from your deck.<strong> Inti</strong> and<strong> Quilla</strong> summon each other after being destroyed.

<strong>Possessed Lyna</strong> searches ""<strong>Ascator, Dawnwalker</strong>"" when shes summoned by her effect. <strong>Pot of Extravagance</strong> gets you to your combo pieces. The <strong>Possessed</strong> cards just get you closer to your combo pieces also. <strong>Oracle of the Sun</strong> really has no purpose here except for being a target for <strong>Supay</strong> and <strong>Ascator</strong>. <strong>Dimmered Path</strong> recycles your ""<strong>Ascator, Dawnwalker</strong>"" and ""<strong>Supay, Duskwalker</strong>"" for next turn (kinda was just putting in cards to get to 40 cards).

<strong>Naturia Barkion</strong> negates<strong> Infinite Impermanence</strong>. <strong>Red Reign</strong> is for that small chance of a 1000 IQ play.

Interpret the side deck however you want. I don't see this deck actually winning games. Inca are just the cards used by Rex Goodwin in the anime; there is no real consistency."

Then start synchro summoning for whatever you need on the board; especially Geomathmech Final Sigma. Make sure Final Sigma is in the extra monster zone to gain its protection and double damaging effects. Geomathmech Magma can also be a great option, as it destroys two cards on your opponent's field when it destroys a monster."

More stronger. More faster. ,"Evolution of my first uploaded deck. Destiny Hero with Elemental Hero work very fine.

This deck allow you to recall in the hand or summon many monster (elemental and destiny hero) for fusion summon all the possible monster in the extra deck. 3 copies of polymerization, mask change and a copy of super poly give you the chance to summon all masked and elemental hero fusions. Fusion destiny is the strongest card in this deck: summon destiny hero Dominance, after 2 turn, for fusion destiny, this card go to GY and you can summon all 3 monster you used for fusion summon by his effect. Now you can special summon Dogma or Plasma from your hand.

Stratos recall from the deck a hero monster, Ocean recall a monster from GY or field, Drilldark allows you to special summon a destiny hero, with Solid and Liquid Soldier you can summon another monster, Blazeman send a monster from deck to GY (good for mask change), Decider allows you to recuperate a monster from GY and neutralize effect damage recalling this card from GY, woodsman helps you to summon much more fusions using Poly and Vyon send a monster to GY...(why do you send malicious to the GY??XD) Xtra Hero monster helps you to control the game by setting spell cards for fusions, add monster for your fusions, SS destiny hero and also add an hero monster to your hand."
