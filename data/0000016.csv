Foolish Burial Goods is there to send Overload to the Graveyard, turning it into an easy search on the next turn. Artifact Lancea was my tech choice as it protects your Gears and Drivers if you do not control Circuit or have a free monster zone for your Synchro Summons. Beatrice and Big Eye were chose over other Xyz because of their great synergy with PSY-Frames, Beatrice for enabling Multi-Threader and Overload plays and Big Eye for stealing the opposing monsters as a last resort. Overall, this is a good rogue deck, capable of facing most strategies and unleashing very powerful options, such as PSY-Framelord Omega and Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon to opress the opponent."

It's inspired by the Chaos Xyzs, Utopias and 100+ Numbers that were feat","This is a zexal-inspired deck that works around summoning Xyz's (non-link format, so you can't spam anymore) with the purpose of bringing out their CXyz (Chaos Xyz form). As it's namesake might suggest, the boss monster - and goal - is to bring about CXyz Barian Hope. The best way to bring about Barian Hope would be to use C101: Silent Honor Dark - which has an effect that allows you to pile on more Overlay material for Barian Hope, which boosts Hope's ATK/DEF. This can lead to an OTK, as it's not difficult to reach a 5000/5000 or 6000/6000 beater with CXyz Barian Hope. Aside from the boss monster, the deck revolves around the Utopia Chaos series - enabling you to deal damage or prevent damage, depending on the situation; and given other situations, there are various Xyzs - Castel (clearing), Honor Ark (card destruction + clearing), etc.

Basics: Most of the spells exist, in the counts that they are in, to speed up the summoning of a Chaos Xyz - but there are some reinforcement cards in spells like Xyz Territory and Xyz Tribal Rivals (the latter of which can make a nearly indestructible board). The Monsters exist, too, in their current number for the purpose of summoning an Xyz in a turn or two."

supported by ""MAGICIAN GIRLS""","- uses ""magician girls series of cards"" to stall for time or keep opponent unable to ATK
- Spell cards are used to summon Dark Magician or other stronger Spellcasters in the deck
- Traps keep opponents side clear of monsters

Focus of the deck is using magician girls to stall &amp; keep opponent unable to ATK due to cutting ATK in half permanently and summon
strong spellcasters with spells and monster effects.

The deck should never brick or give you a hand that does not synergize or lead to a good run.
= at worst you will have multiple magician girls on the field stalling until you have a perfect combo
- also, use ""link spider"" to keep field healthy and monsters if ready to summon strongerÂ Spellcasters, eg./ Dark Magician

The Rokkets' main purpose, in this deck, are to get in your opponent's way, <a data-name=""Anesthrokket Dragon"">Anesthrokket Dragon</a> is the card you'll want the most with it's DEF of 2200, boostable to 2500 with their Field Spell, <a data-name=""Revolve Boot Sector"">Revolve Boot Sector</a>, which has a sort of reverse-<a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> effect, if your opponent controls more monsters than you, you can summon Rokkets from your GY in Defense Position up to the surplus

You can also, during your turn, Special Summon up to 2 Rokket monsters from hand in Defense Position, if you already have monster's on the field, this more often than let's you go straight into <a data-name=""Borreload"">Borreload</a>, which sets up a whole load of different combos with the Rokkets, they all have different effects which let you take care of cards your opponent has that's annoying you, <a data-name=""Shelrokket Dragon"">Shelrokket Dragon</a>Â let's you also destroy monsters in adjacent zones

This deck can already do a hell of a lot, and until it becomes Meta-Relavant, it's just going to keep getting better and better with every new card that comes out for them."

Most of the fodder does come from the regular deck, but there is generally not enough fodder in any given hand for you to summon Trishula; the boss of this deck and the hardest card to summon. Whilst this deck does not perform the special summons of a true Nekroz deck and can not survive off of the extra deck in a link format, it does have its strengths: being able to turn weak, but sustainable, card advantage into plus summons and being able to protect monsters that are on the field for extended periods of time."

<ul>
 	<li>Objective: Summon Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant by means of 3 tributes
<ul>
 	<li>Let opponent trigger Metaltron eff. or keep the 3000/3000 beater (if you have dragonic --&gt; 3.3k/3.3k beater)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
This deck relies on the True Draco engine, though it can not pull of the card advantage that was once typical of True Draco. The engine is not used in this deck to establish card advantage, though it can be useful for this purpose, but to bring out Metaltron.

Metaltron can be brought out in 2 ways.
<ul>
 	<li>1.) Tribute Summon - requires 3 (3 spells, 0 monsters | 2 spells, 1 monster | 1 spell, 2 monsters | 0 spells, 3 monsters)
<ul>
 	<li>This is ideal as it allows you to trigger Metaltron's eff - which can be used to delve into the synchro portion of the extra deck as needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>2.) Dreiath III, the True Dracocavalry General: this card's eff is upon being sent to the graveyard (you can tribute this card for another True Draco or for metaltron itself - and bring out another metaltron, etc.) it allows you to summon any True Draco monster - which includes Metaltron (though this negates the eff of Metaltron and should only be used if you need a defensive card or a beater).</li>
</ul>
Aside from bringing out Metaltron, details above, the deck focuses on gradual spell advantage through the True Draco spell system - which can not be searched due to the limitation of Ignis and ban of Dinomight Knight. The spell system works in that traps are used to destroy opponent's monsters - and bring out True Draco monsters - and spells are used in one of two ways. True Draco Heritage allows you to draw and is the most basic card when it comes to spell advantage, it should always be set before a spell/trap tribute summon of a true draco spell/trap --&gt; gives you a +1 card advantage. The second spell is Disciples of the True Dracopheonix which can serve as fodder in the beginning of a duel but must be kept around for later in a duel so that the True Draco engine can be kept alive; as this card allows you to recycle cards such as Dreiath and Metaltron - which are key to bringing out Metaltron and the Sycnhros associated with his eff.

Other Important Cards:
<ul>
 	<li>Masterpeace: Same use as in previous True Draco decks, though this is not necessarily the boss ""monster"" of the deck anymore. Masterpeace serves as a card that can shut down and/or prevent chains - as well as give you ridiculous card advantage. I keep 2 but if you prefer Master Peace to Metaltron, use Â 3.</li>
 	<li>Ash Blossom...: Standard hand trap, multi-purpose and won't trigger graveyard effs (though you can replace Ash with Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit if you'd prefer sending to graveyard)</li>
 	<li>Dragonic Diagram: Allows you to search for true draco spells/traps/monsters --&gt; Key to speeding up the engine and securing Metaltron through 3 tributes. Not the most important card in the deck but it acts as the primary searcher, allowing you to trigger spell/trap effects and bring more into your hand.
<ul>
 	<li>Ideal combos: Dragonic Diagram (activation) --&gt; tribute of fodder card (useless card) or Dreiath --&gt; Summon Metaltron or Ignis from Dreiath eff --&gt; obtain something like True Draco Heritage or Dracopheonix from sacrifice (whatever is more appropriate for the situation) --&gt; Use to gain card advantage --&gt; beatdown + spell/trap destruction --&gt; repeat</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Extra Deck Synchros: Many are situational but some can be used in any battle as a boss monster that can guarantee victory. Personally I'd bring out Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon for it's effect but Barbaroid has one of the most brutal effects available to you and can help beef up a deck that is otherwise lacking in immediate offensive firepower.</li>
</ul>
Not really sure what else to say here, so I'll leave it at that. If you have any tips, I guess you can contact me on here?"

And although it's not fantastic due to how much resources it requires, I've also included a small <a data-name=""Doom Virus Dragon"">Doom Virus Dragon</a> engine.

The rest of the cards are the usual Dark Magician engine type cards. <a data-name=""Secret Sanctuary of the Spellcasters"">Secret Sanctuary of the Spellcasters</a> and <a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spellcasters"">Secret Village of the Spellcasters</a> being the ultimate stall combo (remember you need a Spellcaster on the field!)."

<h2>Summary</h2>
This deck depends on your metalfoes skill. If you can play metalfoes this deck will work greatly in your favor. I won't be covering the metalfoes basics since there is enough information on the internet out there. I might make a video in the future on how to make plays with this deck. It will be posted here.

You can learn to play metalfoes by practicing. A good beginner idea is to destroy all your metalfoe cards and end up with a pendulum scale 1 - 8 so you can summon your monsters back.
<h4>Why do we run 46 cards as opposed to 40 cards?</h4>
This deck has good drawing power. If you are going to utilize your side deck, you can still utilize your main cards without needing to sacrifice good cards you need.

Wind bitches = 6.

Assuming that you get your wind witch combo right ur left with 43 cards in your deck. If you remove wind witches you have 41 cards. Whats wrong with 41 cards :)

 	<li>weak if your card are getting banished</li>
 	<li>not the best backrow destroyer such as spells and traps<em> (you might place some <a data-name=""twin twisters"">twin twisters</a> in this deck if that is a problem)</em></li>
</ul>
<h1>Monsters</h1>
<h4><a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a></h4>
If this card is used right it is one of the best cards. You can shuffle your opponent cards to their hand but also your own cards. kaijus can be brought back to your hand. The best idea with mithrilium is sending one of your own metalfoes monster on the field to your hand so that you have the missing pendulum scale in for summoning pendulums. Shuffle nopes to your opponents hand. Shuffle cards you need back to your own hand.

Also if this card is destroyed you can recover 1 metalfoe normal monster from your graveyard or pendulum zone. Overal great defence.
<h4><a data-name=""Metalfoes orichalc"">Metalfoes orichalc</a></h4>
If you need to quickly destroy a card on the field, you can destroy with your pendulum zone this card to destroy one card on the field. Also this baby is your main piercing damage amplifier. Also with metalfoes combination you can fusion summon mithrilium with a pendulum monster for orichalc and they will all come back on the field.
<h4><a data-name=""Metalfoes alkahest"">Metalfoes alkahest</a></h4>
Steal his monster if needed.
<h4>Kaijus (tributing their monsters optional)</h4>
You have a choice between:
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a></li>
 	<li class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a></li>
 	<li class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Kumongous, the Sticky String Kaiju"">Kumongous, the Sticky String Kaiju</a></li>
</ul>
Those three are your main to go kaijus for this deck. The reason kaijus work with this deck is that you can bring them back to your hand withÂ <a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a>.Â Sphere also works but it requires 3 tributes although sphere can be a game changing moment, lava golem will almost certainly guarantee that you remove 2 monsters on the field. Use whatever of those 3 monsters you like. Two kaijus in your deck is more than enough. The usefull thing aboutÂ <a data-name=""Kumongous, the Sticky String Kaiju"">Kumongous, the Sticky String Kaiju</a> is that you can pendulum summon it, and tributing your opponents monster requires no normal summon.
<h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a></h4>
you get to summon 2 metalfoes. This card is a must have in this deck.
<h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Astrograph Sorcerer"">Astrograph Sorcerer</a></h4>
Some people prefer usingÂ Â <a data-name=""Majespecter Raccoon - Bunbuku"">Majespecter Raccoon - Bunbuku
</a>But astrograph gives you more utility. If a card is destroyed you can summon it and you can bring one metalfoe monster from your deck to your hand.
It also helps you with summoning numberÂ <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye
</a>

This card also has a pendulum scale 1 so it balances it out with <a data-name=""Raremetalfoes Bismugear"">Raremetalfoes Bismugear</a>
<h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Archfiend Eccentrick"">Archfiend Eccentrick</a></h4>
This card is great because it can destroy a spell card or a monster card.
Some people prefer having 3 of them in your deck. However, having 3 of those cards in your extra deck is meaningless since you will be summoning metalfoes most of the times.
2 of them is more than enough. Also you can use archfiend eccentrick onÂ <a data-name=""Metalfoes Combination"">Metalfoes CombinationÂ Â </a><a data-name=""Metalfoes Combination"">to get another metalfoe in your hand.</a>
<h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer"">Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer
</a></h4>
<p class=""engine-dark-box"">This card is next level with metalfoes. with 1 metalfoe monster and luster pendulum you can get another metalfoe to your hand.</p>

<h4><strong>Wind bitches</strong></h4>
Free <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a><a data-name=""clear wing crystal dragon"">? </a>And with pendulum summon you can get a <a data-name=""clear wing fast dragon"">clear wing fast dragon</a> as bonus? Get your hands on it.

If you, however don't like them, you can remove them from the deck.

If your opponent gives you a hard time doing the wind witch combo, then u can always replace them with your side deck cards. The wind witches are inside to give you more options. The only downside is that you can only summon wind monsters the turn you activate it. Play wisely.

On a side note: withÂ <a data-name=""Windwitch - Glass Bell"">Windwitch - Glass Bell</a> and a metalfoe monster you can summon clear wing fast dragon. If you also have <a data-name=""Windwitch - Snow Bell"">Windwitch - Snow Bell</a> then u can get <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro DragonÂ </a>regardless.
<h1>Spells</h1>
<h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Swords of Concealing Light"">Swords of Concealing Light (optional as opposed to quacking mirror force)
</a></h4>
<p class=""engine-dark-box"">The reasonÂ for this card as opposed to a mirror force is that you can get this card back in your hand withÂ <a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a><a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">
</a></p>
Also they are on defence position on your turn so with metalfoes orichalc you can get dem piercing damage on their faces :)
<h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a></h4>
since metalfoes are basically destroying their own monsters with card effects, supply squad works for having great draw power. 2 is enough because you don't want 3 of those in your hands or on the field.
<h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Painful Decision"">Painful Decision</a></h4>
This is your card for getting a metalfoe from your deck. Since you can only use 1 per turn I won't recommend 2 of those in your deck.
