The Venice Film Festival attracts Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya and an epic space adventure. Now it is clear that the hotly anticipated ""Dune"" will have its world premiere at this autumn's festival. On September 3, it's time, Variety announces.

<a>https://outof.cards/hearthstone/decks/27324-can-take-our-self</a>

Director Denis Villeneuve has put together a fittingly epic cast that includes Oscar Isaac, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, Charlotte Rampling and the Swedes Stellan Skarsgård and Rebecca Ferguson. ""<a>LUCA ITA</a>"" is of course based on Frank Herbert's iconic sci-fi novel and has long been something of a dream project for Villeneuve. The ambitious plan is to follow up the film with both a ""Dune 2"" and a TV series.

Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow can search any level 1 winged-beast monsters so if you need you can also have access to D.D. Crow; Where Are Thou? can help you search for effect veiller if you have all of your combo pieces in your hand.

Swallow's Nest can fix your normal summon summoning from your deck the correct starter for your plays.

Bird Strike is a weaker dark ruler no more but it is easily searchable from your deck ; feather storm is not seachable in the deck cut its an extra utility resource, you can replace it with 2 more bird strike and 1 extra Sanctuary.

The Side deck contains cards that i'm experimenting with, it could be anything for the current meta."

Here we fight crime *dramatic pause, face smuggens* with crime.","<span>What is justice, really?</span>

<span>Some might think of revenge, others might dream of Master peace. Me? When I think of justice I think of deserving a keyboard that doesn't make every other word look like ttthiss (writing this is gonna be a pain, isn't it). You're a Yu-Gi-Oh player so I'm assuming you visualize justice in the form of a huge banlist, seeing Miragestallio unbanned, declaring an international law to burn all copies of Mystic Mine, changing the time rules and lowering the cost of cards like they do it in the OCG. But above all the typical TCG player wishes for both control and combo to die out, wanting to return to a stale, flavorless gameplay of t-setting and passing like they did in the golden days back in 2004, after which the game went downhill fast, getting worse and worse with every new card type being released, new Master Rules being implemented and meta decks created. If it can out Blue-Eyes, it's broken.</span>

<span>So how do we do this? If we are a team of justice seeking Blue-Eyes enthusiasts, how do we return to this perfect game of Yu-Gi-Oh that Tut Ankh Amon and Ozymandias played back in their childhood days? Well, if you want to clean, expect to get your hands dirty.</span>
<span>If they want to combo off, you scream ""<strong>NO</strong>"" and slap down your Dimension Shifter. If they set 5 you yell ""<strong>I DON'T THINK SO</strong>"" and activate Harpie's Feather Duster (Game 2 onwards). If they ash your Chiyomaru going first you set 3 of your own and wickedly screech ""<strong>TRY ME</strong>"".</span>

<span>In short, you play all that you swore to destroy but if it takes a monster to defeat a monster, then so be it (ironically we're not playing any Kaijus).</span>

<span>So let's get to the deck.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>""First, why is S-Force all that you wish to end?""</span>

<span>Well, with the new support card S-Force Chase this archetype now has access to a very powerful removal trap that doesn't take much too sseaearch (see what I mean) to search. One Chiyomaru is all it takes to search this card off of Gravitino without using up many resources and it's not dependent on the S-Force card you banished for Chiyomaru's effect.</span>
<span>S-Force also plays surprisingly well under There Can Be Only One. It doesn't care if their cards are banished either, making way for Dimension Shifter and Macro Cosmos. Add some Solemns into the mix and you got yourself a spicy, floodgate-oriented control deck. And all that is without taking Gravitino into consideration.</span>

<span>But not only do they excel at control they also combo off, summoning three bodies a turn, every turn. With the new addition of S-Force Edge Razor they now have access to another extender. That doesn't change the amount of monsters they can summon but it does give the deck more ways to summon them besides the classic two card Chiyomaru + Gravitino combo. Summoning two to three monsters every turn means that they can make good use of I:P Masquerena (yes, it's the ""enemies teaming up to fight against a greater evil"" cliché) and potentially OTK with Borrelsword or clean up with Accesscode or Underworld Goddess.</span>

<span>So regardless of what you wish to eradicate, combo or control, you <em>will</em> become that which you swore to destroy.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Enough exposition, let's get into the cards:</span>

<span>S-Force monsters all have an effect which affects your opponents monsters in the same column, requiring strategic placement of your cards.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Rappa Chiyomaru"">S-Force Rappa Chiyomaru</a></span><span>: Your playmaker. Summons any S-Force monster other than herself straight from deck and returns to the hand as a Quick Effect. She banishes an S-Force card for cost but that's not a big deal. Her column effect forces monsters in the same column as an S-Force card to target the monster in their column for attacks. If you use her effect during your opponents turn make sure to use it at the right time so that you can make full use of your column effects.</span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Pla-Tina"">S-Force Pla-Tina</a><span>: The reason why Chiyomaru's banish is not a problem. When she is summoned, for example from the deck (I'll let you figure out how to do that one on your own..), she summons any S-Force monster other than herself that is banished. Pretty neat, huh? But what would be the ideal target? Her column effect makes your opponents monsters lose 600 ATK.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Gravitino"">S-Force Gravitino</a><span>: The other part of your typical combo. If summoned he adds any S-Force card from your deck to your hand other than himself. If he's banished with Chiyomaru and then summoned with Pla-Tina that gives you two monsters on the field and any S-Force card in hand, which could be an S-Force Showdown to summon your Chiyomaru from hand again. That allows for an I:P + Chiyomaru setup with Chiyomaru's effect to summon another S-Force monsters potentially live for your opponents turn. His column effect is the most important one. Or the least important one if you have Shifter live or Macro Cosmos activate. Monsters in the same column are banished when they leave the field (that includes returning to hand or deck).</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Edge Razor"">S-Force Edge Razor</a><span>: When summoned summons an S-Force other than themselve from your hand. Makes your deck less reliant of drawing exactly Chiyomaru and Gravitino to summon multiple monsters a turn. He prevents monsters in the same column to be used as material for Link-3 or higher.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Dog Tag"">S-Force Dog Tag</a><span>: Neat card to search off of Gravitino if you already have your other pieces. Summons itself from hand when your opponent summons a monster in the same column. Prevents monsters in the same column from <em>activating</em> their effects. Sounds busted but it's only during your Main Phase and he's not even Level 4 or lower.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Bridgehead"">S-Force Bridgehead</a><span>: The deck's field spell. Searches any S-Force monster. Also once per turn protects an S-Force monster from being destroyed by a battle. Can come in handy and I can't tell you how many times I forgot to activate this effect.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Showdown"">S-Force Showdown</a><span>: Adds an S-Force monster from your GY back to your hand or, more importantly, summons an S-Force monster from hand in defense position.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Chase"">S-Force Chase</a><span>: Bounces your opponents face-up cards up the number of S-Force monsters with different names you control. Can be banished from GY as a substitute cost for your S-Force cards.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><span><a data-name=""S-Force Justify"">S-Force Justify</a></span><span>: Link-3 with a quick effect monster effect negate and non-destructive, non-targetting removal. But he needs three monsters exact which is a pain.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><a data-name=""S-Force Orrafist"">S-Force Orrafist</a><span>,</span> <a data-name=""S-Force Professor DiGamma"">S-Force Professor DiGamma</a> <span>and <span><a data-name=""S-Force Specimen"">S-Force Specimen</a><span> are all cards I chose not to include as they are either too weak or too slow. Although Specimen gives more means to control the columns and DiGamma is good against Boarbow in a more combo oriented deck.</span></span></span></span>

<span>Now onto some non-S-Force cards.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a><span>: A very strong handtrap that not many decks can play. As an added bonus, if you link Gravitino and Pla-Tina away for I:P in the aforementioned combo, they will both be banished and now Pla-Tina can summon back that Gravitino during your opponents turn.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a><span>: It's Ash Blossom.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a><span>: This concludes our handtrap bundle. Very strong right now and a handtrap I like to include in control oriented decks as another card to set and ideally make use of its s/t negate. Mind you that you could replace these handtraps with any cards or more simply more trap cards.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a><span>: Why play your field spell at three if you can play it at four.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a><span>: Why play your level 4 or lower Warrior at three if you can play it at four.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Reinforce Truth"">Reinforce Truth</a><span>: Why play your level 2 or lower Warrior at four if you can play it at seven. As this is more of a control oriented version this card could also be swapped for any other trap.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos</a><span>: Why play Dimension Shifter at three when you ca - okay I'll stop.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> (TCBOO)<span>: Because you love winning more than integrity.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a><span>: It wouldn't be a control deck without your dear Solemns, right?</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a><span>: See Solemn Strike.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span>Now let's take a look at the remaining Extra Deck:</span>

<span>This deck does not use it's Extra Deck much, leaving you with a lot of open slots. Besides a few that I strongly recommend you can do with it however you like. Ghost Reaper sends her regards.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span><span><span><a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a></span>: I'm playing the Nova + Mechaba punish against Dogmatika Maximus.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a><span>: Mechaba's better half.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</a><span>: You can summon quite a few monsters and this is a great removal tool against hard to out cards.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a><span>: Great way to OTK. Strongly recommend!</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a><span>: You got the slots, you got the I:P so why not.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a><span>: If you want to clean up the board. Since you don't spam link monsters like other decks you might just have 1-2, sometimes 3 attributes to work with.</span></span></li>

</ul>
<span>The cards in the Side Deck are up to your but I'd suggest 6-7 backrow removal tools. If your opponent is on control you can swap out a bunch of handtraps for them.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Time to wrap this up:</span>

<span>The first (and hopefully not last) wave of support this deck received is fantastic. Chase and Edge Razor each improve aspects of the deck, increasing both it's power ceiling as well as it's consistency. It's a fun and explosive control oriented deck that has easy access to some of the most powerful floodgates in the game with very strong cards of their own. Their unique playstyle rewards strategy and experience and can catch people off guard if they are unfamiliar with the mechanic and individual effects.</span>

<span>Before, the deck couldn't really perform too well against meta decks and you had to hope that Gravitino's continued effect to banish cards in the same column was enough to stop the archetype you were facing. That made it feel as if your match-up was more of a deciding factor than your skill, which was frustrating at times. But now with the new support I believe the deck can definitely stand it's ground among rogue tier decks. However it's performance against meta relevant decks - although much better than before - has yet to be determined as hopefully more people pick up and pilot the deck.</span>"

Like so many other things, the tournaments are currently only taking place virtually and are then referred to as remote duels. On the 15th and 16th

May the Remote Duel Extravaganza took place, which is definitely worth a look. The victory there went to an old friend, namely Virtualwelt. But since I have already introduced this cover topic, we will dedicate ourselves today to the runner-up and that is Tri-Brigade.

<strong>The cover theme</strong>

Usually I always use the German designation of the topics in my articles, simply because many of you also prefer German maps. But here I made a conscious decision against it: Regardless of whether we look to Italy, Portugal or Spain, the English name Tri-Brigade has been adopted everywhere.

Yes, even the French, who otherwise even turn Darth Vader into Dark Vador, remain true to the template and simply call the archetype Tri-Brigade. Not so the Germans, who for some reason believe that Sta-Brigade would be a much more appropriate name. The “tri” clearly refers to the three different types that we find united here: It is about monsters, monster-warriors and winged monsters.

The topic itself is still quite new and only came to us in Phantom Rage at the end of last year. The game mechanics are mainly based on link summons and the banishment of monsters. Ismail B.'s deck, which I would like to introduce to you today, combines tri-brigade with lyric song bird, accordingly there are also lyric song bird Xyz monsters in the extra deck, which then brings Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Himmelsdonner into conversation.

<strong>The tournament</strong>

Before I get to the actual deck, I'd like to take a quick look at the tournament itself. A total of 207 players took part in the Remote Duel Extravaganza # 6, and of course the game was played according to the current banlist.

As already mentioned, the first place went to Virtualwelt, but after that there are a number of tri-brigade decks.

Not only did Ismail B. take second place with this topic, places 3 and 4 also went to Tri-Brigade, but then in combination with Zoodiak and again Lyrikliedervogel.

In places 5 to 8 are the usual suspects in the form of pranksters, dragon links, dinosaurs and dogmatics. Shaddoll Invoked and Eldlich made it into the top 16, which is quite respectable with a total of 207 participants.

<strong>The deck</strong>

Let's finally get to the deck of the runner-up. The combination with Lyrikliedervogel has proven itself here and was represented twice in the top 4.

Sta-Brigade Fraktall and Sta-Brigade Kerass are sometimes the most central cards in the deck and should definitely appear three times.

You can put Fractal from the field or (much better!) From your hand into the graveyard to also move a monster, monster-warrior or winged monster of level 3 or lower from the deck to the graveyard.

<a>https://aps1.instructure.com/eportfolios/897/Home/_32021</a>

You can also use this directly, because with its help you can summon a link monster from the extra deck and only have to banish monsters from the cemetery according to the number of links. You can special summon Kerass yourself, but otherwise it has the same summoning effect as Fraktall.

Sta-Brigade Kitt and Sta-Brigade Nevall can also summon Link Monsters from the Extra Deck in the same way, but they also generate an advantage if they are discarded, which Kerass easily takes care of.

All of these effects are limited to the three different types of monsters and from now on you can only summon these three types, but that does not play a particularly important role in this deck, since you almost exclusively play forms of the monster type anyway.

Although: Similar to Eightness from Ancient Guardians, you are also dependent on a very specific type of monster here. So if there was a card that turned all monsters on the field or in the graveyard into zombies, for example ..."

The same prob","For those of you who are still playing Yu-Gi-Oh! until now, maybe you guys feel that Konami. not very good at balancing their own games. The same problem can be seen in DotR.

When you understand how to play DotR optimally, this game becomes very easy -- too easy, in fact. There are very few parts of DotR that are challenging, and that challenge comes from having overpowered cards that players can't use.

Grinding in DotR is also a big drawback. In DotR, the enemy's Deck Leader generally has certain skills. To get the same skill, players must increase the rank of Deck Leader. The rank of the Deck Leader can be raised by using the same monster as the Deck Leader as often as possible. However, this grinding process was very, very slow, taking hours just to acquire one skill.

Of course, in the gaming era like now, any game can be repaired with mods, especially old games that can be played via emulators. However, unlike Forbidden Memories, Duelists of the Roses does not have a modder community that actively issues dozens of mod variations. Fortunately, a DotR lover on behalf of Clovis is willing to start a DotR mod project with the title DotR Redux.

As the title says, DotR Redux is a great mod that completely changes Duelists of the Roses. Recognizing the many problems with DotR, Clovis created the DotR Redux project with the aim of making the DotR experience better, and retaining all the positives that already exist in the game.

This is done with three major changes. The first is a change in grinding to get the Deck Leader skill. All additional EXP in DotR Redux is multiplied by five from the original DotR. In addition, in Custom Duel mode, a map is added that is intentionally designed for grinding Deck Leaders. With these additional features, the grinding process that initially took hours can be completed in just 30 minutes."

Many of the combos and tech featured in this video remain relevant.

3 cards released since this video introduce major new lines, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Mermail%20Abyssalacia"">Mermail Abyssalacia</a>, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Ravenous%20Crocodragon%20Archethys"">Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys</a>, and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Adamancipator%20Risen%20-%20Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a>
These cards are all notable because they introduce solid first turn plays, Abyssalacia and Crocodragon can both discard <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Atlantean%20Heavy%20Infantry"">Atlantean Heavy Infantry</a> as the cost for a quick effect, giving an effective single or double pop respectively. Dragite is just a Spell Negate, which can be incredibly threatening against many decks.

Abyssalacia can be made with any 2 monsters in the Merlantean typings (Fish, Aqua, Sea Serpent), but is best setup by <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Deep%20Sea%20Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> summoning <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Neptabyss%2C%20the%20Atlantean%20Prince"">Neptabyss</a>, whose effect gives you Atlanteans to discard for Abyssalacia's cost.

Crocodragon is more difficult to make, as a Level 9 Synchro, the only really consistent setup in the deck is having Mermail Abysspike discard <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Atlantean%20Dragoons"">Dragoons</a> as cost, searching <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Lappis%20Dragon"">Lappis Dragon</a> as well as a Level 3 WATER monster. This setup can also make Abyssalacia if needed, which is sometimes relevant for her float effect.

Finally, Dragite is made turn 1 off of <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Genex%20Undine"">Genex Undine</a>. Once again you dump Dragoons to add Lappis Dragon, but having one less level you can make a Synchro 8. The deck is on no Rocks for the first effect, though you can still activate it if you want to get the top 5 cards to the bottom of your deck, for some reason? Once again, this setup can make Abyssalacia if needed.

A final thing of note is that much of this deck is ""dumb"" techs. The Gorz-likes have been mostly fine in my play, though running Ra and not just Guardian Slime is somewhat suspect. In all my play of this deck I have not resolves Cataclysmic Circumpolar Chillbania once, and am leaning to it being a bad card. Additionally, LANphorynchus is entirely unneeded in this build, it carried over from builds on more complex Undine combos that did need it, but I would not run it in hindsight."

This card game is old, but it is still popular today. This is due to the continuous emergence of new cards. Interestingly, in this patch there is an OTK deck that is very effective to play. The OTK or One Turn Kill deck uses the Fortune Lady archetype. How about the deck, let's see the explanation below.

<strong>Fortune Lady Light</strong>
The first card is Fortune Lady Light, a one-star Light monster who can Special Summon other Fortune Lady monsters from the deck when she leaves the Field. This card is usually combined with Fortune Lady Past and Fortune Lady Water for additional Draw.

<strong>Fortune Lady Wind</strong>
The next card to be added to the deck is Fortune Lady Wind, a one-star wind elemental monster in the online game Yugioh Duel Link. With this card, we can destroy the enemy's Trap or Spell cards a number of Fortune Lady monsters in our Field. By using Fortune Lady Wind, we have a fairly strong Back Row removal.

<strong>Forbidden Lance</strong>
Because this deck is a combo, of course we don't want our combo to be disturbed by opposing players. Therefore we need Spell protection that is able to protect the combo. In the Fortune Lady deck, the Forbidden Lance has excellent synergy.

<strong>Fortune Lady Calling</strong>
By activating Fortune Lady Calling, we can summon other Fortune Lady monsters from our deck. However, keep in mind that we must have the Fortune Lady monster in the field first. With this card, we can perform OTK combos in the online game Yugioh Duel Link more easily.

<strong>Fortune Lady Vision</strong>
Sometimes we brick during Draw, which causes the combo not to work. However, by including Fortune Lady Vision into the deck, the chances of us bricking will be smaller.

This deck doesnt need the normal summon, so I use thunder king rai-oh and denko sekka as normal, since theyre great floodgates that have no drawbacks for this deck. I also use cyber dragon because you can use him to summon its fusions without poly and get rid of a monsters from my opponent field. Also I run eater of millions and pankratops, cause they are very easy to summon and are very good for outing my opponents monsters. I run super poly as well, since there are plent of targets in my extra deck that can easely be made with it, so I can get rid of my opponent monsters while having monsters on my side of the field."

The standard dino combos are the ones who will bring you to the desired endboard if u already played dinos it isnt alot different

You can replace all dino names with Fossil Dig

Misc+Baby

Misc+Petit

Ovi+Baby

Archosaur+Baby

Archosaur+Petit

One for One+Baby+(Monster for the discard)

One for One+Petit+(Monster  for the discard)

All these will grant you a full board.

Your endboard should look something like this:

Dolkka+Dweller+Laggia+UCT

of course you can change it to whatever the matchup is, but for going blind first this is pretty good.

now i will show you a basic combo with Baby+Misc which you can watch here: <a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=578705-29238003</a>

the combo goes as follows: Activate Misc effect to discard, activate second effect of Misc to banish and Special Summon Archosaur from the deck, Archosaur effect will trigger to destroy the Baby in hand so we can search a Double Evo Pill, Baby mandatory effect will trigger to special Oviraptor, Oviraptor effect will trigger to search another Baby,Normal Summon the Baby then Activate the second effect of Oviraptor to destroy the Baby and Special Summon the other Baby from the graveyard, then again Baby mandatory effect will trigger to Special Summon Scrap Raptor, activate Scrap Raptor effect to destroy the Baby on the field so we can make a second normal summon with a Scrap Monster, then once again Baby mandatory effect will trigger to Special Summon Giant Rex, Then link off the Archosaur into a Linkuriboh and then Link off the Linkuriboh and the Scrap Raptor into a Scrap Wyvern, Then activate Scrap Wyverns effect to special summon scrap raptor from the graveyard and destroy the same scrap raptor you just Special Summoned Both effects of Scrap Wyvern and Scrap Raptor will trigger, chain link 1 will be Scrap Wyvern chain link 2 will be Scrap Raptor,so you will add Scrap Chimera to the hand <span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">through Scrap Raptors effect and then you will Special Summon a Scrap Raptor from the deck </span><span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">through Scrap Wyvern`s effect, Then destroy the Scrap Wyvern (read Scrap Wyvern if you dont understand what i mean), Then overlay Oviraptor and Scrap Raptor into Dolkka, then Normal Summon Scrap Chimera then its effect will trigger to special summon Scrap Raptor from the graveyard then overlay giant rex and scrap chimera into Abyss Dweller and activate his effect and detach Giant Rex <strong>IT IS VERRY IMPORTANT YOU DETACH GIANT REX SO YOU CAN SPECIAL SUMMON HIM THROUGH HIS EFFECT!!!</strong> then activate Double Evo Pill and banish Giant Rex and Linkuriboh to Special Summon Ultimate Conductor Tyranno then Giant Rex effect will trigger to Special Summon himself then overlay Giant Rex and Scrap Raptor into Laggia and there you have it :)
</span>

This is just one combo you can do but theres many others i would list them here if there werent so much of them and i if i wouldnt be so lazy :P.

I encourage you to play the combo i showed you to see how everything works im pretty sure when you understand what you have to do you will find the other combos verry quickly.

Now just something about some of the Card choices:

Pot of Prosperity will help you find your missing combo pieces or if you already have everything you can search for a gamma it is usually a good idea to dig for 3 but if you really need something just dig for 6 u can also use it to bait a Ash Blossom from your opponent.

One for One is pretty self explanatory it summons a Archosaur straight from the deck so you can combo off

Instant Fusion is there to Summon Milenium-Eyes Restrict it will give you handtrap protection so its verry good if you dont have a gamma in your opening hand

and thats pretty much it i hope that my explanation of the combos arent too complicated if so just leave a comment :) all in all i hope you have fun with the deck and if you have any suggestions please leave them in the comments bellow :)

It is an understatement to say that it bears some cards that will change the landscape of ,"Lightning Overdrive officially releases June 4th this year. It is an understatement to say that it bears some cards that will change the landscape of the current meta-game. It isn’t Rise of the Duelist level, which gave us Infernobles, Dogmatika, Schism, and ridiculously great staples. However, it brings the power and consistency levels of two specific decks to a peak that will surely shake the foundations of competitive Yu-Gi-Oh! as we know it. Let’s take a look at what it’s going to bring, and what handtraps are going to be run to adjust to it.

Diviner of the Heralds is one of the big cards coming out in Lightning Overdrive (LIOV). This, along with Mu-Beta Fafnir, will 100% bring Drytrons back to contention. Diviner dumps a fairy monster from either the extra or main deck to the grave to increase its level. This will practically add 3 more copies of Benten. You can send Herald of the Arc Light to go ahead and search it. That, in turn makes it a level 6 which could set-up Beatrice plays. Dump Eva to search your handtrap – Herald of Orange Light. Several routes will open up, one of which can end-up setting an Imperial Order via Beatrice and Knightmare Gryphon. If that wasn’t good enough, it could also send Natasha or Lancea to then make itself level 7. It’s a tuner, so any level 1 will then get you to Chaos Ruler.

Drytron’s ceiling has always been absurdly high, with Herald of Ultimateness being a non-OPT omni-negate that can also negate summons. The only problem after the Union Carrier and Benten hit, was consistency and resiliency with all the handtraps running around. With Diviner making Benten accessible again, and Mu-Beta taking care of getting an extra Drytron name in grave (plus saving resources from the Ritual Spell) – Drytron will definitely have enough gas to compete, and potentially beat, most match-ups in this developing format.

<a>https://theconjuring3-onlinefree.tumblr.com/</a>

Bearbrumm hasn’t even officially dropped yet and ZooBrigade is already topping several events. This will give close to 100% access to Tri-brigade Revolt. This, as explained in my previous article, is an unthinkably amazing card. ZooBrigade has already been a top deck in the OCG for a while now. That can be attributed a little bit due to Maxx “C” being legal there, and Tri-brigade cheating out link summons. What that means is, even through Maxx C – the deck can still pump out a full board. Revolt will be live while only giving the opponent 2 draws. With Tri-Brigade already finding success without Bearbrumm, it will only skyrocket their performance once LIOV is legal. Especially since they can dodge handtraps by chainblocking Bearbrumm.

<a>https://groups.google.com/g/the-conjuring-3-2021-korea/c/l_wb4kwYIpw</a>

Cycle Reader is one of the handtraps that popped up when Drytron was at its peak. We can definitely expect to see this card more often again after LIOV. That being said, its versatility might become a little less valuable, since Eldlich has fallen down the meta hierarchy.

Skull Meister is another handtrap that gained popularity during the Drytron-VW era. With Drytrons on the rise again (and with Scrap Raptor, Dinos are going to surge in representation too) this will increase in viability. Being able to hit several things across the board will be beneficial for most decks. Any Drytron name in the grave (or Benten), Bearbrumm / Nervall if they don’t chain block, Misc / Raptor, Prank-kids, etc.

Infinite Impermanence has not seen play in quite a while now, and for good reason. Virtual World monsters activate from hand, Drytrons in both hand AND grave, Prank-kids in grave, and it just is very mediocre against heavy-combo decks like Dragonlink. With Mu-Beta being a big part in the Drytron strategy (dump a name, replace ritual materials), this card might get a competitive resurgence. In addition to that, using Impermanence on a Tri-brigade monster that banished for cost could be huge. Their only extender will likely be a Kerass. And even then, they might not have enough resources to finish their combo.

A huge chunk of people have already been maining Droll &amp; Lock Bird – and rightfully so. It’s really the only handtrap that can assure you that Dragonlink is going to end on a very subpar board. With Drytron coming back into the fray, this ol’ trusty tool will become even more of a staple. Oh, and don’t forget that Tri-brigade (and other Zoo variants) usually go for Tenki, too!

Nibiru has been a menace since the moment it came out. It gradually saw less and less play, especially as we headed to a more control-based format. We had Dragonlink as the deadliest combo deck (and even then they could play around Nib with Seal). Drytron loses to Nib a little bit harder now than it did before (early Benten searches allowed for tricky timings). Tri-Brigade also has a Ratpier combo that gets them Drident-Apollousa-Revolt that plays into Nib extremely hard. This, in conjunction with the still-present popularity of Prank-kids, could potentially make Nibiru great once again."

<a data-name=""Desperado Barrel Dragon"">Desperado Barrel Dragon</a> can be summoned with <a data-name=""heavy metal raiders"">heavy metal raiders</a>, with it's own effect, and with <a data-name=""Escape from the Dark Dimension"">Escape from the Dark Dimension</a> if it gets banished first by <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>. The Shoot-Effect can destroy 0-3 monsters and works best in the opponent battle phase, if you special summon it you can still try to shoot. When it gets destroyed or discarded you get <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> from the deck to the hand.

<a data-name=""Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher"">Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher</a> – strong 'dark machine'-monster that can be special summoned to get fast link-4 or link-5 monsters. The second way of using it is to summon <a data-name=""Desperado Barrel Dragon"">Desperado Barrel Dragon</a> when it gets destroyed. You can summon it in either turn from the graveyard, then you have to banish 8 cards, but it also has a good impact. If you summoned it and it is on the field you can use the destroy-effect in your next turn, if you want to use the destroy effect it's best to summon it in the opponent's endphase, because you cannot activate both of it's effect in one turn. It's also good as a 'free-discard' for <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon</a><a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">, </a><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> or <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> since you use the special summon effect anyway, and it works from the hand and from the graveyard.

<a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a> - you can special summon it by special summoning a generic dark dragon, so you only need a rokket-monster, if you only have one you can link-summon <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> (link-1) to special summon it, then you can draw a card when you link summon it. You can build <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a> with it since it is also a dark dragon, if it is in the graveyard it can maybe protect a face-down card, then it gets banished and you can maybe bring it back with <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a>.

<a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a> – <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a> can also be summoned with <a data-name=""Escape from the dark dimension"">Escape from the dark dimension</a> even when it is a trap, because the trap does not get destroyed by <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a>'s effect and the negation happens after the summon. It can maybe get special summoned with Heavy Metal Raiders from the Hand if a dark machine destroys a monster by battle or card effect. Most decks only use monster-effects as negates, but traps are still very important as a backup so it's often good to summon <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a> if you have a normal summon left. You can also discard it with <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon, </a><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> or <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and special summon it later from the graveyard.

<a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> – you have a chance to shoot a card with it with. It has a low chance but since you can target all cards it's still good, it's good to have at least one in the deck, because <a data-name=""Desperado Barrel Dragon"">Desperado Barrel Dragon</a> can get a toss-coin-monster to the hand.

<a data-name=""Unknown Synchron"">Unknown Synchron</a> – a tuner, a special summon and a dark machine for <a data-name=""heavy metal raiders"">heavy metal raiders.</a>

<a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon"">Absorouter Dragon</a> – a special summon that works with rokket monsters, you get another rokket monster to the hand with its effect. The efffect triggers when it gets destroyed but also when you use it as link material or for a fusion summon.

<a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> – it can special summon other rokket monsters that you can use for link summons then. When you play a spell-card like <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> or <a data-name=""Quick Launch"">Quick Launch</a> you can chain the quick effect to it, then the spell-card still triggers and you don't have to destroy any cards. When you already have a link 2, or link 1 monster in the Graveyard, the best choice is normally to get <a data-name=""Rokket Recharger"">Rokket Recharger</a> to synchro summon <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>.

<a data-name=""Rokket Recharger"">Rokket Recharger</a> – it's good as a level 4–rokket card to synchro summon <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>. If a dark link/fusion/synchro-monster gets destroyed, and you have it on the hand or on the field, then you can discard it to special summon itself or another monster from the graveyard, but not the monster that got destroyed. It can also not get targeted when you have a dark link/fusion/synchro-monster.

<a data-name=""Anesthrokket Dragon"">Anesthrokket Dragon</a> – when it gets destroyed you can special summon a Rokket-monster from the deck, but you have to wait for the end-phase (yours or the one of your opponent). It also has a trigger effect when it gets targeted by a link monster, then you can destroy it to negate an opponents monsters effect, and to make it unable to attack. It can can not get triggered by <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> because it is already a dark monster, so It can only effectively be used with <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> as a quick effect, it does also not get triggered by <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>'s effect from the Graveyard.

&nbsp;

Spells

<a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>, <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a>, <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a>, <a data-name=""Squib Draw"">Squib Draw</a> - draw-cards, with <a data-name=""allure of darkness"">allure of darkness</a> you can summon monsters with <a data-name=""Escape from the Dark Dimension"">Escape from the Dark Dimension</a> later.

<a data-name=""Heavy Metal Raiders"">Heavy Metal Raiders</a> – dark machines can not get destroyed by battle one time, so you can also attack monsters with higher atk to get the same atk as them, but you have to pay the difference in life points. When a dark machine gets destroyed you can special suimmon a dark machine from the hand. If you have no dark machine you can link-summon <a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>.

<a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a> - You get this field spell early by link-summoning <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> (link-1) with one Rokket-monster, so you can change it later to <a data-name=""Heavy Metal Raiders"">Heavy Metal Raiders</a> or destroy it with <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> for one more monster on the field. When you have 2 Rokket-monsters in the hand, you can use one to summon <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a>, get <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a>, destroy <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> to get the rokket monster to the hand and then special summon both Rokket-monsters with the effect of <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a>. then you have 2 rokket-monsters, this means you have to get one more monster with <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a>'s effect or other special summons to summon <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>. If you only have 2 Rokket monsters, you can build <a data-name=""Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres"">Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres</a>, but it can only be summoned when you didn't use <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a>'s effect, because it's a light monster. As an alternative you can also build <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> and use one of the opponent's monsters to summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>. <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a>'s second effect can special summon rokket monsters from the graveyard if the opponent has more monsters and didn't clear this field spell.

<a data-name=""Quick Launch"">Quick Launch</a>, Scapegoat, Instant Fusion, Monster Reborn – Special summon cards, with <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> you can 'eat' one monster with <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> and you can build a link-monster with it. with <a data-name=""Quick Launch"">Quick Launch</a> you can build <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a>. If you have <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> on the field you can choose <a data-name=""Quick Launch"">Quick Launch</a> as destroy-target to have 3 rokket-monsters then. With 3 rokket monsters you can build a link-4-monster and you can decide between <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> ist the best card because it can negate, but <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> can 'eat' monsters by 'atk'-ing them, with one more monster you could also build <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a> and then build the other 'boss-monsters' later since you get one rokket-monster everytime you use it's effect.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Traps

<a data-name=""Escape From the Dark Dimension"">Escape From the Dark Dimension</a>, <a data-name=""Call Of The Haunted"">Call Of The Haunted</a>– These cards give you more monsters on the field, <a data-name=""Escape from the Dark dimension"">Escape from the Dark dimension</a> works with <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>. If you used <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a> to get a link-4 monster or <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> out of 4 Rokket-monsters, it also will get banished when it leaves the field. This way you can summon a link-2 monster with <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a> very fast without <a data-name=""Allure Of Darkness"">Allure Of Darkness</a>. Another possible targets for <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a> are maybe <a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a> if it's GY-effect is used that protects a face-down card, and <a data-name=""Borreload Furious Dragon"">Borreload Furious Dragon</a> if you use its special summon effect.

<a data-name=""Dark Illusion"">Dark Illusion</a>, <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a>, – good negate cards, Dark Illusion works for Spells/Traps and monster effects, and <a data-name=""fiendish chain"">fiendish chain</a> also stops the monster from attacking. <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a> can also be used as a target for <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a>, but if it gets destroyed the opponent monsters effect is also not negated anymore, it's still worth it as a target. It can also trigger <a data-name=""Chain Whirlwind"">Chain Whirlwind</a> when you destroy that monster in battle, because then it gets destroyed by a card effect. It is also a bit more a hard negate than <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> is because it also effects normal summoned monsters. A second way of using it is stopping the opponent monster from attacking when you have <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a>, or if you summon it as a trap in the end-phase, then its effect can destroy a monster that didn't attack.

<a data-name=""Chain Whirlwind"">Chain Whirlwind</a> – good backup card, <a data-name=""Chain whirlwind"">Chain whirlwind</a> can get triggered by all destroy-effects, if you have a quick-effect-destroy-effect, you can destroy 2 spells/traps as a quick effect in the opponent's turn. Since you destroy a monster every turn it is better than <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a>.

<a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a> - it can summon <a data-name=""Borreload Furious Dragon"">Borreload Furious Dragon</a> out of 2 generic dark dragons from the graveyard. In the deck are 7 rokket-monsters and 2 dark dragons, in the extra-deck are 8 dark dragons, but only <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> is link-1 and easy to summon very fast, when you summoned <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> with one roket-monster you can use <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a> with both in the graveyard.

&nbsp;

Extra Deck:

Fusion:

<a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a> – dark Fusion Targets, if you use <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a> for a link-summon you get <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> to the hand if it is in the deck.

<a data-name=""Borreload Furious Dragon"">Borreload Furious Dragon</a> - '<a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a>'-target for a fast 'boss-monster' that also has a special summon effect to revive <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a>.

Link-1:

<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> -  it's used for <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>, <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a> and <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a>

Striker Dragon - It's the best first link-monster because you can get one more monster on the field with it very fast, and you can draw one more card from the deck. When you have for example <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> but nothing else, you can summon <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> with it, destroy it with it's effect, and then summon <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> again from the hand, after you got it from the graveyard, with the effect of <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a>, then you can destroy <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a> to get <a data-name=""Rokket Recharger"">Rokket Recharger</a>, this way you have to destroy the field spell but you get a <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> with only one <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a>, it can only negate one card then, but it's a 'once per turn'-effect anyway so it's still a good 'boss-monster'.

Link-2:

<a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, <a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> – <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> can be used for fast fusion-summons to 'eat' monsters, <a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a> is a dark machine that also protects <a data-name=""Heavy Metal Raiders"">Heavy Metal Raiders</a> and could bring it back from the graveyard if needed and <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> is good to shoot spell/srap-sards and to draw cards.

<a data-name=""Hieratic Seal Of The Heavenly Spheres"">Hieratic Seal Of The Heavenly Spheres</a> - it's a backup link-monster if you only have 2 rokket-monsters and no 'special summon'-card in the hand. Then it is better than summoning <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, because you can counter one of the opponent monsters in the opponent's turn and also get a rokket-monster from the deck. You can get <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> and destroy it with the quick effect to get <a data-name=""Anesthrokket Dragon"">Anesthrokket Dragon,</a> or you can get <a data-name=""Anesthrokket Dragon"">Anesthrokket Dragon</a> directly because when it gets destroyed you can special summon a rokket-monster in the end phase of the opponent's turn. You can only summon <a data-name=""Hieratic Seal Of The Heavenly Spheres"">Hieratic Seal Of The Heavenly Spheres</a> if you did not use Rokket Tracer's effect because it is a light monster. As an alternative you can also get <a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon"">Absorouter Dragon</a>, then you get a Rokket-monster to the hand instead of special summoning one when it gets destroyed.

<a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon</a> – These Link-monsters work only with the Rokket-monsters, but you can also use Noctovision dragon or <a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon"">Absorouter Dragon as dark dragons</a>. To combo them you need 3 Rocket-monsters. Then you can link 2 of them to <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a>, and link <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a> with the last monster which has to be a Rokket-monster to <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon</a>. Then you can discard one card and shoot <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon</a> to summon 2 rokket monsters and <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a>, to summon <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> with <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a> on the field or to sumnmon <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> directly as a link 4 monster that can 'eat' monsters by 'atk'-ing them. <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> is the best option because it negates an opponent's card and also has 3500 atk then like <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a> when it has <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon</a> equipped (1000 atk/2 = '+500' atk). <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a>'s second effect destroys a monster in the opponent's end phase that didn't attack, this stops the opponent from only summoning a link-monster or another effect-monster with lower than 1600 atk in attack position. This is more powerful if you summon <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a> in the End-phase with <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a> or <a data-name=""Call Of The Haunted"">Call Of The Haunted</a>. When it gets destroyed after you used the 'graveyard-summon'-effec' it gets banished, this way you can use <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a> directly if you have it.

Link-4, Link-5:

<a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a> – Good Link-4 and Link-5 cards, With <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a> you can summon one Rokket Monster every turn and also negate monsters until the end of the round. So <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a> is much better than <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> and it can also attack all monsters, <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> is good to eat monsters with it's effect but it has no destroy-immunity or 'negate'-effect.

Synchro:

<a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> – If you have a link-2 monster in the graveyard it is a good negate, that can also be sumoned very fast with the effect of <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a>. You can summon it in the first or second turn with the Rokket-monster combo's that summon more Rokket-monster's with their effects. You need <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> and and <a data-name=""Rokket Recharger"">Rokket Recharger</a> and a link-2 monster in the graveyard, you can also use <a data-name=""Unknown Synchron"">Unknown Synchron</a> as a level-1-monster with <a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon"">Absorouter Dragon</a> as level-7-monsters. <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> is always the best opening monster, except you can directly build <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a> and summon it later. When it gets destroyed it is easy to summon another <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> because you only need one <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> and use it's effect to get <a data-name=""Rokket Recharger"">Rokket Recharger</a>, so it's best to have two <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>'s in the extra-deck.

Strategy is to dump your Light/Dark monsters by any means necessary - be it Link Summoning, Chaos Space, Mask Change or Adusted Golds effect and summon BLS.

You use Summoner Monk to either get Nurse or, if you already got to it, Shadow Mist on the field (+ Mask Change on the hand).

After that you make Dark Law through Mask Change (II) and give it to your opponent through Creature Swap.

Now you can infinitely loop a Curry and two Primal Seeds to burn for 200 and retrieve the pieces.

Well, and the Kuribohs are also here. They're Dark/Light, you can get to them, you can get them into the GY, one is a Fiend which is good for Evil Mind ... you get it."

Here are some guides with the specific cards.

The Agent of Mystery - Earth and Master/Majesty Hyperion alongside random card:
<ol>
 	<li>Normal Summon Earth, search Neptune.</li>
 	<li>Link Earth into Almiraj</li>
 	<li>Discard Neptune to revive Earth</li>
 	<li>Use Almiraj and Earth to summon Halq, use Halq effect to summon Plaguespreader Zombie</li>
 	<li>Summon Master/Majesty by banishing Neptune in grave, search Sanctuary in the Sky</li>
 	<li>Use Plague and your Hyperion to go into Master Flare and use its effect to copy Venus</li>
 	<li>Venus/Master Flare summon the 3 Shine Balls, use Plauge in grave to put a card on top of Deck to revive</li>
 	<li>Use Plague and a Shine Ball for Arc Light</li>
 	<li>Use remaining 2 Shine Balls into Masquerena to summon an Avramax on your/opponent's turn or a Knightmare Unicorn if needed</li>
</ol>
Diviner of the Herald and random card:
<ol>
 	<li>Summon Diviner, send Trias</li>
 	<li>Trias effect to revive by tributing Diviner</li>
 	<li>Diviner effect to summon Buten from Deck</li>
 	<li>Buten and Trias summon Master Flare that'll copy Venus</li>
 	<li>Use Master Flare with Venus effect to summon 3 Shine Balls</li>
 	<li>Buten effect in grave to turn a Shine Ball into a Tuner, use 2 Shine Balls, including the new Tuner for Halq</li>
 	<li>Halq summon Plague, use Plauge and the Shine Ball for Arc Light</li>
</ol>
The combos could probably vary and be improved on with certain cards in hand or whatever route you wish to take. Pot of Avarice is nice to recover Shine Balls to continue making plays as you desire."

For now, this is Penguins with frogs and paleozoics. This is basically a deck of aquas that feature penguins as the main stars.

Favorite tech in this deck is the Supay combo that gets me penguin brave and its face-down without a normal summon.

End stage goes, penguin brave + penguin soldier facedown + adamancipator dragite + toadally awesome and/or traps.

Best hand is Supay, duskwalker + royal penguin garden + 3 cards that are sexy."

Bahamut can break boards, TCBOO, Utopia Doubl","Modern twist to <strong>Evilswarm</strong> that I've been tweaking.  There are other variants that can work with a different hand trap arsenal (room for 9), or even cutting down to 6 and adding 3 <strong>Allure of Darkness or Triple Tactics Talent</strong> since the deck can have some minor consistency issues in the opening hand, and can have a tough time against hand traps.

Your win condition is most often going to be <strong>Ophion</strong> shutting down Level 5 specials vs. the wide range of decks which focus on just that. <em> (EX. <strong>Dogmatika Invoked</strong>/any <strong>Invoked</strong> variant, <strong>Dinos</strong>, <strong>Adimancipator</strong>/<strong>Eldlich</strong> <strong>Synchro</strong> variants, etc.)</em>

Against decks like <strong>Zoodiac</strong> and other meta <strong>R4NK</strong> spam decks, you're typically praying for <strong>TCBOO</strong>, or other floodgate locks since <strong>Ophion</strong> falls flat in most cases.  You may want to protect these with <strong>Key Beetle</strong>, if possible<em>.  You could consider teching in <strong>Safe Zone</strong> if you want that 2014 JOTL <strong>Dragon Ruler </strong>format feel, if you want to swap to a heavier floodgate variant.  <strong>Safe Zone</strong> has some fun interactions, and can even potentially take your opponent's monsters with it if it's destroyed blindly.</em>

<strong>Utopia Double OTK Combo</strong>, or stealing a monster with <strong>Bahamut</strong>, attacking, and then overlaying <strong>Zeus</strong> can also help to close out these games. Hitting your opponent's Normal Summon with <strong>Imperm</strong>/<strong>Ash</strong> can very often leave a board hanging with an &lt;2k ATK monster, leaving them open to a huge 10k ATK anime swing from the OG <strong>Utopia </strong>to close the game. <em><strong>Bagooska</strong> and <strong>Origin</strong> can help to slow down and simplify these games states as well, with support from your plethora of hand traps and incredibly strong/versatile backrow options.  </em>

Simply making an <strong>Origin</strong>, and running something over for a free <strong>Kerykeion</strong> into <strong>R4NK/Ophion</strong> play can be a great option too, and activating <strong>Exciton</strong> under <strong>Origin</strong> can be absolutely devastating in the right situation.  <em><strong>Torrential</strong> is a very viable tech option for this reason, depending on the meta.</em>

In my opinion, going <strong>Infection</strong> vs <strong>Pandemic</strong> with <strong>Ophion</strong> search is often the way to go, just because a nearly guaranteed <strong>Kerykeion</strong> safety net for the next turn can be huge if your board is broken.  <em>Obviously if you know you're facing a S/T heavy deck, <strong>Pandemic</strong> will likely be the better option if <strong>Ophion</strong> is worth protecting.</em>

<strong>Crackdown </strong>is an insanely strong trap in this deck as well.  Stealing something like <strong>Aleister</strong> can completely shut down the <strong>Invoked</strong> engine for the turn, and provides you with <strong>R4NK/Link</strong> fodder next turn.  Ideally you want to keep whatever you steal as XYZ material when possible, but you can just as easily link them off for <strong>Unicorn</strong>, <strong>Phoenix</strong>, or even <strong>Apollousa</strong> when the situation calls for them.  If <strong>TCBOO</strong> is effective vs the deck you're facing, consider swapping <strong>Crackdown</strong> out for side deck options in Games 2&amp;3.  Other Floodgates (<strong>EEV</strong>, <strong>Anti-Spell Fragrance</strong>, etc.) are good choices if they're viable, or something like <strong>Evenly Matched</strong> when going 2nd.  <em>If <strong>TCBOO</strong> isn't viable, keep <strong>Crackdown</strong> and replace with a more viable floodgate/tech options.</em>

I'm not a huge fan of <strong>Allure</strong> unless you run Dark hand traps such as <strong>Dimensional Shifter</strong> or <strong>D.D. Crow</strong>.  It may be worth it if you run 3 of either, plus main deck <strong>Mandragora</strong>?  But I would rather try to fit in <strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong> if you want extra draw power, just due to it's versatility and how hard hand traps can hurt because the deck can be so reliant on <strong>Rabbit/Dai/RotA</strong> as starters.  <em><strong>Dai</strong> and <strong>RotA</strong> can both double as <strong>Ash</strong> bait, when needed.  </em>

<strong>Iron Dragon Tiamaton</strong> is another super interesting tech option for a Dark ""hand trap"", and if you summon <strong>Ophion</strong> straight to your EMZ, you can slow a lot a decks down substantially if you're able to land <strong>Tiamaton</strong> to lock out the other EMZ.  This card also has FANTASTIC synergy with <strong>Origin</strong>, providing a super soft domain lock by blocking <strong>Origin's</strong> up arrow if summoned beneath it in the same column, only allowing your opponent to SS from the extra into the opposite EMZ.   It will also give <strong>Origin</strong> protection if you summon beneath it in the same column, even if there is no monster on your opponent's side above it.  This variant is super fun, and I recommend it as well.  <em>Keep in mind, this is very good Game 1, but your opponent will often be prepared for <strong>Tiamaton</strong> later in the match.</em>

This deck works best going second so you can use cards like Lunalight Fusion to bust out more powerful Fusion Monsters if your opponent has already special summoned something from the Extra Deck. One combo to try out can work with Kaleido Chick and Purple Butterfly in your hand. Use Kaleido Chick to send Blue Cat or Yellow Marten to the Graveyard (Which one you send depends on what you need. If you don't already have a fusion card like Polymerization or Lunalight Fusion, send Marten. If you do already have one, send Cat). If you send Marten, you can grab a Lunalight Fusion from your deck to use to bust out pretty much any of your Lunalight Fusion Monsters should your opponent have an Extra Deck monster out on their field. Then use Purple Buttefly's ability to resurrect Blue Cat if that's the card you sent with Kaleido's ability so you can double your Fusion's ATK and easily OTK your opponent.

Another great combo makes use of Fraktall to send Kitt and then Nervall to the Grave, then add a Kerass to your hand. You can Special Summon him if you have another expendable monster in your hand, or normal summoning works just as well for what comes next. Next, use Kerass to Link Summon Ferrijit by using the monsters in your Grave, then use Ferrijiit's ability to bust out another Tri-Brigade card from your hand. Then you have a great number of things you can do from here. You can use the three monsters on your field to Link Summon Borrelsword or Shuraig, or go into Rugal and then Shuraig to lower your opponent's monster's ATK first, but no matter what you do you can use Ferrijiit's ability to draw an extra card, plus you still have your one Normal Summon at your disposal to bust out even more monsters afterwards if you used Kerass' ability to Special Summon him out on the field.

All-in-all, this deck is amazing at delivering swift, decisive blows to your opponents that can overload your monsters with ATK points to deal 8000+ damage in one turn. It's all in how you decide to use it."

On top of all of that, you have the Machina - Train OTK toolbox for both supporting and for making a massive damage, leading to OTK your opponent!

However, I only make decks with cards I actually own in real-life as I want to be able to play with what I have.

The most important card in the deck is the field spell Heavy Metal Raiders, as it can protect your monsters in battle and help you summon out more in the process.

This deck is definitely not a combo deck, but there are some fun plays/strategies you can apply:

If you manage to draw Cyber Stein in your opening hand, you can attempt to use his effect to special summon The Last Warrior From Another Planet.

Crackdown/Mind control can be used together with a level 6 monster in order to facilitate the summoning of Dhampir Vampire Sheridan.

If you are prepared to take some damage to your life points, you could main deck Jinzo #7 while having Heavy Metal Raiders in the field zone. For example, say your opponent attacks your Jinzo #7 with a Blue-Eyes White Dragon. After taking the damage, your Jinzo will now have 3000 Atk, while once per battle phase being unable to be destroyed in battle, with the ability to attack directly for a lot of damage."

Primary win-con hopes to establish Empen + counter trap with protection from either Apex Avian or Solemn.

&nbsp;

Field spell + any level 1 Flunder unopposed results in Empen and the counter trap. Any two level 1 Flunders with the field spell makes it consistent through Ash/Imperm. Without the field spell, the deck is fragile. Sauravis mitigates this to a degree, and can be run as an alternative to the 3x Empen and counter trap.

&nbsp;

Zeus can be summoned if the opponent's turn ends with two level 1 Flunders or one level 1 Flunder and another level 1 in hand. Note that controlling <strong>any</strong> special summoned monsters turns off the counter trap. The extra deck in general exists for Pot of Prosperity but can provide utility if necessary.

Side deck includes options for going second and the Simorgh lock."

Going first summon dark law pass , turn 3 OTK.

No evil heros but you can add them in or cut some cards for them

D heros, draw hand is amazing with dark law and super poly, makes d hero dangerous a super poly target if the opponent ends on a dark monster. Also you can draw hand force them to draw and law them. Also dynatag is the best one after you summon dystopia off of it , so it always has a pop.

Dark world dealings, Saw a profile on youtube and am testing this card, and i love it. Summon dark law turn 1 , then activate this card and force them to draw discard and then dark law rip one. Making them start their turn with 4 cards. Also helps fix bad hands , and also moved shadow mist to 3 because of super poly and dark world dealing discards, helps having better discards.

Hand traps can be anything, i chose veiler and droll bc it makes the super poly targets live more often, like great tornado and the shining, making them easier to miracle fusion into."

I've decided to add it because I already use Isolde. The core of the deck is pretty standard PK Fire. Here's the other cards that you might not see in other profiles.

Isolde is a fantastic card for just about any warrior deck. I actually prefer it to Laviair for extending. The ability of special summoning just about any warrior trivializes needing to have that warrior in hand when needed. Renaud is in incase I draw an equip card. Renaud can further extend with sending DDR or Living Fossil with Isolde, and getting chosen Equip Spell back with Renaud's effect.

Shadow Mist goes right into Dark Law when brought out with Isolde. Dark Law is an intimidating monster for your opponent to deal with. They'll have a hard time playing around it.

I've shown that I use the Artifact package. Dagda into Scythe can put a stop to your opponent's plays that use the Extra Deck. I can use Rusty's destruction effect to destroy Scythe on my opponent's turn by special summoning a dark Xyz monster with Rank-Up. I can also get an added effect if I'm able to get Abomination onto the field too. Which is also another monster that my opponent will have to deal with or suffer it's effects.

The equip cards are what I think would be best. DDR and Living Fossil are the best using Renaud. The other two can be whatever you'd like, but I think these two work the best of any Equip Spells. Steal your opponent's monster from they're GY. And Shooting Star Bow to drop your opponent's attack by 1000. This can make Apollousa lose two negates!

I like the deck at 44 cards to reduce the chance of drawing unwanted cards like the BA and Equip Spells. 44 cards don't seem to reduce the deck's consistency either. It feels like a good balance.

Extra Deck might change a little. It has what I want. But I think I can lose I:P and Zeus without missing them."

This was kind of a challenge cuz tiger was an essential piece for the deck to function and that was the thing, my obsession with tiger overshadowed the fact that lunalight had so much other great cards and interactions to work with, stuff like purple butterfly, serenade dance and emerald bird etc...

<span><em><strong>NOTES :</strong></em></span>

<em><b>Luna light perfume: </b></em>this card is just irreplaceable, use its second effect to discard cards that gives you value even in the gy, your main searchable cards depends on the situation, if you have yellow marten in gy search for wolf, or just go for kaleido chick if you dont have something to normal summon and again just be smart and add cards that will execute your combos best, also dont use it on danger! monsters even if it sounds like a good idea but no its better for you use their full effect to maximize the value and lastly, most of the times you want to activate this card rather than just send it the gy.

<em><strong>Lunalight serenade dance: </strong></em>this card's main purpose is to go in the gy....thats it..serenade dance's is a meh card but its second effect tho is bonkers, again use the cost to send your valuable cards in the gy and dont use it on danger! monsters cuz it does not discard and thats actually a great thing since it triggers your emerald bird's second effect.

This deck has some kind of raw power to just go thought handtraps but you can remove parallel exceed for move protection like 2 triple tactics and a called by the grave, other than that its kind of the same you just replace tiger with butterflies and wolves, ah yes speaking of wolf that thing is kinda cool but you just use it to otk with style using your fusions and to return it back to hand to summon zephyros and marten."

Basically this is to give a bit more of consistency.

&nbsp;

<span><strong>Procedure: </strong></span>
<ol>
 	<li>Kaiju, Slumber, Dark hole anything you need/can.</li>
 	<li>Try to open <span><strong>always</strong></span> with Rokket engine otherwise you will be probably locked to the fiend type restriction impose by Aruha or Rakea.</li>
 	<li>Let a Beelze or Tenyi after your dragon combo.</li>
 	<li>Follow the Unchained regular combo to swarm.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span><strong>Tips: </strong></span>

-You can use Tracer to pop your Unchained monsters to recycle or float another Unchained monster as needed (like Rakea does, so it is a plus there).

-You can chain to Unchained traps activation the Tracer effect to even go further.

-Whenever a Rokket is destroyed: Unchained soul special summon can be activated if is in hand (another plus there).

&nbsp;

<strong><span>How to use this against...?</span></strong>

Well, as usual it depends on your hand but mostly of the times you will be in the next scenarios:

<strong>Board with a boss monster or two</strong>: Dragoon, Borreload Savage, Apollousa, etc: Kaiju, dark holes or Slumber (for apollousa or boss that do not negate spells or are weak to a simple dark hole).

<strong>Heavy backrow</strong>: Unless they have a lot of Solemn judgments or Solemn strikers set you are going to be fine, you can bait with Rokket engine specials to leave at the end your Unchained end board.

&nbsp;

<span><strong>Sidedeck:</strong></span>

This is as always open to the meta in your location, I put there some generic options that covers: D. Links, Dino and Zombies or pretty much anything that banish.

&nbsp;

<span><strong>Weakness of this deck:</strong></span>

Zombies. They have a really bad time trying to beat a deck that turn everything into a zombie (specially with the fiend and dragon restrictions).

If you like it enjoy. If you don't, thanks for trying and give me tips, please, keeping it in mostly Zexal-Like","Got a couple of cards backward Sorry

This is for a Fanfiction I'm working on that takes place in Zexal times but I liked the aspect of the Rikkas plus Number 87 was never in the anime or manga so here's my attempt to put this decent card into it. Also, it's a Shark x OC so this is why there are sharks in this deck as well as they help get bigger monsters on the field to get the effects either on the field or grave.

Getting Rikka Petal on the field first is a strong start even if she gets destroyed on the next turn because she gets brought back instantly if you only have plants or no cards at all in the monster zone. Using Petals other effect to get Snowdrop in your hand or already having her is perfect. If you have a plant on the field just activate Snow's effect Special Summoning her after tributing that plant then get out another Rikka sets you up marvelously to get out either Teardrop or Number 38 if you have two thanks to Snow's other effect of changing levels making them level 8 or if you have three and use Snow's level change effect get three Level 8s out there's Number 87 right there. Lantern shark helps when you wanna get Number 37 or Abyss Dweller. I would go Abyss Dweller if you can since it raises almost every card in this deck's attack by 500 including itself.

If you like it enjoy. If you don't, thanks for trying and give me tips, please, keeping it in mostly Zexal-Like","This is for a Fanfiction I'm working on that takes place in Zexal times but I liked the aspect of the Rikkas plus Number 87 was never in the anime or manga so here's my attempt to put this decent card into it. Also, it's a Shark x OC so this is why there are sharks in this deck as well as they help get bigger monsters on the field to get the effects either on the field or grave.

Getting Rikka Petal on the field first is a strong start even if she gets destroyed on the next turn because she gets brought back instantly if you only have plants or no cards at all in the monster zone. Using Petals other effect to get Snowdrop in your hand or already having her is perfect. If you have a plant on the field just activate Snow's effect Special Summoning her after tributing that plant then get out another Rikka sets you up marvelously to get out either Teardrop or Number 38 if you have two thanks to Snow's other effect of changing levels making them level 8 or if you have three and use Snow's level change effect get three Level 8s out there's Number 87 right there. Lantern shark helps when you wanna get Number 37 or Abyss Dweller. I would go Abyss Dweller if you can since it raises almost every card in this deck's attack by 500 including itself.

The priority should be getting out Empen, because he provide access to the counter trap and a restriction on your opponents monster effects. Bird of bringing can get you either an extra normal summon off the field spell, or one of the simorgh birds if you have enough tribute fodder and still have a normal summon to use. Draw power ratio is probably a bit high in this deck. It's an early version. They can probably be swapped for handtraps. Ideas for cards to use are in the side deck."

Dino DNA and Scrap Raptor is no different.
The cool thing about Scrap Raptor is that it doesn't change the way Dino plays, what it does is make the final board even better. When you access the Scrap engine it's because your game is already running and it gives you greater game volume for a lot more possibilities, making the variables within your control for better decision.
With only 2 Scrap Raptor + Chimera + Wyvern engine you have access to Savage and facilitate Links and xyz playing around Nibiru and Misc follow up. You still have up to 14 slots for tech cards game 1 and space for 19 after side. Of course, the deck keeps losing to the same hand traps and interactions that everyone should know by now. The best deck build for better preparation for tournaments depends on the meta call.
In view of this I have tested too many Dino Scrap combos whether it is Artifact Lock, FTK, send Imperial Order with Curious and set with Gryphon, move with Halq and Auroradon, use extra deck with a lot of Synchro or a lot of Link. In the end, I saw that first any combo is only good if you use Golem and Chimera which are worse draw than Driver and second you don't do anything better than the deck already does without Scrap, third you lose for all hand traps, fourth detail is that most of the best end boards are made with the Giant Rex which means no Follow Up Misc making your deck horrible turn 3 and 5 you try to play Dino going first which is horrible because either you brick more than going second or make a board that loses to power cards as it used to. So for me the Scrap engine is only good if you only use Synchro Savage and use a lot of xyz like Bagooska, Dugares, Zeus, Excitom Knight to get the most value from this engine and nothing else.
I'm still wondering if it's worth playing compared to the standard build (sometimes the board feels a little unecessarily overextended, and maybe a bit weaker to Nib) but it has some great perks (especially the access to Savage, the possibility to play more around Lancea and instant lose cards like TCBO and IDP, and access to another two card combo in Scrap Raptor + Lost World and Scrap Raptor + Miscellaneousaurus). I still recommend playing second with this deck even though most decks are Dice Roll made to use a lot of Go First cards. Always remember that Dino is a bad deck compared to the Tier 1 of the format, he has to be an excellent technoplayer to get a good result with the deck.

Engine cards you can take post side: Giant Rex and one of the Scrap Raptor. But remember that with just one Scrap Raptor you cannot use the Wyvern's second effect.
Against Drytron and Dragon Link: You take all Lost Worlds because DLink bounces and Drytron has Linkuriboh in GY.

Options that can be used in place of Zeus:
Unicorn - most recommended
Cerberus - is better than Unicorn in some respects as far as Phoenix can be co-linked with Wyvern, can destroy lost world token, be link 2.
Hiita or Aussa - Hiita accesses Misc or Dogoran if you side use it instead of Qoatlus. Aussa accesses the Babys, Rex, Pankratops and Scrap Raptor."

The goal is to get your 4 card engine in the GY in order to bring out Ogdoadic Water Lily in order to special summon Ogdoabyss to wipe your opponent's field and potentially OTK with Draglubion/ Numeron combo, or if you can summon two Ogdoabyss' you can bring out Gustav/ Liebe combo. If you want negates, Lancelot is good but a double edged sword then compound him with AA-Zeus or you can make Apollousa. The last extra deck combo is Cipher Dragon summon, to overlay Full Armor in order to detach and pop a face up card on your opponent's field, then overlay for Cipher Blade and pop a facedown card on your opponent's side but always detach cipher dragon when activating this effect."

So I need to constantly find new ways to make it work. This is what I got, been doing me good on Dawn of a New Era unranked matches. Not the best deck but good enough imo.

Card by card/Explanations for what might look like dumb decisions and ultimately arent crucial to the deck and you are free to replace them:

Blue-Eyes White Dragon: Blue-Eyes White Dragon

Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon: Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon

Dragon Spirit of White: Same joke as previous 2, but you could use only 1 or go to 3 in all honestly, up to you and what you play a lot against. Also battle phase shenanigans, but this card almost never sees the battle phase, I usualy xyz or synchro it off. Also, it can tag out even under skill drain so that's pretty cool.

Chaos Dragon Levianeer: Free rank 8 80% of the time, sometimes a 3k beater that pops 2 cards. Usually you use the all light effect though. Searchable with Melody

Nebula Dragon: EZ rank 8 play, 1 less brick in a deck with more bricks than home depot

White Stone of Ancients: Best search for Sage, Cards of Consonance is a thing, and you get a free blue-eyes normie monster at the end phase. Dragon Spirit of White can get rid of backrow, or just have the big boy himself come out for a 3k beat stick.

Sage with Eyes of Blue: Sage with Eyes of Blue

Protector with Eyes of Blue: I feel this card is slept on. I used to use Glow-Up bulb to extend from my Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon plays, but Halqi exists and got my boy banned. So Protector is kind of that role. Only 1 though because you really don't want to draw into it, and only want to search it off of Sage if you can already make a decent board and don't need White Stone. Worst case scenario it's a Sage that doesn't search, which yeah isn't great but most of the time I see this card I'm using his effect to go into a Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon.

Return of the Dragon Lords: Monster Reborn for 90% of our deck with a banish to protect effect

Pot of Desires: it draw the cards. You can use Extravagance, but I feel like bad banishes with Desires are still better than if you get bad banishes with Extravagance.

Trade-in: Trade-in

Cards of Consonance: it's like trade-in for white stone but you also get the special summon at end phase

Melody of Awakening Dragon: Searches all our monsters in the deck besides tuners and nebula dragon.

Upstart Goblin: basically makes the deck 39 cards, and giving the opponent 1k LP doesn't matter

Skill Drain: Blue-Eyes tend to have higher base attacks than most anything else in the game. If you go first and draw into this and flip it on your opponent after having set up a decent board for yourself, you won if they can't out it.

Bingo Machine: Honestly just couldn't think of anything else, and I never played with this card before. It's not the worst, I also experimented with Dragon Shrine in its place and I just didnt like that, again, to each their own

Solemn Strike: I chose this over Judgement because it can stop Ash and in my own experience, that really shuts us down. I feel like Blue-Eyes decks kind of get 1 chance to make their board and any sort of disruption just loses us the game. We don't special summon enough for Nibiru to be a problem, and even if you do, you can still come back from that with cards like Return of the Dragon Lords, but most of the time if I get my Trade-In or Melody Ash Blossom'd I feel like I just wanna scoop.

Twin-Burst: Sometimes you can't get over some big booties. More or less Eater of Millions with a Blue-Eyes skin.

Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon: great tag out target for Spirit Dragon. Protection effect for all your  currently controlled dragons for 2 turns, also saves itself from being destroyed from Spirit Dragon's effect, also can special summon Blue-Eyes or Spirit of White from your GY. You can cut down to 1 if you are looking for more extra deck room, I like 2 incase I'm in a real grindy game and we both run out of steam, this puts me back in it

Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon: Super versatile, can go into 3 differnt extra deck monsters we have, negates GY effects, the ""no more than 2 special summons at a time"" effect comes in handy once in a while.

Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon: Yeah don't go into it too often, but enough that I think it's worth an extra deck spot. This is why I put Protector into the deck. Summon Protector, use effect to special another tuner from your hand, go into Spirit Dragon, tag out for Black Rose, return one of their cards, go into Crystal Wing so you don't lose a monster.

Black Rose Moonlight Dragon: bounce something troublesome back, if you have another tuner go into Crystal Wing as mentioned above.

Stardust Spark Dragon: honestly I don't use this one too too much, it's just been in Blue-Eyes decks for as long as I can remember. Feel free to replace with something you think is better

Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon: Draglubion target, sometimes better than Numeron Dragon. In which case you summon N92 and attack Numeron.

Number 100: Numeron Dragon: Usually best thing to cheat out w Draglubion, at minimum it will be a 9k beat stick. If you really pop off I've seen it go 25k.

Draglubion: Can cheat out 2 incredible cards.

Number 38 Hope Harbinger Titanic Dragon Galaxy: Go into if you know you're playing a deck that relies on a spell card to get their combos going.

Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord: Only used to go into Full Armor Photon Dragon. Also has a negate that might come up as useful now and again

Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon: 4k beater that can pop 1 card a turn.

Why no Zeus?: I didn't put in Zeus because I feel like Blue Eyes decks just kinda do what he does anyway.

I didnt include a side deck because honestly I change it constantly depending what I am seeing a lot of in the online matches I play.

That's all I have to say about the deck, hope the description was helpful."

Resource loop. Main deck D Shifter while being able to go first.","Tier 0? I don't think so tbh. Its pretty overhyped because the choke point is very narrow compared to most other meta decks. This deck struggles to play through a single form of disruption like ash blossom. The potential is high but compared to decks like drytron/dragon link it doesn't have the same versatility and doesn't have the same grind potential as decks like eldlich/Invoked bs. There is a recourse loop but the retained cards are not proactive to compete with the current meta control decks.

If playing ocg i would take out imperm for crossout and replace the loose super poly with another cyclone or whatever you want. With Crossout designator i think this deck could be meta but im not sure when or if we'll ever get it in the tcg."
