I am only running 2x rite and 1x enchantress because enchantress is searchable off of Cherubini, and I run a lot of level 3 extenders so it is pretty easy to get to Cherubini. This gives me 3 cards I can open with that can start off the engine, and like around 20 different level 3s to make Cherubini to search enchantress. I run Dracoback because if you use it to discard for dragoons effect, it attaches to the token for a free bounce. I run 1 of all of the common handtraps because I run 3x Crossout. I also run the one scythe because I can cross it out, and if I do draw it I can set it and pop it off of Rusty's effect by reviving a break sword in grave to a zone he points to. I also choose to run dragoon over DPE beacause he is a tower and is harder to get around that DPE. Everyone a;ways forgets about the double pop+burn and that alone has ended games. Drawing red eyes fusion happens moderately often and it basically useless in hand, because Verte cannot get it into grave from the hand. If I do open red-eyes fusion, I can go through combo and dump Edge Imp Sabres, then use Edege Imp to put Red-Eyes Fusion back into the deck and Special summon itself,  then make Verte off of Cherubini + Edge or go into Rusty and continue combo. It's pretty solid and pretty consistent and you can basically play forever with stuff in the graveyard so the grind game is super good. I also has a really good OTK through Arc Rebellion and its pretty easy to play through a bunch of stuff and still end on arc rebellion for the OTK, especially if your opponent payed 2000 for verte. There are definitely better decks but I like PK so this is what I'm running to keep up with the meta decks running around."

Featured archtype: Karakuri, Machina, Theroins', P.U.N.K., Infinitrack, Mor","Note: Ban list destroyed this deck. Will remain up, but only feasible in traditional format.  Really fragile, but not  as  fragile as the base Karakuri Strategy.  The plan is to go into Halq, get 001, then go into Auroradon. From there, you synchro into a Burei and bring out a Saizan to create another Burei. You Synchro Climb into Bureido using Gamas (Remember to use Gama in GY to draw 2), and then go into Bureibu.  Card Selection Breakdown:  The summary above can be the result of a single e-Tele (or just a Ze Amin Normal Summon). Of course, depending on your opening hand, the strategy might differ a bit. Here  is why I run the cards I do.  Karakuri: Base for the deck. You generally don't want to draw into your Ninishi and Gamas. Kunamzan is best left in the deck, and you should only go into it when you have no other play  other than Ready/Insta fusion  + Kunamzan into a River Stormer.  Theorins': King Reggie is a safety net against interruptions. Having him on the board while you combo off is great for preventing Nibiru or a disruption. Remember, if Halq fizzles, you're pretty much fucked. I would run 3, but I found myself drawing into 2 Reggies when I only needed the one.  P.U.N.K: Main Combo Starter. A single E-Tele can take you from Ze Amin to a Bureibu. Standard combo is  Ele-Tele -&gt; Ze Amin -&gt; Madame Spider -&gt; Halq (into 001)  -&gt; Auroradon -&gt; 2 Bureis -&gt; 2 Bureidos -&gt; Bureibu and a Bureido  Machina: Great for setting up Reggie and getting bricks into your GY. Drawing into Redeployment and a Machina isn't generally bad, as you do run an Overdrive. You use Overdrive to recycle your Halq and other options. If you get into the fabled turn 3 and beyond, you can do a pretty nice loop  of Recycling Tunneler with Overdrive to get back even more resources. Citadel is also an amazing piece of interruption.  Infinitrack: There mostly for Tunneler. Dozer and Trencher are cuttable, but Dozer searches out the Tunneler and I find myself in a lot of situations where I need to get myself back into the grind. I usually search Dozer w/ Heavy Forward to deck thin. I also pitch it for Theorins when I can.  Vernalizers: Extenders. Them being able to retrieve ANY earth is amazing. I don't want to draw into them too often tho. Never use these as your first move, as they'll lock you out of Halq, Auroradon and Baronne. Only use them to continue your combos once you're sure you have no other play.  Morphtronic: There to get you into Halq if you don't draw into any P.U.N.Ks.  Ready/Insta Fusion: As mentioned previously, here when you need an extra body on the field. You run Gyroid and Cyber Saurus because they're Earth Machines.  Using Kunamzan doesn't lock you out of them  and Tunneler can recycle them - so they're perfect.  Destrudo: Another Tuner for Halq  Extra deck:  Run what you'll go into. The extra deck space isn't that right, as you  can cut Infinitrack Goliath and Earth Slicer. I never go into them, and if I do, I'm probably losing that game anyways. However, Earth Slicer can be great going second.  You'll generally use up most of the Karakuris in your Combos, although I do find myself with a Single Bureibu left, often. Naturia Beast is perfect, and shuts down most decks - you can go into it with a Ninishi Special Summon with a Karakuri Synchro, and then normal summoning Inashichi.  Baronne is a great card, and you can go into it with a Ninishi + Machina Fortress. It's worth mentioning that it is Generic, so any  other combination of  cards in the deck can lead up to it.  &nbsp;"

They have level 3 psychics (making them E-Tele targets) whose combo line is pretty competent and good at baiting negates. Normally, the PUNKs are used to make Halqdon lines, but for this list we opted for a pair of Rank 2 monster: Gossip Shadow and Break Sword. Gossip Shadow lets us set up a negate under Nibiru, and Break Sord is a great equalizer going second.  If you didn't want to run the PUNKs, I would recommend replacing them with Pot of Desires and another handtrap."

Rated Toadally Awesome by many.,"Fast shark XYZ that will crumble under the weight of a single handtrap. Main deck lacks handtraps because they are expensive. I've been playing a version of this deck with handtraps in Master Duel and it works well enough.  Starters: Beautunaful Princess, Buzzsaw Shark, Lantern Shark  Boss monsters: Utopic Draco Future, Silent Honor ARK, Silent Honor DARK, Stealth Kragen  Usually I summon Bahamut Shark and detach to summon Toadally Awesome for that toadally sick negate. If I'm lucky enough I can get out another Rank 4, then I use the two Rank 4s to summon Utopic Future -&gt; Utopic Draco Future. If you're holding XYZ Remora in your starting hand don't detach, special summon Remora and then you'll get back the two detached monsters.  Set Whitefish Salvage as soon as you get it. You win if it's destroyed (add fish from deck to hand) and you win if it stays on the field (add fish from GY to hand every turn). Remember to special summon Silent Sea Nettle from your hand BEFORE special summoning Silent Angler. If you hold XYZ Revive Splash, probably set it.

Final board: Schisme, some monster(depend of situation), and if i have on my hand, some trap.  My stratégie for going first:  Take from the side deck: Scythe engine, whitch's strike.  Take off gamma and put in veiler/ghost/belle x3  Do you think it will be a strong enought deck to score at locals? Maybe win ?:D  Any advice will be really apreciate!!!  Cheers guys"

It can survive against meta-decks that can negate your ass multiple times and with the right luck, you can still have some resources to still have a strategy to win.  The main first move strategy is to have 2 Spyral cards on the field to summon <strong>Double Helix</strong>. Use <strong>Spyral Drone </strong>to find out the top card on your opponent's deck is so you can correctly activate other Spyral cards' effects. After summoning <strong>Spyral Drone,</strong> you should hope that you have <strong>Super Agent</strong> in your hand to special summon on the field or cards that can bring him to your hand like <strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong> or <strong>Spiral Resort</strong>. There is other tricks to manage to have other Spyral cards special summoned on your first turn:  <em><strong>-</strong></em><em>One for One can have you have 2 Drones on the field (if something happens that would have O.F.O. negated, the monster would still be discarded. Managing to discard a Spyral Rescue can special summon the monster from the grave yard.  -Magicians' souls can send a Spyral Master Plan to the graveyard and send Spyral Rescue in your hand (and one other spyral trap) to the grave yard so you could use Spyral Rescue in the graveyard to special summon Master Plan. (This is probably the best way since it could burn out your opponent's hand traps Like Effect Veiler or Ash Blossom and the result of sending cards in the grave yard would still happen, though obviously you wont draw cards from Magician's Souls' effect.)  -Managing to discard a Spyral monster and having Big Red in your hand can special summon that Spyral Monster. Most people would like to keep Big Red for an emergency, but its good material to special summon Spyral Sleeper. With the right cards and with this strategy, you can have a good collection of cards in your hand so having Sleeper and with multiple Spyral cards already in the graveyard, you could also have Spyral Sleeper on the field on your first turn.  -Before summoning Drone, summon Quick Fix instead. Activate his effect by adding Big Red to your hand then sacrifice him to summon Linkuriboh. Using his effect in the graveyard can have Quick Fix special summon himself by discarding a card in your hand (you need to discard a spyral monster). After gaining another card from Quick Fix, use Big Red to special summon that discard Spyral Monster from the graveyard. (Warning: Quick Fix would be sent to the Banishment during Link Summoning)  </em>Those are just few ways to get a head start on the first or second turn. By the end of your turn, you'd want <strong>Spyral Double Helix</strong> and <strong>Spyral Resort</strong> on the field. In a situation where you have no cards left and just managed to summon <strong>Spyral Double Helix</strong>, have his effect special summon <strong>Spyral Master Plan</strong>. After gaining a card from <strong>Master Plan</strong>, preferably <strong>Spyral Rescue</strong>, Link Summon another <strong>Double Helix</strong> to activate <strong>Master Plan</strong>'s effect in the grave yard to draw a <strong>Spyral Resort</strong> and any Spyral Monster to your hand. <em> Depending on hand you started out with, you should have the right card to prepare for your opponent's next turn: -If you haven't used Super Agent's effect to be special summoned, draw him and summon him. -If you only have Double Helix on the field, draw Spyral Gear: Last Resort to keep Double Helix from dying. -If you have a good amount of cards on your spell and trap zone, draw Spyral Sleeper -If you already have a Spyral Resort and you summoned Master Plan, you don't have to make the extra link summon unless to have an extra Resort and a extra Spyral Monster. -If you managed to special summon Master Plan without Double Helix's effect, special summon Quick Fix to add Utility Wire and/or Fully Armed. (You could have both by link summoning Quick fix for Linkuriboh , then using Quick Fix's effect to bring him back from the graveyard. However he will be banished next time he is destroyed. </em>There are other back up strategies in case your opponent negates you hard enough to almost run out of options with your Spyral Cards. -<em>The Numeron Network and the Numeron XYZ monsters is good for a last ditch comeback.  -Underworld Goddess and Mekk-Knight is used as move to destroy your opponent's nearly invincible monster depending on the situation. Even if the Numeron XYZ monsters can't be used to attack, they can still be used as material.  -Security Dragon can be used to send your opponent's nearly invincible monster back to their hand. By the off chance that you were unable to summon Double Helix but still have 2 effect monsters on the field, Code Breaker Virus Swordsman can be used to link together with Security Dragon.  -Slifer is good to have during matches that are drawn out. Spyral Resort, Master Plan, Spyral Mission: Assault, and Double Helix regularly draw cards to your hand to generate Slifer's attack points (once I managed to have it up to 12,000atk) and the ways to have monsters on your field can be used as materials to tribute summon Slifer to the field.  -Big Eye would be used on a rare occasion if you'd managed to have both Master Plans on the field.  </em>Thats everything I can think of for strategy off the top of my head and the more you practice with your deck, the more flexible your own strategy can be. Its my first time adding a deck to this website and its already waaaaaaaaaay too long to read, but this deck has brought me to Platinum Rank 1. Any feed back and ways I can improve this deck would be awesome."

What I like most about this deck is that you feel that Fluffal has a high ceiling of moves, even more considering that the deck doesn't use any LINK-2 Enabler to make moves, but you <strong>rotate the engine around your cards</strong>. And for that it is subdivided into three Archetypes: <strong>""Fluffal"" Cards, ""Edge Imp"" Cards and ""Frightfur"" Cards</strong> and since practically all fusions are semi-generic and need at least 1 ""Fluffal"" and 1 ""Edge Imp ""Monster to be Made this is a typical big engine to play. The only LINK Monster missing when playing Fluffal in Fusion Format is <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> for bringing back from the GY a <strong>name necessary to make a certain Fusion Summon</strong> for example. Despite having received excellent support over the years, Fluffal's focus in Fusion Format is to <strong>go Second Always</strong> because turn 1 you don't have many ways to <strong>interact with the opponent</strong> being at most passing with <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> + <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> that makes the move of Summon <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> on your opponent's turn allowing you to <strong>destroy 1 card on each side of the field</strong> and <strong>draw 2 cards and discard 1</strong> with Fluffal Penguin.  This is not a linear deck, each <strong>Starter Hand will change the way you run the engine</strong> and make field presence and advantage. It's like playing a puzzle, and that's why this is a deck that, even with simple effects cards, is quite complex to play correctly. The deck has a lot of <strong>Search Power, Draw Power and Recycling</strong> needed to play since it's a Fusion deck that <strong>doesn't ""CHEAT"" in the mechanics</strong> because you still Fusion Summon through <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a>, at most you have <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a> that allows you <strong>banish Fusion Materials from the GY</strong> to make Fusions from the Extra Deck as a Fusion Summon Enabler, otherwise everything you do is in the race and so you need to know <strong>how to manage resources as efficiently as possible</strong> because you will most of the time need it <strong>Draw half of your deck in one turn</strong> to be able to Fusion Summon. Because you need to Fusion Summon with <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> and in general ""Frightfur"" Fusion Monsters are semi-generic because it requires an ""Edge Imp"" Monster and a ""Fluffal"" Monster as material you will come across several Main Deck cards that generate advantage like the <a data-name=""Pot of Greed"">Pot of Greed</a> and <a data-name=""Engage!"">Engage!</a> level such as: <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>, <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> and especially <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> which is a Continuous Spell with two <strong>Soft Once Per Turn effects</strong> (once per copy) being an absurd card in terms of advantage for Fluffal's Archetype. As this is a very old Archetype several of the cards especially the Extra Deck monsters have Soft Once Per Turn effects so whenever you <strong>bring a different copy of them to the field you will be able to use their effects again</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Details during Fluffal's Fusion Format Gameplay</strong>:  As I don't have the <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> summon I have to use <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> as an <strong>extender as soon as possible</strong> and it hurts to have several push moves but that's ok for this version only Fusion Summon. The trick behind <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> is that you can <strong>use your first effect</strong> of returning a ""Frightfur"" Fusion to the Extra Deck and <strong>giving Monster Reborn</strong> because in the Normal version of Fluffal you always want to send it straight to the GY with the <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> but in Fusion Format you need to take advantage of the card's first effect as well. For that you need to make <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> using <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> as material and activate its effect to Add <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> from Deck to hand and use <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> send <a data-name=""Frightfur Daredevil"">Frightfur Daredevil</a> to GY and gain ATK Boost to be able to use <strong>Repair first eff</strong> and return Daredevil to the Extra Deck and reborn from <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> for example to use its Special from Hand effect again. That way you not only extend your rolls but you will also have the second effect of Frightfur Repair available on the next turn.  When you have several cards in your hand that don't help you at all, it's very good to <strong>start discarding them to see new cards</strong> with <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>.  Even if <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> doesn't have good targets against the opponent's deck you can simply use Super Polymerization <strong>on your Monsters during the Battle Phase</strong> to guarantee OTK when using for example <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> and <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a> as material to make the <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> that enters giving Reborn from Kraken. Another use of <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> is taking the target out of an <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> for example so that your Fusion monster like <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a> resolves and destroys your opponent's cards.  Interesting to see how to <strong>make your chain link</strong> with the deck because several Main Deck monsters trigger effs when <strong>sent to the GY as Fusion Materials</strong> so if you are facing a deck of <strong>Omninegate monsters</strong> like <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> you can <strong>""Chain Block""</strong> the most important effects for them to resolve.  <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> is very easy to make with any ""Frightfur"" Fusion and the <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> added with <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Simple Deck Combo Lines:</strong> They are more about <strong>small combinations of cards that make a certain advantage</strong> to allow you to connect the pieces necessary to make Fusion Summon. The combo <strong>changes a lot as the Draws happen</strong> so it's more about understanding the gameplay than memorizing moves.  //////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Combo 1: (Bear +

////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Comments about the presented Combos:</strong>  A very good move for you to make is to use <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a> eff or <a data-name=""Frightfur Cruel Whale"">Frightfur Cruel Whale</a> eff to <strong>destroy your own</strong> <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> to gain its Search effect and if you haven't even Normal Summoned you can add the <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> that will set the Toy Vendor back field and send <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> or <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> to the GY.  A card that works similar to what I said above is <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a>, which also can <strong>trigger eff from Search from Toy Vendor</strong> without having to spend your Normal Summon since you <strong>discard it from your hand</strong> with <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> to draw 1 card and then it comes back from the GY to the field when <strong>sending the Toy Vendor to the GY</strong> for Search eff trigger. Going Second is out of <strong>Floodgates</strong> and in Grind Game instead of <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a> add directly the monster you want you can add <a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Fluffal Bear</a> and set another <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> to use <a data-name=""Golden Lord"">Golden Lord</a> eff and with Toy Vendor add the Target you wanted with Dog having the Golden Lord on the field. But I think he <strong>will be banned from the Fusion Event Banlist</strong> so I'm not even using it in the Main Deck.  <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> is one of the last supports this deck has received over the years and is a perfect card for Fluffal's deck strategy: <strong>Spot Removal</strong> on both turns with <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a>, <strong>Combo Enabler</strong> sending <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> to GY and <strong>OTK Tool that will boost the ATK</strong> of your Fusion monsters.  <strong>Some OTK options:</strong> Making <a data-name=""Frightfur Sabre-Tooth"">Frightfur Sabre-Tooth</a> using <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> as material and giving Reborn from Kraken to the field <strong>grants you an OTK of 8400damage</strong> as Kraken can <strong>attack twice</strong> and each ""Frightfur"" fusion <strong>gains 400ATK from Sabre-Tooth</strong>.  Another way to OTK is to make <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> + <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a> which will <strong>boost 300ATK for each ""Fluffal"" and ""Frightfur""</strong> monster so you get a 600ATK boost for both and do an OTK of 8100damage. <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> using his <strong>ATK Boost effect</strong> on <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> makes him reach 3300ATK and already grants another OTK. So you can see that <a data-name=""Frightfur Kragen"">Frightfur Kraken</a> is a very strong enabler to finish the game and has synergy with the main Archetype fusions for that.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Technoplay:</strong>  ////////////////<strong>Main Deck Cards:</strong>  When you manage to Reborn GY's <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> you see how versatile he is and can use his effect to <strong>Special Summon from Hand</strong> again since it's Soft Once Per Turn(SOFT).  <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a> allows you to make a really cool move of adding <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> and returning Fluffal Dog to hand to Reborn <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> for example allowing you to <strong>make another Fusion Summon</strong> when having access to the material that was missing. Same goes for <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> set <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and Send <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> play for GY because you can add <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> with Toy Vendor. And when returning Fluffal Dog or Fluffal Dolphin you <strong>guarantee a Follow Up for the next turn</strong> to be your Normal Summon which <strong>makes Fluffal Sheep even better</strong>.  The <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> eff to set the <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> in the field if you have already used <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> eff in GY you can just send <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> to the GY and there is a <strong>very cool Trick</strong> to use the <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> effect and <strong>return a ""Fluffal "" Monster to the top of the Deck</strong> and with the <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> set by the Dolphin you <strong>Draw and Special Summon</strong> this ""Fluffal"" to be another Extender.  <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> can <strong>recycle</strong> <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a> <strong>back into the deck</strong> in Grind Game so even if you use a copy there are ways you <strong>can reuse it throughout the game</strong>. It is also a <strong>good effect to Chain Block</strong> the Fusion you bring to the field and for you to be able to resolve <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> in the Grind Game because it is necessary to have <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> in the deck to activate.  <a data-name=""Fluffal Own"">Fluffal Own</a> and <a data-name=""Fluffal Cat"">Fluffal Cat</a> are cards that will allow you to continue to <strong>do more Fusion Summon when accessing Polymerization</strong> during your turn to take control of the game. Your Opponent can use <a data-name=""Ghost Belle"">Ghost Belle</a> on the <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> effect because it banishes a Fluffal from the GY as an effect resolution and not as a cost.  <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> is one of the main pieces for you to <strong>maintain card advantage</strong> while Fusion Summoning and is a great discard also giving search <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> or <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a> or <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a>.  <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> is a kind of Hand Trap in the opponent's turn by Fusion Summoning <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> to destroy a card it controls and if you only control Cruel Whale you <strong>can protect it from destruction with Scythe's own effect in the GY</strong> then you take a card from the opponent while guaranteeing a body on the Cruel Whale table that can even use the second effect of sending <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> to the GY and you have one more Extender on your turn. The best Fluffal Monster option to use in conjunction with Edge Imp Scythe for Fusion Summon is <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> which gives you 2 Draws and 1 Discard.  <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> is Soft Once Per Turn both effects and you <strong>don't need to Special the Fluffal Monster</strong>, you can simply add it to the hand and <strong>Special Summon any other Monster</strong> in your hand. If you need <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> in the GY and you have already made <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> plays you can simply use <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> send Repair for Extender plays.  <a data-name=""Royal Penguins Garden"">Royal Penguins Garden</a> is a Continuous Spell that allows you to do excellent Combos in the deck but at this point it <strong>doesn't exist in Master Duel</strong>.  ////////////////<strong>Extra Deck Cards:</strong>  If you activate <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a> while controlling <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> you can chain its effect just to <strong>send a Fusion from the Extra Deck to the GY</strong> and be able to use it with Frightfur Fusion to make <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> without having to banish any Fusions in field guaranteeing OTK.  If you pass to the opponent with <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> and Fluffal Monster in Hand and <a data-name=""Frightfur Sabre-Tooth"">Frightfur Sabre-Tooth</a> in Field: Activate Edge Imp Scythe eff Fusion <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> (using Sabre-Tooth and Scythe and Fluffal Monster) = Sabre-Tooth(<strong>with Protection from Destruction by Battle or Card Effects</strong>) This is a way to field a monster that is very <strong>difficult for most decks to take out of the field</strong>, ensuring it survives your opponent's turn and buys you time to rejoin the game. And you can still take advantage of this protection when using the <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> effect by choosing the Saber-Tooth on your side of the field to be destroyed but as it has the protection only the opponent's card will be destroyed.  Virtually all Archetype Frightfur fusions are <strong>Soft Once Per Turn (SOFT)</strong>, that is, every time you <strong>Summon a different copy of the same card</strong>, you can <strong>use its effects again</strong> either by <strong>sending your opponent's monsters</strong> to the GY with <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a>, or continue to <strong>ATK Boost</strong> your fusions with <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a>. And this has great synergy with <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> because whenever you give Reborn from the Fusion you used to make it, that fusion can use its effects again on the field. The <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> effect to send a monster to gy <strong>doesn't allow you to attack directly with it</strong> for the rest of the turn but if <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> gives Reborn the Kraken again it will be able to give two direct atk as it is considered a different card.  <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> has the role of just bringing the <a data-name=""Frightfur Sheep"">Frightfur Sheep</a> to the field with the advantage of being <strong>treated as a Fusion Summoned Card</strong> so if you use it to make the <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> you can Reborn it back to the field and be able to attack with it and still have the <strong>Floating effect</strong> if it is destroyed by an opponent's card.

Enjoy!,"Despite the domination of the Splight archetype, Tearalaments made their own steps in the OCG and had a bit of success.  The deck's standard play revolves around normal summoning <strong>Tearalaments Reinoheart</strong>, the by using her effect <strong>Tearalaments Shaylen, Tearalaments Haufenis or Tearalaments Meiru</strong> is sent to the GY for their fusion summoning effect to activate. The usual target is <strong>Tearalaments Kitkalos </strong>who searches the trap card <strong>Tearalaments Metanoise</strong>.  Branded fusion also synergises with the archetype since it allows the player to send a Tearalaments monster to the GY and thus trigger it's effect to go for the play mentioned above.  As most meta decks, Tearalaments can also afford to run a respectable amount of handtraps. Concerning the Shaddoll monsters on the list, they are used as materials for the summon of El Shaddoll Winda, even on your opponent's main phase thanks to <strong>Tearlaments Haufenis's </strong>quick effect!"

Interestingly, the old version still managed to beat some decks at a local tournament in May 2019 probably thanks to the surprise effect of a deck composition that hadn't been used for a very long time and for which the meta wasn't prepared. This year I tried to use it again, but it was a complete disaster, the game has now a completely new rhythm and the old deck couldn't keep up without hand traps and newer and more powerful versions of some cards. The core idea is still to play in an unexpected manner w.r.t. the current meta and surprise the opponents who could not have a proper side deck to counter our strategy. <h3>Strategy:</h3> Ideally, you want on the field the <a data-name=""Inspector  Boarder"">Inspector  Boarder</a>, the <a data-name=""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"">Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</a> and/or <a data-name=""Thunder King Rai-Oh"">Thunder King Rai-Oh</a>. They need to be defended, but it's also important to use your hand traps to stop your opponents immediately before they manage to bring big monsters on the field.  A lot of drawing cards are present to allow for a constant hand refill. I am seriously considering adding one or more <a data-name=""Maxx C"">Maxx C</a> in case the deck runs out of cards too quickly (of course only if it gets unbanned).  Some <em>testing is needed</em> to understand whether the deck is balanced or it needs more defending or drawing cards.  The <strong>Extra Deck</strong> is not essential for the moment, therefore can be improved for strategic use in case of emergencies and the only useful card is the <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a>. It is important to have a full 15 cards in order to exploit the <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance.</a>  The <strong>Side Deck</strong> has counters that could be needed against specific decks. It allows focusing on removing, destroying small monsters, countering decks with a lot of summoning, countering decks using the graveyard and more. <h3>Possible edits:</h3> <ul>  	<li><strong>Among the following cards:</strong> - 1x <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a> - 3x <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> Increase PoD if you need more drawings, or remove if you need more defensive traps. Consider substituting with <a data-name=""Maxx C"">Maxx C</a>.

Inspired by Power Rangers!","  Despite the name, this is not a Dino Thunder Dragons deck. This is a Dinomorphia deck featuring two of their newest cards from Dimension Force: Dinomorphia Rexturm and Dinomorphia Frenzy! The name was inspired by Dinomorphia Frenzy's artwork, which is inspired by a scene from Power Rangers: Dino Thunder. The card was trending on Twitter at the end of 2021 because of the comparison.  &nbsp;  Twitter link: https://twitter.com/YuGiOhNewsTCG/status/1476587455637819395  &nbsp;  This deck sticks to the archetype's ""go first or burst"" strategy, but with two good tech choices for Dinomorphia. It contains two copies of Hope For Escape for some draw power, and Ferret Flames for monster removal. In fact, if your LP is low enough, Ferret Flames can be a board wipe for your opponent. The best part is that it doesn't shuffle their monsters into the deck--it forces your opponent to do that to their monsters, so this can get rid of unaffected beaters like Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon, Ancient Gear Chaos Giant, and even UCT under Misc.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

I'm just playing 48 cards so it doesn't count!</span>  <span>Okay so maybe it counts a little but I think there's a big difference in the deck that played all the best engines together to abuse only the strongest of cards and, yknow, Lightsworns. I appreciate a good chaos pile deck as much as the next guy!</span>  <span>So with Dimension Force on it's way we need to talk about the newest addition to the P.U.N.K. team: <span><a data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K. Dia Note"">Noh-P.U.N.K. Dia Note</a></span>.</span>  <span>Dia Note does something very important: Not being a level 8 monster. It can be searched and added by <span><a data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K.

This means that one <span><a data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin"">Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin</a></span> can mill 9 cards. People used to play engines just to summon <span><a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> </span>and now we have an engine (a consistent one at that!) that summons Chaos Ruler <em>and</em> <span><a data-name=""The Zombie Vampire"">The Zombie Vampire</a></span>. With <span><a data-name=""Fairy Tail - Snow"">Fairy Tail - Snow</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a></span> (anyone else keep calling it fissure?) no longer being forbidden I'd be a shame NOT to play a chaos pile deck!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Put on your overalls and grab a wrench, we're talking engines now!</span> <ul>  	<li><span><strong>P.U.N.K.</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><span>Combo Line:</span> <ol>  	<li><span>Summon Ze Amin, effect to add Foxy Tune.</span></li>  	<li><span>Foxy Tune effect to SS Dia Note.</span></li>  	<li><span>Synchro Summon Chaos Ruler, C1 Chaos Ruler C2 Dia Note to SS Foxy Tune // Mill 5</span></li>  	<li><span>Overlay both for Zombie Vampire // Mill 4</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Keep in mind that chaos pile decks are non-linear so you might do other stuff in between this.</span></li>  	<li><span>P.U.N.K.s are also the reason I'm not playing 60 cards.

NOT once per turn. If you have a stacked GY you can use her as a body on your turn, too.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong>Destrudo:</strong> Body and tuner. Can summon <span><a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""F.A. Dawn Dragster"">F.A. Dawn Dragster</a></span> with ease.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong>Called By The Grave:</strong> <span><a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></span> is good going first and even going second against Branded.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong>Handtraps:</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></span>: Generally one of the stronger handtraps. Does wonders against Branded.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">DD Crow</a></span>: Like Ghost Belle it manipulates the GY. Since it's a DARK it's better here than Belle.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a></span>: Albeit technically a worse Imperm when it comes to it's function as a handtrap, it is also a tuner and a LIGHT making it better here than Imperm.</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>The all-generic Extra Deck</span>  <span>Think of a number between 1 and 1652. Picked one? Great. I guarantee you whatever number you picked, it would still not be enough to fit all Extra Deck cards that Pile decks would like to play. (A higher number and I'd have to account for custom cards. No thank you) So these are the 15 I decided to play and here's why. Welcome to my TED Talk:</span> <ul>  	<li><span><strong>Link Monsters:</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a></span>: Used to link climb with the Chaos Dragons.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a></span>: Used to summon Knightmare Phoenix on your opponent's turn and puts Snow back into the GY.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></span>: Used to link climb or to summon Sharakusai to Synchro Summon on your opponent's turn. It's other effect can be used for Desert Locust (I'll refer to the card later).</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a></span>: Spins a card from your opponent.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a></span>: Multiple monster effect negates. It never hurts to use your first badge of resources for her. If you can, use Chaos Ruler before going into Zombie Vampire and summon it back with its effect, then it won't get banished if you overlay it for Zombie Vampire later.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a></span>: Used to secure game.</span></li>  	<li><span><em>Closing Thoughts:</em> Each of them is very important. I really cut it down to the necessities. If I could I'd play more. <span><a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a></span> for example is great, especially after Vampire Zombie milled cards for your opponent.</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul>  	<li><strong><span>XYZ Monsters:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn</a></span>: Used to flex your price card to let everyone know your either crazy good or crazy rich. Oh it also mills 3 and might draw you some cards, too.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""The Zombie Vampire"">The Zombie Vampire</a></span>: Mills 4 cards and summons you another body. Depending on your opponent's deck this can either really mess them up or help them greatly. But we're all Dopamine addicts so don't even pretend you'd hesitate for even a second to use it's effect even against the worst matchup possible.</span></li>  	<li><span><em>Closing Thoughts</em>: Again I kept it at minimum to overcompensate with Synchro Monsters. Definitely play both. <span><a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a></span> are fantastic additions to your lineup. </span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul>  	<li><strong><span>Synchro Monsters:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Desert Locust"">Desert Locust</a></span>: Loops a card out of your opponent's hand and can then summon Fleur with Snow or Amazing Dragon with Dawn Dragster after it's used its effect.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""F.A. Dawn Dragster"">FA Dawn Dragster</a></span>: It's a Spell/Trap negate that can be made with Destrudo and almost any monster.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a></span>: Can mill Snow and then also used for another Synchro Summon, etc.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a></span>: Used to mill cards and adds a card to hand.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a></span>: You have plenty of tuners, non-tuners, level 4 monsters and links in the GY so this is an easy omni negate. <span>// <span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a></span> is a great budget option as long as you get Halq into the GY (and then not banish it with Snow..obviously).</span></span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a></span>: There're surprisingly many ways to make a level 10 Synchro and this one is simply the strongest one. <span>// For a budget option I'd choose <span><a data-name=""Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"">Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying</a></span>. It has near infinite attack after using Snow once or twice, protection and has great removal. There's plenty of removal already that's why I'd prefer Fleur.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon"">Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon</a></span>: It can bounce 1-2 cards or extend when going for lethal.</span></li>  	<li><span><em>Closing Thoughts:</em> As you can see I'm playing a whole lot of Synchro monsters for a whole lot of different board states. Chaos pile decks are very non-linear but you could technically remove Desert Locust, Fleur and Amazing Dragon for more Link or XYZ monsters. I recommend keeping the other ones!</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Once again I have to mess with the Side Deck to get the right tags. Can we please bring choosing tags back? :')</span>"

The goal is to be a midrange deck that consistently puts Chengying on the table with multiple ways to trigger him, and hopefully tools to protect him. I'm still on DPE, but I also don't think you can pass up the consistency granted by Halq - Auroradon. That combo is also super flexible here, ending on either Yazi to set up Swordsoul plays with Auroradon and Yazi, or Denglong + Draco Berserker, in addition to the option of just making Verte when you need it. I think DPE is too important to cut in a Chengying based version, since it can trigger Chengying in a pinch and works neatly with Torrential Tribute as well, but I also think in a lot of situations you're either hoping to draw Fusion Destiny and make Halq plays, or else you're negated into infinity and make DPE in desperation - these are both still good plays I think the deck needs access to. It also offers a line that plays under Nib, although I'm not hyper impressed by that or scared by Nib. Still nice.  This version of the deck is a midrange trap(ish) version focusing on the grind game, and on making Wyrm monsters. There simply wasn't enough space for the actual essentials and all of the tech choices I wanted to run, so instead it is greedy as all hell, and hoping to go first. Having said that, Solemns are still good going second, and Swordsoul can sure break boards, you bet your bippy.  This deck is good, not terrifying, but very strong, and forms of it (Wrym piles basically) are probably going to be good for quite a while. It is also the kind of deck that will likely continue to randomly top events even when it is not good, and will also likely have more than one heyday, if I had to guess, just on the basis of Wyrm synchro piles having such good support already. Denglong is probably not essential, but I like the idea of running it as an alternative in the Auroradon combo. But you could do as well or better with Herald of the Arc Light, which also has a floodgate effect - still, this is a counter trap, so that's pretty good. Or you could just not have that line of play and instead focus on diversity and tech calls - there is space. But for the way I like to play Swordsoul, I need a 16 card extra deck, and whatever I cut will hurt. So we're pretty pure, at least in terms of how we end babeee.  Still doing some tuning. Denglong setups exist, but don't come up, and O-Lion is less of a brick than Nine Pillars, so Denglong is out, and Herald is in. I think it is time to unban this card in the TCG if it exists and Wyrm Synchro doesn't want to play it. You could run 3 Ecclesia and 1 Mo-ye for the same number of ""starters"", and you'd see Ecclesia more often going second, but it seems brickier, not as good at grinding, and especially bricky going first. I like these ratios a lot. You could run 2 Tour Guide for more 1 card starts, but I'm okay with most of my openings requiring 2 cards to start, and 1 Tour Guide seems totally fine, especially since the Rota is also a less restrictive 1 card start."
