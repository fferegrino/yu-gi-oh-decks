The Ligthsworn engine gets cards in the grave, like Breakthrough Skill and Eldlich support cards since they have grave effects. Raiden, Lyla, and Lumina are the only Lightsworns you need, Lyla to pop back rows if any but she is a decent 4-star beatstick that mills, Raiden mills, and is a 4-star tuner for Synchro plays. Lumina is to help recycle your Lightsworns. Eldlich is your main guy to get out and the deck is decided to bring him out as quickly as possible."

Fairly new to yugioh but I'm just applying what I've learned from videos and other ,"I tried to avoid bricky starting hands as much as possible, but I guess that's pretty hard to do with a dark magician deck. I believe it just follows standard Dark Magician meta: I will usually use Magician's Rod to search for Dark Magical Circle unless I see a potential combo (?) for Secrets of Dark Magic to then activate another spell for the draw effect, or if I can use Magicians' Soul to send a Dark Magician/Girl to the GY then I'll search Soul Servant for the extra draw(s) (honestly even if I'm not using  Magician's Rod to search that I will usually try to do that Soul Servant move anyways if I don't know what else to play). I will also use the Rod to search for Eternal Soul or Navigation if I already have a Dark Magician in my hand/GY and a Dark Magical Circle on the field.  If I don't have Dark Magical Circle readily accessible then I try to use Bond Between Teacher and Student just to get Dark Burning Magic (hence my 1 copy of Dark Magician Girl). Usually in this case I would have used Magicians' Soul to get my Dark Magician on the field. If I have Eternal Soul out at that point then I will almost always use Secrets of Dark Magic if I can, just in case the Eternal Soul gets destroyed.  If I can't get a combo started I special summon Apprentice Illusion Magician, just to get Dark Magician in my hand at least and just barely reduce my chances of getting a bricky draw on the next turn, but sometimes I also use her discard effect to send a Dark Magician to the GY and then use Soul Servant to get another draw (usually to search and draw Eternal Soul or Dark Magical Circle if I already have Eternal Soul). Otherwise, she's a way for me to at least get a monster on the field. As for my other spells, I use 1 copy of  The Eye of Timaeus to use Dark Magician the Dragon Knight (or the DMG version if I am absolutely desperate I guess) and 1 Illusion Magic for chain blocking or just a way to get Dark Magician into my hand, as well as 1 Magicalized Fusion for an emergency fusion though I will usually try to save it for Quintet Magician.  For traps I will of course abuse the living heck out of Eternal Soul and Magician Navigation with Dark Magical Circle for the banish during my opponents turn as soon as they summon a threatening monster or use a scary spell (will usually use Navigation first to get a negate set up on my next turn and also because Eternal Soul is a little risky, but I'll use Eternal Soul if I have to summon from the GY). I feel like 2:2 is a pretty decent ratio for that? I do pretty decently with that at least. I also do 2:2 for Solemn Judgment and Solemn Strike. I only use Strike for interrupts and Judgment (usually) if I feel like the card they just played could potentially dismantle my board, which usually just means I keep Judgment there to protect Eternal Soul. I play 2:2 for Infinite Impermanence and Ash Blossom for my standard handtraps (I used to run Imperm at 3 but it's been feeling kind of useless lately. Finally for the traps I used 3 Crackdowns cause I've found those to just be stupid useful stall cards. I usually wait until they summon a Link/Fusion/Synchro/Xyz monster thats pretty powerful or has a scary effect and then I steal it right away, and it's also useful for my link summons.  For my extra deck, I will usually go for Ebon Illusion Magician for the additional banish effect, for a pretty fun (and I'd imagine annoying) double banish if I have Dark Magical Circle out. Or if I'll do that link climb I learned from Team Samurai's video using Dracossack to for the 2 tokens &gt; I:P Masquerena &gt; Knightmare Unicorn (then use the discard effect if I can) &gt; Accesscode Talker for banish and then OTK if I can. I learned that Geonator Transverser is a potential out to Red-Eyes Dragoon from one of Trif's videos, but I haven't had the chance to use it yet in case I ever need to summon Magicians' Soul for the draw effect without any plans to link climb (which I haven't done yet but its there just in case), and I also have the same mentality for Link Spider. Lastly I have Predaplant Verte Anaconda in case I need to copy Magicalized Fusion for an emergency fusion (I'm almost certain it can be used for Quintet Magician if I have enough spellcasters in the GY but I haven't been able to use to use that yet).  As you can see, I'm not using a spellbook engine so I'm not using Crowley, although if you guys think I should switch some cards out for a spellbook engine, as I said in the short deck summary I am fairly new to yugioh so I would appreciate any possible tips for improvement. Also since I am pretty new, I only know cards from other deck profiles and cards that I've encountered in duels. I have considered throwing in a copy or 2 of Foolish Burial Goods for my Soul Servants but I'm not 100% on which cards I want to switch out.

Dogmatika is very consistent and Albaz gives it a strength to remove enemy cards easily  <strong>Monsters</strong>  <strong>Fleurdelis:</strong> Easy to invoke + Negation is easily searchable with Ecclesia or Ash  <strong>Maximus:</strong> 1 for 2  <strong>Albaz: </strong>Core of the deck, easy fusion in any turn is quite good and synergy with most things  <strong>Ecclesia:</strong> Searcher  <strong>Armageddon: </strong>Send Albaz to the GY to be used later  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  <strong>Splind: </strong>You can use the opponent's weak monsters - Give a destruction every turn  <strong>Brigrand: </strong>Remove Big Monsters - Protect Others  <strong>Ash: </strong>Big Monsters - Even so, you will almost always throw it to look for a monster  <strong>Albion: </strong>Something niche but you can do it yourself - Look for the Spell / Trap  <strong>Skull Knight: </strong>Destroy Monsters  <strong>Skull Wagon: </strong>Destroy Spell / Trap  <strong>N'tss: Immediate Destruction</strong>  <strong>Omega: </strong>Resource Recovery  <strong>Wind Pegasus: </strong>Remove things easily  <strong>Spell/Trap</strong>  <strong>Nadir Servant: </strong>Searcher and Miller (Pretty Ban)  <strong>Fusion Conscription: </strong>Search Albaz for opponent turn  <strong>Stigmata of White: </strong>Like a Fusion Spell also recovery  <strong>Stigmata Ominous Cry: </strong>Reborn the big boys also recovery  <strong>Judgment of Stigmata: </strong>Good destruction also recovery  <strong>Dogmatika Encounter: </strong>Really usefull card to Fusion Summon in opponent turn or recover the dogmatika stuff  <strong>Other Things</strong>  <strong>Ash, Duality, Called, Dragon's Prision,Trap Trick: </strong>Good Staples  <strong>Other Options</strong>  Dogmatika: Ashiyan is easy recover, Adin is a boy for me, Nation is protect, Genesis is a interesting trap, Punishment is  destruction +Mill but blocks extra.  Invoked: You know how this works  The Dragons: Feel free to use more copies for this dragons, personally i think one dragon is ok  Others:Ogre is Staple, Toadally is infinte, Pinpoint dash is really good trap with Dogmatika  <strong>Thing you should Know</strong>  If you have the option to summon maximus, remember not to mil Ash first because you can also mill it with maximus.  Duality is often used on a turn where you want to use Albaz on the opponent turn.  Stigmata traps are not that great, I usually prefer to use them as Albaz cost.  I need to say how good Encounter is?!?! It's so easy to search, it lets you interrupt plays, Resource Recovery, it's just brutal.  <strong>Upcoming decks?</strong>  <strong>Kaiju Hero:</strong> It is a deck that I use recently, I think it would be a good idea to upload it.  <strong>Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx:</strong> I just saw the card and I loved it, I hope to find a way to use it in a deck.  <strong>True Draco Crystal:</strong> Crystal girl is good at True Draco, I'm not a fan of this one but I liked the combination.  <strong>Remake of the Best Fusion Deck:</strong> With the new Fossil suport, my Fusion Toolbox looks better, I'll only want to see if Invoke dogde this next banlist.  &nbsp;  If you would like to see one of this deck, dont forget to help."

Why do I like this deck?  Well you see the reason why I chosen phantasm spiral is because of pacifis and the torrential tribute searcher as that just allows you to keep on generating more and more advantage.  This deck is so consistent and you are probably never going to get otk'd becuase of cards such as heat wave.  Phantasm Spiral Battle is also a spell or trap removal type card.  The deck doesn't care about vfd since all the monsters I play in this deck are normal monsters.  <span>Neat Plays You Can do with this deck:</span>  <span>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=707731-24882478 </span>  <span>Anything you want to ask about this deck, join my discord server:</span>  https://discord.gg/yxCsb2Egz8  Hopefully you have lots of fun, feel free to leave any suggestions but I do believe this is the format for this deck since it has got everything combat the current meta game."

May the biggest, most badass dragon win! ","This is a pure Odd-Eyes Dragons archetype deck with some stables that you can swap for whatever you like. The main strategy is to special summon a bunch of high ATK dragons to quickly kill your opponents. It can adapt to some varieties of situations but absolutely suffer from anything that specifically designed to kill/limit spell cards. <p class=""p1""><strong>Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon</strong> is the key card to bring out almost any monsters in the deck. You can trigger it by eff of <strong>Sky Iris</strong>, <strong>Spiral Flame Strike</strong>, T<strong>win Twisters</strong>, and <strong>Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon</strong> or slamming your Odd-Eyes into an opponent monster. This deck provides 13-17 cards to get it. However, it has no protection and has to rely on Omni-negate and/or ordering chain-link for that. You can use <strong>Odd-Eyes Wizard Dragon</strong> and/or <strong>Persona</strong>/<strong>Mirage</strong> <strong>Dragon</strong> to add another chain-link to protect it from negate-destruction on triggered.</p> It's easy to properly bring out <strong>Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</strong> (and then recycled it) on 70% of the opening hands, provided that you're not negated in the important chain, by Special Summoning <strong>Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver</strong>. You can also cheat it out with the eff of <strong>Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</strong>, note that it's very easy to miss timing Vortex's eff <strong>when</strong> it's special summoned.  Stack <strong>Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon - Overlord</strong> on <strong>Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon</strong> to get 3 attacks. If you have an opening scale when it's destroyed, you can place it in the pendulum zone and if you're on MP1, you can then Special Summon <strong>Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon</strong> to finish your opponent HP.  <strong>Odd-Eyes Raging Dragon</strong> is mostly there to be material for <strong>Odd-Eyes</strong> <strong>Fusion</strong>, or to beat something with its 3000 ATK and then bring out <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong> if you ran out of other XYZ monsters or they all get banished with <strong>Pot of Extravagance</strong>. You can swap it with another copy of Vortex or Rebellion, or left it in the side deck because its effect can only be used with <strong>Xiangke Magician</strong>. Tbh, I just left it in because I think it looks very badass.  &nbsp;"

A good Odd-Eyes engine can increase consistency, comeback, protection, and aggressiveness of this deck, it helps turbo goliath out and even triggers infection, plus it adds a series of beaters and more win conditions.</span>  I sided some amorphages for matchup purposes (they all lock different things, some of the things they lock show up more than others so I mained those and sided the others except pride, pride is bad, never play it)  I've been bugged with the question of can amorphage be good or at least viable? If you have any ideas of how to make the amorphages better I'll be more than happy to try them out!"

Fix that w,"The general strat for this is to control and beatdown your opponent as fast as possible, either from using Danger's to help with the Puppet XYZs, or to cheat puppets into the grave for further XYZ. Realistically you will only last a maximum of 7 turns before decking yourself and bricking is always possible, but as long as you have A Danger!  along with 2 puppets you should be fine. For easy field clears priorities either Number C40 or Number C107 with Galaxy-Eye Full Armour Photon Dragon for single target removal.

The deck is meant to be fairly adaptable; they're two copies of the three God Cards and the one you'll want to focus on during the duel depends heavily on the state of the game; if you're opponent has a powerful ""boss monster"" that you want to get rid of, then you'll want to focus on summoning Obelisk to beat over it, or Ra to destroy it with its effect. If you want to slow down your opponent, then you'll want to focus on summoning Slifer the Sky Dragon. Out of all the Egyptian Gods, Obelisk is the one you want to special summon the most since he has baseline ATK and DEF and inherent protection; The True Name (combined with Card Advance) allows you to special summon Obelisk right from the deck, and Monster Reborn is meant to revive Obelisk for a powerful attack before he returns to the Graveyard. The Absolute Divine Beast can be used to revive Obelisk so that he shield you or your monsters from an attack from one of your opponent's strong monsters. However the primary purpose of The Absolute Divine Beast is allowing the God Cards to dominate the field. The primary purpose of Monster Reborn (besides the fact that I think the Ankh is freaking cool) is to revive Obelisk, or previously used tribute fodder for the summon of another Egyptian God. This deck's main weakness is bricking, and with a lack of conventional stall cards this deck can't hold out for long if it can't get its momentum going. Having said that, the amount of search power this deck has, combined with how easily its monsters can be summoned, makes this God Card deck quite consistent and a lot of fun to play."

The Normalcy strategy allows to play a ton of haymaker cards like Justi Break while opening up access to first of the Dragons which the Story duelists will struggle to overcome. Blue Dragon Summoner massively improves the consistency of setting your scales and summoning more monsters. This will hopefully help in getting started without needing to spend DP early to build a deck.

If you want to slow your opponent down, then you'll want to focus on summoning Slifer. Out of all the Egyptian Gods, Obelisk is the one you want to special summon the most since he has baseline ATK and DEF and inherent protection; The True Name (combined with Card Advance) allows you to special summon right from the deck, and Monster Reborn is meant to revive Obelisk for a powerful attack before he returns to the Graveyard. The Absolute Divine Beast can be used to revive Obelisk so that he shield you or your monsters from an attack from one of your opponent's strong monsters. However the primary purpose of The Absolute Divine Beast is allowing the God Cards to dominate the field."

Deck still operates the same with some alter to the combo because no O-Lion in TCG. We need to maximize the search for Stromberg, even have to use Set Rotation with Mid-Breaker Field (Auroradon, Dragoon, Immortal Phoenix Gearfried, and our combo endboard don't use targeting anyway). The Borreload Savage + Herald Arc Light are just my preferred endboard, but some VW/Drytron can push it. It's better to end on VFD instead (all Halq combo is able to end on VFD).  Pros: Super consistent, powerful endboard, stronger in TCG because can use Dragoon.  Cons: Fragile to handtrap, especially without Crossout Designator."

Eternal Soul and Circle are the bread and butter of the deck.  this deck is mainly based on being a pure build with as little help from other stratergies as possible. (I find them more fun that way) I use Ash Blossom personally because of how generic it is as a negate and hits most decks. Yes as the norm for DM Decks at the moment, Verte Anaconda, Red-Eyes fusion and Dragoon are here, however it is not the main stratergy of my deck. I use the Spellbook draw engine over cards like Allure Of Darkness because of the downside of Allure aswell as the Spellbook Engine deck thins allowing me to get to the key combo pieces quickly.  Dark Magician Girl is a marmite subject among DM players, However in my opinion the upsides of being able to utilize The Dark Magicians floating effect and a extra draw off of Soul Servant is too good to ignore in my personal opinion. Bond and Dark Burning magic have been a tech in my tech since their release, apart from Burning Magic being my favorite card, it has won me games more times then i can count purely because nobody expects it. However, ido understand why people choose not to run it.  As for tech cards and side deck its up to you what cards you want to run. Dark Magic Veil is a good card for this deck, allowing you to summon from your hand or from the GY to summon up those powerful Dark Spellcasters. I like Secret Village as it always works well with a spellcaster deck. The solemns cards are brilliant. I find myself going between Solemn Strike and Solemn Judgement but at the moment i find myself wanting solemn strikes. The virus cards are also very well suited to a DM deck. One of My personal favorite techs is Dark Renewel, basically acting as a Solemn Strike and riding the feild of your opponents monster but giving you a summon from the GY or Deck at the same time."

You have cards that you can drop to go more aggressive like nib for galactic and melody for shrine or going second cards like ruler no more and free galaxy lod tribute.  You play this deck simply by special summoning a bunch of photons until your opponent runs out of negates or you make at minimum one rank 8 to break boards easily(i.e steal a monster than pop a card then use the stolen monster to make more shenanegans), you have 6 hand traps so youll likely hit at least a nib or imperm to slow them down, and as long as you dont draw utter dog you can play through one or more hand traps usually** nib is still rough but no one really knows when to nib you so youre normally able to cheat out more specials or finally use your normal plus the nib token to pop off.  &nbsp;  Things that are alil different here,  The melodys, 3 trade-in, and 3 trance. I run the 3 trance because of the two previous cards. The third trade in because of the 2 melody and the 2 melody because you dont actually want to run 3 afterglow since its only really a special summon once per turn and you really want to have a solid way to get your GEP dragon to hand or even galactic if you need to.  &nbsp;  I considered galactic main and am not opposed to it, it seems nutty especially when you can get your afterglow and photon dragon plus some extra minions then shrine and get a 5 man board of level 8s for 3 rank 8s (using afterglow second effect) and four if you count draglubion (i dont i just use it for otk)"

 So the main combo this deck uses is <a data-name=""crimson resonator"">crimson resonator</a> and a lv 4 monster  First use crimson ef to special itself from hand, then normal summon the lv 4 monster (special summon it if you can)  Synchro summon <a data-name=""red rising dragon"">red rising dragon</a>  Use rising ef to special back crimson  Use crimson ef to special <a data-name=""synkron resonator"">synkron resonator</a> and <a data-name=""creation resonator"">creation resonator</a> from your deck  Synchro summon <a data-name=""red supernova dragon"">red supernova dragon</a><a data-name=""red supernova dragon""> using rising, crimson, synkron, and creation</a>  Syknron ef add back creation (or crimson if your hand is absolute trash)  &nbsp;  That is the basic combo, and you can go further if you have certain cards in hand  All the lv4's I chose can get themself out of your hand easily or search a card that can special summon itself <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""wandering king wildwind"">wandering king wildwind</a><a data-name=""wandering king wildwind""> specials itself from hand</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""witch of the black forest"">witch of the black forest</a><a data-name=""witch of the black forest""> searches wildwind</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""performage hat tricker"">performage hat tricker</a><a data-name=""performage hat tricker""> specials itself from hand</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""performage damage juggler"">performage damage juggler</a><a data-name=""performage damage juggler""> searches tricker</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""stygian street patrol"">stygian street patrol</a><a data-name=""stygian street patrol""> honestly doesnt do either, but can help later in the game</a></li> </ul> So if you have a way to put 2 lv 4's on field <ul>  	<li>witch</li>  	<li>juggler</li>  	<li>wildwind + any lv 4</li>  	<li>juggler + any lv 4</li> </ul> You can do the following combo  First use crimson ef to special itself from hand, then summon 1 lv 4 monster  Synchro summon <a data-name=""red rising dragon"">red rising dragon</a>  Use rising ef to special back crimson  Use crimson ef to special <a data-name=""synkron resonator"">synkron resonator</a> and <a data-name=""creation resonator"">creation resonator</a> from your deck  Summon the other lv 4 monster  Synchro summon <a data-name=""red rising dragon"">red rising dragon</a>  Use rising ef to special back crimson  Synchro summon <a data-name=""red supernova dragon"">red supernova dragon using rising, crimson, synkron, and creation</a>  Use synkron ef to add back creation  Special creation from hand  Synchro summon <a data-name=""hot red dragon archfiend abyss"">hot red dragon archfiend abyss</a><a data-name=""hot red dragon archfiend abyss""> with creation and a rising dragon</a>  &nbsp;  Those are your main combos from turn 1  Now after turn 1, to put more damage on board, if you have abyss on field  Special synkron resonator (either from hand or from grave with rising ef)  Synchro summon <a data-name=""hot red dragon archfiend bane"">hot red dragon archfiend bane</a><a data-name=""hot red dragon archfiend bane""> with abyss and synkron</a>  Synkron ef add back creation  Bane ef tribute creation special abyss  &nbsp;

 HALP I GOT HAND TRAPPED!!! <ul>  	<li>This deck realy can't bait out handtraps, imperm or veiler on crimson/rising or ash on crimson just kills your play</li>  	<li>ALWAYS bait out ash with desires, even if your hand is perfectly fine, ashing crimson hurts too much</li>  	<li>TTT DOES NOT HELP <ul>  	<li>the issue is not drawing more cards, it's that they've stuffed your ONLY starter</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>just kinda hope they're stupid</li>  	<li>if its past turn 1 and they nib you with red reign set, you can use red reign to protect one of your monsters</li> </ul> Late game <ul>  	<li>this deck is fairly decent in late game <ul>  	<li>wildwind, juggler, red reign, stygian, and rising all have good grave effects that kind of let you play from your grave</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>I would consider adding 3 avarice just because you tend to run out of resonators in deck</li> </ul> Just somethings to keep in mind while playing the deck: <ul>  	<li>When you deal damage with abyss and bane, USE THEIR EFFECTS <ul>  	<li>pulling resonators out of your grave often lets you put more big cards on field</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>I said it before but wildwind LOCKS you into synchros</li>  	<li><a data-name=""resonator command"">resonator command adds ANY LV 4 OR LOWER FIEND</a> <ul>  	<li>including wildwind and stygian</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>crimson resonator can only use its effect to special from deck if the ONLY OTHER MONSTER you control is a dark dragon synchro <ul>  	<li>that means that you can't summon the other lv 4 from hand before using crimson resonator, make sure to use crimson resonator then summon your lv 4</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Synkron resonator ADDS A RESONATOR BACK TO HAND <ul>  	<li>this is invaluable for contuning combos and not running out of resources</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>King calamity can be used on your own turn to stuff out your opponents backrow and guarantee an OTK</li> </ul>"
