So, to celebrate I'm releasing this powerful deck that I got in Yugioh Nexus. Now while doing some research I have come across that the Elemental Lords and Elementsabers aren't that good anymore! Which inspired me to make a powerful one that is still Pure so here you go!!! Enjoy HEROes!!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Stats:  -All in all the deck works itself out but i recommend you look over your cards and become acquainted with them and their abilities first. My personal favorite combo would be using the Elementsaber's Graveyard ability to alter their attributes especially while Level 6 <a data-name=""Elementsaber Lapauila Mana"">Elementsaber Lapauila Mana</a> is out so that her effects will protect you in whatever way you see necessary  (Earth and Wind protects all your monsters from battle, Fire and Water protects you from your monsters being destroyed by card effects, and finally Light and Dark prevents the opponent from even targeting your monsters with card effects which is good for shuffling effects) <p><em><strong>*Important: The Graveyard attribute change only lasts until the end phase so get your stuff done!*</strong></em></p>"

But to be honest, every deck that cannot crap out at least 3 boss monster nowadays is considered bad. But I must say, I like the concept a lot, kind of gives an extra reason to set a monster. And over the years, daddy Konami decided to release some flip support in form of the Prediction princesses, sure the effect monster prediction princisses aren't that great, but their ritual monster, Tarotrei, makes flip decks very playable again. Not like on a meta basis, but for some fun games with a friend, it's more than okay, which my deck ""channel"" is all about. But why exactly does Tarotrei help the deck? Well let me explain! Tarotrei is a Lv 9 fairy ritual monster, that is able to special summon a flip monster from the hand or the graveyard in face down DEF. She also has a quick effect which allows you to change any monsters battle position ( that can be targeted)  from face up attack to face down defense position and vice versa. This allows you to exploit most of the existing flip monsters preeeety easily. A good example for that would be pot of the forbidden. And with this Ritual monster, you can add a lot of power and consistency to any flip deck.  And this my friends leads me to talk about this deck.  A Tindangle deck. So for all of you that don't know the effects of the Tindangle monsters, don't worry, this deck isn't known by many, I myself didn't knew about them until a few months ago. Tindangle is one of these decks that do not exactly have a strategy, which means the effects are kind of all over the place. They kind of have a ""main"" monster, which would be the ""Base gardna"". SOME of the monsters like trinity and acute Cerberus work with it, but not all, which makes you kind of think ""Why the heck do these cards have base gardna included in their effect??"" A good thing about base gardna is though that it makes this deck able to not only set 1 monster, no no, you can set a monster AND special summon a monster in defense position with a weird written effect! waaaat. To bad that their main link monster is a link-3 Monster xD  But to be serious right now, even though the Tindangle monsters have all pretty weird effects, it's not at all a bad archetype. It has a lot of very good spam plays, especially with the support of Tarotrei. And with the fact that they will get a new monster (with a name I can't in buddas sake pronounce) , the future looks pretty good for tindangle. For the end of this post, let's address a good first and second turn play!  Hand: Pre-prep, Tindangle protector, Pot of the forbidden, bottomless, burial goods,Tindangle intruder ( Just an example hand )  -activate pre-prep, search Tarotrei and ritual spell -Ritual summon Tarotrei using a pot of the forbidden -activate burial goods and send nagel's protection to the the graveyard -banish nagel's protection from the grave and add another copy from your deck to the hand. - set protector -set bottomless During endphase, special pot of the forbidden from the grave, via Tarotrei. This triggers Intruder in the grave, which specials itself face down.  During your opponents turn, you have a lot of options to gain plus or interrupt him -Flip protector with tarotrei, activate its effect and flip intruder. Thanks to protector, you can add now two Tindangle monsters from your Deck to the hand and thanks to intruders effect, you can add a third one. - Do the same thing but flip thanks to intruder pot of the forbidden as well and activate one of his effects ( draw 2) - Flip only Pot of the forbidden, and draw 2 card, nuce the opponents board or bouce all of your opponents spell and traps - Flip your opponents monster face down thanks to Tarotrei  Thanks to everyone that read this profile. I am so grateful for all the people who have shown interest in my previous profiles. Honestly, this makes yugioh a lot more fun for me, and you guys keep this happy feeling going. See you in my next profile! PEACE&#x270c;&#x270c;  &nbsp; <div id=""mceu_35"" class=""mce-flow-layout-item mce-last mce-resizehandle""></div>"

So get ready cuz' it's HEROtime!!!  (","Okay... Here is my HEROtime!!! deck. When I made this deck I really wanted to do a Neo-Spacian/ Masked HERO deck but I couldn't find one online and if I did it wasn't as pure as I prefer my decks so I decided to make one on my own which was the last thing I wanted because I'm usually bad at making decks but I had it down after multiple testings and my knowledge on HEROes made it much easier than originally anticipated.  <em><strong>BTW if your worried about the lack of Links, don't be because with this deck I've come across that you really don't need them.</strong></em>  Anyhow the deck is actually REALLY Good as I rarely lose with it which is surprising in most HERO decks nowadays. However, this deck isn't COMPLETELY Meta-Proof (but no deck is so whateves).  &nbsp;  I'm not going to recommend combos as limiting yourself to 1 to 2 combos in this deck will limit your chance of <strong>OPTIMAL FUN AND SUCCESS. </strong>Although there are a few that have gotten me out of jams alot such as;  &nbsp;  -<a data-name=""Vision HERO Vyon"">Vision HERO Vyon</a> effect sends <a data-name=""Destiny HERO Malicious"">Destiny HERO Malicious</a> to grave. Then play Malicious's effect summoning another Malicious then activate <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> to summon <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon </a>to your field and go from there.  You see this deck usually works itself out for you. While in a tight spot when all hope seemed lost iv'e drawn the right card like I was in the friggin' anime (which gives you an awesome feeling btw XD)  &nbsp;  Anyway enjoy and stay HEROic!!!"

Crusadia Thunder Guardragon Deck Profile,"Alright guys, I just got back from the Pro-Play Tour Philadelphia from this past weekend and I got Top 16 with Danger! Crusadia Thunder. I haven't posted a Danger Thunder deck on here yet so I figured I'd share my deck profile with you guys. This deck is crazy good and I explain most of the combos in my deck profile which I will leave the link for below. I only lost to Magical Muskets in the Top 16 because game 3 he opened 2 Mystic Mines and I could only negate one with Hope Harbinger and I kept in Sekka's Light because I didn't expect him to side in Mystic Mine even though I should have expected it. I should have sided in Twin Twisters but I messed up. Otherwise I did really well with the deck. I feel like with the mega tins coming around the corner this deck won't be as good and I may want to switch to Pure Thunder or something more control based like Sky Strikers. Anyways I hope you guys like the deck and the deck profile, thanks for all the support.  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiILcKW2KkM</a>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  My Danger Thunder deck profile"

The idea is to use the Danger engine to draw more cards and have more chance to search key cards when rapidly having several monsters of different types to summon Folgo, Justice Fur Hire anc concretise your board. The little Shaddoll engine is usefull to consistantly have a free monster when starting second and send monsters from your deck to the graveyard so you can suppress 1 backrow card, draw 1 card or set up the graveyard to abuse Mayhem Fur Hire's capacity of restart loops, or just contribute to lock the opponent turn to better OTK if starting first.  So basically the main goal is the same but you can make more defensive boards if starting first and handle more easily the opponent's board if starting second.  &nbsp;  We run a classic Fur Hire package with specific ratios made to consistantly have different types and names of monsters spam the board and add the danger and shaddol engines. The level 4 or less Fur Hires have a common effect : you can trigger it's first effect to special summon a Fur Hire with different name from your hand and when another Fur Hire monster is special summoned while it's on the board you can trigger a once per turn second effect. That's why Danger engine has a double utility, you can draw cards and generate extenders while recycling your hand and turbo summon Folgo even under hand traps. The higher Fur Hires can't special summon their comrades but directly trigger a generally good effect when special summoned. So the little Fur Hire monsters can tuto, boost all Fur Hire monsters, loot your hand (draw and discard), reborn, destroy face up or set cards, or even recycle cards so you can ensure solid boards with any starting position. The higher Fur Hires can banish cards from the graveyard, trigger a Pot Of Duality-like effect without restriction or make you gain LP, knowing that Wiz and Rafale have negate effects to strike spell/traps and monster's effects respectively.  The Danger engine is quite classical, we don't run too much to ensure the deck's consistancy but enough to currently have them in fair number in starting hands. They almost all share types with Fur Hire but don't generate excessive ratios. We play only one Tsuchinoko to run 2 Mothman because it add the insect type to the deck to better summon Folgo, and Tsuchinoko is the only one Danger monster of the deck that don't act like a cycling card if it discards itself. Finally the draw added effect following their special summon is an excellent way to access needed cards and potentially debrick a hand.  The minimal Shaddoll engine can complete a going first board with one of the 3 control effect fusion Shaddoll monsters (generally Winda to totally lock a turn in combination with Rafale and/or Wiz and potentially monsters like Abyss Dweller and OTK the next turn). When going second, as you will often face extra deck summoned monsters, Shaddoll Fusion will consist on a free monster with the ability of sending the 2 shaddoll monsters to the graveyard directly from the deck and destroy a backrow card + draw 1 to easily summon Folgo, potentially gain access to key monsters and ensure boards by handling annoying cards. Generally Shaddoll Fusion is a good first move if starting second to potentially bait a hand trap or a negate effect on the field.  To support these cards we play 2 Pot Of Desire to have a free draw 2 cards in a deck that just can get rid of even monsters like Rafale thanks to it's capacity of summoning control monsters or going for OTKs with Borrelsword and other beatsticks. Mayhem Fur Hire allows you to better recover from a disruptive destruction effect and fully abuse the Dangers first effect to enhance or restart loops. Reinforcement Of The Army tuto Beat, Bladesman Fur Hire tha have a tuto effect himself and add a lot of spam potential to your hand. Called By The Grave protects you from hand traps and can simply slow down the opponent by striking a key effect in the graveyard if not used during the first turn, and Ash Blossom soften the boards by locking tuto and cycling effects when going second.  Here we can enjoy Nibiru, The Primal Being that is a deadly weapon against a lot of spaming decks like Guardragons versions and add the rock type to your monsters. Touching this card when going second means a lot of consistant OTKs against a fair number of non-control decks and allows the deck to handle some of it's hardest match ups. We don't play 3 main deck due to this card's bricky tendency but have a third in side to struggle against Guardragons and Pendulums  &nbsp;  The extra deck is a little more specialized due to the particular engines we run main deck. Folgo, Justice Fur Hire is an excellent card that can't be used as link material and requires 3 monsters of different types to summon, but these restrictions won't be a problem for this deck. When he is summoned you can summon a Fur Hire with a different type of it's material from the deck and when an opponent's card is destroyed by any way you can draw 1 card, or even 3 when having at least 3 Fur Hire monsters (including himself) to reform a complete hand and go for extra link and xyz summons. To trigger this effect more easily we run a classic Knightmare package that can directly destroy 1 opponent's card and even potentially discard a Danger monster, and the xyz 7 Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossac that creates 2 tokens and is a free ""destroy 1 card"". Borreload is usefull to bypass the most resilient monsters and Borrelsword generates solid OTKs. Finally tha linkpackage runs Apollousa to inflict the opponent of a multi negate that will pressure a lot of combo decks and some beatdown strategies.  The Shaddoll'smain purpose is to add a monster type to your board and trigger effects from the deck when going second but can be used to lock the opponent or handle specific match ups. While Construct is fully designed to the going second games, Winda limitate the special summons at 1 (the most used of the package when starting first), Shekhinaga strikes monter's effets and Grysta prevents one special summon to heavily pressure extralink decks.  Lastly Number 38 is a solution against combo decks that need a key spell card and Abyss Dweller locks graveyards to heavily restrain decks like Salamangreat, Guardragons and the newcomer Marinecess, and prevent annoying secondary effects of  True Draco's backrow.  &nbsp;  The side deck  The side is dedicated to struggle against backrow focused decks that can be a real nightmare for Fur Hire even with the Danger engine if these cards are floodgates or monster removals, and handle going first Guardragons and similar gameplay decks.  A third Nibiru can be sided for the Guardragon match ups and some Pendulum or Orcust boards that could potentially be deadly if our hand lack starters, and Evenly Matched will be more usefull against huge backrows when going second.  Twin Twisters can discard a Danger to trigger for free and break annoying backrow cards like Skill Drain/The Monarchs Erupt, floodgates in general and some powerfull field spells. Red Reboot will break Subteror decks and harm boards of Salamangreat, Altergeist or True Draco.  Super polymerization can stop decks with moderate spam potential and some loops, adding a monster to perform your loops later. Starving Venom is also a good card against Cyber Dragons by using their fusion monsters to pressure their board with a beatstick that will suppress all their monsters if destroyed by Cyber Dragon Infinity's effect.  Lastly Pankratops is a free monster when playing second that add dinosaur type for Folgo and can pressure boards with it's rapid effect to better protect your loop."

And don't forget your Azathot.","So, much like my previous Danger deck, this deck's premise is pretty simplistic (which I enjoy), but it offers up a certain flexibility that I find a lot of current meta or even anti-meta decks lack. I want a deck that can feasibly, reasonably, deal with more than just one or two kinds of decks. A deck that I can take and be at least relatively confident in being able to actually do something with. No turn 1 scoop, unless things are poor indeed, and no unwinable scenarios... Unless Soul Drain is involved in game 3, as I just found out this past weekend, AFTER I SIDED OUT THE TWIN TWISTERS *ahem* but I digress.  This deck does two things; - Takes apart boards - OTKs  It has a couple different methods of performing both of these tasks, which is what lends it that flexibility. If your opponent has laid a lot of back-row, you can blow it up with discard effects, almost regardless of what those cards actually are, thanks to the unique way Danger effects can be activated. It takes particular floodgates to keep them down. Heck, even Dark Law can't stop their discard effects, even if you don't get to do much else with them. If your opponent has monsters that pose threats (negate boards out the arse with Guardragons or Pendulum Magicians), fret not. Lava Golem will cure what ails you and we so seldom legitimately need our normal summon.  Then the OTK can happen the old fashioned way, by filling your field with enough monsters to choke a Sarlaac pit, after having blown up whatever you can to clear the way, and then run over what's left with extreme prejudice,  or doing something neat. If they've seen fit to leave a monster in attack position, as long as that monster doesn't stop battle damage, you've got them thanks to the Draglubion XYZ monster. Oh baby. The lube dragon will pull out any Number XYZ monster scott-free as long as you've got the zones, and you equip another Number XYZ monster to it as material (from grave or extra deck). So you go for Number 100: Numeron Dragon. Detach one material, this guy's 0 atk gains 1000 atk per ranks on the entire field. With just him and his greasy friend, he's already a formidable 9000 beatstick. If you toss in a rank 4 (like Dugares or Daigusto Emeral, both of which help this deck a considerable amount), or praise the gods, my good friend Heliopolis to deal with all the backrow, you're looking at anywhere from 13000 to 17000. That Lava Golem you gave them, or the attack position monster they left, is going to give you a straight shot to victory.  Oh, I also don't tend to run any hand trap resistance in the main or the side because the Extra Deck still sports Azathot to this day, and if he's one of your very first plays going second, your opponent won't be able to hand trap you (and people do seem to like to wait for the bigger plays to use their Ash Blossoms or their Droll n' Locks), and you'll be dealing with any aggravating floating monster effects as well. Two birds, one C'thulu minion.  Here's the rub, tho; while it's incredibly rare (having not happened to me thus far except when very unlucky in discarding via Dangers), this deck can brick. If you draw nothing but Dark World monsters with no way to discard, you're basically sunk unless your opponent's deck is a slower variant and gives you enough time to try to draw into one of the admittedly plentiful solutions to that problem. As well, unless your hand is stacked to the nines (which it will be fairly often), a couple bad discards from the Danger side of things will stop you pretty much dead in your tracks. So, be warned. But overall, the interactions this deck has, the sheer amount of stuff you can do in a turn, and the unbridled destruction it can bring has made it my favorite deck of all time, now that my old Dark World bois have found a rightful place among them. Speaking of which, I guess I should explain why them, and why so many. Grapha is the most easily recyclable lvl 8 monster I have ever seen, and thus he lends himself well to repeated links, overlays and even removal due to the amount of not only random discard but controlled discard effects you have at your disposal. Likewise, Snoww is a means to the same ends; search out more stuff to have in your hand for better discards. Broww is sorta self-explanatory, and Beige is there for the Grapha Juggling Exxxxxxtravaganza. Seriously, I've gotten easily 2 link monsters and an overlay off of nothing but Grapha recycling and a single Danger monster. It's sickening in a fascinating way when it works properly.  Tl:Dr;  I have fun discarding/destroying/dealing all the damage. The deck is organic but definitely a bit on the luck-based side."

If this is repeated enough times you will either lose your mind or win the duel.  Typically a normal summon along with the likes of <em>One for One</em> or<em> Monster Reborn</em> will allow you to follow the above mentioned strategy.  This deck is already broken so don't try to fix it but you could possibly switch out some of the Xyz Monsters depedning on your prefernce. Another idea could be using the likes of <em>Pot of Desires</em> to stregthen your hand and thus, hopefully survive more turns. Other ""<em>Pot</em>"" spell/trap cards could also be used, However, <em>Pot of Extravagence</em> could be problematic if it reduces your number of <em>Number 78: Number Archive</em>. Another idea could be to add more <em>Allure of Darkness</em> spell cards to add further draw power. However, it would be recommended to keep the deck size roughly around 40.  Another thing to note is, if your opponent can negate special summoning or even negate effects, then you're essentially doomed. Also, if you manage to get <em>Number 78: Number Archive</em> after using its effect, then you're also doomed.  In Conclusion, this deck is terrible and its drawbacks far outweight its advantages."

I went through all the standard variations mainly predaplant or mekk-knight. Eventually I decided to do the meta thing and just throw random cards in the decks and see what sticks. The result is this. I would run a standard side deck with this, and either switch out the Alphan Call or overlay booster and psychic tracker. So here comes strategy I guess.  Red- if you open a red he trumps everything. If you have sky striker hornet drones in hand, then oh well you better hope you can get to a link monster to use it. Either that or ditch it with magnacarrier. Always send a red with Alphan, or white (unless there is nothing in grave to revive). Send two back with blue if you can because you want to be sending him to the grave as often as possible. 3 of red is necessary this deck would be nothing without him.  White- Remember that you can't send alphan with this card. You can use cards in hand or on field for this so keep that in mind as well. With this deck you need to make sure you know what order things are going to be activating (Mainly for ygopro dont accidently revive a green when you meant to send green or whatever). He takes the level of whatever monster you choose to send so you can use that if you only have one other monster on field to cheat out of the mechs and pass. When he goes to grave he can grab an alphan I prefer to grab one from the grave to recycle. Obviously this card helps the deck a lot and I would recommend running three though I have seen people run two.  Blue- Try to only summon blue off of Emergency teleport or off of alphan. Many times people will let you summon red off the alphan so he doesnt get sent to the graveyard. If that the case then just link into something and revive the blue. I would always go for blue with reds revive effect and vice versa. If you do choose to use blues shuffle effect (I prefer to do it if there are 5 or more quants in grave) make sure you put red back please you dont want to run out of both. Good thing too you can shuffle himself back in, but make sure you keep one in grave for the red to revive so you get the search.  Green- The ability the special summon off this card activates on NS and SS. Do not SS red or white with this that's ridiculous, unless its your absolutely only option you would almost certainly be better off. Do not use his graveyard effect unless you want to ditch a second red, or you are already ready to begin magnacarrier-ing everything in which case the cards in hand dont really matter. That being said you would prefer quants so you can attach but thats my opinion.  Alphan- At first this seemed like the least valuable card in the deck, but after sending red to the grave and getting 2 free summons off of him I regret to inform that outside of red he is the most important card in the deck. I always special this off green if i can. Then tribute itself for the other three. You either get it back in your hand and search off blue, you get it back in your hand with a red on field, or you get a white on field which can send another green and a search off blue. Either way its always a plus. That being said I only run two because of the insane amount of recursion from White. White goes to the graveyard you get one from anywhere end of story.  As for everything else they are just there to help special out the link without giving up two super quant cards, or for making the mechas in a pinch. Hornet drones goes before anything except red. Link the token into linkuribo. I only had 14 extra deck monsters in here when I uploaded cause I couldn't decide on anything else. You could use hornet drones to make a column for purple or blue. Purple is there to search and special blue becuase blue is level 5. If you can only make a level 4 dont make aerobeast make dreadnought instead because if you get lucky you get a free magnus with a few materials already.  &nbsp;"

This build and in depth guide covers the bas,"Welcome to this profile. If you know how to play the deck and all that good stuff just scroll right down to the bottom for the decklist but if you're here to attempt to learn the deck I hope this helps you with your Generaid adventures.  <em>What are Generaids?</em>  Generaids are a level 9 spam archetype that release in <em>Mystic Fighters </em>later this year for the TCG. They rely heavily on the field spell <strong>Generaid Stage </strong>which greatly helps the deck get level 9s on the field, similarly, <strong>World Legacy Monstrocity </strong>helps the deck get monsters to field - This is why running too many Generaids isn't a good idea as they are bricks in the hand as they have no self summoning conditions. The only exception for drawing too many Generaids being bad is if you can resolve <strong>Generaid Stage</strong> and get <strong>Dvergs, Generaid of Iron </strong>on the board which can summon from hand.  <em>What is the playstyle like?</em>  The playstyle of Generaids is quite unique compared to other control decks as it summons from deck during the draw phase a giant level 9. This is usually in the form of <strong>Nidhogg, Generaid of Ice </strong>as he can negate summons which is very powerful. The idea is that you control the board with your fat bosses and stun your opponent with <strong>True King of All Calamities.</strong>  <em>What are the weaknesses of the deck?</em>  The big weakness of the deck is having <strong>Generaid Stage </strong>get hit by a handtrap, specifically <strong>Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit </strong>and <strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Springs</strong>. These can leave your board fully exposed and your opponent can just go full aggro on you. Another devastating handtrap is <strong>Nibiru, The Primal Being </strong>as on your opponents draw phase you are summoning 5 monsters (1 Generaid and 4 Tokens) so they can nuke your board on their turn.  Another big weakness of the deck is opening too many Generaid monsters. There is no worse feeling than finally winning the dice roll and drawing for turn and seeing that you're basically playing Blue-Eyes with the level of brickiness of your hand - This is why in this build I try and run a limited amount of Generaid monsters and no more than i feel i have to.  Now, without further ado, let's get into the monsters themselves. i'll be giving a short description of each of the monsters as if you want to read the effects of them in their entirety you can down the bottom in the deck list.  <strong>Mardoll, Generaid of Light: </strong>This is the Generaid monster, however provides no board controlling advantages. On summon she adds one Generaid <strong>card</strong> or one plant monster. you can use this effect to add any generaid card you require or even add a lonefire blossom for next turn. max it at 3.  <strong>Dvergs, Generaid of Iron:</strong> as mentioned earlier Dvergs summons from hand as many Machine or Generaid monsters as you like but you have to tribute for each one (the tribute is cost). This effect is only really useful once or twice per game as once you vomit your Generaids on the board once there isn't really a need to do it again. play 1  <strong>Hel, Generaid of Death: </strong>Hel is one of the best Generaid monsters because you're basically playing double of all the ratios of Generaids. Hel lets you tribute 1 generaid monster (this is cost) to target one Zombie or Generaid monster in your grave and special summon it - this lets you create board presence and run less of your other Generaids because you can revive them anyway. run at 2-3.  <strong>Fraudir, Generaid of the Sword: </strong>Fraudir lets you tribute generaid monsters (this is cost) and target the same amount of monsters on the field and destroy them. Fraudir is a bit lacklustre because your opponent gets to draw to the amount of cards you destroyed with his effect. run at 1-2.  <strong>Nidhogg, Generaid of Ice: </strong>Nidhogg is the big boy who you'll want to summon on first off stages effect. he lets you negate a summon when your opponent would summon a monster by tributing a generaid monster (this is cost). Nidhogg is very strong and some decks find it very difficult to out even just one summon negate done at the right time. however it is important to remember that Nidogg<strong> </strong>is a ""when"" and not an ""if"" effect so you can not negate the summons of Rituals, Fusions or any other summon that would start a chain. run at 2-3.  <strong>Naglfar, Generaid of Flames: </strong>unfortunately, there is always one disappointment of the group, just ask my mother. Naglfar prevents destruction of a Generaid monster(s) but with 200 defence even Mokey Mokey could run over him with ease. he is incredibly useless when compared to the other Generaid monsters and would only be run due to it being another name to summon off <strong>Generaid Stage</strong>. run 0-1.  <strong>Jormungandr, Generaid of Eternity: </strong>When i said there was one disappointment, i forgot about the big XYZ boss monster of the deck - <strong>Jormungandr. </strong>You may read him and go 'gee that's not too bad', but let me remind you that instead of wasting 2 of your level 9s on him you could have just made a <strong>True King of All Calamities</strong> instead which is a way, way, way better monster. play at 0-1.  The spells and traps are pretty straight forward and don't need much explanation. i'll be going over the playable ones.  <strong>(Spell) Generaid Stage: </strong>this is the most important card of the deck and your entire strategy relies on it heavily. You either have to open <strong>Called By The Grave </strong>or hope to the lord above that your opponent has no disruption. <strong>This card has to resolve for Generaids to be used effectively. </strong>the entire effect is important so i will list it here: Once per turn, if your opponent adds a card from the Deck to the hand: You can Special Summon 1 ""Generaid"" monster from your Deck in Defense Position. During your opponent’s turn, if you Special Summon a ""Generaid"" monster: You can Special Summon, in Attack Position, as many ""<a class=""new"" title=""Generaid Token (page does not exist)"" rel=""nofollow"" data-uncrawlable-url=""L3dpa2kvR2VuZXJhaWRfVG9rZW4/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x"">Generaid Tokens</a>"" (Fairy/LIGHT/Level 4/ATK 1500/DEF 1500) as possible, but destroy them during this turn’s End Phase. You can only use this effect of ""Generaid Stage"" once per turn. max out at 3  <strong>(Spell) Generaid Quest:</strong> this is a simple one: reveal 1 generaid monster and add 2 generaid spell/traps with different names to had except itself. it's also pretty good that it returns to deck because it fuels your stage more. max out at 3  <strong>(Trap) Generaid Battle: </strong>It's <strong>Metaverse</strong> but your opponent draws 1 card immediately after <strong>Generaid Stage </strong>is activated from graveyard or deck meaning you can activate it straight away. This is also good for a cheeky Mardoll in the endphase to add something you need to hand. run 2  Non-Archetypal cards that should be run include: <strong>Lonefire Blossom, Any ghost girl, World Legacy Monstrosity, Called By The Grave.</strong>  Non-Archetypal Engines that could be run unless you are going for a pure deck (which is still okay): <strong>True King Engine </strong>(my personal preference) and the <strong>World Chalice Miko Engine</strong> (any group of monsters that turbo out this card that searches <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity.</strong>  <strong>Combos:</strong> there aren't many combos in the deck as it is a control deck so it's all about keeping the flow of the game at your pace and not your opponents. A few i can think of though i will briefly discuss:  You can chain your set <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity </strong>to the token summoning effect of <strong>Generaid Stage</strong> as chain link 2 to summon 2 level 9s from the deck, this is always <strong>Knightmare Incarnation Idlee </strong>and any other Generaid as Monstrosity attempts to destroy in the endphase but Idlee's effect makes level 9s you control immune to destruction.  (True King Engine Specific) as long as you have access to 2 <strong>Dragonic Diagrams </strong>this combo can be done: use the first <strong>Dragonic Diagram </strong>to destroy a card on field or in hand then add <strong>True King Bahrastos, The Fathomer </strong>to hand, then activate your second <strong>Dragonic Diagram</strong> and destroy your <strong>True King Bahrastos, The Fathomer </strong>in hand and add either <strong>True King Bahrastos, The Fathomer </strong>or <strong>True King Agnimazud, The Vanisher </strong>and use the effect of <strong>True King Bahrastos, The Fathomer </strong>in grave to summon a <strong>True King Agnimazud, The Vanisher </strong>from deck. after this you can (if you have them in hand) use <strong>Lonefire Blossom, World Legacy Monstrosity </strong>or the effect to summon from hand of either of the <strong>True King </strong>monsters can get you an easy <strong>True King of All Calamities </strong>on the first turn which heavily restricts your opponent.  &nbsp;  Overall the deck is extremely fun and ever since it's release has been one of my favourite archetypes to grace the game we all know and love. Thank you for reading this guide, or even if you didn't, it was my first and i hope i made it informative enough. Thanks!"

Summon Great Magnus on the First Turn (with 4 materials)! Can take on most meta decks.,"NOT for beginners! Utilizes multiple strategies such as Morning Star to search for Succession, and SS either Red Layer or Blue Layer from graveyard (whichever eff on the field hasn't been used yet this turn). The primary goal is to summon Great Magnus on the FT! Going first is preferable despite the Mekks, since you have roughly a 50% chance to summon Great Magnus (WITHOUT considering HandTraps), but if it fails, you can almost always get a mech XYZ on the field to use during their turn. Loads of fun to play. The combos are nearly endless! Check out my YouTube Channel (Soup 007) to see how this deck is played!"

Comments and advice welcome!,"I wanted to make a deck like you would see in the protagonist of a YUGIOH! show. This one is based off of a Super Quant Deck. Aside from those, there are cards that seem random, but are meant to give that perceived versatility you see in specific situations in the shows. All in all, This is supposed to be a fun deck, not for super competitive use, but for fun casual play. Also, in most protagonist decks (with exceptions, like blue eyes) there aren't many copies of the same cards. This would be dumb to do with Super Quants, so I'm gonna try to keep things limited, with exceptions.  For the cards that may not fit with the archetype, I added effect veiler and drill synchron in for tuners, because level 3 and level 1 tuners work very well when trying to get clear wing and crystal wing out. Effect veiler also has that decent discard effect. There are much better level 3 tuners, but I chose drill synchron so I could add Drill Warrior in the Extra Deck, because I wanted to. Sue me. Cracking dragon is in the deck because I wanted to put in a zord-like monster representing the dragonzord. and then White Layer was released. I'm going to replace it eventually. Also, it looks cool, and I wanted a dragon put in there, if only 1. Most protagonists have at least 1 dragon put in their deck, even if randomly. Vermillion Dragon Mech is in there for the same reason as Cracking Dragon.  Star Drawing and Overlay Booster work well with Super Quants, adding fodder for Magnaliger and Aeroboros, and I wanted to add Electromagnetic Turtle because I felt like it. Also something about it looking remotely like Catapult Turtle.  If anyone has questions or opinions, I plan on improving this deck over time, whilst sticking true to the casual, protagonist-themed deck. I plan on adding the other two supreme king dragons into the extra deck or side, dark rebellion and starving venom (not odd-eyes) because I love dragons. And I plan on swapping out Cracking Dragon for a Speedburst Dragon to synchro with to more easily bring out Clear Wing or Vermillion Dragon Mech."

HOW COULD HE?!?!,"So...There is actually nothing much to say about this, except that altergeist is my second favorite archetype and that the multifaker hit hurt altergeist more than I ever expected.  Well there is though an ,,advantage"" to the hit, that would be that altergeist is now even more budget than before xD Seriously the most expensive cards in this profile are the 1. multifaker and the Borreload dragon ( that thank the gods got a needed reprint )  This deck is purely meant as a fun and casual control deck to do some fuckie wuckies with your friends. I should probably explain though to the ones that never actually seen an altergeist duel, how they play. So altergeist duels can go two ways:  1. If your opponent plays a heavy deck that for example uses effects that would hinder you, with destruction effect, bounce effects etc. You will likely play a control duel. That means, that you will have few monsters on the field, that you will use as resources for Hexstia or protocol to negate the effects of your opponent. This is the most common altergeist dueling style, due to the problem that this archetype doesn't really have the most outstanding first turn plays. Having a marionetter and manifestation is considered a solid first turn. If you aren't able to link/synchro/xyz summon, that isn't a problem, like I said, you don't have the funkiest first turn plays that shit out every extra deck monster, but sooner or later you will have enough resources to go into link plays.  2. If your opponent plays a slower deck, or just doesn't have the right cards in their hands, you will have by turn 2 or 3 enough monsters and comeback traps to build a big board presence. This happens more often than you, believe me, I play this deck very frequently  I hope you like this deck profile if you do, feel free to leave a like down below or comment on what you like and what you don't like. See you in my next profile! PEACE! &#x270c;  &nbsp;"

This build focuses on breaking your opponent's board and then setting up so they can't recover the next turn. One of the most powerful assets in the deck is <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a>. Most decks can't out this card and resolving this card going second most of the time means your opponent loses instantly since a lot of people don't main outs to Mystic Mine. Another card that is really good in this deck that I liked in testing is <a data-name=""Cynet Universe"">Cynet Universe</a> because it allows you to recycle your Kagari easily, especially since the deck is playing <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> and you could possibly banish Hercules Base. I know a lot of people aren't playing 2 Eagle Booster but I like it because going second a lot of the time you need to resolve Kagari or Hayate, and if they try to stop your Kagari or Hayate then you can chain Eagle Booster. It's a card you sometimes want to see in your going second opening hand but not multiples of. The important outs to big combo decks like Thunder Dragon and Pendulums are in the side deck because we need to have a well rounded main deck since not everyone plays Thunder or Pendulums. In order to resolve Mine against combo decks you need to bait out their negates first with cards like Widow Anchor and then use Mine so they can't negate it. When Mine is in play, you can just keep passing until you can kill your opponent with <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> or by taking their monsters with Widow Anchor and attacking for game. I hope you guys like this deck!"

Note: <ul>  	<li>Your first goal is to go first, so you can set the traps.</li>  	<li>Your starting hand most likely will be 1-2 Monsters, along with traps (and some spells). Usually, I just summon a Traptrix Monster and then go right into Sera.</li>  	<li>You don't always have to go straight into Sera. You can wait a turn or two, just much sure you have traps setted down.</li>  	<li>This deck works like a machine. If you have Sera on the field, she can generate the traps very easily after a Traptrix effect is activated. Same goes for when a Normal Trap is activated; it will generate a Traptrix Monster of your choice.</li>  	<li>Continue using and generating cards while destroying your opponent's field and win the duel.</li>  	<li>Other cards such as <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> were used to transition into the offensive side.</li> </ul> Despite the deck, I still think it is Non-Meta, because of it's possible matchup with other decks such as Thunder Dragon, but I still think it could be used competitively.  Leave any comments and likes if you wish.  Enjoy the Deck :)"
