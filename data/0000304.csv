You will start by activating fraktall, you will send it from the hand to the grave to send kitt to grave who will send nervall to the grave who will add kerass to the hand. You will then special summon turqoise warbler to the board. Then you can normal summon kerass and use its effect to banish 2 tri-brigade monsters from the graveyard and summon bearbrum from the extra deck. You will then link all 3 of them into an apollousa with 3 negates. When the bearbrum is linked off you will get to search revolt, and put back your blank card. You will set the revolt and pass your endboard is 3 monster negates a non targeting banish a potential 3-4 hand traps, or more dending on what else you oppened, and followup through nervall on the oponets turn.</p><p><strong>Budget options-</strong> You can swap the crossout designators out for something like skull meister or ghost belle. If you can not afford zeus, then you can play another bearbrum, or omen, or a generic link 2 or 3. If you can not afford accesscode talker then you can play borrelsword, or a genric link monster. even though apolousa is a 20 dollar card it is very important to the deck so you should really play it if you are going to play this deck.</p>"

While the deck often plays and handles in the style that a combo deck would, the actual gameplay of Salamangreats often times better resembles that of a control deck. In the past I used to say that the deck's biggest faults where it's predictibility due to age and lack of pivot options, but now in modern times, I think recent support for the Cyberse-type has changed my tune a little bit. While it's still not anything too crazy, the deck is undoubtedly in a far better position than it used to be.</span></p>"

On some replays, I skip some setup because almost every Simoon line goes something like -&gt; Simoon, activate Whirlwind -&gt; search Suthri, Normal Summon Suthri, search Vata + Shamal, activate Shamal to activate Feather Whirlwind, Vata special summon + effect to summon Black-Winged Dragon.</p><p>Simoon, Ash on Vata: (if they Ash Simoon normal summon, that can end your turn unless you have another name in hand you can normal summon)<br /><a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=44857-42764806</a><br /><br />Simoon, Ash on Wise Strix:<br /><a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=44857-42772481</a><br /><br />Simoon, Ghost Belle on Feather Whirlwind:<br /><a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=44857-42772557</a><br /><br />Simoon, Ghost Belle on Shamal 2nd effect:<br /><a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=44857-42774534</a><br /><br /><br />Simoon + Gale, Nib on 5th summon (Suthri + Vata/Shamal/Black Whirlwind + Gale also works):<br /><a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=44857-42763789</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simoon + Gale through Nib on Suthri 2nd NS:</p><p><a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=44857-42763943</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simoon + Gale through Nib on Wise Special Summon:</p><p><a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=44857-42764010</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simoon + Gale through Nib on FAM summon + Zephyros Bounce:</p><p><a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=44857-42764156</a></p><p><br />In actuality, it does not matter where they Nib you so long as you have Gale as an extender. If they decide to Nib you at the very end of your combo, you still end on FAM + Twin Shadow for 2 pops + Chinook. You can also choose to leave Assault Dragon in the ED, if everyone is playing Nib in their side deck or you think your opponent will wait to Nib you at the end,&nbsp; so then you can summon BWAD afterwards.<br /><br />Deck Choices and other notes:<br />- None of the level 4 Blackwing extenders do anything in this synchro build. Your starters already do all the work in getting you to your full combo and opening hands like Suthri + Bora as opposed to just Suthri adds literally nothing to your end board and their level 4 non-tuner stats aren't favorable. Gale, Harmattan, and Oroshi are the only worthwhile extenders. Gale lets you play through Nib via Hawk Joe (also for easier Raikiri access), Harmattan can come up for when you need to synchro Shamal summoned off Wise Strix with Harmattan to make a level 6, and Oroshi let's you summon Hot Red Abyss easily.&nbsp;<br />- At least 2 or 3 level 2's are mandatory. 1 is needed to activate Vata's effect to send a level 2 + Zephyros (important), so it won't be a problem if you draw 1 level 2.&nbsp;<br />- At least 3 consistency cards are needed (Small World, Prosperity, and Allure are the best ones). You only have 6 1 card starters in the deck, so you need the extra consistency.&nbsp;<br />- PK engine adds unnecessary bricks and the endboards aren't that impressive comparing to what you could do in a Synchro focused deck playing minimal bricks. Dark Requiem takes more investment than I:P into Apollousa (using at least 2 monsters you summon off Twin Shadow + Feather Whirlwind on your opponent's turn). Kali Yuga builds can now get away with playing only the 1 Rank-Up Magic Launch as a brick, but the combo is too intricate and fragile to be consistent through handtraps. And you already deserve to be winning if your opponent opened literally nothing to stop your combo. The only advantage Kali has over Synchro is that it doesn't lose to Mystic Mine.&nbsp;</p><p>- The deck has 9 or 10 slots for handtraps/board breakers. Blackwing still struggles going 2nd so board breakers &gt; handtraps.<br />- You can play Zonda + Kunai &gt; Vayu if you want. They both accomplish the goal of getting a free body on board (preferrably level 5), so you should only play one or the other. Zonda requires you to play another soft brick, while Vayu takes a slot in your Extra deck.<br />- Optional cards in the extra: Draco Berserker of the Tenyi, Psy-Framelord Omega, Raikiri, Sohaya (if you play the Gamma package)<br />- Wing Requital is a winmore and terrible because it does NOT get you to your starters.</p>"

Perhaps not the best possible build but one that has enough variety so each game is fun.</p><p>This deck is not meant to be perfect but rather to have a bit of variety, while still being competitively viable. That is why it has Giant Soldier of Stone, Wall of Illution, Trap Master and even Hane-Hane at 2 each; so that there is some spice in the cards you set down. As well, The Wicked Worm Beast may not be a heavy beater but it is surely a fun card to play around with.</p>"

I am just messin around and trying out something new for me. I usually stay away from meta archetypes (you can look at my other decks for proof of that), but the Branded and Despia archetypes just seem like a good bit of fun, especially since I love fusion monsters more than any other extra deck monsters.</p>"

I'm also running level 4 Tenyis for easy 6 material Zeus lines going second. Baxia and 3 of the Sacred Summit help make this a deck that can solidly break boards while putting up 2-3 interruptions per turn, and still has access to the best Xyz in the format. If you own Dweller or Tornado Dragon you could cut down on Zoodiacs to run more of a toolbox. I actually crafted my Dweller down, and realistically having either a pop or a Zeus is reasonable enough. You try and make synchro plays on the play, and force through Zeus first on the draw (sometimes baiting interruptions on the way). Zeus + Barronne seems to be a good plan in the format.</p>"

Dinomorphia Dragoon is the perfect anti-meta deck to use them in! Youtube link inside!","<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp; I pulled a Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon from my 2022 Megatin Case. Being super excited to finally own one (it's been two years!!!) I frantically looked for a deck that can host this beautiful Duel Monsters Nostalgia bait!<br /><br />Dragoon is a force of nature on it's own - untargetable, indestructible, 3000ATK, omni-negate, it can increase it's own attack and burn up to twice per turn! Dragoon is a ridiculously powerful card, and getting it out is extremely easy as well with Red-Eyes Fusion being easily accessible. The only downside is that Red-Eyes Fusion prevents any summoning for an entire turn, which seriously prevents Dragoon from being usuable in many decks. <br /><br />After a lot of research, I've discovered the perfect shell to put the incredibly powerful card in is Dinomorphia. While Dragoon provides an omni-negate Dinomorphia seriously needs, Dinomorphia provides control, a fieldwide one-sided ""Skill Drain,"" and battle protection through Rexturn. Dinomorphia can summon their monsters via their trap cards on the opponent's turn, effectively bypassing Red-Eyes fusion's summon lock!</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br />Paired with Dinomorphia, Dragoon and his Dino DNA squad can even smash through 2022 meta threats like Spright and Tearlaments!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><a>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</a></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>ARCHETYPES, ENGINES AND DECKBUILDING</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><ul type=""disc""><li class=""MsoNormal"">Forming the deck&rsquo;s core, The <strong>Dinomorphia </strong>cards in the Main Deck consist of 15 cards:</li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>3 Therizia, 1 Diplos, 3 Frenzy, 2 Domain, 1 Alert, 1 Brute, 1 Sonic, and 3 Trap Trick</em>. Forming most of the Extra deck, there are <em>3 Kentregina, 3 Rexturn and 2 Stealthbergia</em>. </p><ul type=""disc""><li class=""MsoNormal""><strong>The Dragoon</strong> cards in the maindeck consists of whopping 9 cards:</li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>1 Dark Magician, 1 Red-Eyes Black Dragoon, 1 Red-Eyes Wyvern, 3 Red-Eyes Insight and 3 Red-Eyes Fusion. In the Extra Deck, there are 3 Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon. </em>These cards enable arguably one of the most ridiculous cards ever printed by Konami - Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon. <em><br /></em></p><ul type=""disc""><li class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Generic Support</strong> cards assist the Pure Punk strategy and consist of 7 cards.</li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>3 Pot of Prosperity, 1 Called by the Grave, and 3 Gozen Match</em>. </p><ul><li class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Board Breaker</strong> and <strong>Staple Handtraps</strong> cards consist of 12 cards.</li></ul><p><em>3 Dark Ruler No More, 3 Evenly Matched, 3 Infinite Impermanence, and 3 Dimension Shifter.</em> These cards can singlehandidly turn the odds in your favour with their devastating board breaking/turn ending potential.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">43 cards are used in this deck to lower the possibility of drawing into bricks/garnets like Dark Magician, Red-Eyes Black Dragon, Red-Eyes Wyvern an Dinomorphia Diplos. Cards can be more easily accessed through Pot of Prosperity. Prosperity is easily used in this deck, since not every Extra Deck monster is needed. </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dinomorphia Dragoon is fairly easy to play, since it doesn't involve multiple combo routes and complex decision making. Functioning as an anti-meta stun deck, you simply lockdown your opponent with Dragoon/Dinomorphia until they concede or die!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Able to go first or second thanks to the wide variety of devastating board breakers and crippling handtraps, Dinomorphia Dragoon can play either way. Preferably going first is best, since it allows the player to use their Dinomorphia trap cards as soon as possible. <br /><br /><strong>Going first,</strong> the gameplan is pretty simple - try to summon Dragoon and set all your trap cards. On the opponent's main phase, summon Kentregina, then summon Rexturn to shut off your opponent's monster effects on their field. This Dinomprhia gameplan is backed by Dragoon's omni-negate and floodgates like Gozen Match/Dimension Shifter, effectively shutting down your opponent's plays.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Going second,</strong> boards are broken with a combination of Dragoon + Dark Ruler No More/Evenly Matched. If you are missing a certain card to break your opponent's board, try to dig for it with Pot of Prosperity. After Dragoon is successfully on board, it is a nigh unstoppable juggernaut, capable of destroying two monsters with it's effect and running over another monster in the battle phase. After Dragoon's onslaught, the Dinomorphia cards are ready for action, ready to seal the deal as their summoned on your opponent's next turn with their control/lockdown effects.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">If your opponent manages to break through your board and slay Dragoon, Dinomorphia can actually grind out a game by themselves for several turns. Every Dinomorphia monster floats into a monster from the Graveyard, and Therezia/Diplos can grab resources from deck.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Your win condition is Dragoon or Rexturn. If either of those come out, it is often game over for your opponent.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><a>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</a></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Dinomorphia's main gimmick is halving the player's lifepoints to dangerously low levels. Be aware of your attack position/defense position monsters! Note that a simple attack from even a Kuriboh can kill you!</li><li>Be careful of cards like Sky Striker Hayate that can attack directly, or Spright Pixies which can increase their attack points to hit over your monsters!</li><li>Fun fact - Gozen Match prevents your opponent from kaiju'ing or Lava Goleming your monsters from your field. Protect your Dragoon and Rexturn with that floodgate!</li><li>If you already have all the pieces of your gameplan in your hand, use Pot of Prosperity after you thin out your deck so you have the highest chance to get the card you want.</li><li>Dinomorphia Sonic is this deck's answer to backrow based boardbreakers like Dark Ruler No More, Lightning Storm, Evenly Matched and Triple Tactics Talent.</li><li>The side deck has many cards that straight-up end your opponent's turn, allowing you to swing back for lethal. Be sure to side in the appropriate cards when you're guaranteed to go first!</li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">When I held the Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon in my hands when I pulled it from the tins, it was like holding pure power! Proving how powerful it is in online testing, I was amazed how that singular piece of nostalgia bait that seemed like a fan-made monstrosity can tear through meta decks with the greatest of ease!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Dinomorphia Dragoon is a great anti-meta call when facing a format overly reliant on field-based monster effects, targeting removal, destruction effects summon spam, and graveyard reliant strategies. This deck counters all of that through a combination of Dragoon, Rexturn, Dimension Shifter and Gozen Match!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">If you pulled or obtained your Dragoonsm Pot of Prosperities and Dimension Shifters just like me, this is the perfect deck to use them in! I definitely am, next time I go to my Locals. <br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

The same thing applies for Rhino: 1 impermanence or 1 veiler and you might pass or even go to the next game.</p><p>If you lose the dice roll this time luck may actually be on your side, while going first in G1 you may have a disadvantage.

Its a very consistant deck with a non-once per turn searcher and is extremely budget due to every amorph card being under 1$ U.S.D. The deck has a consitant 85% win rate, with the only decks that stop it being decks that dont rely or focas on meta based strats, and those are far and few between. It has a great matchup against things like splight, and tearlament as the cards ""Amorphage Gluttony"" and ""Amorphage Lechery"" counter those decks pretty hard.

So, the new Kshatri-La cards are pretty powerful. Whenever the opponent activates card effects, you can respond by banishing cards from various zones the opponent controls (field, hand, gy, deck, extra deck). They are splashable as special-summonable Lv 7 mons with good on-field effects, and on their own they form a very strong control core, with each of the monsters banishing cards in reaction to the opponent's monster effects, Shangri-La locking down field zones from being used, and cards like Prepare or Berth summoning back your own banished monsters. Combining this with Runick gives us an even stronger control core, as we can use the excellent Runick removal spells and recursion engine off of the field spell! This build is by no means a perfect list, but I really think that this concept can be innovated and pushed further! The idea is to stun the opponent out of the game, and win either through combat or by decking them out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Commnents, suggestions, ideas? Let me know what you think!</p>"

This is a deck in a series of lists where I try to build as many Krawler variants as I can! By doing so I hope to explore unusual builds, interesting synergies, and to give other people inspiration to improve these lists or make lists of their own. In this variant, I'm combining Spright and Krawler, splashing the Frog engine. I'll be going over the archetypes' strengths and weaknesses, the card choices, and the decks combos below!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What are the strengths, weaknesses, and synergies of the archetypes in this list? Krawlers have gotten much stronger at flooding the field with the release of Krawler Soma, but their strongest disruptions are Winda and Deus X-Krawler, both of which are vulnerable to removal/negation. Krawler flip-control is a playable strat, using Sol and Luna as well as Mind Meld to answer several of the opponent's monsters, but it requires a lot of main-deck slots to achieve. Krawlers can quite easiliy make Utopic Draco Future, but they rely on out-of-archetype support to extend their plays. Spright need no real introduction. One of the best decks this format, they can easily put up powerful negates, protection for their board, and recurse resources every turn. Spright don't really struggle with any deckbuilding weaknesses, but they benefit from synergistic support. All of the main Krawlers we are using are level 2 (even Soma, after summoning 2 monsters), and so they allow the Sprights to special summon themselves form hand. Krawlers can also build their board before we even commit to the Spright plays, letting us set up a very dense board before passing, or playing through the opponent's interruption if they go first. The combination of these 2 archetypes also lets us play a very toolboxy build, including several answers for threats and combo-paths that we can use to adapt to the opponent's deck as we play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alright! So, the two main engines we are playing are the Krawler engine and the Spright engine, but we are splashing Frogs, Magicians' Souls, and using Small World for consistency. We are playing 1 Deus X-Krawler (summoned off of the Girsu combo), 3 Soma (the best Krawler and a main playmaker), 2 Glial, 1 Spine, 1 Axon, 3 Mind Meld, 1 Pawns, and 3 Girsu (an honorary Krawler). We want to mill / discard Mind Meld off of Girsu, Magicians', Survivor, or Mothman, but we can also use it to negate an opponent's monster effect, bouncing a monster we control to hand which often doesn't hurt us. Glial is great recursion, and we could play them at 3, but I'm trying to save space. There is an argument for cutting Girsu, but I find them to be an excellent Ash-bait, and if they are not negated we can extend pretty far. If you cut Girsu, also cut Deus (the only consistent way to summon them is off of Mind Meld), and limit Mind Meld to 2. For Spright, we are on 3 Blue (the best), 3 Jet, 1 Carrot, 1 Red, 2 Starter, and 2 Smashers. I find that when playing a mixed-deck with Spright, its best to play Starter and Jet at a 2/3 or 3/2 ratio, depending on whether you prefer a more consistent body on board or a more consistent Blue search. In this list, drawing Blue plus Starter is a bit of a dead draw, so we play 3 Jet instead of 3 Starter. Smashers is at 2 to deal with Mystic Mine, and it does well against Tearlament (banishing instead of destroying), as well as being non-targeting removal.</p><p>We are playing Magicians' Souls for more consistency (Illusion of Chaos is the dump and a search) and it lets us turn dead cards in hand into draw power. We will usually be linking Souls off for Spright Elf, or I:P Masquerena. Our Small World bridge is Danger! Mothman, but we can also bridge off of the Souls package, Sprights, or Frogs. Speaking of Frogs, we are playing the smallest package we can; 2 Swap Frog and 1 Ronintoadin. This makes the Toadally Awesome package a lot more fragile, but deck space is very tight in this build, and I'm willing to trade durability for fewer bricks. In the Extra Deck, we are playing the Ghostrick / UDF package, the Winda package, 1 Gigantic and 2 Elf, Lib, Unicorn, I:P, and Avramax. I can absolutely see the argument for Accesscode or Apollousa over some of my choices, but this is what I feel gives the deck the most options and answers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now we're on to combos! I'll start with a few refreshers for those unfamiliar with the basic Krawler/Spright lines of play, then delve into some optimal opens and how we can extend.</p><p>Basic Combos:</p><p>(Cards in Hand -&gt; combo)</p><p>Girsu: Normal Girsu, sending Mind Meld from deck to GY. Summon a token to both fields, then link off for Lib. Use Lib to set Pawns, then summon Deus X off of the Mind Meld in GY.</p><p>Gisru and Soma: Normal Girsu, sending Mind Meld and making tokens. Flip-down Girsu to summon Soma, then use Soma to summon 2 Krawlers (Axon and Spine) face-up. Link Soma and the token for Lib, setting Pawns with Lib, then link the 2 Krawlers for Shaddoll Construct. Use Construct to fusion summon Winda with Construct and the face-down Girsu.</p><p>Any Spright and a Lv 2 (or Soma and a normal summon): Normal the Lv 2 mon, then special the Spright. Make Gigantic, detatching to summon Swap Frog. Swap Frog sends Ronintoadin to GY, then link Swap and Gigantic off for Elf. Use Elf to summon back Swap, sending Swap from deck to GY, use Ronin in GY to banish Swap to summon itself, then link off for Toadally Awesome. If you have Soma, normal the monster, then use Soma to get 2 Krawlers on the field, then make Gigantic and follow the above combo from there. Making Toadally Awesome can negate Spell / Traps in addition to monsters, so it can be a better counter against certain decks than using Iblee as a floodgate.</p><p>Any Spright and a Lv 2 (or Soma and a normal summon): Normal the Lv 2 mon, then special the Spright. Make Gigantic, detatching to summon Iblee. Link Iblee and Gigantic for Elf, summoning Iblee to the opponent's field. Summon back the Gigantic / Lv 2 / Spright from GY with Elf and extend if possible. Again, we can do the same play with Soma by using the summons off of Soma and Soma itself to make Gigantic, then summon Iblee and make Elf. Iblee floodgates the opponent and certain decks will just fold to her (Tear has a lot of trouble), but other lists can play through it with minimal effort (Floowandereeze); either go for Iblee or Toad, depending on the matchup. Iblee can also help us get to Unicorn / Avramax on following turns using her normal summon effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Extended Combos:</p><p>Girsu, Soma, and Spright Blue / Jet / Starter: Perform the above Girsu and Soma Combo, stopping when you have Lib, face-down Girsu, and 2 Krawlers on field. From here, we can either make Winda and end on a Carrot / Red, potentially with a set Smashers, or we can go into UDF. I won't go over the Winda / Spright Red/Carrot line here, but if you want me to explain it, just ask in the comments. So, for the UDF line, use the 2 Krawlers to make Ghostrick Socuteboss, then overlay for Angel of Mischief. Detatch Socuteboss to search Ghostrick Shot, then use Shot to summon back Socuteboss. Overlay for another Angel, then detatch for Ghostrick Scare. Use the 2 Angels for Utopic Future, then overlay that for Utopic Draco Future. Now you can summon Blue from hand, or use Jet / Starter to summon Blue. From here, follow either of the Spright Basic Combos above, ending on Toad or summoning Iblee to the opponent's field. Again, if you need clarification on these combo lines, just ask and I'll respond!</p><p>Girsu and Spright Blue / Jet / Starter: Perform the above Gisru Combo, ending on Lib with a face-down Deus. Summon the Blue, or summon Jet searching Starter to summon Blue. Blue searches Jet / Carrot / Red, depending on what you already have or need, then we can make Gigantic to either summon Swap Frog or Iblee, depending on which line we want to follow, ending with Toadally Awesome or an Iblee on the opponent's field. </p><p>I might come back to this section later to add more combo lines, but I'll leave it at this for now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Small World Lines:</p><p>(Starter&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Bridge&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Goal)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Krawler / Spright Blue/Jet / Souls / Illusion / Iblee&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Mothman&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Krawler / Spright / Souls / Illusion / Iblee</p><p>Girsu / Illusion / Souls&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Spright Blue/Jet&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Girsu / Illusion / Souls</p><p>Spright / Lv 2 Krawler / Iblee&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Swap / Ronin&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Spright / Lv 2 Krawler / Iblee </p><p>Soma / Iblee / Girsu / Spright Blue/Jet&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Illusion&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Soma / Iblee / Girsu / Spright Blue/Jet</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Side Deck doesn't matter, its just a placeholder for now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for your time! I hope you enjoyed reading this, and maybe it inspired you to try your own take on an under-used archetype!

However, for a little while, some were very tempted by the existence of the Hex-Sealed Fusions: rock monsters that let you special summon fusions in your synchro deck. During Block Dragon's reign, it was relatively easy to gather the resources to summon Naturia Exterio to lock your opponent from spells and traps.</p><p>Now a new fusion exists that is easy to capitalize on: Mirrorjade. Using The Dark Hex-Sealed Fusion and any monster special summoned from the extra deck, you can summon a Mirrorjade. Note that this is a special summon, not a fusion summon, so Mirrorjade's raigeki effect cannot trigger, but the value a banish brings to the Adamancipator board is unparralleled. Afterwards, in your opponent's end phase, you can special an Ecclesia and search Fleurdalis as two free extenders attached to a board breaker and beatstick.</p><p>This combo is a perfect use of a Halqifibrax. In addition, Spright Elf can resummon level two tuners summoned by the Halq, bypassing its restriction. Finally, the Elf can summon Halq on your opponents turn to access quick synchros.</p><p>There are two major benefits to this deck. It is resistant to Dimension Barrier by utilizeing fusions, links, and synchros. In addition, Mirrorjade is an exceptionally powerful going second card, and can still access interruption on the end phase via Titaniklad and I:P.</p><p>If you like Adamancipator and want to get some shocked looks out of people at locals, then this deck is for you!</p>"

Cycle the Eldlich traps to stay afloat until you acquire true Draco cards.&nbsp;</p><p>*Most hands are pretty consistent with at least two back rows and ways to pull out eldlich monsters 87% of the time.&nbsp;</p><p>*if your opponent is playing a floodgate deck, make sure to side in 1-2 super polys; the extra deck is fodder for Poe, and there are a bunch of general swarm control and monsters of all kinds of types and attributes so that super poly can work with almost any combination.&nbsp;</p><p>*This deck is consistent going first or second, but going second is better in most cases because of the Draco spells, traps, and Aldrich's hand effect. Going first is all right, too. Just make sure to set an apocalypse and wait to summon Draco monsters until your opponent's turn.</p><p>*Some basic rules for True Draco in case you've never played it before. 1. If you have true Draco's apocalypse, wait to activate its effect until your opponents turn or when they are about to destroy your true Draco monster or spell/trap. Preferably destroy your spells and traps before your monsters and save yourself with true kings' return.</p><p>*If you have a dragon diagram, use it first thing on your turn (if you don't have extravagance), so you can get opponents to negate out of the way or get some fodder for true Draco heritage, starting a combo in general.&nbsp;</p><p>*Eldlich cards are excellent at stalling, and make sure to use conquistador at the correct times; otherwise, you will get destroyed. Save guardian for when your opponent gets out a boss monster or a monster similar to dragoon because that card is pretty much the only way to destroy it other than the apocalypse. If your opponent has a monster unaffected by card effects, you must rely on super poly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's about it for the summary. | I have played hundreds of games with this deck, so I know it through and through. I'm sure you'll enjoy playing it too. If you got this far, thanks for reading the summary, I've done hours and hours of research to create the most optimum version of True Draco Edlich because they are two control archetypes I like. Love or hate true Draco/Eldlich, just try it out. You are bound to have some fun. I selected this deck as meta because it is top-of-the-line anti-meta and can compete with decks such as sword soul and marincess. Thanks for reading,g and enjoy the gameplay (I am working on other-metal decks, stay tuned for more). HAPPY DUELING!</p>"

I like to play some more competitive and rogue decks - like Sharks XYZ and PK P.U.N.K, but always have a spot to play ""fun/casual"" decks as well because, why not? This is one of these decks.</p><p>I first got inspired to build this deck after watching DarkArmedDuelist's profile from a year ago. After facing so many control decks, I was wondering what kind of deck would be fun to play that is not in the current meta, and could handle certain decks and playstyles, like Swordsoul. Meklords seemed like an interesting anti-synchro deck, and also had the means to out back-row heavy decks, like Mystic Mine Burn, or even Eldlich. But I knew it wasn't strong enough on it's own. That's when I remembered King Regulus was a card, and could equip machines in the graveyard... and that's how we got to here.</p><p>The main idea of the deck revolves around two cards: Meklord Army Recruiter Obbligato, and Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core. These cards enable you to either pop the core to bring out one of your emperors (Weisel for spell negates, or Granel to do some damage), or obbligato to bring out two Meklord army monters - which enable either xyz plays, or link plays. By sending enough of these monthers to the graveyard, you can also build up a pool of monsters with different names, which is what you need to bring out Astro Dragon - which can equip a monster from your opponent's extra deck to boost it's attack power (and potentially attack multiple times as well).&nbsp;</p><p>This deck also plays a lot of going second staples - like DRNM and Feather Duster - to help clear your opponent's board and limit their interuptions/floodgates that could limit your play options. And by adding Therion cards, as well as Kaiju's and Lava Golem in the side deck, it also helps you tribute over monsters that would cause you trouble. And with Astro Dragon Triskelion, you can usually equip an ED monster large enough to get over your own Kaiju.</p><p>This deck is by no means perfect, but I hope you enjoy the idea!</p>"

Aiming that taking advantage of the electromagnet warrior effects that can be activated on opponent's turn. Basically the idea is to get a lot of magnets into play so opponent can't kill you, and set up for berserkion to OTK on your next turn using berserkion, knightmares and accesscode in particular. The deck has a lot of hand traps because otherwise it cannot really deal with combo decks, and they you more time to set up your plays and build card advantage. The slower pace also allows you to side unending nightmares which are really goof in this floodgate meta imo with even mystic mine being around. The side deck is mainly focused on heavy backrow solemn cards for when you know you are going first and spell adn trap removal in case you face a backrow heavy control deck such as Labrynth or Exosister. Overall the deck performs quite well actually.</span></p>"

This is mainly done with the 10 searchers this deck has access to, that being Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall, Blue-Sky, Orcust Girsu, and World Legacy's Memory. <br /><br />Hard-to-out extra deck bosses are usually the win condition in this deck, like a I:P Masquereena boosted Avramax, an untargetable/undestroyable Mekk-Knight Spectrum Supreme or the column-dependent battle phase champion Mekk-Knight Morning Star.</p><p><br />In a simplified gamestate vacuum, Mekk-Knight Avramax is nigh-unkillable and often is a ""checkmate"" on your opponent.

No Dragoon. This deck is mainly based of the Dark Side of Dimensions deck Atem used during his simulated duel against Kaiba. The Face Card Knights didn't fit with the Egyption esthetic of the deck so I sided it alongside Slifer. You can add them if you wish. The god cards, in general, are too bricky to be added. No Timaeus because he no longer owned it after the Waking The Dragons arc. Buster Blader culd be added but would be bricky and his DSOD deck mainly focuses on his older Duelist Kingdom cards like BLS, C. Guardian, and Gaia. My reasoning for adding Super Soldier is due to the mention of it in Chaos Form and the official promotional video by Konami features Atem from DSOD summoning the card (look up Battles of Chaos trailer on YouTube). Adding Gaia was because it is a more recent support of him and Super Soldier floats into a Gaia monster when destroyed. Exodia was added because it fits with the theme and was featured in the 2019 World Championship live duel of Yugi vs Kaiba along with Apprentice Illusion Magician, Magician of Chaos, Magician of Black Chaos Max, Palladium Oracle Mana, and Quintet Magician. I also added the support cards from the 2016 World Championship live duel and the Dark Illusion set except the XYZ because this deck is kept in canon with the DM era. If you have any questions, feel free to comment.</p>"

I've been testing the deck for a long time now after a lot of edits and duels this was the best build I can do, you call this deck absolute tier 0<br /><br />now are some notes:<br />1- thanks to Byssted archetype and herald of diviner, we can do rank 6 plays so we can XYZ summon Beatrice which helps us to sent our Tearlament monsters to GY, and trigger their effects, about the byssted monsters Magnumut can add any dragons from your deck or your GY to your hand so basically you can add Druidwurm as many times you want and it's really annoying card to deal with.<br /><br />2-we summon zeus over number 41 most of the times, but you can summon on time thief redover and sometimes zeusing your own board might be a good idea.<br /><br />3-Grapha, the dragon overlord of dark world: since i lost a lot against evenly matched, cuz deck have no omni negate, thought using grapha could be nice it also has 3200ATK point, and it really was it's better then having dead winda or shadoll beast in our hand, also swamp king helps to summon Lulucaros or Kaleido-heart, imagine swamp king is your new shadoll beast, trust me not a bad card, if you say i might brick well there is no deck with at least 1/10 dead hands.<br /><br />4-herald of diviner: this card is really nice, not to say allowing you summon baronne or sending Elder to GY to out the summon limit or helping to summon Beatrice or sending Kelbek or sending Agido to GY, are the adventage of this card, not seeing the diviner in nowadays OCG break down reports doesn't mean other players don't plays this card, it just duel in mirrormatches for tearlament players is hard and painful and depends on mills.<br /><br />5-Pankratopes and lava golem both are good side deck cuz most of the time we don't even normal summon in this deck, and pankratops is best way to out summon limit or skill drain and any floodgates which we see more in TCG than OCG.<br /><br />6-&nbsp; ghost reaper is good hand trap especially against Tearlament or Spright players, cuz they won't be able to do anything against it.<br /><br />7-galaxy cyclone: ya we still have annoying mystic mine in TCG ( it's getting banned next banlist i hope so )<br /><br />8-Tearlament Crime which always been seen in Tearlament players side deck and it's searchable .<br /><br />9-evenly matched, no need to say that this don't have omni negate except baronne and grapha but still best board breaker in my mind.<br /><br />10: super poly if you want to play it, i suggest you to cut Beatrice and Spright sprind from extra deck and replace with mudragon and Garura and cut dark rulers and replace with 3 super polies, both super poly and dark ruler plays same role, so doesn't matter which one you play.<br /><br />Till next time, which we're going to discover a funny water deck ( i mean Gishki XD ) peace</p>"

You aren't running too many floodgates besides secret village of the spellcasters in order to just instant win games. The main goal of the deck is to snowball off a multifaker on your opponent's turn to have a bounce with silquitous, you'll want to use personal spoofing to swap any altergeist&nbsp; card including a trap card, this will also work swapping a multifaker and your other multifaker. Now that altergeists have 2 multifaker it makes this deck so significantly better. I do wish it was fully unlimited but master duel's banlist is already really bad so there's much worse that would need to fixed. This deck is weak to big body decks that use floodgates like eldlitch, dark magician, and fluandereez. I enjoy the deck a lot because it feels more like older yu gi oh where you slowly build up to a unstoppble board.</p>"

Let me explain a bit more in Detail:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The big Potential</strong></p><p>Your go to Combo is summon Cyber Slash Harpie Lady and set a Feather Storm and sometimes a Harpie Conductor on top of it. Your opponent summons any monster and you activate Feather Storm, chain Cyber Slash to bounce his Monster and win next turn. Any kind of backrow will be no problem thanks to their easy access to the Field Spell. It's also heavily effective against stronger strategies like the Adventure Engine for example.</p><p>If you set a Hysteric Sign and destroy it yourself with your field spell you can add any 3 Harpie cards from the deck to your hand during the End phase. Alternatively discard it with Hysteric Party since it triggers from hand too.&nbsp;</p><p>Setting Feather Storm is highly effective since an opponents Lightning Storm/Feather Duster were you chain Feather Storm results in the Monster Effect negate plus a Feather Duster search/recycling on top of it which can't be ashed.</p><p>The Harpie's pet Phantasmal Dragon can give a hard time to your opponent when combined with Conductor. Crush (Once per Turn Conductor), targeting and attack protection for all Harpie Monsters isn't easy to overcome for some decks plus he attacks directly and sets the opponent on a 2 - 3 turn clock to find a out to him. And he can be used to create a 4 material Zeus as a added bonus.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that their new Harpie's Pet Dragon is way less bricky and sets up Harpie Harpist searches for the End phase. He can also create a permanent attack wall when combined with the Baby Pet Dragon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Ups and Downs</strong></p><p>High searchability, recycling, OTK, defensive, removal and stun plus many options make this deck such a hard time to beat for many meta oriented decks.</p><p>But there are a few downsides obviously... If your initial normal summon gets removed from field you have literally no follow up outside of setting Hysteric Party and hoping for the best. There are ways to protect your important first summon but a card as simple as Trap Hole is the demise of the Deck. Good that no one plays that card:)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final Words</strong></p><p>I find it easy again and again to reach Diamond 1 with this strategy. I do have a lot of practice with it and can't explain every combo in detail here but there's much to look forward too, should you decide to try out this Deck^^</p><p>Overall Rating: ★★★★★★</p>"

This is another deck in a series I'm making where I try to come up with as many different Krawler builds as I possibly can, mixing archetypes and splashing engines to make unique builds! This build is primarily a Ninja build, using the new support, with the Krawler Soma engine enabling UDF and Winda. This list leans very heavily on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/author/zefer-121799"">Zefer</a>'s <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/combo-with-ninja-300086"">Ninja build</a> (please go check out their build, the deck description gives you a great breakdown of the archetype and what it can accomplish!). Again, I really encourage you to click the link above and check out their deck list first; my list is fully inspired by their deck build and what it is able to accomplish. Usually, I try to take mix-up the deck's I take inspiration from, but I tested and could not find better ratios or include's than in that build, and the changes I made are fairly minor. As usual, I will break-down the archetypes in this list, go through a few of the card choices, and give a description of a few of the deck's combos!<br /><br /><br />Please refer to Zefer's build for the Ninja breakdown; it is very complete and I believe it gives a great profile of what Ninjas can now accomplish with the new support.&nbsp; I'll go over the new cards in more depth to give some background, which I hope will mesh well with Zefer's explaination. Ninja Grandmaster Hanzo can search Ninjas and Ninjitsu Arts to hand, and this is NOT a once-per-turn ability. As for the new Ninjas; Mitsu is an extender that can represent a negate on board, Baku recurses resources when searched and summons itself, Kagero can bounce your cards to protect their effects from negation and can summon a body face-down, and Green Ninja can flip monsters face-down and summon themselves form hand. The new trap, Ninjitsu Art of Fallen Leaves' Dance, can tribute your Ninjas, or ANY face-down monster (I will use this in another Ninja build I upload) to summon a Ninja from deck (Hanzo / Black Dragon / Mitsu). The Novel Ninjitsu Art Book sets a card from the GY and another from the deck, but it requires the opponent to control a card (very useful for recycling). Ninjitsu Art Equipment Kanamugura lets you treat any monster as a Ninja, can pop a card on board, and when destroyed it returns a banished Ninja to the field or hand. Finally, War Ninja Meisen is a contact-Fusion boss monster for Ninjas. They cannot be targetted for attacks while you control a face-down monster, they let your Ninjas attack directly, and they let you special summon a Ninja when the opponent activates a card or effect! Our Krawlers are fairly minimal in this deck, running 3 Soma, 1 Glial, 1 Axon, and 1 Spine. We are using the Krawlers either at the end of our Ninja combo, or when our combo gets stopped by hand-traps and other negation, to extend our plays. With the new support for Ninjas, there is potential for a pseudo-flip-deck of sorts that I will be exploring in another deck breakdown, but for now the synergies we will be exploring are the combo-extension of both archetypes and the toolbox elements of both archetypes.<br /><br /><br />So, as you can see, most of this list is the same as Zefer's build. From their deck breakdown you will find that our main combo starter is getting 2 Warrior monsters on the field, which explains the ratios of Hanzo, Fire Flint Lady, and Tobari. The Ninja ratios are almost all the same with the exeption of Kagero which I run at 1 (I didn't feel that I was getting value out of the second copy). The main departures from the list are Pot of Avarice, the Armor Ninjitsu Art of Alchemy / Ninjitsu Art Notebook package, the Krawler package, and the UDF / Winda packages in the extra deck. In the main deck, we miss out on further defensive options like Mist Valley Apex Avian and Ninjitsu Art of Transformation, or Triple Tactics Talents, but I felt I did not have room for these cards, and in testing I favored the other cards I subbed in (this is a personal take and by no means an absolute, feel free to play with the card choices and ratios on your own to figure out what works best for you). The Krawler package consists of the afore-mentioned monsters, as well as 2 copies of Small World, which can either search a Ninja starter or Soma. I found that this deck often runs through its resources very quickly and has trouble turn 2 if the opponent breaks our board, so the Pot of Avarice choice is here to address that issue. Would this problem be better solved by including negates for the opponent's board breakers? Probably, but I'm on a Pot of Avarice kick right now; I just like its inclusion. The Ninjitsu Art Notebook package works by discarding a Ninja to search any Ninjitsu art; this can be used to get a trap on the field for plays during the opponent's turn, or can be used to set then activate Armor Ninjitsu Art of Alchemy for a draw 2. We sacrifice stopping power and consistency in the Extra Deck (Accesscode and 2nd copies of our Ninjas) for the UDF and Winda packages, both of which can be made after a full Ninja combo as an additional layer of disruption.<br /><br /><br />For combos, I will pick up where Zefer's leaves off. After getting 2 Warriors on field, we can go through Isolde, Saryuja, Getsuga, Zealantis, and Cross-Sheep, ending on a board with Apollousa, Meisen, Hanzo, and perhaps one other Ninja. From here, we can special summon Soma by flipping Hanzo face-down and summon 2 Krawlers from deck. If you want to make Utopic Draco Future, summon 1 Krawler face-up, the other face-down, and if you want to make Winda, summon both face-up. Either link the face-up Krawers into Construct then fuse Winda with the face-down Hanzo, or use the face-up Soma and Krawler to go through the Ghostrick line, ending on Utopic Draco Future and a set Ghostrick Scare. I can provide a more in-depth explaination of the lines this deck can make, but I feel that Zefer does a great job at explaining the main points of the combo, and the inclusion of the Krawler engine is mostly here to supplement that. If we get negated on our Hanzo or Upstart Golden Ninja, we can still make Winda/UDF if we have a Soma in hand, and that is the other upside of this partnership, the ability to play through disruption.<br /><br /><br />Here are the Small World Bridges:<br /><br />Starter&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Bridge&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Goal<br /><br />Soma / Green Ninja&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Mitsu&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Soma / Green Ninja<br /><br />Lv2 Krawler / Mitsu / Hanzo / Upstart Golden / Kagero / Getsuga / Gearfried&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Green Ninja&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Lv2 Krawler / Mitsu / Hanzo / Upstart Golden / Kagero / Getsuga / Gearfried<br /><br />Fire Flint / Krawler&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Tobari&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Fire Flint / Krawler<br /><br />Kagero / Green Ninja / Upstart Golden / Gearfried / Fire Flint / Soma&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Getsuga&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Kagero / Green Ninja / Upstart Golden / Gearfried / Fire Flint / Soma<br /><br />Mitsu / Tobari / Getsuga&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Soma&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Mitsu / Tobari / Getsuga<br /><br /><br /><br />Alright, that about does it! I hope you enjoyed this list and that it got you thinking about some possible extensions/additions you could make to the Ninja list! If you have any questions or comments, or have suggestions for this build, please let me know in the comments! I appreciate you, and hope you have a good day!</p>"

Gishki now have the ability to set up Turn 1 boards with interruptions rather than just existing as a gimmicky handloop Deck. This is a pure Gishki Deck that uses the new Gishki support. At the very least, your Turn 1 board will have 2-3 monster negates,&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, 2 to 4 cards in hand and proper follow-up.</span></p><p><span>For our monsters, we play 1&nbsp;<strong>Gishki Zielgigas</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Evigishki Nereimanas</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Evigishki Gustkraken</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Gishki Abyss</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Gishki Shadow</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Gishki Vision</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Grim Gishki</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Zielgigas&nbsp;</strong>is a massive 3200 ATK body that allows you to pay 1000 LP to draw a card and spin a card on field if the card you drew was a Gishki monster. While you won't be Summoning him Turn 1, he is still good Ritual fodder for the new Level 10 Gishki Ritual and he can net you advantage on Turn 3 onwards.&nbsp;<strong>Nereimanas</strong> is the new Gishki Ritual from PHHY and it is extremely good. On Ritual Summon, it can revive any WATER monster from GY including another copy of itself and it is not once per turn. Also, it can negate a monster effect and shuffle it into the Deck by returning a Gishki Ritual Monster you control to hand as an effect rather than cost and it is a soft once per turn. Not only can this card allow you to put up multiple monster negates if you Summon multiples, it also gives synergy with another card called&nbsp;<strong>Aquamirror Illusion</strong> which can Summon back the&nbsp;<strong>Nereimanas</strong> you returned to hand for another monster negate.&nbsp;<strong>Gustkraken</strong> on Ritual Summon looks at 2 random cards in your opponent's hand and you shuffle one of them back into Deck. This card is more of an additional play that you can make going first since this card aims to make a board rather than handloop. If you want, you can replace it with a 3rd&nbsp;<strong>Nereimanas</strong> since the possibility of Summoning a 3rd is definitely there.&nbsp;<strong>Gishki Abyss</strong> searches any Gishki with 1000 or less DEF on Summon which is not once per turn. This basically searches everything in your Deck aside from&nbsp;<strong>Nereimanas</strong>, so if you can keep Summoning it over and over again, you can search a ton of cards. You will usually be using it to search&nbsp;<strong>Gishki Shadow</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Gishki</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Vision</strong>. Both can be an entire Tribute for a WATER Ritual Monster and they can discard themselves to search a Gishki card which is not a once per turn. <strong>Shadow</strong> discards itself to search a Gishki Ritual Spell while&nbsp;<strong>Vision&nbsp;</strong>discards itself to search a Gishki Ritual Monster. Both of these cards are insane and with them not being once per turn, you are able to search out the necessary cards to Ritual Summon as long as you have copies of them in hand.&nbsp;<strong>Grim Gishki</strong> can also be used as an entire Tribute for a WATER Ritual Monster and it can Summon any Gishki monster from Deck on Summon. This basically gets you to&nbsp;<strong>Gishki Abyss</strong> making it a starter and somewhat of a 1 card combo starter.</span></p><p><span>For handtraps, we play 1&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Ash</strong> is good in general, but it and&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru&nbsp;</strong>are in here as&nbsp;<strong>Crossout Designator</strong> targets since this Deck is very subseptible to handtraps and disruptions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For Spells/Traps: We have 1&nbsp;<strong>Gishki Photomirror</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Gishki Aquamirror</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Photomirror</strong> Ritual Summons by paying 500 LP for each Level on your Ritual Monster. While this means that you will be paying 5000 Life Points to Summon&nbsp;<strong>Nereimanas</strong>, not having to Tribute monsters is really good for conserving resources.&nbsp;<strong>Aquamirror</strong> is a normal Ritual Spell for the archetype and it can shuffle itself into Deck from GY to add back a Gishki Ritual Monster in GY which is good for recycling. We are not playing&nbsp;<strong>Gishki Icemirror</strong> as we are already using up 5000 Life Points for&nbsp;<strong>Photomirror</strong>, so&nbsp;<strong>Icemirror</strong> dealing DMG to you equal to the Ritual Monster's ATK is pretty bad considering it can either kill you or put you in a very precarious situation. However, it is still a good card for the archetype since its 2nd effect works well with&nbsp;<strong>Zielgigas</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Aquamirror Focalization</strong>. This searches any Gishki Monster and it can banish itself during the End Phase to set any Aquamirror Spell/Trap from Deck or GY. Not only does it provide more consitency, but it gives access to&nbsp;<strong>Aquamirror Illusion&nbsp;</strong>which synergizes very well with&nbsp;<strong>Nereimanas</strong> as I explained earlier. 1&nbsp;<strong>Called by the Grave</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Crossout Designator</strong>. To reiterate, this Deck is very subseptible to handtraps and disruptions, so you need to protect yourself against those as best as you can. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity </strong>for more consistency. 3&nbsp;<strong>Salvage</strong> which is like a godsend in this Deck. It basically adds back <strong>Shadow</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Vision</strong> from GY which nets you more resources. And since it is not once per turn, you can amass a ton of resources if you have multiples in hand. 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> for disruption, but it is also a&nbsp;<strong>Crossout </strong>Target. 1&nbsp;<strong>Aquamirror Illusion</strong>. This card is good for reasons that I have already explained and&nbsp;<strong>Focalization</strong> can set it from GY so you only need to play 1.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Extra Deck only requires a few necessary monsters for your combo, so the rest can realistically be filled with anything of your choice. I am playing 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Downerd Magician</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Sky Cavalry of Centaurea</strong>. This is just a small <strong>Zeus</strong> package. You can also play&nbsp;<strong>Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</strong> since this Deck can make Rank 10's, but I would rather not use my Ritual Monsters for Xyz Materials. 1&nbsp;<strong>Herald of Pure Light</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Gigantic Spright</strong>. These are very playable Rank 2's in this Deck with&nbsp;<strong>Pure Light</strong> being able to add back a monster from GY and&nbsp;<strong>Gigantic Spright&nbsp;</strong>being able to do something like Summon a<strong> Gishki Abyss&nbsp;</strong>from Deck at the end of your combo to search follow-up. 2&nbsp;<strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong> and 1 <strong>EvilTwin's Trouble Sunny</strong> as <strong>Ultimate Slayer </strong>Targets. 1&nbsp;<strong>Accesscode Talker</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Avramax</strong> could realistically be any Link-4 you want to you into with&nbsp;<strong>I:P</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>. And finally, 1&nbsp;<strong>Marincess Coral Anemone</strong> and 2 <strong>Spright Elf</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Elf</strong> can be made with&nbsp;<strong>Abyss</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Grim</strong> and then it can Summon back the&nbsp;<strong>Abyss&nbsp;</strong>for another search. After your first&nbsp;<strong>Nereimanas</strong> Summon, you will have 2 extra WATER monsters on field which can be used to go into&nbsp;<strong>Anemone</strong> to Summon back&nbsp;<strong>Abyss</strong> again for another search.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Side Deck consists of 1<strong> Nibiru</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Ogre</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Effect Veiler</strong>, 1<strong> EvilTwins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Cosmic Cyclone&nbsp;</strong>and 1&nbsp;<strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>. If you think that&nbsp;<strong>Cosmic</strong> is a bit much considering that you've already paid 5000 LP with&nbsp;<strong>Photomirror</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Twin Twisters&nbsp;</strong>also works.

Fairly UR cheap with unneeded Extra Deck.</p><p>5. Works wonders in a format where most players run one piece of S/T removal via Duster,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cons:&nbsp;</p><p>1. Extreme disadvantage going second, relies on drawing the out via board breaker.</p><p>2. Little skill needed to learn (certified former Numeron player stamp of approval).</p><p>3. Be a YGO War Criminal.</p><p>4. Exceptionally weak against some control decks. Sky Striker and Eldlich eat this deck for breakfast.</p><p>5. Suspectable to Ash given you will likely not draw all your needed cards and could brick with too many pots.</p><p>6. Friend destroyer.</p><p>7. A continued contribution to the horrid Master Duel format.</p><p>8. Takes an extreme amount of time compared to most duels in a way that is not interactive.</p><p>9. Ojamas.</p><p>10.

This deck can go first and second with good prospects for the end board. Of course mystic mine because the sheer power is insane and the runick cards allow easy access to the mystic mine cards for board breaking or just mill with Runick Allure. The Tri-Brigade engine is a powerful engine that also goes well with the Beast Runick Monster. I added the Knightmare mosters and Masq for easy aces to the link zones when the Runick Monster takes up the EMZ. Overall this is a real contender for one of the best Runick Decks. Tri-Brigade is back. LETS GO!</p>

The build itself is pretty stale and that kinda makes me sad so as always I ask for your opinions in the comments.&nbsp;</p><p>Since I don't plan on explaining my main deck choices I will make up by explaining my side deck choices.</p><p><strong>Kaijus:</strong> As you can understand I side in Kaijus in case I have to second against a deck that brings out troublesome monsters that I would not like to deal with (some kind of negate - Toad for instance). Specifically, Gadarla is a pretty mainstream way to deal with Floos (although I only own 1 copy of her)</p><p><strong>Harpie's Feather Duster / Twin Twisters:&nbsp;</strong>Well classic backrow removal cards since I happen to face trap based decks (Floodlich for instance) pretty often</p><p><strong>Dark Hole:</strong> By no means I suggest using this card. The real reason I run this one in my side is 'cause (along with DRNM) it's a pretty famous meme in our local community. Still it can do it's job.</p><p><strong>Forbidden Chalice:&nbsp;</strong>This is my ultra budget alternative to Infinite Impermance since I still haven't bought my playset. Although a versatile card I firmly believe that Impermance is much better in the current meta so I would prefer running it instead. Nevertheless, Forbidden Chalice provides a potential negate.</p><p><strong>Contract with Eternal Darkness:&nbsp;</strong>Is there really anything to say about this card? It's effect is pretty insane and can help in a variety of matchups (although it won't help much against decks like Tears and Sprights and that's my reason for running Patent License on main instead).</p><p><strong>Contract with the Errors:&nbsp;</strong>This is an immense countermeasure for trap decks and it's ofc my trump card against them</p><p><strong>Contract with the WItch:&nbsp;</strong>A classic way to fight against cards like DRNM and Droplet, since it allows Siegfried to negate them by becoming the CL3 (CL1 - DRNM, CL2 - Witch, CL3 - Siegfried)</p><p><strong>Dimensional Barrier:&nbsp;</strong>One of the strongest floodgates in the format nothing more to say</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

The infamous field spell is what made Gravekeeper's popular but wait, there's more. Activate Necrovalley ----&gt; Summon Spiritualist ---&gt; Summon Supernaturalist ----&gt; Activate Hidden Temples ----&gt; Activate Royal Tribute ----&gt; Win the Game. It's the dream combo which many Gravekeeper Decks focus on but what do you do if that doesn't work? Well this Deck uses all the other better Gravekeeper Cards to have a weaker Plan B which does work quite often (Surprisingly). Let's go a bit more into Detail:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The many different options</strong></p><p>Gravekeeper's are slow but often they can get enough time through their various lockdown cards to get things started. With Burn, Crush and Beatdown options they can achieve the victory in various slower ways. They can prevent Special summoning and any interaction that is Graveyard related. They can even prevent the activation of other Field Spell cards too.</p><p>Cannonholder burns for 700 without a Once Per turn making it a stronger Cannon Soldier for Gravekeeper's only. Descendant destroys Cards without a Once Per Turn again. Both require Tributes instead which can be created through various ways within this Deck. You got recycling and Revival Power in the S &amp; T lineup. You also got a few slower ways to Special Monsters directly from Deck which is nice too.</p><p>The Big Boys in the Maindeck Oracle and Visionary can both be summoned with just one Tribute. Visionary is easily the strongest attacker and Oracle has some nice removal and weakening options build within. Him being Level 10 makes him the best Fusion Material for Supernaturalist on top of that.&nbsp;</p><p>A Omni Negation Counter Trap with Condition and no Cost and Supernaturalist as a very strong Fusion Boss are strong options on top of that. Your Main Card Necrovalley can be searched and recovered in many ways and should always be active. Both Supernaturalist and Shaman protect your field Spell from harm. The Priestess can act as Necrovalley too which is a good alternative if you can't find Necrovalley.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Problems </strong></p><p>Did you know Gravekeeper's were the first real Archetype ever? So you can kinda imagine there's some trouble ahead. One of your key Cards being Royal Tribute is unsearchable same goes for a Rite of Spirit and Gravekeeper's Stele.&nbsp;</p><p>Some Gravekeeper's revolve around Flip Summoning which is way to slow to always work nowadays. You often find yourself in a Situation were you play your Flip Monster Face Up to get a Hidden Temples of Necrovalley active.&nbsp;</p><p>And maybe the biggest downside is the absolute necessity of having Necrovalley active at any time to even work properly.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall the Tempo of this Deck is slow and if you don't get to go first there's often trouble ahead. Be mindful of that when you consider trying this Strategy. Then again if you go first you will win against the most Meta relevant Strategies with ease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final Words</strong></p><p>All in all this Deck works just well and consistent most of the time. I used it to grind my way to Diamond in Master Duel once but since then found other types of Decks more easy to get there. It's quite good and you might wanna give it a try!&nbsp;</p><p>Overall Rating: ★★★★☆☆</p>"

Let's go into more Detail:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>With Eyes of Blue</strong></p><p>The Goal of this Deck is to use the ""With Eyes of Blue"" cards to it's maximum to gain advantage. Unlike other Blue-Eyes Decks this one doesn't brick often and can summon BE Spirit Dragon and BE Twin Burst Dragon as early as turn 1. Use the powerful trap Ultimate Creature of Destruction and both recovery and search to repeat your go to Combo plus Ultimate Fusion for the big unexpected hit or Dragon Beacon of white to get a Blue-Eyes Monster which can easily attack 10+ times and finish the game.&nbsp;</p><p>The Priestess can Recycle Blue-Eyes back into the Deck which makes the desperation Move ""Rage with Eyes of Blue"" live whenever you draw it. Having a searchable Raigeki thanks to the Field Spells Graveyard effect being able to search Burst Stream of Destruction is the Cherry on top for this otherwise streamlined Archetype.</p><p>Yes there's more too this which I can't explain in full detail here but overall Blue-Eyes is a Simple to understand Strategy. The most unique part to this day with Blue-Eyes White Dragon is, that he's the unbeaten Champion in terms of ATK for Normal Monsters. Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon is the King of ATK for non-effect Monsters too.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The obvious Problems</strong></p><p>As good as all of it sounds your plays are quite limited and the Deck is missing some bigger surprises but in the right hands it's certainly better then your average Chaos MAX Dragon beatdown deck and looking at Master Duel you get swiftly to Platin League with it (Diamond is kinda a stretch with it).&nbsp;</p><p>You will sometimes find yourself in Situations with no Out against certain Cards the opponent is using. A Blue-Eyes Deck wants to overwhelm the opponent with strong beaters and strong defense but that's about it. Finest Kaiba Style Gameplay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final</strong> <strong>Words</strong></p><p>Lastly this Deck for reallife play is very Budget friendly compared to other Blue-Eyes variants and stays true to it's Blue-Eyes cards only. Give it a try if you like pure Archetype Decks or if you like to play a more simple type of Deck. I do find myself having fun to simply beatdown the opponent with pure Strength sometimes.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall Rating: ★★★☆☆☆</p>"
