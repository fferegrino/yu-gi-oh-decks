Dragon's Bind and Field Barrier are unsearchable 3-ofs, so you need to use 3 Pot of Prosperity to help you find them.  The side deck is filled with cards that be used by other build options for this deck.  One weakness of the deck is that it has no follow-up play even in the (somewhat unlikely) event it goes off. Since Black Garden can be reliably searched by a level 5 synchro, at the cost of only a tiny amount of consistency, 1x Terraforming, 2x Black Garden, and 1x Cynet mining can be removed for 1x Malefic Truth Dragon, 1x Foolish Burial and 1x Dragon Shrine to put it in the GY, and 1 more copy of Allure of Darkness in case it ends up in your hand.  Malefic Truth Dragon provides some recovery if they manage to get rid of Malefic Rainbow Dragon.  Another weakness is how bad the deck is going second.  By again removing 1x Terraforming, 2x Black Garden, 1x Cynet Mining, and 1x Upstart Goblin, and adding 1x Neos, 3x Neos Fusion, and an additional Rainbow Dragon, (or keep upstart) you can have Rainbow Neos' powerful board wipes for going second.  Alternatively, you could remove those same 5 cards for hand traps such as Ash Blossom and InfImp.  The last card in the side deck is Imperial Custom, which protects continuous traps.  If you play this card, it is possible to add it as 5th card to enhance the lockdown."

Get Light pulsar on the field and nuke it with phantom of Chaos coping sky scourges effect. You can use plaguespreader to manipulate the card you will draw after you nuke the field (BLS anyone). Light pulsar is also great for manipulating the grave by being able to summons himself from it by discarding a light and dark from your hand. The extra deck monsters that you use are M7 and Chaos Ruler. It's rare for me to use any of the others. When all else fails nuke the field and hope for the best.

Cynet Codec is one of, if not the most important spell in the deck, allowing you to search a new monster off of link summoning a Code Talker. In order to take advantage of this link-climbing capability this spell represents, there's one Code Talker of each attribute to maximize the potential Codec has. While this deck list may not be perfect, It's a general representation of how the deck likes to operate. Now that the intro is over with, lets get into the basic  strategies one can pull off using this deck. First off, lets go over what you're searching off of Codec: Micro Coder, Mathmech Subtraction and Addition, Scrypton, Code Radiator, Parallel EXceed, and last but certainly not least, Code Generator. Now let's go over each application each monster has. Micro Coder can be searched off of summoning Accesscode Talker, when Micro Coder is used as material in the hand, this will allow you to add a Cynet s/t, adding some consistency to the Codec strategy. If It's used on the field as material, you're given the choice of two level four extenders still remaining in your deck. Primary choices for this search includes: Mathmech Addition and Subtraction, and Code Radiator. Next up to go over is Mathmech Addition and Subtraction. Both of these monsters will be searched off of summoning Power Code Talker, however they do not need to be searched to be usable, as these monsters can be special summoned for free at your disposal. Next monster to be gone over is Scrypton. Scrypton is one of the two water-attribute monsters that you'll be searching off of summoning Shootingcode Talker. Scrypton primarily doesn't want to be in your opening hand, however if it manages to land there, It's still able to be used, as there's two water-attribute monsters you can search with Codec. That of which being Code Radiator. While Code Radiator is generally weaker than the other hand material monsters, It's attack-reducing effect isn't why were playing it. The primary focus of this card is to be used as link material in the hand, much like Micro Coder and Code Generator. Next up is Parallel EXceed, which is one of the most powerful extenders in the cyberse toolbox. The fact this monster is searchable and is that powerful is just...powerful to say the least. Anyways you will be searching this monster off of summoning Excode Talker, one of the lesser-played Talkers, but is used for the fact you can search such powerful monsters from it. Now moving on to to last of our list of monsters, we have Code Generator. Code Generator has a  diverse amount of options you can use its effect for. Not including the hand material effect. But we'll get to the plays it enables in our next section of this guide.  &nbsp;  Starter Cards And Combo Extensions:  &nbsp;  Your starter cards are how you're going to get your combos going. If those somehow get put to a halt, you have extenders hopefully in your hand so your turn doesn't end on a pitiful board. Your main starters are as followed: Clock Wyvern, Lady Debug, Dotscaper (If you open it). And with this small array of monsters, lets go over what you can pull off with these. Starting off with the one and only Clock Wyvern. Clock Wyvern is one of the few monsters that's immune to being hit by an Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. So when you summon it, you're going to want to make Splash Mage. And then use Splash Mages effect to revive the fallen Clock Wyvern. From there, you have an array of Code Talkers you can make (Assuming you have Codec out). The most common play to make here is going into Transcode Talker and reviving the Splash Mage you used as material (And searching a Code Generator if you happen to have Cynet Codec out on your field). And then finally making an Accesscode Talker using the Splash Mage and Transcode Talker you currently posses on your field. This gives you 2 link monsters for dealing with the opponents board, or just for the sake of having a beatstick (To my surprise it comes up a lot...but that Isn't your main focus with this card). Now onto our next starter, Lady Debug. This card has been used in multiple other strategies, one of the biggest being Salamangreat. But while this card may have high representation in cyberse-typed deck, lets go over how good this card is in a deck such as the one were going over. When you normal summon this card, it grants you the ability to add a level 4 or lower cyberse-type monster to your hand. This effect can be used to your advantage in multiple situations. This card also ties in with Balancer Lord, another one of our other uh...Support monsters...? I don't know how to describe it, but it works well with quite a few monsters included in this deck. The biggest being Lady Debug, because you can simply summon Balancer Lord, then normal summon Lady Debug, get your search, and now you have an extra piece of link material. Granted it Isn't much, but It's something. Cards you'd want to search off Lady Debug are usually monsters you can immediately special summon from your hand. Such as backup secretary or the two Mathmechs. You can also add a monster such as Dotscaper, for when you have a card like Code Talker Inverted, which would allow you to summon the monster you added and continue your combo. Now we'll go over how you can extender your combos. One way being the pitch you get off of Code Generator. The main card you'd send with this effect would be Dotscaper, which you could immediately special summon from the graveyard. Yes, yes I know, yell at me all you want for playing Upstart Goblin in 2021. But I swear, it works well with this deck! If you open with Cynet Codec and you use the effect of Micro Coder, you have two options here, you can either search Optimization for an extra normal summon. Or you can add Cynet Mining to search a needed extender for your combo. Hoping you have a card you can discard, if your lucky something like Dotscaper, but thats pretty unlikely, but something ive been able to pull of with Cynet Mining is discarding a cyberse monster, then searching a starter, then special summoning the monster you discarded and using its effect, assuming you can.  &nbsp;  Closing Thoughts.  &nbsp;  Now that we've gone over the essential info, It's time you've experimented with this deck yourself. There's many combinations you can use, many of which I didn't cover in this guide, because that's your job. Yes, you the person reading this. I hope you enjoyed this article as much as I had writing it, and I'll see you in the next one!"

There are pros and cons. <a>https://unlugarensilencio2guide.wildapricot.org/</a>  What drew you to the project, as a director?  - Bob, above all. I got the script, I saw that Bob Odenkirk was there and that Derek Kolstad has written. Interesting. But when I had almost finished reading, I realized what the film is really about.  <a>https://lucapelicula.wildapricot.org/</a>I saw an opportunity to make a film with a decent budget, an R rating, a big star, a studio film that not only has weapons and bullets and violent popcorn entertainment, but that also gave me the opportunity to work with a theme that feels new and exciting for this genre. <a>https://viejospelicula.wildapricot.org/</a>"

Ah the Phantom Knights, my favorite archetype of all time, and I'm glad you came here to check it out. This is one of the fastest combo decks at the rogue status. From spamming out XYZ monsters, to spitting out 7 negate boards, this deck is the complete package. And I'm happy you want to play them as well. Now, lets get into the main strategy, the Phantom Knights focus on banishing themselves for searches, sending more Phantom Knights to the graveyard, and they even work well with the never-dying Burning Abyss archetype. Hence the popular name PK Fire (Phantom Knights + Fire, and is also a reference to Ness' famous move). So, lets go over the main Phantom Knights. First up is The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots. This is one of the important ones, this card is essential for combos and helps get your spells and traps to set up your negates. Next is The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales. Arguably the best out of all the Phantom Knights, this one can special summon itself when another Phantom Knights is banished, which you'll find happens a lot. Next is The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak. Also one of the important ones, this is how you'll search your Silent Boots for combos. Next is The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves. This one Isn't used nearly as much as the others, but still comes up, It allows you to send cards like Phantom Knights' Wing to revive other Phantom Knights for extending combos. Last, and probably least, is The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves. We're only playing one for a reason, this card just doesn't come up that much. And that's not saying it never comes up, its just a lot rarer to pull of than the others. Trust me.  &nbsp;  The Extra Deck  &nbsp;  The extra deck is obviously very important to this strategy. And that's why were going over it! So let's go over the XYZ monsters. First off is The Phantom Knights of Break Sword. This Monster is really important, and what's also important, is that It's not a hard once per turn. So you can pull off multiple on the same turn, and you'll find out by playing the deck, is pretty good. Next up is Leviair The Sea Dragon, where do I begin, this card is just good. That's all that really needs to be said, aside from the fact you can bring back your banished Phantom Knights, and what's also cool, is that Leviair is conveniently rank 3. Next up is one of our tech cards, that of which is Zeus. Arguably one of the most powerful XYZ monsters currently in the game. You can stack this over an XYZ monster to bypass other monsters with destruction protection, such as annoying cards like Dragoon. Next is Raiders' Knight, this card allows you to OTK the opponent fairly easily, which is why were playing it. Next is Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon. This is what you're using Raiders' Knight to summon. This card is a beast, being able to gain ATK equal to every other monster on the field is good, and the fact it also negates the effects of every other monster on the field. Granted it negates yours as well, but that doesn't matter since you're just going to OTK with it anyways. Up next is Dark Requiem XYZ Dragon, and Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon. You use Break Sword to make Rebellion XYZ Dragon, more on that later. But for now we'll cover why were using this card. For one, Dark Requiem's negate effect Isn't once per turn. But the only reason were using Rebellion XYZ Dragon is just to go into Requiem, You'll almost never use Rebellion XYZ Dragon by itself. And that covers all the XYZ monsters, now we'll move onto the link monsters. First up we have one of the strongest links in the game, that being The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche (My favorite monster of all time). Oh boy, this card is really something. I could probably write a whole article dedicated to this card alone, but we'll cover this card later. Sheesh. Next up is Apollousa, Bow of The Goddess. This card is a big help with setting and establishing boards. Very very helpful. Next is Cherubini, Ebon Angel of The Burning Abyss. If you're not running this card, what's wrong with you...? It lets you pull of your main combos, and is great support when it comes to making Rusty. Lastly is Knightmare Phoenix and Knightmare Unicorn. These are just generic removal tools, nothing much to say about them. And that should cover the entire extra deck. Lets move on to the fun part, combos.  &nbsp;  Combos And Final Thoughts  &nbsp;  Now, here's where the fun begins. Here I'll go over the main combos.  Key: SS = Special Summon. NS = Normal Summon. Search = Add The Card From The Deck To Your Hand. GY = Graveyard. XS = XYZ Summon. LS = Link Summon.  NS Tour Guide &gt; SS Graff &gt; LS Cherubini &gt; Graff effect to SS Cir from deck &gt; Cherubini effect to send Cloak to the GY &gt; LS Rusty using Cir and Cherubini &gt; Cir effect to revive the Cherubini from the GY &gt; Rusty effect to send Scales to the GY and set a Fog Blade &gt; Banish Cloak to search Boots, SS Scales from the GY &gt; SS Boots &gt; XYZ Summon Leviair using Boots and Scales &gt; Detach Boots to SS Cloak from the banished zone &gt; Link into Apollousa using Leviair, Cherubini, and Cloak &gt; Banish Boots from the GY to search a Fog Blade and set it. So this basic combo ends on 5 negates. Obviously you shouldn't rely on this combo every game, but this is just to give you an idea of how this deck plays.  Now for a more advanced combo:  NS Scales &gt; SS Kagemucha Knight from your hand &gt; Use Scales effect to discard and send Cloak to the GY &gt; Link Scales And Kagemucha into Cherubini &gt; Use Cherubini to send Graff to the GY &gt; Use Graff effect to SS Cir from the deck &gt; Link Cir and Cherubini into Rusty &gt; Use Cir effect to revive Cherubini &gt; Use Rusty effect to send Ragged Gloves to the GY and set a Rank Up Magic &gt; Banish Gloves to send Wings to the GY, and SS Scales from the GY &gt; Banish Wings to SS Cloak from the GY &gt; XS Break Sword in Rusty's arrow, and use Rusty's effect to Destroy Break Sword &gt; Use Break Swords effect to special summon Scales and Cloak from the GY &gt; XS Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon &gt; On the opponent's turn use Rank Up Magic to XS Dark Requiem XYZ Dragon. And there's the end of the combo. There's a lot more combos you can pull off with this deck. Many I didn't list, because I like to leave some of the job to you guys. The deck I made and Submitted should serve as a template for this deck. Don't feel obligated to keep it this way, make changes to match how you'd like to play it. And that's all for this guide. Have fun, and I'll see you in the next one."

It's a funny format that plays like old school yugioh, but without some of the more unfair banned cards. The format also includes cards up to the set ""Shadow of Infinity"" giving it a bigger card pool. This deck is for people who want to say: ""screw all of that, I'm still going to sack you out with a bullshit OTK"".  Some important things to note is that this format uses some of the older texts of cards such as Exchange of the Spirit with the original text being: You can only activate this card by paying 1000 Life Points while there are 15 or more cards in your Graveyard. Both players swap the card(s) in their Graveyard with the card(s) in their Deck. Then, shuffle the card(s) in each new Deck and put it on the Deck Zone. Or DMOC who's original text reads: When this card is Normal Summoned or Special Summoned successfully, you can add 1 Spell Card from your Graveyard to your hand. A monster that is destroyed by this monster as a result of battle is removed from play instead of going to the Graveyard. When this card is destroyed or removed from the field, it is removed from play.  &nbsp;"

You can also use Darkfluid, Topologic, and some interruptions to supply your big boss. Don't know if the prerelease cards will show up, but it's just another reborn with a decent gy effect to pair with the other for some good loops. Still messing with the ratios of each reborn, probably should run A.Idle at 3.  The red and yellow skittles will be the one you want to see in your opening hand, and doyon is a great card to keep your plays alive.  Problems it runs into: Droll. If this gets thrown down on you, instant L. Kaijus, which is why i run strike. Otherwise, really fun deck that is actually now very powerful."

In the French ""The Last Mercenary"", he plays a former intelligence agent, who must return home to France when his son is accused of drug and arms trafficking. <a>https://wrathofmanfilmy.wildapricot.org/</a>  - It is an incredibly exciting project that allows me to try a new genre. I hope to take the action comedy torch in my own way. David Charhon has written a script that connects a beautiful and emotional story with lots of action and humor, comments the now 60-year-old van Damme. <a>https://thejourneyanime.wildapricot.org/</a>  Since 2002, Insomniac Games has taken us on both humorous, action-packed and colorful space adventures with the pocket watch Ratchet and the robot Clank in countless games. <a>https://krudsnovodoba.wildapricot.org/</a>  For a while, the series actually felt a bit worn out and there was a risk that ""Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart"" would also feel repetitive (which is the sixteenth part of the series). However, you do not have to worry about that, as it is an almost bloated gaming experience that was offered. <a>https://lucafilmovi.wildapricot.org/</a>  The adventure begins with our duo paying tribute to their many heroic deeds during a festival, where, however, everything goes completely wrong very quickly. A so-called Dimensionator that Clank had intended to give his friend as a present, so that he could look for his missing race in another dimension, is instead stolen by the villain Dr Nefarious. <a>http://community.gtarcade.com/thread/1358357-1-1.html</a>  He accidentally opens portals to a variety of dimensions, which take all three of them to an alternative universe where his even more powerful counterpart reigns.  The two heroes separate and Clank meets the lombax Rivet, who leads a resistance group against the evil emperor. Together, they must work together to stop Nefarious and prevent the evil robots from collapsing the entire multiverse. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://twitter.com/BnhaMovie3"">https://twitter.com/BnhaMovie3</a>  The story in is not revolutionary either for the game medium or for the series, but it is the dialogues and interactions between the different characters that shine the strongest here. During the journey, topics such as friendship, trust and insecurity are addressed, while there is almost always an accurate dose of humor embedded. The new character Rivet is also a far more interesting and complex character than the gullible hero Ratchet, with an exciting background story and a charming personality. The emotions reach out even more due to the brilliant voice acting (a bonus is that it is also possible to play with Swedish voices) and the characters' live minions."

If you're lucky, you can also get the drytron counter trap into that, but that plus everything else isn't going to happen all of the time. There are a few ways of going about your main strategy, but the key point is benten adds Vanity's Ruler, so you need to make sure you can add draconids to the hand if you don't have it. Mu Beta is great for getting you the right pieces you need, if you didn't draw them.  Chaos MAX and Quadrantids are great for turn two or following up. The extra deck is mostly and emergency options list. Dark Ruler no more is the worst thing to happen to this deck, although Nibiru isn't fun either, so watch out for those.  As for some other things, diviner of the herald is not present in this deck, because she costs an absolutely insane amount right now. This is a deck I am actually using, and $75 dollars a card is too rich for my blood. Manju does essentially the same thing, he's just not as flexible. Swap him out if you want. ZEUS is missing for a similar reason, but he would be cool to have if I was a little mmmmm richer."

It motivates me to play them more. For fun... I already have a meta deck (BBWs) and casual (Rikka) deck.  This War Rock setup is still clunky, but I'm seeing improved and smoother gameplay. Different than the few deck profiles I found around the intraweb and uuutube.  I'm weighing my cards into playing defensive Turn 1. So, that is why you are seeing mostly 1 of on most cards. Working on improving Barrier Statue Turn 1. Currently it is not that consistent. I know its cheesy but I find it being a very necessary evil to force your opponent to address; they will have to ADDRESS it.  Extravagance: Extra Deck is not super necessary. Most good targets will conflict with War Rock Mountain. Dante, hilarious can be played with War Rock and can be protected by War Rock Mountain. #cough Marauding Captain.  Marauding Captain can bring out Barrier(emphasis on Main Phase 2) or Fortia on its own Normal Summon. With Gactos, Special Summoning itself.  Book of Lunar Eclipse. Meteoragon can attack both face-down targets while negating effects during the battle phase WHEN it attacks then for the rest of the turn.  Solemn Strike,SS3, for the Monsters.  Dignity, SS2, for the Spell and Trap effects."

This deck aims to blind second and pick apart your opponent's board by using their monsters for your plays.</span>  <span>3 <strong>Ash</strong> and 3 <strong>Belle</strong> since this deck's engine is really small so you can fit a lot of handtraps to for going second. 3 <strong>Cipher Biplane</strong> which is just insane especially being a soft OPT on the level modulation. 3 <strong>Cipher Twin Raptor</strong> which is pretty much your only normal summon for the deck if you don't meet its special summon requirements. It also summons any <strong>Cipher</strong> from deck which gets you to<strong> Biplane</strong>. 3 <strong>Cipher Wing</strong> which is a free special summon. 3 <strong>Cipher Entranger</strong>. It may not seem the best, but it is the best discard fodder for <strong>Raptor</strong> and it searches a Spell/Trap. 1 <strong>Cipher Mirror Knight</strong> which is just discard fodder and it sets your hand for next turn.</span>  <span>Spells/Traps: <strong>One for One</strong>. 3 <strong>Prosperity</strong> which you can actually cut down to maybe 1 or 2 in order to play something that just gives the deck a higher ceiling like <strong>Avarice</strong> to recycle. 3 <strong>Double Exposure</strong> for Rank 8 plays. 3 <strong>Droplet</strong>. 3 <strong>Odd-Eyes Fusion</strong> which sets up your blowout<strong> X Dragon</strong> play. 1 <strong>RUM Cipher Ascension</strong> since <strong>Neo Cipher</strong> is just a house. 3 <strong>Imperm</strong>. 3 <strong>Cipher Spectrum</strong> which gives you somewhat of a greater reason to play <strong>Avarice</strong> since you are just burning through your copies of og <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</strong> each turn. 1 <strong>Cipher Bit</strong> which prevents destruction of 1 <strong>Galaxy-Eyes</strong>/<strong>Cipher</strong> Xyz.</span>  <span>Extra Deck. 1 <strong>Borreload Furious</strong> and 1<strong> Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</strong> as your <strong>Odd-Eyes Fusion</strong> targets. 1 <strong>Zeus</strong>. 3 <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon</strong> which extends your plays using your opponent's stolen monsters. 1 <strong>Neo Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</strong> which can detach ""UP TO 3"" to steal the same amount of monsters who can also be ranked-up into<strong> X Dragon</strong>. 2 <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon</strong> which you can rank-up into if you happen to steal an xyz monster and it pops 1. 1 <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon</strong> which pops 1 and floats. 3 og <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</strong>. Finally, 1 <strong>Odd-Eyes Rebellion</strong> and 1 <strong>Odd-Eyes Raging Dragon</strong>. I got this idea from an <span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/AxEgtKjj8oQ"">OCG duel</a> <span>where you would send <strong>Raging</strong> and <strong>Rebellion</strong> off of<strong> Odd-Eyes Fusion</strong> and then you would use 1 or 2 of your <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragons</strong> that have survived until your next turn or that is summoned from <strong>Cipher Spectrum</strong> to return <strong>Raging</strong> and <strong>Rebellion</strong> to the ED and summon them using your <strong>X Dragons</strong>. Now you have 2 board wipes. You also have up to 5 attacks between the two of them but the board wipe is the more important pay-off of this.</span></span></span>  <span>Side Deck. There are a lot of Traps so you can go first. This deck does not have any turn 1 plays and you can't make a<strong> Hope Harbinger</strong> either since <strong>Cipher Twin Raptor</strong> xenolocks you. We also have <strong>Nibiru</strong> and<strong> Twin Twisters</strong> for those match-ups. 3<strong> Cosmos Channelling</strong> which is a neat tech card. If you run out of <strong>X Dragons</strong> to rank-up your stolen monsters into, this card sends the stolen monster to grave to summon 1 machine from hand or grave. <strong>Twin Raptor</strong> and <strong>Biplane</strong> are machines so you can further extend your plays if you wanted to.</span>"

Most likely 3x Swap Frog 1x Ronintoadin instead of the Mermails, or reduction of Unexpected Dai. One copy of Transmodify can be replaced with Downbeat if you want Transmodify to brick less, but Downbeat only works well on Retort Fusion/Roaring Ocean Snake into The Great Emperor Penguin unless you also run the frogs. I originally considered Genex Undine and Crystron Rosenix, but you cannot use Skull Dread or Link Spider or Genex Controller in the all WATER variant that Ice Barrier / Ice Knight / Silent Sea Nettle forces.  Foolish Burial Goods sends Ice Barrier which lets you send then retrieve The Great Emperor Penguin. Aqua Spirit, Ice Knight, Unexpected Dai, Mermail Abyssteus, Instant Fusion and Retort Fusion can provide a tribute for TGEP without using your normal summon.  TGEP goes into Glacial Beast Polar Penguin and Nopenguin, which make Penguin Brave (Polar Penguin will also banish a card on summon at this point due to Nopenguin). Penguin Brave sets Penguin Soldier or Nightmare Penguin from your deck which triggers Nopenguin to revive itself. With one additional monster you can use it and Nopenguin to make Marincess Coral Anemone, which revives a discarded Barrier Statue, or a material for Stealth Kragen, or Glacial Beast Polar Penguin to act as a tuner for another Synchro.  Penguin Brave can flip Penguin Soldier up on the opponent's turn, which will also trigger Nopenguin to revive again, so it's free to use Nopenguin as materials for something and not keep it around on your turn.  A decent common end board is Penguin Brave, Stealth Kragen, Penguin Soldier (set) and usually Marincess Coral Anemone or Mistar Boy, potentially with Barrier Statue of the Torrent, and Nopenguin auto-revíves when you trigger Brave. At minimum you have Penguin Brave Penguin Soldier and Stealth Kragen so that's at least 2 monsters banished and 1 destroyed -- with Barrier Statue and either Stealth Kragen or Penguin Brave on field you can sort of bottleneck a non-WATER opponent with only one summon that will get destroyed or banished."

Youll see a couple of choices I made in the deck but it has his reasons like the dark rule no more you can use that going second if you lose the dice roll that's no problem you can top deck or have dark ruler no more in your hand so you're always capable of breaking a board if needed if they don't have any blowout cards like judgment or whatever but if you go first and you have a dark no more in your hand that's not a big of a deal because you can 1 draw and put back dark ruler no more with ferijjit effect or you keep it in hand just in case if you're playing against a FTK deck. You have something that can help you break the board if you survive  the turn  I'm playing the trap build because trap cards are amazing I love trap cards that's why I'm playing the trap cards I'm playing three trap cards I'm not counting the impermanence as a trap card more like a hand trap because impermanence is very good right now in the format but you can use it in your hand so it's like a pseudo effect veiler but a better effect further  I'm playing needle ceiling just to counter combo decks and ftk that they can produce a lot of summons a lot of monsters on the field there is there is a condition to needle ceeling but there is a condition to torrential as well. Yes you don't need to summon something and then avoid being TT’d but not a lot of people are expecting needle ceiling and a lot of people want to break boards and want to summon as much monsters as  they can and needle ceiling regards your own field so if you have two monsters they only need two monsters on their field you can also use that benifically against dino because NC doesn’t send face down monsters and your monsters have grave effects that wont lose timing. so there's an upside and downside to using that I love the card I've been testing against Dinos and drytron and it's it's very impactful against Dino because the misc protection effect doesn't protect in the battle phase so in the battle phase: needle ceiling and then break boards.  I'm also playing ice dragon prison because I dragon prison is a very good car to use banishing a monster way it's pretty good banishing tool is even better going into your second match you'll probably get lancia so your eyes are in prison will be unaffected against dry trans or something like that it's also not that great so UN contemplating if I want to replace the Azure in prison with hand traps such as droll and lock bird.  3x revolt just a great card in general he can plus, it can add cards to your hand and it can interrupt your opponent so I'm playing it at three if you open up revolt it doesn't matter at all you don't need to go into bearbloom you can go into ferijjit draw one card put there put the revolt back in if you draw two that's also fine you can stack your graveyard leave it at that go into farji make your hand better and then put the revolt that allows you also to play around nebiru more because you don't need the extra summon of bearbrumm and it won’t lock you into tri brigade when you use her effect to search revolt so revolt at three is the way to go in my opinion  To top off the trap cards i have solemn strikes uhm strike doesn't need any explanation it's very good trap card counter trap card yeah that's about it.  &nbsp;  The extra deck is kind of standard everything you will see in every other deck it's like a staple extra deck maybe you can switch around the doom eagle for a second rugal for the access code play synergizing with the revolt or simply a third shuraig but it won't come up so yeah the doom eagle is just a good interruption in your opponent's turn or just a FTK card."

Les monstres sont très récursifs, permettant de remplir le terrain rapidement, et le terrain force l'adversaire à dépenser pas mal de ressource. Le deck possède en plus un boss puissant, capable d'annuler tous les effets de monstre sur le terrain quand il est retourné. Le deck joue en premier pour préparer ses monstres flips, puis reprend l'avantage en invoquant une masse d'insecte.  &nbsp; <h2>Cartes clés</h2> &nbsp;  <u>Les petits Krawler</u> : Ils ont chacun leur propre effet flip, de la destruction de carte, de l'invocation spéciale, de la pioche, .... Ils ont en plus de ça un effet commun : s'ils sont face recto et qu'il quitte le terrain par un effet adverse, vous pouvez invoquer 2 Krawler de plus depuis le deck face cachée, avec leurs propres effets flips, cet effet inclut <strong>Deus X-Krawler,</strong> le boss de l'archétype.  <u>World Legacy in Shadows</u> : Le terrain de l'archétype. Il possède de nombreux effets smpathiques, notamment invoquer un insecte de lvl 2 depuis la main, face recto ou verso (cet effet fonctionne aussi sur<strong> Insecte Mangeur d'Homme</strong>). Il est aussi très embêtant pour l'adversaire puisque quand un monstre Flip est détruit au combat, le monstre attaquant est aussi envoyé au cimetière. Ca entraîne une double pénalité pour l'adversaire puisque les attaques activent en plus les effets flips.  <u>Les pièges World Legacy</u>: <strong>Pawns</strong> et <strong>Mind Meld </strong> joue chacun sur un effet des Krawler. Pawns permet simplement d'activer leurs effets flips quand vous voulez, mais Mind Meld lui permet d'activer le deuxième effet des Krawlers, puisque c'est bien une carte de l'adversaire qui fait quitter le terrain au Krawler (les Krawlers ne précisent pas qu'ils doivent aller au cimetière). <h2>Tips/Limitations</h2> &nbsp;  Si vous avez <strong>Mind Meld</strong> en main de départ, il peut être utile de laisser dès le premier tour un un Krawler face visible (le terrain le permet par exemple). Dès que l'adversaire utilise un effet qui semble important, vous le transformez avec  <strong>Mind Meld</strong>, vous récupérez votre Krawler et en rajoutez deux autres sur le terrain (dont un petit <strong>Deus X-Crawler</strong> bien embêtant). Le top du cool est ensuite de pouvoir retourner <strong>Deus X-Crawler</strong>  avec un <strong>Pawns </strong>pour complètement bloqué l'adversaire.  <strong>Combo Lib, World Legacy Key :</strong> 2 monstres sur le terrain, <strong>World Armor</strong> dans le cimetière (Effet <strong>Krawler Dendrite</strong>) En invoquant Lib alors que vous avez World Armor au cimetière, vous pouvez allez chercher dans votre Deck <strong>World Legacy Succession</strong>, l'activer, invoquer World Armor, et par l'effet de World Armor récupérez une autre carte World Legacy."

Le deck est capable de piocher énormément en premier pour aller chercher ces pièges. Le deck est néanmoins correct en deuxième, grâce aux cartes Magie/Piège de l'archétype qui ont toutes des effets de destruction. <h2>Cartes clés</h2> <u>Dragonic Diagram</u> : Une carte primordiale du deck, elle permet d'accéder à n'importe quel carte de l'archétype, que ce soit un monstre (principalement <strong><em>Ignis Heat</em></strong> ou <strong><em>Dinomight Knight</em></strong> pour aller chercher des Magies/Pièges) ou des Magies comme<strong><em> Héritage</em></strong> pour piocher plus pendant le tour.  <u>Les « Floodgates » </u>: C'est le nom qu'on donne aux pièges continus qui limitent l'adversaire dans ses possibilités de jeu. L'objectif premier de ce deck est d'optimiser ses pioches pour accéder à un maximum de ces cartes : <strong><em>Summon Limit</em></strong> et <strong><em>Monarch Erupt</em></strong>.  <u>Evil Eye :</u> Ce petit archétype rajoute pas mal d'options au deck.<strong><em> Sezriel</em></strong> peut détruire pendant le tour adverse et est dur à gérer équipées de l’<strong><em>œil maléfique. Retribution</em></strong> offre de l'annulation d'effet<strong><em>. </em></strong>De plus le contre-coup de détruire ses propres cartes est compensé par l'effet de « Revanche » des magies/pièges True Draco. <h2>Tips/Limitations</h2> Si vous avez plusieurs monstres True Draco sur le terrain et que votre adversaire active un effet, vous ne pouvez chaîner qu'une seule pioche à la fois, il faudra attendre d'autres effets de l'adversaire pour activer vos autres pioches.  Vous pouvez sacrifier des Magie/Piège continues faces cachées pour invoquer vos True Draco.  &nbsp; <h2>Combos/Synergies</h2> <u>Sacrifier vos adversaires</u> : <strong><em>The Monarch Stormforth</em></strong> + <strong><em>True Draco Apocalypse</em></strong>/<strong><em>True King's Return</em></strong>  Les deux pièges True permettent lors de leur activation d'invoquer par sacrifice un monstre True Draco. En activant<strong><em> The Monarch Stormforth </em></strong>pendant le tour de l'adversaire en plus d'un piège, vous pouvez invoquer un monstre de votre main en utilisant un monstre de l'adversaire. Attention à bien activer <strong><em>Stormforth</em></strong> avant le piège, ou après si vous faites les deux dans la même chaîne."

No Diviners - but still consistently sets up multiple negate boards. ,"This is similar to the Megalith Drytron build which some people were playing following the March ban list, however, with Mu Beta it is way more consistent and you're able to set up much better boards. I do not play Diviner as this is my IRL deck and the card is just really expensive. If you wish to play diviner, swap out the cyber petit, manju and purple light. The combos for this deck are still fairly lengthy so I'll add video links to them below.  The most effective two card combo is <strong><span>Zeta</span> + <span>Nova</span> </strong>which ends with <strong><span>Perfection</span> + <span>Apollousa</span> </strong> (Perfection will have a minimum of 3 or 4 negates - 1 or 2 Fairies in hand, plus Beatrice for an additional 2 after dumping Eva, also 3800 DEF.

Recording should start at any time, considering the premiere, which is December 16, 2022. Jason Momoa returns in the title role as the sea's most hunky superhero, Amber Heard plays Mera and Patrick Wilson becomes Orm. We do not yet know anything about the plot, but Wan has previously indicated that the new film is more serious: <a>https://conjuring3korea.wildapricot.org/</a>  The first ""Aquaman"" was a huge success for DC, and their only movie to date (besides ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy) which recorded over $ 1 billion. Believe it or not, the movies about the ghost hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren are actually based on real people who claim that several of the events being painted have taken place. But what exactly is the truth behind the films? <a>https://fastandfuriouspoland.wildapricot.org/</a>  The so-called ""Conjuring verse"" is growing bigger and bigger, and recently the eighth film in the series, ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" was released. The films follow Ed and Lorraine Warren, two paranormal ghost hunters who help vulnerable families and save them from supernatural dangers. The plot is recognizable from several horror films based on the Christian belief in God and the devil, with ""The Exorcist"" at the forefront, with the difference that the films in Warren's universe are said to be based on real events. <a>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCltxMIFko6OYsQW7wXRmJAA/about</a>  But how much of the source material is actually true? Can a series of movies that feature obsessed dolls, evil spirits, and haunted houses really contain a measure of truth? It seems to depend on who you ask and what level of proof you think you need.  One thing we can say for sure is that the main characters who appear most frequently in the film series, Ed and Lorraine Warren, really exist. <a>https://ok.ru/group/53982664261697/topic/153459086087489</a> The Warren couple have been working to investigate supernatural events in the United States for decades. They founded the New England Society for Psychic Research in the 50's and have since investigated thousands of reported supernatural events, haunted houses, etc. Several films have also been based on cases they have investigated in the past, including two films about ""The Amityville Horror"" - the house that God forgot. <a>https://mobile.ok.ru/group/53982664261697/topic/153459068261697</a>  In addition to writing books about the events on which the films are based, Lorraine Warren in particular has also been involved in the creation of the films, in an advisory role. It undeniably gives the films a greater connection to the real events that the couple investigated. How many of these stories are true, however, has been debated extensively over the years. As Lorraine herself puts it in a featurette with Warner: ""There are many who do not believe."" <a>https://wrathofmanfilmovi.wildapricot.org/</a>  The movie that kick-started the universe, ""The Conjuring"", is about the Perron family who move into a haunted house in Rhode Island. The house turns out to be a haunt for several spirits, some more vicious than others and according to an interview with Lorraine, most scenes in the film are completely accurately portrayed. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/ganzerfilm/comments/nwf3es/der_mauretanier_trailer_german_deutsch_2021/</a> Now, you may not trust Lorraine Warren, but the fact is that several members of the Perron family have also officially confirmed the truth of several of the events depicted in the film. According to the book ""House of Darkness, House of Light"", where Andrea Perron tells about her experiences, the large mansion was inhabited by several different spirits. They should mostly have performed innocent acts, such as lifting their beds lightly and moving their things. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/ganzerfilm/comments/nwe0xn/hotel_transsilvanien_4_eine_monster_verwandlung/</a> Cynthia Perron, the youngest sister in the family, says in an interview with Historycollection: “When we first moved in, for the first two months, it was a woman who came in every night and kissed me on the forehead, who I thought was my mother ”.  However, it quickly got worse and after a while the spirits must have started to become more unpleasant and, among other things, whispered to the children that there were hidden corpses in the house. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/ganzerfilm/comments/nwdjlv/das_wunder_von_fatima_trailer_german_deutsch_2021/</a> According to the Perron family, several of the scenes in the film must also correspond perfectly with reality. Among them, the clap-and-hide game was played on the family estate, a game similar to hide-and-seek where the family members hide somewhere in the big house and clap their hands as a clue to the seeker. ""The Conjuring"" contains a hair-raising scene where the mother in the family looks for her children but quickly discovers that someone, or something else, is also participating in the game. According to Andrea Perron's book, this event must have happened just like in the movie.  However, the film does not end as the real case. In reality, the Perron family claimed that it continued to haunt the estate, until the day they moved from there. The myth of Ed and Lorraine thus seems to be somewhat more beautifully painted than reality."

Luego de eso, dependiendo de cuántos tengamos, nos decantaremos por una de las 2 posibles rutas (explicadas en el video).  <strong>Extenders para iniciar el combo:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Tour guide from the underworld:</strong> Vale x3. Trae al campo a Graff o al Edge imp (el otro lo envías al cementerio usando a Cherubini). En todo caso, es el mejor normal summon del deck.</li>  	<li><strong>Phantom knights of torn scales:</strong> Vale x4. Envía al cementerio a Cloak para traer a Boots e invocarlo gratis. Luego, destierras este último para traer a Brigandine y al mismo tiempo invocar a Scales por su efecto.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk forward:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial desde la mano si no controlas monstruos, por lo que si lo robas, debe ser el primero en invocarse.</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha knight:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial cuando invocas otro monstruo de nivel 3 de modo normal. Ojo que puede perder timing.</li>  	<li><strong>Psychic wheeleder:</strong> Se invoca si ya tienes otro monstruo de nivel 3, aunque sólo es una vez por turno.</li>  	<li><strong>Psychic tracker:</strong> Igual que el anterior.</li>  	<li><strong>Gilasaurus:</strong> Se invoca casi gratuitamente. Ojo que el rival puede invocar algo del cementerio, aunque usualmente eso no es un problema.</li>  	<li><strong>Fossil dig:</strong> Trae al Gilasaurus.</li>  	<li><b>Reinforcement of the army: </b>Trae a Torn scales, Junk forward o Kagemucha knight.</li>  	<li><strong>Emergency teleport:</strong> Trae a uno de los Psychic gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish burial:</strong> Puedes enviar a Cloak para robar a Boots o Brigandine, o en su defecto enviar uno de los targets de la Tour guide.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck extremadamente consistente, tiene muy pocos bricks y/o garnets.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Se adapta a los recursos que tengamos en mano.</li>  	<li>Protegido constantemente por Apollousa, por lo que es difícil de contrarrestarlo una vez toca el campo.</li>  	<li>No requiere demasiados recursos para realizar el combo.

I realized this could work due to how many draws Soul Servant can give you, how many cards can stack the deck for The True Name to activate, and how good Soul Crossing is.  Magicians' Souls has to be at 3 for this concept to work, sadly. It lets you clean up your hand and send the Palladium Oracles to the grave before they become dead draws. You can run less Secrets of Dark Magic, but it does let you use dead monsters (like Dark Magician Girl, extra Rods, and the Palladium Oracles) as fusion material.  It's expensive and won't beat meta, but it's cool how consistent a deck with a god card and Dark Magician can be."

I’m back again with a new profile this time around, dinomists!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Now there are people who don’t know this even exists! Don’t worry, you came to the right place. I originally was going to do amorphage for my 80th deck but then I figured that it would be more suited for my 100th deck</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Dinomist are water machine pendulum monsters that appear in the dracoslayer lore.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Dinomist are split into a couple categories. They are very similar overall but let’s explain the verity here. There are 2 levels of dinomist, level 4 and level 5, then there is 2 scales, 3 and 6, only fitting their respective levels when pendulum summoning. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Every dinomist share something in common no matter what category it is in. They can substitute themselves if a dinomist card is in danger, they bail your dinomists out of card effects (some negates a card targeting a dinomist card) and battle (some just prevents destruction in general). This helps you pull your plays through and is really helpful in the grind game as well.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I used the standard dinomist ratios with a couple of my own twists. Here’s the list:</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 spinos, spinos is a way to push for game, its also able to wipe 5000 for the price of two tributes which is really powerful.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 rex, Rex is the boss of the deck, this thing twin attacks with piercing damage but what’s scarier is it’s second effect, you can shuffle a card from your opponents hand or field back into the deck, this doesn’t target and doesn’t destroy so you can even just out dragoon with this. It’s removal and hand rip made it a 3 of alone.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 speedroid passenglider, two things, one it’s a level 5 machine self summon, two it’s a scale if necessary</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 ceratops, purely for its self summon as a machine</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 brachion, same as ceratops, self summon machine</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 dracoslayer, as generic pendulum support this card helps grinding and consistency of the deck as well as granting access to new bosses</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 petran, a built in search effect that this deck can use actually! Plesois stacks pretty quickly and it lets petran search stuff</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 plesois, a weakener, normally this effect is bad but it stacks like crazy and helps a lot in securing your position</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 ankylos, this bad boy banishes monsters destroyed by dinomists! It’s also there to provide another level 4 in case it’s needed</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 charge, a search on activation with a built in recycle is really helpful in this deck and makes it worth playing at 3</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 allience, searcher for your dracoslayer and treasure, so why not play it?</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 treasure, a pendulum pitch that’s absolutely worth playing at 3, no less.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 the seventh one, it’s for a custom combo that I’ll explain later.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 upstart goblin, draw one because I had the space, so why not?</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 reload, igknight reload helps a lot in unclogging your hand, just be hopeful that they don’t ash it!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 dinomist roar, this is the best dinomist card in the game without question, it gives you removal, and your both of your scales set</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 dinomist charge, it’s to set up a dinomist into your extra, you can also keep the summoned dinomist with a scale sacrifice</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 fusion dracoslayer, the dinomist dracoslayer, it’s summoned by contact fusion and provides a bulky beater</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 synchro dracoslayer, as an extender and removal I felt like it would be best if I had it.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 infinity, free negates and remover off of nova</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 silent honor dark, the seventh one summon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 nova, just to get out infinity</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 bahumat shark, one for toadally and another for f0</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 silent honor ark, seventh one target</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 full armored black ray lancer, combo enabler</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 number 71, place the seventh one on top of your deck with this.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 toadally awesome, bahamut summon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 future dragon, free cheese if you summon bahamut shark</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 utopic future, to summon dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 musicia, remember when I said dinomists come in scales of 3 and 6? Odd and even? Here’s a card to abuse that (rip eletrumite though)</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 qliphort genius, the card that searches for you.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So I mentioned repeatedly that you can cheese out utopic future dragon and the seventh one, here’s how</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Summon bahamut shark by any means</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Bahamut shark summons number 71</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Overlay 71 for full armored black ray lancer</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Overlay both lancer and bahamut shark for utopic future, the Matthew had are detached</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Number 71’s effect stacks the seventh one</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Overlay utopic future for utopic future dragon.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">And that’s how you set up a negate, other than that the combos in this deck aren’t linear but after it reaches a certain points the deck is really good with resources.</span></p>"

Dawn Dragster","Main goal is getitng banshee in the graveyard while getting a tuner and another monster on the board to go into halqifibrax, into blossom, into linkuriboh into Balerdroch into Vampire Sucker on the first turn.  Optimally your first turn board will be Halqifibrax, Eldlich with conquistador set, Dragoon, ,Zombie world, with Vampire Sucker and balerdroch in the graveyard.  You go into Desert Locusts with Halqifibrax during your opponents main phase to make them discard a card then, if you get a level one on the board like dotscaper or millennium eyes restrict you can go into a spell/trap effect negate with the level 7 or if you use a Golden land you can go into the level 11 synchro with Halqifibrax which is alright.  Sometimes its better to have more monsters on the field then go into the synchro for Saryuja combos which will help to return the Red-eyes black dragon or dark magician back to the deck.  Extra deck is really tight the synchro set-up is all you can ask for from Halqifibrax, into Formula synchron (can miss the timing) or desert locust into the level 7.  Notes are I made this to be consistent with the banshee uni-zombie  halqifibrax combo. Reasoning is particularly interesting in this deck because you run a lot of different level monsters with graveyard effects and the Eldlich traps get their searches causing you to potentially go plus 5 over all in card advantage.  Deck is very powerful and feels pretty good to play I've gotten 1157 Wins this Banlist with this deck and 415 losses.  &nbsp;"

Link to his deck: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/abyss-actors-4/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/abyss-actors-4/</a>  Abyss Actors are basically an OTK machine(I mean, if you don't brick). You can use that power to go second and try to otk, or go first and try to control. <ul>  	<li>Combo Starters: 1.  Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser + Any Pendulum: This is one of the best combo starters, since it's a free special summon. Use them to link summon into Abyss Actor - Hyper Director and start the combo. 2. Abyss Actor - Extras/ Abyss Actor - Mellow Madonna: Put them together since both will end up doing the same thing(Extras will need an extra step of putting him in Pend. Zone, activating effects and setting Mellow). Adding a monster from your deck to hand. That card can depend of how good/bad your hand is. It can be an Abyss Actor - Superstar if you already have a high pend. scale monster, or adding a high pendulum scale monster if you don't have one... It depends of your hand. 3. One for One: Not an Abyss Actor card, but you have Extras, which is a lv1, and a combo starter... So yea, same thing as No2. 4. Abyss Actor - Wild Hope: In case of a really, really bad hand, you can suicide him, to get an Curtain Raiser or Extras. This is very risky and bad, but it's a option to be considered.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Abyss Scripts/Playhouse: Abyss Scripts(I'll use AS to refer to Abyss Scripts) are the Abyss Actors Spells. They're mainly used to interact with your opponent, but there are some who are good for the player. Most of the AS are only used because of their pop effect, since they give advantage to you. The most common way to activate these effects is by playing the field, Abyss Playhouse - Fantastic Theater. The field is very good, since it can add an AS and make your opponent destroy your setted AS, activating their effects. Use them wisely, but don't make it too obvious.</li>  	<li>Going First: Being the first to play is an problem. Since Abyss Actor is ""made"" to be an OTK deck, being the first means no OTK. BUT, that doesn't mean you get to do nothing. Abyss Actor can setup their field, play set rotation(with necrovalley in your side, if you don't have setted cards), make xyzs(if you don't lock your extra), use another pendulum supports, and others... Going first is not as bad as other casual decks and not as good as meta decks, but it's decent enough for you to try to live for a turn and kill turn 3.</li>  	<li>Side Decking: Side Deck can be anything that works well with Abyss Actors. I've put some examples, but there are other cards that are good as well. At the end, the side deck is at your own.</li> </ul> Good Luck and have fun with the deck. Any suggestions you can put in the comments or submit a deck yourself, marking me/the original creator in the description.  Electrumite to 2, plz Konami... Pendulums are dead without it."

I've always been a fan of the GX series so I built this Deck. The problem I have with it right now is knowing what Handtraps I should add so if anyone has some advice for me I would love to hear it.  The Current Strategy aims to draw one of the multiple searchers for polymerization and use the Searchers for the specific fusion materials. Right now the current hand I aim to go for is Elemental HERO Solid Soldier, Any Level 4 or Lower E-HERO monster, Fusion Sage/Fusion Recycling Plant, Honest Neos, Favorite HERO, and Neos Fusion. This is the combo I normally go for with this hand, which makes this Deck want to go second. <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Solid Soldier</li>  	<li>Activate Solid Soldier to SS the Level 4 or lower E-HERO in your hand</li>  	<li>Link Summon Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer</li>  	<li>Activate Devicer's effect to add Fusion materials based on the current match-up.</li>  	<li>Activate Fusion Sage/Fusion Recycling Plant to add Polymerization</li>  	<li>Fusion Summon Sunrise with the Heros you added from Devicer's effect.</li>  	<li>Add miracle fusion with Sunrise.</li>  	<li>Fusion Summon the monster you revealed with Miracle Fusion.</li>  	<li>Activate the Spell Favorite HERO to equip Sunrise or the monster you fusion summoned with miracle fusion.</li> </ol>"

This is an actual thing I made. Basically one day I thought about how Neos is a meta defining deck in Duel Links because Neos Fusion is a slightly restrictive Foolish Burial, which makes it good for control in that format, and I went ""but what if I did that."" And so from a combination of that and a bit of inspiration from that Shark Paleo Frog deck that did well in Challislme Monthly, I made a control deck with Neos Fusion as the centerpiece. And you know what? It's been pretty good. Strategy is fairly self explanatory, go first, summon Brave Neos with Neos Fusion sending Neos and Supreme King Back Jack (or Phantom Knights of Shade Boots, but Back Jack is better for playing around Duster and Lightning Storm, so I don't recommend doing that on turn one unless you drew literally no other interaction) and blow out the opponent with good staple traps. The Neo-Spacians and Connector seem like easy cuts at a glance, but the Neo-Spacians are really good discards off of Keeper of Dragon Magic, since you can summon them right back, and their effects even come in handy some times (better to have 2500 more LP turn one than not have 2500 more LP turn one). And Connector's recovery effect has come in handy for me a few times now. If you're going to cut anything from the main deck, I recommend making it either Miracle Contact, or maaaaaaaaaaybe a copy of Ice Dragon's Prison? Cuz your opponent's got to have a card in the GY for it to be activated? The Extra Deck is a lot more flexible, the only cards that are unnegotiable are Almiraj, Rainbow Neos, three Brave Neos, and at least one Verte. I highly recommend the Neo-Spacian's respective fusion monsters, though, just so you can summon them back with Keeper. The side deck is just a Waking the Dragon package you can flex game 2 when you know your opponent's gonna fade into sweepers like Lightning Storm. Feel free to put whatever you want in there. I honestly think this deck has potential to be, if absolutely nothing else, a somewhat competent Rogue deck. I'd put it on par with that Paleo Shark Frog deck I mentioned earlier, at least. I've seen way more success with this deck than I expected to, and I highly recommend you try it out."

Endymion, the magistus of mastery is your combo starter most of the times (he's searchable with spell power mastery), you summon him then use his effect to equip artemis from your extra deck into him and then use artemis's effect to search for any majistus monster from your deck which is mostly crowley, the magistus of grimoires one of your best combo pieces since its basically a free level 4 monster.  Notes: use endymion's second effect to destroy your artemis or your scales which will trigger their effect and draws you a card and on top of that shuffles garnets back into the deck and use crowley to send dissolver or jackal or mighty master to the gy to summon them later with selene.  <em><strong>The pendulum magicians:</strong></em> they provide you with easy spell counters cuz duelist alliance is a one card 3 spell counters, its a consistent way of summoning versital level 4 monsters to your field and also give you your pendulum scales which have great pend effects and monster effects.  Harmonizing magician: its your main aim to search for with pendulum call along side with any other pendulum magician depending on the situation (if you want a scale or if you want another body). It dosent matter what you summon with its effect its kind of there just cuz its a one card xyz.  Performapal celestial magician: this card can do some nice tricks but your best way to use it is to special summon it while you control another pendulum on the field so you can get a free search during the end phase which is mostly mighty master or jackal, and then special summon the searched monster during your opponent's turn with selene's effect for a nice negate.  Double irs magician: time pendulumgraph is a bonkers card and you want to search it using this guy's effect, you can destroy it in your pend scales using tornado dragon or magistus of mastery to get the trap, and it also have a great scale.  Magical abducator: it basically searches half of your deck why wouldn't you use this thing, it can also search magicians' soul, it doesn't happen a lot but keep that in mind.  Performapal odd-eyes dissolver: you use it mainly to summon magicians' soul and then summon it using selen and then use its effect to fusion into vortex dragon, so a free omni-negate.

Timestar magician: searches like 70% of your deck but you mainly use it to search magicians' soul to continue your plays  Divine arsenal bla bla zeus bla bla: eh....this thing is unbalanced  Number 60 : unbalanced in a balanced way"

The shaddoll fusion is for the added spice that makes this deck unique (Read: Inconsistent)  In all honestly, I am not entirely sure of the ratios to use for the Dogmatika and Shaddoll cards. Currently, I am considering cutting Fleurdelis and Schism. I am considering adding Dogmatika Nexus as the summon conditions can easily be met, but it is never wise to willingly add bricks. Ideally, ratios should be adjusted to allow for space to include Ash Blossom or Infinite Impermanence.  Note: May be worth trying to slot in Hidden Village of the Spellcasters. All monsters present are spellcasters.  Please give constructive feedback, as I am aware that this deck is attempting to combine conflicting archetypes. I simply like to have fun with novel ideas."

What sorcery is this?!  &nbsp;  All jokes aside, I love Flundereeze design-wise. Their monsters are based on diverse species of birds, and the backrow are based on multiple locations. Even the Field Spell is a map! So, I made my first ever Flundereeze deck, named after the Tokyo Port Wild Bird Park! It's a 61-acre nature preserve where vou can find various wild birds and other animals. So if you wanna go birdwatching in Japan, I reccomend going to Tokyo and visiting the Tokyo Port Wild Bird Park!  &nbsp;  As for this deck, you pretty much wanna go first at all times. The deck is really slow thanks to all the Trap cards, and it doesn't have much of an answer to your opponent going first."

This deck struggles to play through a single form of disruption like ash blossom. The potential is high but compared to decks like drytron/dragon link it doesn't have the same versatility and doesn't have the same grind potential as decks like eldlich/Invoked bs. There is a recourse loop but the retained cards are not proactive to compete with the current meta control decks.  If playing ocg i would take out imperm for crossout and replace the loose super poly with another cyclone or whatever you want. With Crossout designator i think this deck could be meta but im not sure when or if we'll ever get it in the tcg.

So I need to constantly find new ways to make it work. This is what I got, been doing me good on Dawn of a New Era unranked matches. Not the best deck but good enough imo.  Card by card/Explanations for what might look like dumb decisions and ultimately arent crucial to the deck and you are free to replace them:  Blue-Eyes White Dragon: Blue-Eyes White Dragon  Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon: Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon  Dragon Spirit of White: Same joke as previous 2, but you could use only 1 or go to 3 in all honestly, up to you and what you play a lot against. Also battle phase shenanigans, but this card almost never sees the battle phase, I usualy xyz or synchro it off. Also, it can tag out even under skill drain so that's pretty cool.  Chaos Dragon Levianeer: Free rank 8 80% of the time, sometimes a 3k beater that pops 2 cards. Usually you use the all light effect though. Searchable with Melody  Nebula Dragon: EZ rank 8 play, 1 less brick in a deck with more bricks than home depot  White Stone of Ancients: Best search for Sage, Cards of Consonance is a thing, and you get a free blue-eyes normie monster at the end phase. Dragon Spirit of White can get rid of backrow, or just have the big boy himself come out for a 3k beat stick.  Sage with Eyes of Blue: Sage with Eyes of Blue  Protector with Eyes of Blue: I feel this card is slept on. I used to use Glow-Up bulb to extend from my Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon plays, but Halqi exists and got my boy banned. So Protector is kind of that role. Only 1 though because you really don't want to draw into it, and only want to search it off of Sage if you can already make a decent board and don't need White Stone. Worst case scenario it's a Sage that doesn't search, which yeah isn't great but most of the time I see this card I'm using his effect to go into a Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon.  Return of the Dragon Lords: Monster Reborn for 90% of our deck with a banish to protect effect  Pot of Desires: it draw the cards. You can use Extravagance, but I feel like bad banishes with Desires are still better than if you get bad banishes with Extravagance.  Trade-in: Trade-in  Cards of Consonance: it's like trade-in for white stone but you also get the special summon at end phase  Melody of Awakening Dragon: Searches all our monsters in the deck besides tuners and nebula dragon.  Upstart Goblin: basically makes the deck 39 cards, and giving the opponent 1k LP doesn't matter  Skill Drain: Blue-Eyes tend to have higher base attacks than most anything else in the game. If you go first and draw into this and flip it on your opponent after having set up a decent board for yourself, you won if they can't out it.  Bingo Machine: Honestly just couldn't think of anything else, and I never played with this card before. It's not the worst, I also experimented with Dragon Shrine in its place and I just didnt like that, again, to each their own  Solemn Strike: I chose this over Judgement because it can stop Ash and in my own experience, that really shuts us down. I feel like Blue-Eyes decks kind of get 1 chance to make their board and any sort of disruption just loses us the game. We don't special summon enough for Nibiru to be a problem, and even if you do, you can still come back from that with cards like Return of the Dragon Lords, but most of the time if I get my Trade-In or Melody Ash Blossom'd I feel like I just wanna scoop.  Twin-Burst: Sometimes you can't get over some big booties. More or less Eater of Millions with a Blue-Eyes skin.  Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon: great tag out target for Spirit Dragon. Protection effect for all your  currently controlled dragons for 2 turns, also saves itself from being destroyed from Spirit Dragon's effect, also can special summon Blue-Eyes or Spirit of White from your GY. You can cut down to 1 if you are looking for more extra deck room, I like 2 incase I'm in a real grindy game and we both run out of steam, this puts me back in it  Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon: Super versatile, can go into 3 differnt extra deck monsters we have, negates GY effects, the ""no more than 2 special summons at a time"" effect comes in handy once in a while.  Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon: Yeah don't go into it too often, but enough that I think it's worth an extra deck spot. This is why I put Protector into the deck. Summon Protector, use effect to special another tuner from your hand, go into Spirit Dragon, tag out for Black Rose, return one of their cards, go into Crystal Wing so you don't lose a monster.  Black Rose Moonlight Dragon: bounce something troublesome back, if you have another tuner go into Crystal Wing as mentioned above.  Stardust Spark Dragon: honestly I don't use this one too too much, it's just been in Blue-Eyes decks for as long as I can remember. Feel free to replace with something you think is better  Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon: Draglubion target, sometimes better than Numeron Dragon. In which case you summon N92 and attack Numeron.  Number 100: Numeron Dragon: Usually best thing to cheat out w Draglubion, at minimum it will be a 9k beat stick. If you really pop off I've seen it go 25k.  Draglubion: Can cheat out 2 incredible cards.  Number 38 Hope Harbinger Titanic Dragon Galaxy: Go into if you know you're playing a deck that relies on a spell card to get their combos going.  Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord: Only used to go into Full Armor Photon Dragon. Also has a negate that might come up as useful now and again  Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon: 4k beater that can pop 1 card a turn.  Why no Zeus?: I didn't put in Zeus because I feel like Blue Eyes decks just kinda do what he does anyway.  I didnt include a side deck because honestly I change it constantly depending what I am seeing a lot of in the online matches I play.  That's all I have to say about the deck, hope the description was helpful."

The goal is to get your 4 card engine in the GY in order to bring out Ogdoadic Water Lily in order to special summon Ogdoabyss to wipe your opponent's field and potentially OTK with Draglubion/ Numeron combo, or if you can summon two Ogdoabyss' you can bring out Gustav/ Liebe combo. If you want negates, Lancelot is good but a double edged sword then compound him with AA-Zeus or you can make Apollousa. The last extra deck combo is Cipher Dragon summon, to overlay Full Armor in order to detach and pop a face up card on your opponent's field, then overlay for Cipher Blade and pop a facedown card on your opponent's side but always detach cipher dragon when activating this effect."

Dino DNA and Scrap Raptor is no different. The cool thing about Scrap Raptor is that it doesn't change the way Dino plays, what it does is make the final board even better. When you access the Scrap engine it's because your game is already running and it gives you greater game volume for a lot more possibilities, making the variables within your control for better decision. With only 2 Scrap Raptor + Chimera + Wyvern engine you have access to Savage and facilitate Links and xyz playing around Nibiru and Misc follow up. You still have up to 14 slots for tech cards game 1 and space for 19 after side. Of course, the deck keeps losing to the same hand traps and interactions that everyone should know by now. The best deck build for better preparation for tournaments depends on the meta call. In view of this I have tested too many Dino Scrap combos whether it is Artifact Lock, FTK, send Imperial Order with Curious and set with Gryphon, move with Halq and Auroradon, use extra deck with a lot of Synchro or a lot of Link. In the end, I saw that first any combo is only good if you use Golem and Chimera which are worse draw than Driver and second you don't do anything better than the deck already does without Scrap, third you lose for all hand traps, fourth detail is that most of the best end boards are made with the Giant Rex which means no Follow Up Misc making your deck horrible turn 3 and 5 you try to play Dino going first which is horrible because either you brick more than going second or make a board that loses to power cards as it used to. So for me the Scrap engine is only good if you only use Synchro Savage and use a lot of xyz like Bagooska, Dugares, Zeus, Excitom Knight to get the most value from this engine and nothing else. I'm still wondering if it's worth playing compared to the standard build (sometimes the board feels a little unecessarily overextended, and maybe a bit weaker to Nib) but it has some great perks (especially the access to Savage, the possibility to play more around Lancea and instant lose cards like TCBO and IDP, and access to another two card combo in Scrap Raptor + Lost World and Scrap Raptor + Miscellaneousaurus). I still recommend playing second with this deck even though most decks are Dice Roll made to use a lot of Go First cards. Always remember that Dino is a bad deck compared to the Tier 1 of the format, he has to be an excellent technoplayer to get a good result with the deck.  Engine cards you can take post side: Giant Rex and one of the Scrap Raptor. But remember that with just one Scrap Raptor you cannot use the Wyvern's second effect. Against Drytron and Dragon Link: You take all Lost Worlds because DLink bounces and Drytron has Linkuriboh in GY.  Options that can be used in place of Zeus: Unicorn - most recommended Cerberus - is better than Unicorn in some respects as far as Phoenix can be co-linked with Wyvern, can destroy lost world token, be link 2. Hiita or Aussa - Hiita accesses Misc or Dogoran if you side use it instead of Qoatlus. Aussa accesses the Babys, Rex, Pankratops and Scrap Raptor."

The priority should be getting out Empen, because he provide access to the counter trap and a restriction on your opponents monster effects. Bird of bringing can get you either an extra normal summon off the field spell, or one of the simorgh birds if you have enough tribute fodder and still have a normal summon to use. Draw power ratio is probably a bit high in this deck. It's an early version. They can probably be swapped for handtraps. Ideas for cards to use are in the side deck."

If you like it enjoy. If you don't, thanks for trying and give me tips, please, keeping it in mostly Zexal-Like","This is for a Fanfiction I'm working on that takes place in Zexal times but I liked the aspect of the Rikkas plus Number 87 was never in the anime or manga so here's my attempt to put this decent card into it. Also, it's a Shark x OC so this is why there are sharks in this deck as well as they help get bigger monsters on the field to get the effects either on the field or grave.  Getting Rikka Petal on the field first is a strong start even if she gets destroyed on the next turn because she gets brought back instantly if you only have plants or no cards at all in the monster zone. Using Petals other effect to get Snowdrop in your hand or already having her is perfect. If you have a plant on the field just activate Snow's effect Special Summoning her after tributing that plant then get out another Rikka sets you up marvelously to get out either Teardrop or Number 38 if you have two thanks to Snow's other effect of changing levels making them level 8 or if you have three and use Snow's level change effect get three Level 8s out there's Number 87 right there. Lantern shark helps when you wanna get Number 37 or Abyss Dweller. I would go Abyss Dweller if you can since it raises almost every card in this deck's attack by 500 including itself.  Testing this against DuelingNexus' Time Theif bot using Master 3 rules, 4000 LP (cause this is an Anime based Fic) and in a 1v1 situation I did pretty decent but the bot could have just had crap hands and I got lucky so I wouldn't hold my breath on its game-winning strats against actual people.

If you like it enjoy. If you don't, thanks for trying and give me tips, please, keeping it in mostly Zexal-Like","Got a couple of cards backward Sorry  This is for a Fanfiction I'm working on that takes place in Zexal times but I liked the aspect of the Rikkas plus Number 87 was never in the anime or manga so here's my attempt to put this decent card into it. Also, it's a Shark x OC so this is why there are sharks in this deck as well as they help get bigger monsters on the field to get the effects either on the field or grave.  Getting Rikka Petal on the field first is a strong start even if she gets destroyed on the next turn because she gets brought back instantly if you only have plants or no cards at all in the monster zone. Using Petals other effect to get Snowdrop in your hand or already having her is perfect. If you have a plant on the field just activate Snow's effect Special Summoning her after tributing that plant then get out another Rikka sets you up marvelously to get out either Teardrop or Number 38 if you have two thanks to Snow's other effect of changing levels making them level 8 or if you have three and use Snow's level change effect get three Level 8s out there's Number 87 right there. Lantern shark helps when you wanna get Number 37 or Abyss Dweller. I would go Abyss Dweller if you can since it raises almost every card in this deck's attack by 500 including itself.  Testing this against DuelingNexus' Time Theif bot using Master 3 rules, 4000 LP (cause this is an Anime based Fic) and in a 1v1 situation I did pretty decent but the bot could have just had crap hands and I got lucky so I wouldn't hold my breath on its game-winning strats against actual people.  Anyway GL HF and Hold my Snowflake Umbrella"

This was kind of a challenge cuz tiger was an essential piece for the deck to function and that was the thing, my obsession with tiger overshadowed the fact that lunalight had so much other great cards and interactions to work with, stuff like purple butterfly, serenade dance and emerald bird etc...  <span><em><strong>NOTES :</strong></em></span>  <em><b>Luna light perfume: </b></em>this card is just irreplaceable, use its second effect to discard cards that gives you value even in the gy, your main searchable cards depends on the situation, if you have yellow marten in gy search for wolf, or just go for kaleido chick if you dont have something to normal summon and again just be smart and add cards that will execute your combos best, also dont use it on danger! monsters even if it sounds like a good idea but no its better for you use their full effect to maximize the value and lastly, most of the times you want to activate this card rather than just send it the gy.  <em><strong>Lunalight serenade dance: </strong></em>this card's main purpose is to go in the gy....thats it..serenade dance's is a meh card but its second effect tho is bonkers, again use the cost to send your valuable cards in the gy and dont use it on danger! monsters cuz it does not discard and thats actually a great thing since it triggers your emerald bird's second effect.  This deck has some kind of raw power to just go thought handtraps but you can remove parallel exceed for move protection like 2 triple tactics and a called by the grave, other than that its kind of the same you just replace tiger with butterflies and wolves, ah yes speaking of wolf that thing is kinda cool but you just use it to otk with style using your fusions and to return it back to hand to summon zephyros and marten."

I've decided to add it because I already use Isolde. The core of the deck is pretty standard PK Fire. Here's the other cards that you might not see in other profiles.  Isolde is a fantastic card for just about any warrior deck. I actually prefer it to Laviair for extending. The ability of special summoning just about any warrior trivializes needing to have that warrior in hand when needed. Renaud is in incase I draw an equip card. Renaud can further extend with sending DDR or Living Fossil with Isolde, and getting chosen Equip Spell back with Renaud's effect.  Shadow Mist goes right into Dark Law when brought out with Isolde. Dark Law is an intimidating monster for your opponent to deal with. They'll have a hard time playing around it.  I've shown that I use the Artifact package. Dagda into Scythe can put a stop to your opponent's plays that use the Extra Deck. I can use Rusty's destruction effect to destroy Scythe on my opponent's turn by special summoning a dark Xyz monster with Rank-Up. I can also get an added effect if I'm able to get Abomination onto the field too. Which is also another monster that my opponent will have to deal with or suffer it's effects.  The equip cards are what I think would be best. DDR and Living Fossil are the best using Renaud. The other two can be whatever you'd like, but I think these two work the best of any Equip Spells. Steal your opponent's monster from they're GY. And Shooting Star Bow to drop your opponent's attack by 1000. This can make Apollousa lose two negates!  I like the deck at 44 cards to reduce the chance of drawing unwanted cards like the BA and Equip Spells. 44 cards don't seem to reduce the deck's consistency either. It feels like a good balance.  Extra Deck might change a little. It has what I want. But I think I can lose I:P and Zeus without missing them."

Also you can draw hand force them to draw and law them. Also dynatag is the best one after you summon dystopia off of it , so it always has a pop.  Dark world dealings, Saw a profile on youtube and am testing this card, and i love it. Summon dark law turn 1 , then activate this card and force them to draw discard and then dark law rip one. Making them start their turn with 4 cards. Also helps fix bad hands , and also moved shadow mist to 3 because of super poly and dark world dealing discards, helps having better discards.

Any two level 1 Flunders with the field spell makes it consistent through Ash/Imperm. Without the field spell, the deck is fragile.

However, I only make decks with cards I actually own in real-life as I want to be able to play with what I have.  The most important card in the deck is the field spell Heavy Metal Raiders, as it can protect your monsters in battle and help you summon out more in the process.  This deck is definitely not a combo deck, but there are some fun plays/strategies you can apply:  If you manage to draw Cyber Stein in your opening hand, you can attempt to use his effect to special summon The Last Warrior From Another Planet.  Crackdown/Mind control can be used together with a level 6 monster in order to facilitate the summoning of Dhampir Vampire Sheridan.  If you are prepared to take some damage to your life points, you could main deck Jinzo #7 while having Heavy Metal Raiders in the field zone. For example, say your opponent attacks your Jinzo #7 with a Blue-Eyes White Dragon. After taking the damage, your Jinzo will now have 3000 Atk, while once per battle phase being unable to be destroyed in battle, with the ability to attack directly for a lot of damage."

This deck works best going second so you can use cards like Lunalight Fusion to bust out more powerful Fusion Monsters if your opponent has already special summoned something from the Extra Deck. One combo to try out can work with Kaleido Chick and Purple Butterfly in your hand. Use Kaleido Chick to send Blue Cat or Yellow Marten to the Graveyard (Which one you send depends on what you need. If you don't already have a fusion card like Polymerization or Lunalight Fusion, send Marten. If you do already have one, send Cat). If you send Marten, you can grab a Lunalight Fusion from your deck to use to bust out pretty much any of your Lunalight Fusion Monsters should your opponent have an Extra Deck monster out on their field. Then use Purple Buttefly's ability to resurrect Blue Cat if that's the card you sent with Kaleido's ability so you can double your Fusion's ATK and easily OTK your opponent.  Another great combo makes use of Fraktall to send Kitt and then Nervall to the Grave, then add a Kerass to your hand. You can Special Summon him if you have another expendable monster in your hand, or normal summoning works just as well for what comes next. Next, use Kerass to Link Summon Ferrijit by using the monsters in your Grave, then use Ferrijiit's ability to bust out another Tri-Brigade card from your hand. Then you have a great number of things you can do from here. You can use the three monsters on your field to Link Summon Borrelsword or Shuraig, or go into Rugal and then Shuraig to lower your opponent's monster's ATK first, but no matter what you do you can use Ferrijiit's ability to draw an extra card, plus you still have your one Normal Summon at your disposal to bust out even more monsters afterwards if you used Kerass' ability to Special Summon him out on the field.  All-in-all, this deck is amazing at delivering swift, decisive blows to your opponents that can overload your monsters with ATK points to deal 8000+ damage in one turn. It's all in how you decide to use it."

Bahamut can break boards, TCBOO, Utopia Doubl","Modern twist to <strong>Evilswarm</strong> that I've been tweaking.  There are other variants that can work with a different hand trap arsenal (room for 9), or even cutting down to 6 and adding 3 <strong>Allure of Darkness or Triple Tactics Talent</strong> since the deck can have some minor consistency issues in the opening hand, and can have a tough time against hand traps.  Your win condition is most often going to be <strong>Ophion</strong> shutting down Level 5 specials vs. the wide range of decks which focus on just that. <em> (EX. <strong>Dogmatika Invoked</strong>/any <strong>Invoked</strong> variant, <strong>Dinos</strong>, <strong>Adimancipator</strong>/<strong>Eldlich</strong> <strong>Synchro</strong> variants, etc.)</em>  Against decks like <strong>Zoodiac</strong> and other meta <strong>R4NK</strong> spam decks, you're typically praying for <strong>TCBOO</strong>, or other floodgate locks since <strong>Ophion</strong> falls flat in most cases.  You may want to protect these with <strong>Key Beetle</strong>, if possible<em>.  You could consider teching in <strong>Safe Zone</strong> if you want that 2014 JOTL <strong>Dragon Ruler </strong>format feel, if you want to swap to a heavier floodgate variant.  <strong>Safe Zone</strong> has some fun interactions, and can even potentially take your opponent's monsters with it if it's destroyed blindly.</em>  <strong>Utopia Double OTK Combo</strong>, or stealing a monster with <strong>Bahamut</strong>, attacking, and then overlaying <strong>Zeus</strong> can also help to close out these games. Hitting your opponent's Normal Summon with <strong>Imperm</strong>/<strong>Ash</strong> can very often leave a board hanging with an &lt;2k ATK monster, leaving them open to a huge 10k ATK anime swing from the OG <strong>Utopia </strong>to close the game. <em><strong>Bagooska</strong> and <strong>Origin</strong> can help to slow down and simplify these games states as well, with support from your plethora of hand traps and incredibly strong/versatile backrow options.  </em>  Simply making an <strong>Origin</strong>, and running something over for a free <strong>Kerykeion</strong> into <strong>R4NK/Ophion</strong> play can be a great option too, and activating <strong>Exciton</strong> under <strong>Origin</strong> can be absolutely devastating in the right situation.  <em><strong>Torrential</strong> is a very viable tech option for this reason, depending on the meta.</em>  In my opinion, going <strong>Infection</strong> vs <strong>Pandemic</strong> with <strong>Ophion</strong> search is often the way to go, just because a nearly guaranteed <strong>Kerykeion</strong> safety net for the next turn can be huge if your board is broken.  <em>Obviously if you know you're facing a S/T heavy deck, <strong>Pandemic</strong> will likely be the better option if <strong>Ophion</strong> is worth protecting.</em>  <strong>Crackdown </strong>is an insanely strong trap in this deck as well.  Stealing something like <strong>Aleister</strong> can completely shut down the <strong>Invoked</strong> engine for the turn, and provides you with <strong>R4NK/Link</strong> fodder next turn.  Ideally you want to keep whatever you steal as XYZ material when possible, but you can just as easily link them off for <strong>Unicorn</strong>, <strong>Phoenix</strong>, or even <strong>Apollousa</strong> when the situation calls for them.  If <strong>TCBOO</strong> is effective vs the deck you're facing, consider swapping <strong>Crackdown</strong> out for side deck options in Games 2&amp;3.  Other Floodgates (<strong>EEV</strong>, <strong>Anti-Spell Fragrance</strong>, etc.) are good choices if they're viable, or something like <strong>Evenly Matched</strong> when going 2nd.  <em>If <strong>TCBOO</strong> isn't viable, keep <strong>Crackdown</strong> and replace with a more viable floodgate/tech options.</em>  I'm not a huge fan of <strong>Allure</strong> unless you run Dark hand traps such as <strong>Dimensional Shifter</strong> or <strong>D.D. Crow</strong>.  It may be worth it if you run 3 of either, plus main deck <strong>Mandragora</strong>?  But I would rather try to fit in <strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong> if you want extra draw power, just due to it's versatility and how hard hand traps can hurt because the deck can be so reliant on <strong>Rabbit/Dai/RotA</strong> as starters.  <em><strong>Dai</strong> and <strong>RotA</strong> can both double as <strong>Ash</strong> bait, when needed.  </em>  <strong>Iron Dragon Tiamaton</strong> is another super interesting tech option for a Dark ""hand trap"", and if you summon <strong>Ophion</strong> straight to your EMZ, you can slow a lot a decks down substantially if you're able to land <strong>Tiamaton</strong> to lock out the other EMZ.  This card also has FANTASTIC synergy with <strong>Origin</strong>, providing a super soft domain lock by blocking <strong>Origin's</strong> up arrow if summoned beneath it in the same column, only allowing your opponent to SS from the extra into the opposite EMZ.   It will also give <strong>Origin</strong> protection if you summon beneath it in the same column, even if there is no monster on your opponent's side above it.  This variant is super fun, and I recommend it as well.  <em>Keep in mind, this is very good Game 1, but your opponent will often be prepared for <strong>Tiamaton</strong> later in the match.</em>  &nbsp;"

This is basically a deck of aquas that feature penguins as the main stars.  Favorite tech in this deck is the Supay combo that gets me penguin brave and its face-down without a normal summon.  End stage goes, penguin brave + penguin soldier facedown + adamancipator dragite + toadally awesome and/or traps.  Best hand is Supay, duskwalker + royal penguin garden + 3 cards that are sexy."

Here are some guides with the specific cards.  The Agent of Mystery - Earth and Master/Majesty Hyperion alongside random card: <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Earth, search Neptune.</li>  	<li>Link Earth into Almiraj</li>  	<li>Discard Neptune to revive Earth</li>  	<li>Use Almiraj and Earth to summon Halq, use Halq effect to summon Plaguespreader Zombie</li>  	<li>Summon Master/Majesty by banishing Neptune in grave, search Sanctuary in the Sky</li>  	<li>Use Plague and your Hyperion to go into Master Flare and use its effect to copy Venus</li>  	<li>Venus/Master Flare summon the 3 Shine Balls, use Plauge in grave to put a card on top of Deck to revive</li>  	<li>Use Plague and a Shine Ball for Arc Light</li>  	<li>Use remaining 2 Shine Balls into Masquerena to summon an Avramax on your/opponent's turn or a Knightmare Unicorn if needed</li> </ol> Diviner of the Herald and random card: <ol>  	<li>Summon Diviner, send Trias</li>  	<li>Trias effect to revive by tributing Diviner</li>  	<li>Diviner effect to summon Buten from Deck</li>  	<li>Buten and Trias summon Master Flare that'll copy Venus</li>  	<li>Use Master Flare with Venus effect to summon 3 Shine Balls</li>  	<li>Buten effect in grave to turn a Shine Ball into a Tuner, use 2 Shine Balls, including the new Tuner for Halq</li>  	<li>Halq summon Plague, use Plauge and the Shine Ball for Arc Light</li> </ol> The combos could probably vary and be improved on with certain cards in hand or whatever route you wish to take. Pot of Avarice is nice to recover Shine Balls to continue making plays as you desire."

Strategy is to dump your Light/Dark monsters by any means necessary - be it Link Summoning, Chaos Space, Mask Change or Adusted Golds effect and summon BLS.  You use Summoner Monk to either get Nurse or, if you already got to it, Shadow Mist on the field (+ Mask Change on the hand).  After that you make Dark Law through Mask Change (II) and give it to your opponent through Creature Swap.  Now you can infinitely loop a Curry and two Primal Seeds to burn for 200 and retrieve the pieces.  Well, and the Kuribohs are also here. They're Dark/Light, you can get to them, you can get them into the GY, one is a Fiend which is good for Evil Mind ... you get it."

The Shoot-Effect can destroy 0-3 monsters and works best in the opponent battle phase, if you special summon it you can still try to shoot. When it gets destroyed or discarded you get <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> from the deck to the hand.  <a data-name=""Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher"">Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher</a> – strong 'dark machine'-monster that can be special summoned to get fast link-4 or link-5 monsters. The second way of using it is to summon <a data-name=""Desperado Barrel Dragon"">Desperado Barrel Dragon</a> when it gets destroyed. You can summon it in either turn from the graveyard, then you have to banish 8 cards, but it also has a good impact. If you summoned it and it is on the field you can use the destroy-effect in your next turn, if you want to use the destroy effect it's best to summon it in the opponent's endphase, because you cannot activate both of it's effect in one turn. It's also good as a 'free-discard' for <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon</a><a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">, </a><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> or <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> since you use the special summon effect anyway, and it works from the hand and from the graveyard.  <a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a> - you can special summon it by special summoning a generic dark dragon, so you only need a rokket-monster, if you only have one you can link-summon <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> (link-1) to special summon it, then you can draw a card when you link summon it. You can build <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a> with it since it is also a dark dragon, if it is in the graveyard it can maybe protect a face-down card, then it gets banished and you can maybe bring it back with <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a>.  <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a> – <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a> can also be summoned with <a data-name=""Escape from the dark dimension"">Escape from the dark dimension</a> even when it is a trap, because the trap does not get destroyed by <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a>'s effect and the negation happens after the summon. It can maybe get special summoned with Heavy Metal Raiders from the Hand if a dark machine destroys a monster by battle or card effect. Most decks only use monster-effects as negates, but traps are still very important as a backup so it's often good to summon <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a> if you have a normal summon left. You can also discard it with <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon, </a><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> or <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and special summon it later from the graveyard.  <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> – you have a chance to shoot a card with it with. It has a low chance but since you can target all cards it's still good, it's good to have at least one in the deck, because <a data-name=""Desperado Barrel Dragon"">Desperado Barrel Dragon</a> can get a toss-coin-monster to the hand.  <a data-name=""Unknown Synchron"">Unknown Synchron</a> – a tuner, a special summon and a dark machine for <a data-name=""heavy metal raiders"">heavy metal raiders.</a>  <a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon"">Absorouter Dragon</a> – a special summon that works with rokket monsters, you get another rokket monster to the hand with its effect. The efffect triggers when it gets destroyed but also when you use it as link material or for a fusion summon.  <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> – it can special summon other rokket monsters that you can use for link summons then. When you play a spell-card like <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> or <a data-name=""Quick Launch"">Quick Launch</a> you can chain the quick effect to it, then the spell-card still triggers and you don't have to destroy any cards. When you already have a link 2, or link 1 monster in the Graveyard, the best choice is normally to get <a data-name=""Rokket Recharger"">Rokket Recharger</a> to synchro summon <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>.  <a data-name=""Rokket Recharger"">Rokket Recharger</a> – it's good as a level 4–rokket card to synchro summon <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>. If a dark link/fusion/synchro-monster gets destroyed, and you have it on the hand or on the field, then you can discard it to special summon itself or another monster from the graveyard, but not the monster that got destroyed. It can also not get targeted when you have a dark link/fusion/synchro-monster.  <a data-name=""Anesthrokket Dragon"">Anesthrokket Dragon</a> – when it gets destroyed you can special summon a Rokket-monster from the deck, but you have to wait for the end-phase (yours or the one of your opponent). It also has a trigger effect when it gets targeted by a link monster, then you can destroy it to negate an opponents monsters effect, and to make it unable to attack. It can can not get triggered by <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> because it is already a dark monster, so It can only effectively be used with <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> as a quick effect, it does also not get triggered by <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>'s effect from the Graveyard.  &nbsp;  Spells  <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>, <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a>, <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a>, <a data-name=""Squib Draw"">Squib Draw</a> - draw-cards, with <a data-name=""allure of darkness"">allure of darkness</a> you can summon monsters with <a data-name=""Escape from the Dark Dimension"">Escape from the Dark Dimension</a> later.  <a data-name=""Heavy Metal Raiders"">Heavy Metal Raiders</a> – dark machines can not get destroyed by battle one time, so you can also attack monsters with higher atk to get the same atk as them, but you have to pay the difference in life points. When a dark machine gets destroyed you can special suimmon a dark machine from the hand. If you have no dark machine you can link-summon <a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>.  <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a> - You get this field spell early by link-summoning <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> (link-1) with one Rokket-monster, so you can change it later to <a data-name=""Heavy Metal Raiders"">Heavy Metal Raiders</a> or destroy it with <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> for one more monster on the field. When you have 2 Rokket-monsters in the hand, you can use one to summon <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a>, get <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a>, destroy <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> to get the rokket monster to the hand and then special summon both Rokket-monsters with the effect of <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a>. then you have 2 rokket-monsters, this means you have to get one more monster with <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a>'s effect or other special summons to summon <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>. If you only have 2 Rokket monsters, you can build <a data-name=""Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres"">Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres</a>, but it can only be summoned when you didn't use <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a>'s effect, because it's a light monster. As an alternative you can also build <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> and use one of the opponent's monsters to summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>. <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a>'s second effect can special summon rokket monsters from the graveyard if the opponent has more monsters and didn't clear this field spell.  <a data-name=""Quick Launch"">Quick Launch</a>, Scapegoat, Instant Fusion, Monster Reborn – Special summon cards, with <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> you can 'eat' one monster with <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> and you can build a link-monster with it. with <a data-name=""Quick Launch"">Quick Launch</a> you can build <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a>. If you have <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> on the field you can choose <a data-name=""Quick Launch"">Quick Launch</a> as destroy-target to have 3 rokket-monsters then. With 3 rokket monsters you can build a link-4-monster and you can decide between <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> ist the best card because it can negate, but <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> can 'eat' monsters by 'atk'-ing them, with one more monster you could also build <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a> and then build the other 'boss-monsters' later since you get one rokket-monster everytime you use it's effect.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Traps  <a data-name=""Escape From the Dark Dimension"">Escape From the Dark Dimension</a>, <a data-name=""Call Of The Haunted"">Call Of The Haunted</a>– These cards give you more monsters on the field, <a data-name=""Escape from the Dark dimension"">Escape from the Dark dimension</a> works with <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>. If you used <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a> to get a link-4 monster or <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> out of 4 Rokket-monsters, it also will get banished when it leaves the field. This way you can summon a link-2 monster with <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a> very fast without <a data-name=""Allure Of Darkness"">Allure Of Darkness</a>. Another possible targets for <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a> are maybe <a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a> if it's GY-effect is used that protects a face-down card, and <a data-name=""Borreload Furious Dragon"">Borreload Furious Dragon</a> if you use its special summon effect.  <a data-name=""Dark Illusion"">Dark Illusion</a>, <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a>, – good negate cards, Dark Illusion works for Spells/Traps and monster effects, and <a data-name=""fiendish chain"">fiendish chain</a> also stops the monster from attacking. <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a> can also be used as a target for <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a>, but if it gets destroyed the opponent monsters effect is also not negated anymore, it's still worth it as a target. It can also trigger <a data-name=""Chain Whirlwind"">Chain Whirlwind</a> when you destroy that monster in battle, because then it gets destroyed by a card effect. It is also a bit more a hard negate than <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> is because it also effects normal summoned monsters. A second way of using it is stopping the opponent monster from attacking when you have <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a>, or if you summon it as a trap in the end-phase, then its effect can destroy a monster that didn't attack.  <a data-name=""Chain Whirlwind"">Chain Whirlwind</a> – good backup card, <a data-name=""Chain whirlwind"">Chain whirlwind</a> can get triggered by all destroy-effects, if you have a quick-effect-destroy-effect, you can destroy 2 spells/traps as a quick effect in the opponent's turn. Since you destroy a monster every turn it is better than <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a>.  <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a> - it can summon <a data-name=""Borreload Furious Dragon"">Borreload Furious Dragon</a> out of 2 generic dark dragons from the graveyard. In the deck are 7 rokket-monsters and 2 dark dragons, in the extra-deck are 8 dark dragons, but only <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> is link-1 and easy to summon very fast, when you summoned <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> with one roket-monster you can use <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a> with both in the graveyard.  &nbsp;  Extra Deck:  Fusion:  <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a> – dark Fusion Targets, if you use <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a> for a link-summon you get <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> to the hand if it is in the deck.  <a data-name=""Borreload Furious Dragon"">Borreload Furious Dragon</a> - '<a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a>'-target for a fast 'boss-monster' that also has a special summon effect to revive <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a>.  Link-1:  <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> -  it's used for <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>, <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a> and <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a>  Striker Dragon - It's the best first link-monster because you can get one more monster on the field with it very fast, and you can draw one more card from the deck. When you have for example <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> but nothing else, you can summon <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> with it, destroy it with it's effect, and then summon <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> again from the hand, after you got it from the graveyard, with the effect of <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a>, then you can destroy <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a> to get <a data-name=""Rokket Recharger"">Rokket Recharger</a>, this way you have to destroy the field spell but you get a <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> with only one <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a>, it can only negate one card then, but it's a 'once per turn'-effect anyway so it's still a good 'boss-monster'.  Link-2:  <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, <a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> – <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> can be used for fast fusion-summons to 'eat' monsters, <a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a> is a dark machine that also protects <a data-name=""Heavy Metal Raiders"">Heavy Metal Raiders</a> and could bring it back from the graveyard if needed and <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> is good to shoot spell/srap-sards and to draw cards.  <a data-name=""Hieratic Seal Of The Heavenly Spheres"">Hieratic Seal Of The Heavenly Spheres</a> - it's a backup link-monster if you only have 2 rokket-monsters and no 'special summon'-card in the hand. Then it is better than summoning <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, because you can counter one of the opponent monsters in the opponent's turn and also get a rokket-monster from the deck. You can get <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> and destroy it with the quick effect to get <a data-name=""Anesthrokket Dragon"">Anesthrokket Dragon,</a> or you can get <a data-name=""Anesthrokket Dragon"">Anesthrokket Dragon</a> directly because when it gets destroyed you can special summon a rokket-monster in the end phase of the opponent's turn. You can only summon <a data-name=""Hieratic Seal Of The Heavenly Spheres"">Hieratic Seal Of The Heavenly Spheres</a> if you did not use Rokket Tracer's effect because it is a light monster. As an alternative you can also get <a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon"">Absorouter Dragon</a>, then you get a Rokket-monster to the hand instead of special summoning one when it gets destroyed.  <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon</a> – These Link-monsters work only with the Rokket-monsters, but you can also use Noctovision dragon or <a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon"">Absorouter Dragon as dark dragons</a>. To combo them you need 3 Rocket-monsters. Then you can link 2 of them to <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a>, and link <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a> with the last monster which has to be a Rokket-monster to <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon</a>. Then you can discard one card and shoot <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon</a> to summon 2 rokket monsters and <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a>, to summon <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> with <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a> on the field or to sumnmon <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> directly as a link 4 monster that can 'eat' monsters by 'atk'-ing them. <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> is the best option because it negates an opponent's card and also has 3500 atk then like <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a> when it has <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon</a> equipped (1000 atk/2 = '+500' atk). <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a>'s second effect destroys a monster in the opponent's end phase that didn't attack, this stops the opponent from only summoning a link-monster or another effect-monster with lower than 1600 atk in attack position. This is more powerful if you summon <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a> in the End-phase with <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a> or <a data-name=""Call Of The Haunted"">Call Of The Haunted</a>. When it gets destroyed after you used the 'graveyard-summon'-effec' it gets banished, this way you can use <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a> directly if you have it.  Link-4, Link-5:  <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a> – Good Link-4 and Link-5 cards, With <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a> you can summon one Rokket Monster every turn and also negate monsters until the end of the round. So <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a> is much better than <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> and it can also attack all monsters, <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> is good to eat monsters with it's effect but it has no destroy-immunity or 'negate'-effect.  Synchro:  <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> – If you have a link-2 monster in the graveyard it is a good negate, that can also be sumoned very fast with the effect of <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a>. You can summon it in the first or second turn with the Rokket-monster combo's that summon more Rokket-monster's with their effects. You need <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> and and <a data-name=""Rokket Recharger"">Rokket Recharger</a> and a link-2 monster in the graveyard, you can also use <a data-name=""Unknown Synchron"">Unknown Synchron</a> as a level-1-monster with <a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon"">Absorouter Dragon</a> as level-7-monsters. <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> is always the best opening monster, except you can directly build <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a> and summon it later. When it gets destroyed it is easy to summon another <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> because you only need one <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> and use it's effect to get <a data-name=""Rokket Recharger"">Rokket Recharger</a>, so it's best to have two <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>'s in the extra-deck.  &nbsp;"

It is an understatement to say that it bears some cards that will change the landscape of ,"Lightning Overdrive officially releases June 4th this year. It is an understatement to say that it bears some cards that will change the landscape of the current meta-game. It isn’t Rise of the Duelist level, which gave us Infernobles, Dogmatika, Schism, and ridiculously great staples. However, it brings the power and consistency levels of two specific decks to a peak that will surely shake the foundations of competitive Yu-Gi-Oh! as we know it. Let’s take a look at what it’s going to bring, and what handtraps are going to be run to adjust to it.  Diviner of the Heralds is one of the big cards coming out in Lightning Overdrive (LIOV). This, along with Mu-Beta Fafnir, will 100% bring Drytrons back to contention. Diviner dumps a fairy monster from either the extra or main deck to the grave to increase its level. This will practically add 3 more copies of Benten. You can send Herald of the Arc Light to go ahead and search it. That, in turn makes it a level 6 which could set-up Beatrice plays. Dump Eva to search your handtrap – Herald of Orange Light. Several routes will open up, one of which can end-up setting an Imperial Order via Beatrice and Knightmare Gryphon. If that wasn’t good enough, it could also send Natasha or Lancea to then make itself level 7. It’s a tuner, so any level 1 will then get you to Chaos Ruler.  Drytron’s ceiling has always been absurdly high, with Herald of Ultimateness being a non-OPT omni-negate that can also negate summons. The only problem after the Union Carrier and Benten hit, was consistency and resiliency with all the handtraps running around. With Diviner making Benten accessible again, and Mu-Beta taking care of getting an extra Drytron name in grave (plus saving resources from the Ritual Spell) – Drytron will definitely have enough gas to compete, and potentially beat, most match-ups in this developing format.  <a>https://theconjuring3-onlinefree.tumblr.com/</a>  Bearbrumm hasn’t even officially dropped yet and ZooBrigade is already topping several events. This will give close to 100% access to Tri-brigade Revolt. This, as explained in my previous article, is an unthinkably amazing card. ZooBrigade has already been a top deck in the OCG for a while now. That can be attributed a little bit due to Maxx “C” being legal there, and Tri-brigade cheating out link summons. What that means is, even through Maxx C – the deck can still pump out a full board. Revolt will be live while only giving the opponent 2 draws. With Tri-Brigade already finding success without Bearbrumm, it will only skyrocket their performance once LIOV is legal. Especially since they can dodge handtraps by chainblocking Bearbrumm.  <a>https://groups.google.com/g/the-conjuring-3-2021-korea/c/l_wb4kwYIpw</a>  Cycle Reader is one of the handtraps that popped up when Drytron was at its peak. We can definitely expect to see this card more often again after LIOV. That being said, its versatility might become a little less valuable, since Eldlich has fallen down the meta hierarchy.  Skull Meister is another handtrap that gained popularity during the Drytron-VW era. With Drytrons on the rise again (and with Scrap Raptor, Dinos are going to surge in representation too) this will increase in viability. Being able to hit several things across the board will be beneficial for most decks. Any Drytron name in the grave (or Benten), Bearbrumm / Nervall if they don’t chain block, Misc / Raptor, Prank-kids, etc.  Infinite Impermanence has not seen play in quite a while now, and for good reason. Virtual World monsters activate from hand, Drytrons in both hand AND grave, Prank-kids in grave, and it just is very mediocre against heavy-combo decks like Dragonlink. With Mu-Beta being a big part in the Drytron strategy (dump a name, replace ritual materials), this card might get a competitive resurgence. In addition to that, using Impermanence on a Tri-brigade monster that banished for cost could be huge. Their only extender will likely be a Kerass. And even then, they might not have enough resources to finish their combo.  A huge chunk of people have already been maining Droll &amp; Lock Bird – and rightfully so. It’s really the only handtrap that can assure you that Dragonlink is going to end on a very subpar board. With Drytron coming back into the fray, this ol’ trusty tool will become even more of a staple. Oh, and don’t forget that Tri-brigade (and other Zoo variants) usually go for Tenki, too!  Nibiru has been a menace since the moment it came out. It gradually saw less and less play, especially as we headed to a more control-based format. We had Dragonlink as the deadliest combo deck (and even then they could play around Nib with Seal). Drytron loses to Nib a little bit harder now than it did before (early Benten searches allowed for tricky timings). Tri-Brigade also has a Ratpier combo that gets them Drident-Apollousa-Revolt that plays into Nib extremely hard. This, in conjunction with the still-present popularity of Prank-kids, could potentially make Nibiru great once again."

Your endboard should look something like this:  Dolkka+Dweller+Laggia+UCT  of course you can change it to whatever the matchup is, but for going blind first this is pretty good.  now i will show you a basic combo with Baby+Misc which you can watch here: <a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=578705-29238003</a>  the combo goes as follows: Activate Misc effect to discard, activate second effect of Misc to banish and Special Summon Archosaur from the deck, Archosaur effect will trigger to destroy the Baby in hand so we can search a Double Evo Pill, Baby mandatory effect will trigger to special Oviraptor, Oviraptor effect will trigger to search another Baby,Normal Summon the Baby then Activate the second effect of Oviraptor to destroy the Baby and Special Summon the other Baby from the graveyard, then again Baby mandatory effect will trigger to Special Summon Scrap Raptor, activate Scrap Raptor effect to destroy the Baby on the field so we can make a second normal summon with a Scrap Monster, then once again Baby mandatory effect will trigger to Special Summon Giant Rex, Then link off the Archosaur into a Linkuriboh and then Link off the Linkuriboh and the Scrap Raptor into a Scrap Wyvern, Then activate Scrap Wyverns effect to special summon scrap raptor from the graveyard and destroy the same scrap raptor you just Special Summoned Both effects of Scrap Wyvern and Scrap Raptor will trigger, chain link 1 will be Scrap Wyvern chain link 2 will be Scrap Raptor,so you will add Scrap Chimera to the hand <span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">through Scrap Raptors effect and then you will Special Summon a Scrap Raptor from the deck </span><span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">through Scrap Wyvern`s effect, Then destroy the Scrap Wyvern (read Scrap Wyvern if you dont understand what i mean), Then overlay Oviraptor and Scrap Raptor into Dolkka, then Normal Summon Scrap Chimera then its effect will trigger to special summon Scrap Raptor from the graveyard then overlay giant rex and scrap chimera into Abyss Dweller and activate his effect and detach Giant Rex <strong>IT IS VERRY IMPORTANT YOU DETACH GIANT REX SO YOU CAN SPECIAL SUMMON HIM THROUGH HIS EFFECT!!!</strong> then activate Double Evo Pill and banish Giant Rex and Linkuriboh to Special Summon Ultimate Conductor Tyranno then Giant Rex effect will trigger to Special Summon himself then overlay Giant Rex and Scrap Raptor into Laggia and there you have it :) </span>  This is just one combo you can do but theres many others i would list them here if there werent so much of them and i if i wouldnt be so lazy :P.  I encourage you to play the combo i showed you to see how everything works im pretty sure when you understand what you have to do you will find the other combos verry quickly.  Now just something about some of the Card choices:  Pot of Prosperity will help you find your missing combo pieces or if you already have everything you can search for a gamma it is usually a good idea to dig for 3 but if you really need something just dig for 6 u can also use it to bait a Ash Blossom from your opponent.  One for One is pretty self explanatory it summons a Archosaur straight from the deck so you can combo off  Instant Fusion is there to Summon Milenium-Eyes Restrict it will give you handtrap protection so its verry good if you dont have a gamma in your opening hand  and thats pretty much it i hope that my explanation of the combos arent too complicated if so just leave a comment :) all in all i hope you have fun with the deck and if you have any suggestions please leave them in the comments bellow :)  &nbsp;  <span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en""> </span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This deck doesnt need the normal summon, so I use thunder king rai-oh and denko sekka as normal, since theyre great floodgates that have no drawbacks for this deck. I also use cyber dragon because you can use him to summon its fusions without poly and get rid of a monsters from my opponent field. Also I run eater of millions and pankratops, cause they are very easy to summon and are very good for outing my opponents monsters. I run super poly as well, since there are plent of targets in my extra deck that can easely be made with it, so I can get rid of my opponent monsters while having monsters on my side of the field."

This card game is old, but it is still popular today. This is due to the continuous emergence of new cards. Interestingly, in this patch there is an OTK deck that is very effective to play. The OTK or One Turn Kill deck uses the Fortune Lady archetype. How about the deck, let's see the explanation below.  <strong>Fortune Lady Light</strong> The first card is Fortune Lady Light, a one-star Light monster who can Special Summon other Fortune Lady monsters from the deck when she leaves the Field. This card is usually combined with Fortune Lady Past and Fortune Lady Water for additional Draw.  <strong>Fortune Lady Wind</strong> The next card to be added to the deck is Fortune Lady Wind, a one-star wind elemental monster in the online game Yugioh Duel Link. With this card, we can destroy the enemy's Trap or Spell cards a number of Fortune Lady monsters in our Field. By using Fortune Lady Wind, we have a fairly strong Back Row removal.  <strong>Forbidden Lance</strong> Because this deck is a combo, of course we don't want our combo to be disturbed by opposing players. Therefore we need Spell protection that is able to protect the combo. In the Fortune Lady deck, the Forbidden Lance has excellent synergy.  <strong>Fortune Lady Calling</strong> By activating Fortune Lady Calling, we can summon other Fortune Lady monsters from our deck. However, keep in mind that we must have the Fortune Lady monster in the field first. With this card, we can perform OTK combos in the online game Yugioh Duel Link more easily.  <strong>Fortune Lady Vision</strong> Sometimes we brick during Draw, which causes the combo not to work. However, by including Fortune Lady Vision into the deck, the chances of us bricking will be smaller.  <a>Duro de Cuidar 2 Pelicula Completa</a>  <a>Godzilla vs Kong 2021 Pelicula Completa</a>  <a>El Conjuro 3 Pelicula Completa</a>  <a>Un Lugar en Silencio 2 Pelicula Completa</a>  <a>Rapido y Furioso 9 Pelicula Completa</a>  <a>Cruella 2021 Pelicula Completa</a>  Gamers need to recognize and play exciting and fun games that you can play other than those mentioned above, such as online play log games.  That's the composition of the OTK deck using the Fortune Lady archetype in the online game Yugioh Duel Link. Hopefully this article is useful, and you can catch up with the King of Game rank. Success."

Dragite is just a Spell Negate, which can be incredibly threatening against many decks.  Abyssalacia can be made with any 2 monsters in the Merlantean typings (Fish, Aqua, Sea Serpent), but is best setup by <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Deep%20Sea%20Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> summoning <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Neptabyss%2C%20the%20Atlantean%20Prince"">Neptabyss</a>, whose effect gives you Atlanteans to discard for Abyssalacia's cost.  Crocodragon is more difficult to make, as a Level 9 Synchro, the only really consistent setup in the deck is having Mermail Abysspike discard <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Atlantean%20Dragoons"">Dragoons</a> as cost, searching <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Lappis%20Dragon"">Lappis Dragon</a> as well as a Level 3 WATER monster. This setup can also make Abyssalacia if needed, which is sometimes relevant for her float effect.  Finally, Dragite is made turn 1 off of <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Genex%20Undine"">Genex Undine</a>. Once again you dump Dragoons to add Lappis Dragon, but having one less level you can make a Synchro 8. The deck is on no Rocks for the first effect, though you can still activate it if you want to get the top 5 cards to the bottom of your deck, for some reason? Once again, this setup can make Abyssalacia if needed.  A final thing of note is that much of this deck is ""dumb"" techs. The Gorz-likes have been mostly fine in my play, though running Ra and not just Guardian Slime is somewhat suspect. In all my play of this deck I have not resolves Cataclysmic Circumpolar Chillbania once, and am leaning to it being a bad card. Additionally, LANphorynchus is entirely unneeded in this build, it carried over from builds on more complex Undine combos that did need it, but I would not run it in hindsight."

The same prob","For those of you who are still playing Yu-Gi-Oh! until now, maybe you guys feel that Konami. not very good at balancing their own games. The same problem can be seen in DotR.  When you understand how to play DotR optimally, this game becomes very easy -- too easy, in fact. There are very few parts of DotR that are challenging, and that challenge comes from having overpowered cards that players can't use.  Grinding in DotR is also a big drawback. In DotR, the enemy's Deck Leader generally has certain skills. To get the same skill, players must increase the rank of Deck Leader. The rank of the Deck Leader can be raised by using the same monster as the Deck Leader as often as possible. However, this grinding process was very, very slow, taking hours just to acquire one skill.  Of course, in the gaming era like now, any game can be repaired with mods, especially old games that can be played via emulators. However, unlike Forbidden Memories, Duelists of the Roses does not have a modder community that actively issues dozens of mod variations. Fortunately, a DotR lover on behalf of Clovis is willing to start a DotR mod project with the title DotR Redux.

Recognizing the many problems with DotR, Clovis created the DotR Redux project with the aim of making the DotR experience better, and retaining all the positives that already exist in the game.  This is done with three major changes. The first is a change in grinding to get the Deck Leader skill. All additional EXP in DotR Redux is multiplied by five from the original DotR. In addition, in Custom Duel mode, a map is added that is intentionally designed for grinding Deck Leaders. With these additional features, the grinding process that initially took hours can be completed in just 30 minutes."

Like so many other things, the tournaments are currently only taking place virtually and are then referred to as remote duels. On the 15th and 16th  May the Remote Duel Extravaganza took place, which is definitely worth a look. The victory there went to an old friend, namely Virtualwelt. But since I have already introduced this cover topic, we will dedicate ourselves today to the runner-up and that is Tri-Brigade.  <strong>The cover theme</strong>  Usually I always use the German designation of the topics in my articles, simply because many of you also prefer German maps. But here I made a conscious decision against it: Regardless of whether we look to Italy, Portugal or Spain, the English name Tri-Brigade has been adopted everywhere.  Yes, even the French, who otherwise even turn Darth Vader into Dark Vador, remain true to the template and simply call the archetype Tri-Brigade. Not so the Germans, who for some reason believe that Sta-Brigade would be a much more appropriate name. The “tri” clearly refers to the three different types that we find united here: It is about monsters, monster-warriors and winged monsters.  The topic itself is still quite new and only came to us in Phantom Rage at the end of last year. The game mechanics are mainly based on link summons and the banishment of monsters. Ismail B.'s deck, which I would like to introduce to you today, combines tri-brigade with lyric song bird, accordingly there are also lyric song bird Xyz monsters in the extra deck, which then brings Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Himmelsdonner into conversation.  <strong>The tournament</strong>  Before I get to the actual deck, I'd like to take a quick look at the tournament itself. A total of 207 players took part in the Remote Duel Extravaganza # 6, and of course the game was played according to the current banlist.  As already mentioned, the first place went to Virtualwelt, but after that there are a number of tri-brigade decks.  Not only did Ismail B. take second place with this topic, places 3 and 4 also went to Tri-Brigade, but then in combination with Zoodiak and again Lyrikliedervogel.  In places 5 to 8 are the usual suspects in the form of pranksters, dragon links, dinosaurs and dogmatics. Shaddoll Invoked and Eldlich made it into the top 16, which is quite respectable with a total of 207 participants.  <strong>The deck</strong>  Let's finally get to the deck of the runner-up. The combination with Lyrikliedervogel has proven itself here and was represented twice in the top 4.  Sta-Brigade Fraktall and Sta-Brigade Kerass are sometimes the most central cards in the deck and should definitely appear three times.  You can put Fractal from the field or (much better!) From your hand into the graveyard to also move a monster, monster-warrior or winged monster of level 3 or lower from the deck to the graveyard.  Links:  <a>https://aps1.instructure.com/eportfolios/897/Home/2021</a> <a>https://aps1.instructure.com/eportfolios/897/Home/_32021</a>  You can also use this directly, because with its help you can summon a link monster from the extra deck and only have to banish monsters from the cemetery according to the number of links. You can special summon Kerass yourself, but otherwise it has the same summoning effect as Fraktall.  Sta-Brigade Kitt and Sta-Brigade Nevall can also summon Link Monsters from the Extra Deck in the same way, but they also generate an advantage if they are discarded, which Kerass easily takes care of.  All of these effects are limited to the three different types of monsters and from now on you can only summon these three types, but that does not play a particularly important role in this deck, since you almost exclusively play forms of the monster type anyway.  Although: Similar to Eightness from Ancient Guardians, you are also dependent on a very specific type of monster here. So if there was a card that turned all monsters on the field or in the graveyard into zombies, for example ..."

Here we fight crime *dramatic pause, face smuggens* with crime.","<span>What is justice, really?</span>  <span>Some might think of revenge, others might dream of Master peace. Me? When I think of justice I think of deserving a keyboard that doesn't make every other word look like ttthiss (writing this is gonna be a pain, isn't it). You're a Yu-Gi-Oh player so I'm assuming you visualize justice in the form of a huge banlist, seeing Miragestallio unbanned, declaring an international law to burn all copies of Mystic Mine, changing the time rules and lowering the cost of cards like they do it in the OCG. But above all the typical TCG player wishes for both control and combo to die out, wanting to return to a stale, flavorless gameplay of t-setting and passing like they did in the golden days back in 2004, after which the game went downhill fast, getting worse and worse with every new card type being released, new Master Rules being implemented and meta decks created. If it can out Blue-Eyes, it's broken.</span>  <span>So how do we do this? If we are a team of justice seeking Blue-Eyes enthusiasts, how do we return to this perfect game of Yu-Gi-Oh that Tut Ankh Amon and Ozymandias played back in their childhood days? Well, if you want to clean, expect to get your hands dirty.</span> <span>If they want to combo off, you scream ""<strong>NO</strong>"" and slap down your Dimension Shifter. If they set 5 you yell ""<strong>I DON'T THINK SO</strong>"" and activate Harpie's Feather Duster (Game 2 onwards). If they ash your Chiyomaru going first you set 3 of your own and wickedly screech ""<strong>TRY ME</strong>"".</span>  <span>In short, you play all that you swore to destroy but if it takes a monster to defeat a monster, then so be it (ironically we're not playing any Kaijus).</span>  <span>So let's get to the deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>""First, why is S-Force all that you wish to end?""</span>  <span>Well, with the new support card S-Force Chase this archetype now has access to a very powerful removal trap that doesn't take much too sseaearch (see what I mean) to search. One Chiyomaru is all it takes to search this card off of Gravitino without using up many resources and it's not dependent on the S-Force card you banished for Chiyomaru's effect.</span> <span>S-Force also plays surprisingly well under There Can Be Only One. It doesn't care if their cards are banished either, making way for Dimension Shifter and Macro Cosmos. Add some Solemns into the mix and you got yourself a spicy, floodgate-oriented control deck. And all that is without taking Gravitino into consideration.</span>  <span>But not only do they excel at control they also combo off, summoning three bodies a turn, every turn. With the new addition of S-Force Edge Razor they now have access to another extender. That doesn't change the amount of monsters they can summon but it does give the deck more ways to summon them besides the classic two card Chiyomaru + Gravitino combo. Summoning two to three monsters every turn means that they can make good use of I:P Masquerena (yes, it's the ""enemies teaming up to fight against a greater evil"" cliché) and potentially OTK with Borrelsword or clean up with Accesscode or Underworld Goddess.</span>  <span>So regardless of what you wish to eradicate, combo or control, you <em>will</em> become that which you swore to destroy.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Enough exposition, let's get into the cards:</span>  <span>S-Force monsters all have an effect which affects your opponents monsters in the same column, requiring strategic placement of your cards.</span> <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Rappa Chiyomaru"">S-Force Rappa Chiyomaru</a></span><span>: Your playmaker. Summons any S-Force monster other than herself straight from deck and returns to the hand as a Quick Effect. She banishes an S-Force card for cost but that's not a big deal. Her column effect forces monsters in the same column as an S-Force card to target the monster in their column for attacks. If you use her effect during your opponents turn make sure to use it at the right time so that you can make full use of your column effects.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Pla-Tina"">S-Force Pla-Tina</a><span>: The reason why Chiyomaru's banish is not a problem. When she is summoned, for example from the deck (I'll let you figure out how to do that one on your own..), she summons any S-Force monster other than herself that is banished. Pretty neat, huh? But what would be the ideal target? Her column effect makes your opponents monsters lose 600 ATK.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Gravitino"">S-Force Gravitino</a><span>: The other part of your typical combo. If summoned he adds any S-Force card from your deck to your hand other than himself. If he's banished with Chiyomaru and then summoned with Pla-Tina that gives you two monsters on the field and any S-Force card in hand, which could be an S-Force Showdown to summon your Chiyomaru from hand again. That allows for an I:P + Chiyomaru setup with Chiyomaru's effect to summon another S-Force monsters potentially live for your opponents turn. His column effect is the most important one. Or the least important one if you have Shifter live or Macro Cosmos activate. Monsters in the same column are banished when they leave the field (that includes returning to hand or deck).</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Edge Razor"">S-Force Edge Razor</a><span>: When summoned summons an S-Force other than themselve from your hand. Makes your deck less reliant of drawing exactly Chiyomaru and Gravitino to summon multiple monsters a turn. He prevents monsters in the same column to be used as material for Link-3 or higher.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Dog Tag"">S-Force Dog Tag</a><span>: Neat card to search off of Gravitino if you already have your other pieces. Summons itself from hand when your opponent summons a monster in the same column. Prevents monsters in the same column from <em>activating</em> their effects. Sounds busted but it's only during your Main Phase and he's not even Level 4 or lower.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Bridgehead"">S-Force Bridgehead</a><span>: The deck's field spell. Searches any S-Force monster. Also once per turn protects an S-Force monster from being destroyed by a battle. Can come in handy and I can't tell you how many times I forgot to activate this effect.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Showdown"">S-Force Showdown</a><span>: Adds an S-Force monster from your GY back to your hand or, more importantly, summons an S-Force monster from hand in defense position.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""S-Force Chase"">S-Force Chase</a><span>: Bounces your opponents face-up cards up the number of S-Force monsters with different names you control. Can be banished from GY as a substitute cost for your S-Force cards.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""S-Force Justify"">S-Force Justify</a></span><span>: Link-3 with a quick effect monster effect negate and non-destructive, non-targetting removal. But he needs three monsters exact which is a pain.</span></span></li> </ul> <span><a data-name=""S-Force Orrafist"">S-Force Orrafist</a><span>,</span> <a data-name=""S-Force Professor DiGamma"">S-Force Professor DiGamma</a> <span>and <span><a data-name=""S-Force Specimen"">S-Force Specimen</a><span> are all cards I chose not to include as they are either too weak or too slow. Although Specimen gives more means to control the columns and DiGamma is good against Boarbow in a more combo oriented deck.</span></span></span></span>  <span>Now onto some non-S-Force cards.</span> <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a><span>: A very strong handtrap that not many decks can play. As an added bonus, if you link Gravitino and Pla-Tina away for I:P in the aforementioned combo, they will both be banished and now Pla-Tina can summon back that Gravitino during your opponents turn.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a><span>: It's Ash Blossom.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a><span>: This concludes our handtrap bundle. Very strong right now and a handtrap I like to include in control oriented decks as another card to set and ideally make use of its s/t negate. Mind you that you could replace these handtraps with any cards or more simply more trap cards.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a><span>: Why play your field spell at three if you can play it at four.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a><span>: Why play your level 4 or lower Warrior at three if you can play it at four.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Reinforce Truth"">Reinforce Truth</a><span>: Why play your level 2 or lower Warrior at four if you can play it at seven. As this is more of a control oriented version this card could also be swapped for any other trap.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos</a><span>: Why play Dimension Shifter at three when you ca - okay I'll stop.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> (TCBOO)<span>: Because you love winning more than integrity.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a><span>: It wouldn't be a control deck without your dear Solemns, right?</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a><span>: See Solemn Strike.</span></span></li> </ul> <span>Now let's take a look at the remaining Extra Deck:</span>  <span>This deck does not use it's Extra Deck much, leaving you with a lot of open slots. Besides a few that I strongly recommend you can do with it however you like. Ghost Reaper sends her regards.</span> <ul>  	<li><span><span><span><a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a></span>: I'm playing the Nova + Mechaba punish against Dogmatika Maximus.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a><span>: Mechaba's better half.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</a><span>: You can summon quite a few monsters and this is a great removal tool against hard to out cards.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a><span>: Great way to OTK. Strongly recommend!</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a><span>: You got the slots, you got the I:P so why not.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a><span>: If you want to clean up the board. Since you don't spam link monsters like other decks you might just have 1-2, sometimes 3 attributes to work with.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a><span>: Different Goddess. Very strong card but again, most of these won't regularly come up. Still nice to have.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a><span>: Great way to summon Accesscode. Pla-Tina is a spellcaster so any two monsters into a Knightmare and then with that one and Pla-Tina into Selene gives you 2 pops for Accesscode already.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a><span>: Part 1 of the Knightmare package. Very good card to summon off of I:P. Strongly recommend!</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a><span>: Next Knightmare. Not only is he a great removal tool but also your means to go into a Link-2 under TCBOO. Strongly recommend!</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a><span>: Your weakest Knightmare. Still, if you use him to access link plays under TCBOO you still have Phoenix for when you need it. Also recommended.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Geonator Transverser"">Geonator Transverser</a><span>: Strong card that punishes unfortunate column placement. Recommend that one but it's not necessary.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a><span>: Very good card, adds protection to your links, can summon Unicorn or Underworld Goddess during your opponent's turn. Very cute, greatly recommended!</span></span></li> </ul> <span>The cards in the Side Deck are up to your but I'd suggest 6-7 backrow removal tools. If your opponent is on control you can swap out a bunch of handtraps for them.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Time to wrap this up:</span>  <span>The first (and hopefully not last) wave of support this deck received is fantastic. Chase and Edge Razor each improve aspects of the deck, increasing both it's power ceiling as well as it's consistency. It's a fun and explosive control oriented deck that has easy access to some of the most powerful floodgates in the game with very strong cards of their own. Their unique playstyle rewards strategy and experience and can catch people off guard if they are unfamiliar with the mechanic and individual effects.</span>  <span>Before, the deck couldn't really perform too well against meta decks and you had to hope that Gravitino's continued effect to banish cards in the same column was enough to stop the archetype you were facing. That made it feel as if your match-up was more of a deciding factor than your skill, which was frustrating at times. But now with the new support I believe the deck can definitely stand it's ground among rogue tier decks. However it's performance against meta relevant decks - although much better than before - has yet to be determined as hopefully more people pick up and pilot the deck.</span>"

Now it is clear that the hotly anticipated ""Dune"" will have its world premiere at this autumn's festival. On September 3, it's time, Variety announces.  <a>https://outof.cards/hearthstone/decks/27324-can-take-our-self</a>  Director Denis Villeneuve has put together a fittingly epic cast that includes Oscar Isaac, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, Charlotte Rampling and the Swedes Stellan Skarsgård and Rebecca Ferguson. ""<a>LUCA ITA</a>"" is of course based on Frank Herbert's iconic sci-fi novel and has long been something of a dream project for Villeneuve. The ambitious plan is to follow up the film with both a ""Dune 2"" and a TV series.  &nbsp;"

The Agent and Despia are both banish oriented fairy decks and apparently work together super well when you tie a chaos engine into the mix, here’s how:  Despia is easily the coolest thing that’s coming out in DAMA, it’s a dark fairy oriented deck made for the monster fallen of albaz, it’s extremely consistent but lacks one important trait, it needs light monsters to work. Yes, it needs them to summon their fusions, otherwise they can’t exactly win, so my original trick for them was diviner of the heralds. Now though new support cards came out for another banish oriented fairy deck, the agents. Exempt the agents are actually LIGT monsters! This gives them two pieces of synergy, they’re both banish fairies, and Despia can use Agents for fusion materials. But there wasn’t enough, it was consistent but underwhelming. That’s where our most important deck comes in, chaos, chaos actually ties these deck together very tight and completely revamps the playstyle of the synergy. I already learned to love this deck and I hope it can evolve and become a viable strategy."

With the right hand, you can end with an Absolute Zero, Escuriado, Sunrise, and Core. This deck seems to show a lot of potential even without Malicious Bane. I was trying to get this deck as budget as possible so instead of running Liquidman, I chose to run Bubbleman (If you can afford Liquidman, I'd go for it instead of Bubbleman). The hand I got the most often was Elemental HERO Stratos, Elemental HERO Solid Soldier, E - Emergency Call, Fusion Conscription, Fusion Sage, and 1 of the Normal Elemental HEROs. The combo I did is as followed: <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Elemental HERO Solid Soldier.</li>  	<li>Special Summon Stratos with Solid Soldier's effect.</li>  	<li>Search for Shadow Mist.</li>  	<li>Activate Fusion Sage to search Polymerization.</li>  	<li>Activate Polymerization to Fuse Shadow Mist and the Normal HERO in your hand to Summon Sunrise.</li>  	<li>Start a chain with Shadow Mist and Sunrise to add a Bubbleman and Miracle Fusion to your hand.</li>  	<li>Link Summon Xtra HERO Wonder Driver by using Stratos and Solid Soldier as material.</li>  	<li>Set Fusion Conscription, Miracle Fusion to Special Summon Bubbleman.</li>  	<li>Activate Miracle Fusion to Summon Escuriado to the zone Wonder Driver is pointing to, by banishing Shadow Mist and Solid Soldier.</li>  	<li>Activate Wonder Driver's effect to set Miracle Fusion.</li>  	<li>Activate Miracle Fusion again to Summon Absolute Zero by banishing the Bubbleman and Stratos.</li>  	<li>End board is Escuriado, Absolute Zero, Sunrise, and Wonder Driver</li> </ol> Now you have a Board wipe, A Beater, a Card Destroyer, and a Special Summoner as your end board."

To that end I decided to experiment with a Magician package that focuses on using <a data-name=""Harmonizing Magician"">Harmonizing Magician</a> as an extender to get to a Magician that can help summon Vortex Dragon. I don't consider it a budget build considering the presence of among other things, the one copy of <a data-name=""Diviner of the Heralds"">Diviner of the Heralds</a>, however I am aware that some optimizations are yet to be made. As such, this is a prototype.  <hr />  The ideal combo is an extension of a basic two card combo from <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the ""Idiot's Guide to Solfachords"" video by direYGO</a>. As such it is a 3 card combo that needs you to open with a way to summon <a data-name=""Supreme Dragon King Darkwurm"">Supreme Dragon King Darkwurm</a> and <a data-name=""DoSolfachord Cutea"">DoSolfachord Cutea</a> and have <a data-name=""Harmonizing Magician"">Harmonizing Magician</a> in hand. the respective searchers here are <a data-name=""Dragon Shrine"">Dragon Shrine</a>, <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a> (which isn't ran here due to space) and <a data-name=""Pendulum Call"">Pendulum Call</a>, having Dragon Shrine or One for One is ideal since you only have 1 normal summon.  The first step of this combo is to use Dragon Shrine to Mill Darkwurm and set up its effect. this lets you get Supreme King Gate Zero as a scale. From there you summon Cutea to add a high scale Solflachord monster (for this example 5 is the minimum, so <a data-name=""SolSolfachord Gracia"">SolSolfachord Gracia</a> will suffice) to use as the other scale. You then summon I:P Masquerena using Cutea and Darkwurm as materials. This will put them in the Extra Deck and ensure there will be room for them both for the Pendulum Summon. From there you activate Call to search Harmonizing and Dragonpulse (or any other Magician at your preference) With the scales set and Cutea and Darkwurm in the Extra deck, you can then Pendulum Summon the four monsters.  Harmonizing Magician's effect then activates, letting summon a third Magician to suit the combo's needs. In this case We'll be summoning <a data-name=""Nobledragon Magician"">Nobledragon Magician</a>. We tune Nobledragon and either Darkwurm or Dragonpulse into the Level 7 <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a>, which then enables use to summon Gate Zero both because of Meteorburst's effect and because a zone was opened up. We overlay those two Level 7 monsters into <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a>. This leaves us with Masquerena, Absolute, Cutea, Harmonizing and a Level 4 monster. the latter of which can be used to extend further into a rank 4 or Link-2.  On your opponent's turn you can then use Masquerena's effect to Link herself, Cutea and Absolute away to summon Avramax, with Absolute's effect activation to summon Vortex. Alternatively you can link Absolute away in addition to summon a Link-3.  <hr />  The other two Magicians are Dragonpit for if you have a Level 7 or <a data-name=""Puzzomnino, the Drop-n-Deleter"">Puzzomnino, the Drop-n-Deleter</a> out and Timebreaker for if you want to use Harmonizing herself as the Tuner or already drew into Nobledragon. The rest of this 60 card deck would be msotly Traps such as <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>, <a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a> and 5 cards of the Solemn series. I'm also considering using <a data-name=""Mask of Restrict"">Mask of Restrict</a> in lieu of some of the Solemn cards to further fortify Avramax in the event Kaiju and Sphere Mode return to meta prominence (though it wouldn't do much against Nibiru). Outside of the Odd-Eyes trio, Avramax and Masquerena, the rest of the Extra deck is used to provide follow-ups (<a data-name=""Borrellord Dragon"">Borrellord Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>, and <a data-name=""Ignister Prominence, the Blastinging Dracoslayer"">Ignister Prominence, the Blasting Dracoslayer</a>) or alternate ways to Vortex or Avramax, such as Puzzlomino or <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a>, or extenders (<a data-name=""Crystron Halqlifibrax"">Crystron Halqlifibrax</a>).  The side deck is a little generic, with going second cards such as <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> and <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, though I also added <a data-name=""Hypnosister"">Hypnosister</a> and <a data-name=""Wavering Eyes"">Wavering Eyes</a> for pendulum matchups as well."

Super poly is extremely strong with zombie world since you can use opponent's monsters to summon your fusion monsters.  The Danger ! archetype is here to make the deck faster and discard cards. And you love discard cards with this deck.  Gamma is here to prevent opponent using Ash on Solitaire. It can be a bit brickey but it remains a very strong hand trap. You can prevent opponent doing Lancea too which is pretty problematic for this deck's mechanisms.  Shiranui Solitaire should only be used to special summon Uni-zombie unless you have already Zombie World on the field.  Uni-zombie is the maestro of this deck. You want him on the field asap. He allows you to foolish from your deck and discard from your hand. Both effects once per turn!  Cards too foolish/discard:  Banshee : you can ban her from your GY to activate Zombie World from your deck.  Mezuki: You can ban him from GY and special summon a zombie monster from your GY.  Glow-up Bloom: If Zombie World is activated you can ban it and special summon a level 5 or more zombie monster from your deck. If Zombie World is not on the field you can't special summon but add the monster to your hand: Vampire Fraulein or Jack-o-Bolan are good choices.  Have fun!

Well , in this list you'll find an answer to all of your questions , altough if there are any feel free to send me a massage .  There was already a list from this deck on my profile but it's kinda a bit older and doesn't compare with the newer cards and the new meta ,so I waited for the new support and finally finished my research and found a way to competitively play it in the current meta and the current time ,I really  hope you'll like what i have come up with ,and that you will enjoy it.  one more reason why I uploaded this deck now was because all the decks which I found here on youtube etc... ,were either old , not really that competetive or pre LIOV ,where the new came out which braught a huge boost to the deck only by itself.  Here's also a link with all the combos explained really in the depth , and what do you do in a particular situation and stuff like that , this way I wont need to explain and writte down all the combos , and also becouse I think that you'll get way more faster when you watch someone actually doing and explaining the combos that just by reading them here .  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcVW1hDM9dc&amp;list=LL&amp;index=1&amp;ab_channel=TeamYuGiFailsTeamYuGiFails  That would be all from me and as said I hope you will enjoy this deck and list and have much fun with it .  Greetings from your readytogetricked i hope that this will help you even a bit to enjoy the current format"

Enabling this was the new Support Card Traptrix Vesiculo by being a starter, extender and grinder all in 1. The disappointing part being Cularia who is just a worse Sera in every way, the only time you should ever Summon her is if you already have a Sera on field that you wouldn't need to Link off, already Summoned Dragoon and cannot go into Xyz for some reason. Long story short, Cularia's job is just being banished for Prosperity, you can switch her out for anything else.  &nbsp;  This version is pretty much unbeatable when going first, and going second you still have Dimension Shifter to force your opponent to pass.  Your priorities should be to maximize the amount of board presence by having atleast 2 Traps Set turn 1 and having either Bagooska, Dweller or Dragoon on board.  &nbsp;  I also wouldn't advise to take Dragoon out. This Deck has no real Wincon to work for and is also abyssmal at breaking already established boards so Dragoon and Zeus are filling that gap."

It enables more consistency, an improved grind game, a","Who is gonna win? Hordes of Demons, Superpowerful Dragons, Masters of Arcane Arts,  &nbsp;  Or a single girl in a mech suit?  &nbsp;  I’d put my money on the girl with the mech suit, because her favourite tool Engage, is back to 1!  &nbsp;  The unban of Engage! is absolutely bonkers for Striker, increasing it’s power <strong>exponentially</strong>. It enables more consistency, an improved grind game, and a search with +1 every turn!  Sky Striker can be <strong>splashed in every deck now as an engine again</strong> with minimal investment. It generally consists of 1 Engage/1 Hornet Drones/1 Widow in the maindeck and 1 Kagari/1 Hayate/1 Zeke in the extradeck, rewarding the player a free link-2 without using up normal summon, a quick effect negate/change of heart with widow anchor, and a “better pot of greed” with Engage! (Seriously Konami what are you thinking lmao). Anyways, on to the deck (it’s a redo of another deck I made a couple months back):  &nbsp;  This deck is the usual Sky Striker's deck, but with an unusual twist - less control/lockdown cards (I refuse to play mystic mine) in favour of cards that blow up the opponent's board. The philosophy with this deck is to destroy most if not all of your opponent's resources that they slap down on the board going first, and then close out the match with Sky Striker's unparalleled grind game. NOW WITH ENGAGE!  &nbsp;  The deck features 3 card types, Going Second Cards, the Generic Staples and the Sky Striker Core:  &nbsp;  <strong>7 Going-Second Cards, the board breakers!</strong>  &nbsp;  2 Lightning Storm - The most expensive card in the deck (About $100 each as of this writing, reprints soon I hope!) it is incredibly powerful. It can wipe either backrow or monsters given the player using it doesn't have face-up cards. This is useful going second, but can become a brick mid/late game, that’s why there are only 2. This card can be replaced by a cheaper alternative like Twin Twisters or Dark Ruler No More.  &nbsp;  3 Evenly Matched - One of the most potent board killers out there, it's non-targeting/destroying removal can out most boards if allowed to activate. Just skip to the end of your battlephase as you go second, and watch your opponent's carefully crafted board that they've spent 10 minutes building disappear into the Shadow Realm.  &nbsp;  1 Raigeki - No explanation needed, smash your opponent's monsters!  &nbsp;  1 Feather Duster - No explanation needed, obliterate your opponent's backrow! This is especially useful during this meta as it is dominated by control cards in the backrow, like Dogmatika Punishment, Ice Dragon's Prison, and Torrential Tribute.  &nbsp;  <strong>17 Generic Staples</strong>  3 Pot of Desires – I know some people are reluctant to run Pot of Desires in their deck, but resources are absolutely essential to Sky Striker’s win-condition of coming out on top of the grind game after breaking the board. Try to tutor out your important one-ofs in your deck before you use this, like Multirole and Engage because of either or both of these are banished, the power level of your deck goes down dramatically.  &nbsp;  2 Pot of Avarice – This card is for resource recycling especially of your Sky Striker link monsters, especially because you burn through a lot of them. This card is a easy +2 because it's conditions of shuffling 5 monsters back into the deck from the GY is so effortless to do in Sky Strikers. Since this card's unban, I've chosen to take out Sky Striker's own resource recycling card Hercules Base because I feel this card is superior even though it's unsearchable. Feel free to bump this card to 3, and maybe take out the Upstart Goblin. This card may be a bit bricky/sticky sometimes though, so be careful.  &nbsp;  1 Upstart Goblin to put a free spell in your GY strengthening your Striker Link monsters as well as a relatively free +1 draw. It may give your opponent +1000 lifepoints, but arguably in most cases lifepoints don't matter if your opponent has few resources left after you whittle them down with your Sky Striker cards and board equalizers.  &nbsp;  1 Terraforming to allow for easy access to Area Zero.  &nbsp;  1 Called by the Grave to out those pesky ghost girl hand traps or banish that old annoying Eldlich dude being a creep in the GY.  &nbsp;  1 Reinforcement of the Army to search for Sky Striker Raye to allow more consistent access to Striker link monsters.  &nbsp;  3 Triple Tactics Talent is optimal because of the sheer power and utility of this card. This card will almost always be live, because in a going-second build of Sky Strikers you will bait negates which are often monster effects, and that’s when this card will make it’s move. For example, after throwing down a Lightning Storm and having it negated with your enemy’s Dragoon, you can use this card to steal their Dragoon and pop two monsters + burn! Also, if you get handtrapped, this card can always give you a +2 to possibly get you out of your sticky situation with more cards.  1 Monster Reborn is self-explanatory. Incredible all-purpose extender.  3 Ash Blossom is essential in the 1 for 1 resource war Sky Striker excels at.  1 Dinowrestler Pankratops is great for breaking boards and getting rid of pesky backrow that your spellcards can’t get rid of, like Imperial Order. It also has 2600 atk, so it can get over a 3 negate Apollousa.  &nbsp;  <strong>15 Sky Striker Cards</strong>  &nbsp;  Everyone knows what these cards do already, so I'll just explain why I picked the ratios for each card. 3 Raye (obviously) and 1 Roze. 1 Roze is fine because she is easily dumped into the GY with Hayate and can be searched through the newly unbanned Engage. 3 Airspace Area Zero and 1 Hornet Drones are also added to allow for maximum access to the Striker links.  &nbsp;  1 Engage does so much for the deck – exponentially increasing the power of Sky Strikers. Arguably the most broken card ever to be released in Yugioh, Engage is a better pot of greed since it allows you to choose the first card you draw and you still get the second card with minimal set-up in the graveyard. This card can be used repeatedly through the recycling of Kagari and Multirole.  &nbsp;  1 Multirole for resource recycling of Sky Striker Spells. Whatever you do, DO NOT let this card get banished by something like cosmic cyclone, if it does, that represents about half the grind game power of Sky Strikers down the drain. Ideally, after you equalize the gamestate in turn 2, you search this card with your first Shizuku at the endstep to initiate your grindgame for turn 3.  &nbsp;  3 Widow Anchor is to maximize your ability for fieldwide control of your opponent's cards and to disrupt plays. I only added one Shark Cannon because I find that other cards are more useful. However, if you come across a deck that uses a lot of monsters in the GY (such as Eldlich) feel free to swap out other cards for Shark Cannon to control the graveyard.  &nbsp;  2 Afterburners are in this deck because it is an excellent board breaking card that can easily bait out negates, preparing for your truly devastating board-breakers. For example, bait out their one spell/trap negate by targeting their Borreload Savage, then proceed to slap down Evenly Matched and watch their entire board EXPLODE! This card can also destroy an active Area Zero if it's already on your field, giving you another Sky Striker monster on the board. Against backrow decks, feel free to swap a copy of this card out for Jamming Waves! to destroy their face down cards.  &nbsp;  <strong>For the Extra Deck, we have</strong>  &nbsp;  11 Sky Striker link monsters - 3 Kagari (spell recovery from GY), 3 Hayate (direct attack + dump Striker card to GY), 3 Shizuku (Free search and endphase), 1 Kaina (stop opponent's monster's attack), and 1 Zeke (Primarily to link away your oppenent's monster you gained control over and to banish an opponent's monster on board).  &nbsp;  1 Hiita the Fire Charmer because it also allow access to Selene by stealing your opponent's used Ash Blossom, Almiraj or any other fire monster that is running around in the meta nowadays. Hiita is easily able to be made by first going into Kagari, the fire attribute Sky Striker and linking it away.  &nbsp;  1 Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior is a common out (since it is non-targeting/destroying removal) to hard to kill towers monsters like Dragoon. A favourite play I do (after baiting out Dragoon’s negate) is to steal the Verte Anaconda used to summon Dragoon and link it away with my Striker link-1, then send Dragoon to the GY!  &nbsp;  1 Knightmare Unicorn to shuffle back your opponent’s card. It’s also the easiest way to link climb to Accesscode talker and give it 5300 atk with it’s link-3 rating.  &nbsp;  1 Accesscode is used to smash your opponent with a slam dunk after you’ve sufficiently tenderized their rock solid defense and depleted their resources. After getting their LP below 5300, push for game with Accesscode Talker with 4+ pops since the GY is packed with different attribute striker links! This badass will be the last thing many opponents see before dropping to 0 LP.  &nbsp;  Additional Commentary  &nbsp;  Weaknesses - This deck is very strong, and it can consistently contend vs. the strongest decks of any era of Yugioh (so far), especially since the unban of Engage! to 1. However, this deck autoloses vs. anti-spell floodgates such as Secret Village of Spellcasters and Imperial Order. A deck that uses both of these cards is very difficult to beat (I'm looking at you, Altergeists &gt;:c)  Monster cards that are untargetable/undestroyable/unaffect are very difficult for this deck to get rid of as well, such as the commonly seen Red Eyes Dragoon and The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister. These cards are specifically why I side kaijus like Gadarla to use in match-ups where these cards are common.  Finally, there are some decks that actually still recover quite competently after you wipe their board and can counter-attack your fragile board with strong gigantic monsters for an OTK. Watch-out for these games, and try to force a grind-game where you're several steps ahead to avoid this situation.  &nbsp;  As a machine player that loves to play aggressively in dynamic interesting back/forth games, I absolutely LOOOOVE this deck. Methodically cracking an established “impregnable” board and going for 1 for 1 trades until you win out feels incredible satisfying. It's super fun wiping your opponent's carefully crafted board, then having your favourite pretty mech girl destroy monster after monster like the Doomslayer. Hope you folks have as much fun playing this deck as I do, even though Sky Strikers technically are not meta anymore. Engage and Afterburners to pierce the heavens!

An awesome day, a very good day indeed. Sky striker mobilize: engage is back to game to make some storms. Sky striker is the first deck that I made a guide for explain every detail, and is one of my favorite decks of all time. School girls and mech suit?! Count me in!!   So…Let get into the guide, shall we?  &nbsp;  <strong><em>Disclaimers</em></strong>  <span>     When I try to build a deck I like to use cards that I already have<em>,</em>thus I rarely have the new staples for exemple. So the majority of cards that you’ll see can be considered a budget option for certain cards, in other words no <a data-name=""Access code talker"">Access code talker</a> =/. </span>  &nbsp;  <strong><em>Starters</em></strong>  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Raye"">Sky Striker Ace - Raye</a></strong><span>: This cute girl or your main starter. She can bring almost every   sky striker monster in your extra deck and makes a good protection for your Links sky striker monsters against destruction, 'cause Raye can bring herself from the GY and link again in another sky striker. </span>  &nbsp;  <strong>2x</strong> <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Sky Striker Ace&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;- Roze&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Sky Striker Ace</strong> <strong>- Roze</strong></a><strong> :</strong><span> The fearsome antagonist of Raye,  Roze can be another great starter for the sky striker link play. The effect that she can be summoned with another sky striker is good, but the effect that she returns to the field when an opponent's monster is removed from the extra monster zone is beyond insane, additionally can also negate the effect of another opponent's monster. This card is insane. </span>  &nbsp;  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones"">Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones</a>: </strong><span> another way to summon the links monster. Furthermore it can be used for other combos utilizing link-2 monsters like  <strong><a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Zeke"">Sky Striker Ace - Zeke</a>. </strong></span>  &nbsp;  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Reinforcement of the army"">Reinforcement of the army</a> : </strong><span>search Raye of Roze depending on your needs.</span>  &nbsp;  1x <strong><a data-name=""Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!"">Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</a></strong> <strong>:</strong> Guess who is beck? Sky F@#$ing striker Moblize engage! This cad is a pot of greed on legs, search a sky striker cards and with the right set up, makes 1+ in card advantage by drawing another card from deck. The cherry in the cake is that is not once per turn, so you can recycle with <strong><a data-name=""Striker Ace - Kagari"">Striker Ace - Kagari</a></strong><strong>. This card was banned for a reason and I’m happy to see its back.</strong>  <strong> </strong>  <strong><em>Pseudo Starters</em></strong>  <span> </span> <span>They’re considered starter only if certain conditions are fulfilled (combination with other specific cards, luck in a draw, etc.)</span>  &nbsp;  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero"">Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero</a> + 1x <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole"">Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole</a>: </strong><span> Area zero can dig more in your deck while finding a copy of the sky striker monster or a sky striker spell. In other cases, you can use  Multirole to pop Area zero and get a free summon of Roze or Raye.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><em>Extenders</em></strong>  &nbsp;  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero"">Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero</a>: </strong><span> You can search some cards by dig 3 card in your deck, but you have to pop one of  your cards.

Insane and deserve to be limited. Also, make any sky striker magic cards irresponsible by any effect of you opponent.  </span>  &nbsp;  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Hayate"">Sky Striker Ace - Hayate</a>: </strong><span>She is amazing and  the perfect monster to stall your opponent with Mystic mine if you decide to side it.

Cycle spell, recover spell that was negated, search cards in conjunction with </span><strong><a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Hayate"">Sky Striker Ace - Hayate</a></strong><span>… this card does so much for one card that deserves the time that was limited. Now you can even recycle <strong><a data-name=""Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!"">Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</a></strong><strong>... what a time to be alive.</strong></span>  &nbsp;  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku"">Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku</a>: </strong><span>This is your primally way to get the spell  like <strong><a data-name=""Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!"">Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</a></strong> And every thing that you wanted, too bad it only in you final phase, but She can be a fine protection by lowering the opponent's monster attack by 100 for each spell card in the GY.</span>  &nbsp;  1x  <strong><a data-name=""Sky Striker Maneuver - Scissors Cross"">Sky Striker Maneuver - Scissors Cross</a>: </strong> this can add  a main deck  sky striker monster to your hand from the Gy.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <strong><em>Controller/Defenders</em></strong>  &nbsp;  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> :</strong><span> your big ""no no"" when you start second and an excellent card in the mid game. </span>  &nbsp;  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>+ 2x <a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a>:</strong><span> your primaries hand trap to stop your opponent from playing.

Kaina can be summoned by the effect of Raye in the opponent’s turn and not allowing a monster to attack. Zeke on the other hand, can be used with Roze and Raye to banish a monster in your summon.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>:  </strong>your best anti-handtrap that you can afford it, until  Designator crossout came to tcg.  <strong><em>Utility cards</em></strong>  &nbsp;  <strong>1x Raigeki: </strong><span>A classical card and a budget one to blow up any monster on the field.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Sky Striker Maneuver - Jamming Waves!"">Sky Striker Maneuver - Jamming Waves!</a>+ 1X <a data-name=""Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners!"">Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners!</a>: </strong><span> Pop a monster and a set spell/trap card , respectively</span>  &nbsp;  <strong>2x<a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a></strong>: this card is better in this deck than  twin twister, cause you  already have some way to pop up backrow and this card is an awesome fuel to Sky striker magic cards effect.  <strong>Utopia package:  </strong>your primary way to deal a massive damage for game, be cause 5000 atk is a little too much.  <strong>1 x<a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a>: </strong>tapir can and will stall all plays of your opponent so be sure to summon when you need.  <strong><em>Side deck</em></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>Almost every card in my side deck it’s self explanatory. <strong><a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> </strong></span> is in here because a love her.  &nbsp;  <strong>Conclusion- Why do you need to play sky strikers?</strong>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Is sky striker broken now that engage come back at one? Of course not , not even close to a tier 2 I believe , but this deck is a pandora box in yu-gi-oh! History. The future will tell us if this action of konami was good or not, but for now I’ll relax and play with my favorite deck. Does this deck deserves the hate? Definitely not!!  I hope you enjoy it my little guide, any doubt or ways to improve it, just comment!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This deck is weak to Nibiru and Dimension Shifter, but otherwise can play around most anything else pretty well. The Fleur Synchro can be replaced by any level 10 Synchro that requires 1 tuner and 1 non-tuner, such as Leo or Ruddy Rose Dragon.  A single Scrap Raptor in the hand often leads to full combo if done right, however, with Scrap Factory also on the field, you can go into even crazier plays. To understand how the main play works, look <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/insanely-splashable-scrap-artifact-lockout-engine/"">here to see how the Scrap Artifact Engine works</a>  Note that this deck is still being labbed, and thus may change as time goes on, but so far, it's a very strong deck going 1st especially."

Though some of the cards may or may not be in the TCG GOAT Format, I see absolutely NO reason whatsoever why some of the GOAT cards from the GOAT OCG shouldn’t be in the already lackluster GOAT TCG in the first place. Also I made very gosh damned sure that these cards were viable for the age span of the GOAT Format and paid damn attention to the forbidden/limited list from the TCG GOAT version as carefully as possible.

Spheres is strong and with a solemn or tidying in the back row it adds another negate/pop  Best starting combo line is to get out spheres and Sheou for a return and negate destroy  Going second  If you can combo off enough without interruption going into borrelsword should win you most games this deck produces enough most of the time to do that  If your opponent has interaction you can always default into spheres  If your feeling like a menace to society you can play through the negates with the dragonmaid combos and then verte into dragoon  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

Wombo Combo 1:  We use 1 copy of Guldefaxe because it is extremely easy to bring out Thor in this deck: Special summon 3 Ojamas by various methods i.e. Country, Obedience Schooled, Tri-wight etc. Summon Guldefaxe and Synchro Thor  Wombo Combo 2:  This combo is to forcefully activate waking the dragon. This is by no means reliable but if you manage to pull it off you're a boss. Special summon an Ojama (preferably Ojama Pink to activate its ability) to the middle monster zone, set waking the dragon to the spell/trap zone diagonal to the middle monster zone. Tribute your Ojama for Yajiro Invader. Activate creature swap and swap yajiro for any monster your opponent controls. Summon their card to anywhere on the board except for the colomn you set waking the dragon on and summon yajiro to the middle monster zone. Now just special summon another Ojama to the monster zone above waking the dragon and yajiro (now controlled by your opponent) will destroy waking the dragon, allowing you to summon anything you want i.e. Naturia Exterio, Ultimate Falcon etc. I came up with this combo primarily for Naturia Exterio since this deck lacks backrow destruction/management.  General info/ Tips: <ul>  	<li>This deck excels at swarming the field with monsters. If you play it right, you can end off with a Ojama Emperor, King, Knight and Apollousa in one turn. This end board pretty much locks your opponent out of playing the game unless they have a spell/trap card to get rid of our monsters. Which is why we have Wombo Combo 2 to bring out Exterio to deal with backrow.</li>  	<li>Ojama duo is an extremely powerful card but can easily backfire if used incorrectly. Unless you're sure your opponent cannot utilize the tokens, always activate your Ojama Duos during the end phase so they don't get a chance to use them for special summons. This allows you to utilize the second part of the effect immediately, since a turn has passed since it was sent to the graveyard.</li>  	<li>More often then not, you're going to be dumping your Ojamas into the graveyard like poop in your toilet after taco bell.

And for once we can sign this: believe the hype! <a>https://blackwidowfilmovi.wildapricot.org/</a>  I myself was cautiously skeptical. A prequel to the Avengers' second most boring member? Do we really need it? And is it not like ten years too late? Why did it feel like an outrageous attempt to give fans a band-aid on the wounds of Natasha's sudden death in ""Avengers: Endgame"", where they even forgot to give her a sensible burial? It turns out that no one needs to worry. <a>https://blackwidowpelicula.wildapricot.org/</a>  We are not yet allowed to review the film (embargo until June 19), however, it is free for reactions on social media.

This means that they cannot be Special Summoned from the hand or Deck except by Ritual Summon and th,"Ritual Monsters (Japanese: 儀ぎ式しきモンスター Gishiki Monsutā), colored blue, are monsters that must normally be Special Summoned with a Ritual Spell Card. Examples include ""Magician of Black Chaos"", ""Demise, King of Armageddon"", and ""Nekroz of Trishula"".  Ritual Monsters are Special Summon-only monsters. This means that they cannot be Special Summoned from the hand or Deck except by Ritual Summon and the card ""Ritual Foregone"", and cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard or while banished unless they were first Ritual Summoned (even with a card like ""Fulfillment of the Contract"").  Ritual Summoning  Main article: Ritual Summon  <a>https://mccookbison.instructure.com/courses/10413/pages/123movies-watch-here-luca-2021-full-movie-online-free-hd-%7C-disney-pixar</a>  In some ways, Level 5 or higher Ritual Monsters can be easier to Summon than Normal or Effect Monsters of the same Level, since their Tributes do not need to be on the field. However, Ritual Monsters require a number of specific cards in the hand or field at once, which can be difficult to achieve. Some Ritual Spell Cards such as ""Advanced Ritual Art"" can ameliorate this by using monsters from the Main Deck instead, instead of using monsters from your hand/field. Searchers such as ""Preparation of Rites"" and ""Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands"" help to assemble the necessary components for a Ritual Summon, while support such as ""Ascending Soul"" and ""Ritual Buster"" help alleviate the costs of Ritual Summoning. The ""Djinn of Rituals"" series can serve dual purposes, as they make the Ritual Spell monster requirement easier to fulfill by banishing themselves from the Graveyard, and also grant an additional effect when used for the Ritual Summon of a Ritual Monster.  A card that allows Ritual Summoning does not always need to be a Ritual Spell card (but usually are). Examples include ""Secrets of Dark Magic"" and ""Conductor of Nephthys"" which are not Ritual Spell cards but have effects that include Ritual Summoning.  <a>https://mccookbison.instructure.com/courses/10413/pages/luca-2021-cz-dabing-videa-%7C-filmy-online-zdarma-hd</a>  Playing style  Because Ritual Monsters are not stored in the Extra Deck, it is usually necessary to have the Ritual Monster and its corresponding Ritual Spell in the hand before that monster can be Ritual Summoned. As a result, Decks focused on Ritual Summoning often include ways to search Ritual Monsters and Ritual Spells.  Some modern Ritual Monsters have effects which can be activated by discarding them from the hand, allowing them to function even when they cannot be Ritual Summoned. Some modern Ritual Spells allow Ritual Summoning from locations besides the hand (such as the Graveyard), or allow using monsters to meet the requirement from locations other than the player's hand or field.  <a>https://mccookbison.instructure.com/courses/10413/pages/123movies-%7C-luca-2021-full-movie-free-hd-%7C-watch-online</a>  Monsters that support Ritual Summoning can have effects including being treated as the entire requirement for a Ritual Summon, activating or applying their effects when used for a Ritual Summon, or granting an effect to the Ritual Summoned monster.  Ritual-reliant Decks benefit from having multiple copies of Ritual Spells and Ritual Monsters, as the chances of drawing both the Ritual Spell and the Ritual Monster increases greatly. Ritual Summoning can cost the player a large number of cards from their hand or field, so ways to generate hand advantage and recycle Ritual Spells are important.  In the anime  Ritual Monsters have not featured as a major mechanic in the anime.  In Yu-Gi-Oh, some prominent characters used Ritual Monsters, including Yugi Muto, Joey Wheeler, Seto Kaiba, Maximillion Pegasus, Dartz, and the Rare Hunters Umbra and Lumis.  In Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, Ritual Monsters occasionally appeared; Fusion Monsters were more prominently associated with the series. Alexis Rhodes used the first Ritual Monster-focused archetype; ""Cyber Angel"". Bastion Misawa, Titan, and Kaibaman all used a Ritual Monster.  In Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL, a single Ritual Monster appeared, used by Kite Tenjo.  In Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V, Ritual Monsters were used by two characters, Alexis Rhodes and Aura Sentia, neither of whom were featured significantly.  In Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS, Ritual Summoning was the first non-Link Summon Special Summon method reintroduced in the series. Yusaku Fujiki and Theodore Hamilton used one Ritual Monster each, and Ai later used one of his own."

The decklist is not updated for the new Banlist so I already tell you not to join if that is,"I describe below why you should disregard the existence of the deck after limiting Misc.  Easy to use cards that automatically give you an advantage are the best cards in the game. This is the safest way to play a game like Yugioh, it's much better to make a simpler move, weaker but much more efficient than a much more powerful move that has several weaknesses. In this aspect my problem as a Dino player since Archosaur's arrival is the fact that the deck doesn't have much versatility, don't get me wrong it has excellent cards like Ovi, Misc, Lost World and Tyranno and excellent extra deck monsters having a power very big but there are no different follow ups and versatile plays like card recovery in GY. It has always been a frustrating deck to play compared to other goals that generate free resource and extend for no reason like Dragon Link was. And now with the hit on the banlist I don't recommend anyone to test the deck because it will just be a waste of time since the Misc dependency is not even a 2 card combo consistency issue (as if it's unfair to try to be consistent in making 2 card combo when most current meta decks do 1 combo card) and yes the fact that it is needed every turn as your follow up is like playing Invoked with 1 Aleister and the Aleister's effect is negated by a hand trap because the deck is cyclic and have to access the engine every turn to play (go through all the combo pieces and this is no longer possible). So it doesn't even make sense anymore to think that Dino will be a Rogue because it's a completely dead deck that goes all or nothing: either I can break field and OTK or I'm dependent on my established field not being broken or instantly forgiven for not having a play on my next turn and relying on a miraculous top draw that won't help me much anyway because what's the point of giving Oviraptor a draw if my play will be to add Tyranno and maybe I'll even make an xyz bringing Rex from turn, that is, what is missing is not Misc's stolen protection effect, but that from my next turn on, no move will be the least bit decent to have control of the game. And it's no use trying to return Misc with Omega or Nemeses. The following Lithium2300 video demonstrates everything I said about why the deck is dead when it plays twice against the Sky Striker deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPm0Xpuc1Kc.  So just accept that the Dinosaur type is forgotten in the game again waiting for a new archetype that I believe will not be made for years to come.

Its important to at least end on <span>Adamancipator Risen-Leonite,</span> <span>I:P Masquerena,</span> (<span>Adamancipator Risen-Dragite</span>/<span>Borreload Savage Dragon),</span> <span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Crystron Halqifibrax (EMZ), </span></span></span></span></span></span></span>and any other card from the Extra Deck or Main Deck.  Now the stun part of the deck, on your opponents turn you can exhaust your opponents resources through your various negates, then banish <span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Crystron Halqifibrax, <span> to synchro summon into <span>Shooting Riser Dragon<span> to then activae trigger effect on summon to send Fossil Dyna to the graveyard. Then wait on your opponent to normal or special summon a monster to then chain <span>I:P Masquerena <span>to link summon <span>Underworld Goddess of the Closed World, <span>being able to use 1 of your opponents monsters and any of your monsters except <span>Leonite <span>which is easy to summon even if its a Link-5. Then you use<span> Leonites</span> effect to special summon Fossil Dyna if you have a fire monster in the grave which would be <span>Prank-kids Bow-wow Bark</span>. than at this point once executed even though both you and the opponent are locked from special summoning you can still end on some strong beaters.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>  now the deck is weak to Dark Ruler No More! and Forbidden Droplet, so the side deck was built having that in mind."

The seventh Transformers movie has been given an official title. Gizmodo confirms that the film will be called ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"".  <a>https://fastandfurious9guias.wildapricot.org/</a>  It will be the first film in the successful, toy-based film series after 2018's ""Bumblebee"". The film will take place in 1994 and will be an adaptation of ""Beast Wars"". Some new robot characters will be introduced, including the villain Scourge. <a>https://fastandfurious9enfrancais.wildapricot.org/</a>  - One of the most important things we try to do with the film is to give the audience a lot of new. Our hope was to find new villains and priorities… If you have seen the other movies and like them, you will see villains you have never seen before. Autobots you've never seen, promised producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura during Thursday's press conference. <a>https://thesuicidesquadguid.wildapricot.org/</a>  We also know that shooting star Anthony Ramos takes the lead role as a former military man with a tech-crazy little brother. Ramos is most recently featured in the musicals ""Hamilton"" and ""In the Heights"", and is thus ready for his first starring role in a major action film. <a>https://thesuicidesquadenfrancais.wildapricot.org/</a>  - I watch classic movies like ""Indiana Jones"", where you go on an adventure but you also learn something along the way. Hopefully I can also shed light on the culture and the people, says the director.  <a>https://spacejam2guias.wildapricot.org/</a>"

This deck has a similar strategy as the 'AI_DarkMagician'-deck that is integrated as a bot in 'ProjectIgnis: EDOPro', but it works without <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> as the main difference. When you play with <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> you have to build the whole deck around it and your combo can get negated when this key-card gets destroyed. So this deck works with Graveyard-effects instead of summoning the dark magicians with <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> again, this means it has a lot more of combo-options and can adapt against every play-style. It has more power- and combo-potential but it has a bit slower build-up against 'OTK'-decks, then it would be better to play only one combo that works everytime in a deck.  <a data-name=""Apprentice Illusion Magician"">Apprentice Illusion Magician</a>: It's part of the <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> combo and is a very fast special summon, that gives you a <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> to the hand, and has also a defensive effect for the battle phase.  <a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a>: With this card you get <a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a> or <a data-name=""Magician Navigation"">Magician Navigation</a> for free, but you only need one in the deck for 2 possible cards to search for.  <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine</a>: It can get special summoned with the effect of <a data-name=""Magician Navigation"">Magician Navigation</a> from the deck if you don't need <a data-name=""Apprentice Illusion Magician"">Apprentice Illusion Magician</a>, and it gives all Spellcaster's a target-immunity. It also has a shoot-effect as a quick effect if you should need it.  <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a>: The only Fusion monster in the deck is <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a>, which has a strong draw-effect and you get <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> back when it gets destroyed. <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a> works with material from the Graveyard, so it's good to discard <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> and then instantly fusion-summon from the Graveyard. You can also do this with <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>, but the effect of <a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a>, that you can special summon with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, can only put Monsters up to level 6 from the deck to the Graveyard.  <a data-name=""Palladium Oracle Mana"">Palladium Oracle Mana</a>: It has a destroy-Immunity for level 7 and higher Spellcasters which are <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>, <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a>, and <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine</a>. It also has more special summon effects as a backup but it is a bit more random because you can not special summon it with <a data-name=""Magician Navigation"">Magician Navigation</a> because it is a light-monster.  <a data-name=""Chocolate Magician Girl"">Chocolate Magician Girl</a>: It has a draw-effect that brings a Spellcaster to the Graveyard which works great in a Graveyard-deck, if you discard <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> or <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a>, you can also use it to fusion summon very fast from the Graveyard.  <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Armor&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Armor""</a>: World Legacy cards are a good side theme with Graveyard effects, you can put it to the Graveyard with <a data-name=""Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> and then special summon it to use it's special summon-effect and get another World Legacy Card. This way you can also get <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Crown&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Crown""</a> to the hand which has a special summon-effect. The normal summon effect is more a backup-effect but it can be good against special summons.  <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Crown&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Crown""</a>: It'a World Legacy Card with a good special summon to synchro-summon or link summon it instantly. The normal-summon-negate-effect effect is again more a backup effect.  <a data-name=""Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> – You can summon really fast <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> with it, and also bring another World-Legacy monster to the graveyard to special summon it.  <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> – You can special summon a second <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> and build <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> to special summon <a data-name=""Magical Hound"">Magical Hound</a> or <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>. If you special summon <a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a> with <a data-name=""Deep sea Diva"">Deep sea Diva</a> you can also special summon the second <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, this is important when you want to synchro-summon <a data-name=""Crystron Quariongandrax"">Crystron Quariongandrax</a> with a level 6 monster.  <a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a> – When it gets special summoned with a Graveyard-effect, with <a data-name=""One for one"">One for one</a> or <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> you can special summon <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a>, or <a data-name=""Chocolate Magician Girl"">Chocolate Magician Girl</a> from the Graveyard. This is mostly good to have another 'token' for Synchro- or Link-summons.  <a data-name=""Magical Hound"">Magical Hound</a> – The best level 1-tuner to search with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> because when you link summon or snychro summon after you special sumoned it, you can special summon it again from the graveyard and put a face-up spell/trap to the hand. This can also be good with card destruction.  <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a> – A good Token-card that is also level 1 to get it with <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>, and which is also a tuner to special summon it with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, you can often stall a round with it to play counter-cards more effectively or you can summon link-monsters.  &nbsp;  Spells:  <a data-name=""Wonder Wand"">Wonder Wand</a>, <a data-name=""Allure Of Darkness"">Allure Of Darkness</a>, <a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a>, <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a> –  draw cards, <a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a> and <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a> are good draw cards with Graveyard-effects. For <a data-name=""Wonder Wand"">Wonder Wand</a> you have 10 Spellcasters, without the fusion- and link-monsters, and for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> you have 12 Dark monsters. To use <a data-name=""Wonder Wand"">Wonder Wand</a> you can also play instant fusion and send <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> to the Graveyard, or you link-summon <a data-name=""Relinquished Anima"">Relinquished Anima</a> with a 'level 1'-effect monster.  <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>, <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""One For One"">One For One</a> – Fast special summons to get <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> (spellcaster), link-summons or synchro-summons. <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a> can also put a card to the Graveyard to special summon it then with another card.  <a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a>, <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a>: <a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a> has a strong banish-effect, and it can bring you <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> or <a data-name=""Magician Navigation"">Magician Navigation</a> to the hand, otherwise you can maybe still rearrange the next three cards to play then a draw-card.  <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>, <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a>: Reborn-cards, you can get <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a> with the effect of <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> or with special summoning <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Armor&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Armor""</a>.  &nbsp;  Traps:  <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>, <a data-name=""Escape from the Dark Dimension"">Escape from the Dark Dimension</a>, <a data-name=""World Reassembly"">World Reassembly</a>, <a data-name=""World Legacy Landmark"">World Legacy Landmark</a> - Special-summon cards from the Graveyard, deck and banished cards. <a data-name=""World Legacy Landmark"">World Legacy Landmark</a> is a 'double-reborn' as a trap which works also good to link-summon in the opponent round with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> or <a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</a>.  <a data-name=""Magician Navigation"">Magician Navigation</a> – Strong Special summon-card and then also a strong-negate card, because of all the other special-summon cards you should only need 1 of it.  <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>: Strong Negate-Card that works twice against special sumoned monsters. Most Special-summon-effects need 1-3 effects to trigger until you can special summon the 'boss-monster', so negates are often necessary.  &nbsp;  Extra Deck  Link-1:  <a data-name=""Relinquished Anima"">Relinquished Anima</a> – it is used to get a spellcaster, for <a data-name=""Wonder Wand"">Wonder Wand</a>, to link-summon <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of The Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of The Master Magicians</a>, or to fusion-summon <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a>.  <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> – it is used to use the tokens for the link-summons.  Link-2:  <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> - you can get Instant Fusion for <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> which is also a spellcaster, or you can fusion summon with a spellcaster and a <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>/<a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> from the Graveyard.  <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> - It gives the link-monsters a 'destroy by card-effects-immunity' when you use it as material, you can also use it in the opponent round with the quick effect.  <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> - you can link summon it in a fast way with only one <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a>, or together with other special summon-cards. With the Banish-effect in the opponent's turn you can get <a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a> and then put <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> for a fusion summon to the graveyard, or <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Crown&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Crown""</a> for <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> or another monster. When you put a 'level 6'-monster to the graveyard you get a 'level 1'-tuner that can instantly synchro-summon. With a level 6 monster on the field you can get <a data-name=""Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"">Clear Wing Synchro Dragon</a>, and with a level 6- monster and another level-2 Tuner (<a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a>), you get <a data-name=""Crystron Quariongandrax"">Crystron Quariongandrax</a> to banish 3 monsters, you can also use a 'level 7'-monster and two 'level 1'-tuners. You must use 3 effects in a row for this in the opponment's turn, so you want to have a negate or a plan-b when you summon in this way.  <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> – You can only link-summon it with <a data-name=""World Legacy Landmark"">World Legacy Landmark</a>, <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a>, <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Armor&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Armor""</a> or <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Crown&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Crown""</a> in the graveyard. <a data-name=""World Reassembly"">World Reassembly</a> does not count as a 'World Legacy'-card, but it can special summon one. Then you can get <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a> from the deck and special summon one monster with it to link-summon again, this triggers the second effect that puts an opponent's card back to the deck.  Link-3:  <a data-name=""Selene, Queen Of The Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen Of The Master Magicians</a> – This card is used to have a reborn-effect for the Spellcaster-Monsters. You get one spell counter for every Spell on the field an in the graveyard, and it counts the spells of both players. With at least 3 spell counters you can special summon 1 Spellcaster from the graveyard and maybe use another combo-effect then with it.  Link-4:  <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess</a> – You can summon it get a lot of negates that can be used more than one time in the opponent's turn, you can also use it later as a link-4-material to summon <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> if you get it back from the graveyard or if it survives.  <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> – It is good with link-4 and link-5 monsters because then it gets 6300 or 7300 atk, so you do not need a monster that has 'battle-damage'-immunity anymore. It also has a shoot-effect, needs only 2 monsters, and can be combo'd with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> to get a 'destroy by card-effects'-immunity.  Link-5:  <a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</a> – You can use one monster from the opponent as material, so you can outplay 'destroy'-immunities (but not 'target'-immunities) with it, it is also good with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> as a trap in the opponent's turn, you need 3 of your own monsters then and one has to be link-2. As secondary effects it has an 'activated-monster-effect'-immunity and a Graveyard-summon-negate, but it can be destroyed in battle.  Synchro:  <a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a> - You can summon it with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> or in another way. You can put one monster to the graveyard as a main effect, and then synchro-summon another monster.  <a data-name=""Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"">Clear Wing Synchro Dragon</a> – A good monster with negate-effect, that is also easy to summon with a 'level 6'-monster and a 'level 1'-tuner.  <a data-name=""Crystron Quariongandrax"">Crystron Quariongandrax</a> – You can summon it after you used the effect of <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, or later in the game when you can summon two tuners from the graveyard or the deck. You need one 'level 6' or 'level 7' card and two tuners to gel 'level 9' in total, then you can banish three monsters as a 'burst'-effect and get a banished monster back when it gets destroyed.  Fusion:  <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> - A target for <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> and a spellcaster.  <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a> – A strong 'draw effect'-card, that gives you up to two monsters back when it gets destroyed that you can use for more combo's. It is easy to summon it when you put <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>/<a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> from the deck to the graveyard, with only two effect monsters then for <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>. With the draw-effect you can also directly set traps and use them if you draw a trap-card with it.

This is a beginner-friendly deck with o,"&nbsp;  &nbsp;  <strong>Utopia. </strong> That card was always a little 'out-there' as a viable deck that did anything other than make a guest spot on any Rank-4 Toolkit deck-list. But that all changes with the new structure deck!  But the most important aspect of this deck is coming to terms with the fact that playing Utopia as Yuma intended is.... Awful. Dododo etc are just... not great in a format where we constantly have to deal with negation effects. This deck<strong> NEEDED</strong> ways to set up XYZs plays without being so vulnerable. Enter 'Random-Jank I threw together so it's resistant to negation'.deck.   With cards like <a data-name=""Heroic Challenger-Assault Halberd "">Heroic Challenger - Assault Halberd, Goblindbergh and Summoner Monk, this made the deck more responsive due to the support of the all new Zexal Server (ZS) monsters, ZS Ascend Sage and ZS Arms Sage!  Two powerful new monsters who can special summon themselves if you meet their requirements. (Instead of all that Dododo Gagaga normal summon stuff.)</a>  This deck is meant to streamline your way to victory using the Zexal Weapons (ZW) which are in your side deck to adapt to different matches so you can OTK easily using combos like Utopia Beyond! and ZW - Ashura Strike to reduce all opponent monster's attack values to 0 and attack multiple times!  Or just use the field spell to make King Overfiend with its proper material to lock the opponent out of monster effects so you can achieve game easier this way. You're a pure and simple beat stick deck and don't you forget it!  This has been UtopicJay &amp; don't forget to High-Five the Sky!  (Or 'Kattobingu' if you're weird.)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Synchros always have been my favorite amongst all other monsters and since I never got around into making a full deck back then, I thought it would be a good idea to make it now. After some trial and error I came up with this:  &nbsp;  Summon Dux and Phalanx with Dragunity Whirlwind, synchro summon Vajrayana, equip then summon Phalanx with its own effect, normal summon Deep Sea Diva, then another one from the deck with its effect, then synchro summon Red Supernova Dragon.  &nbsp;  Special summon Ice Bell, then Glass Bell, then Snow Bell, then synchro summon Clear Wing Synchro Dragon (first) then Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon (second).  &nbsp;  Ideal conditions to bring Ruddy Rose Dragon: normal summon White Rose Dragon, then special summon from your hand or GY (can be sent there with Foolish Burial) one Red Rose Dragon. Synchro summon Black Rose Dragon, then using Red Rose's effect special summon Roxrose Dragon from your hand or deck, then all you have left to do is synchro summon Ruddy Rose Dragon using both monsters as materials.  OR (the hard, unorthodox way)  Synchro Summon Black Rose Dragon using Angraecum Umbrella and another level 4* monster, then you can clear the field, use Stardust Shimmer or Monster Reborn to bring him back, activate Double Summon and summon a level 3* tuner, then synchro summon Ruddy Rose Dragon. If you don't have Double Summon in your hand at the time, you can wait a turn, use Stardust Shimmer, then normal summon the level 3* tuner.  Tip: Once you clear the field with Black Rose Dragon you can freely use your Ice Bell to summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon  &nbsp;  Disclaimer: I moved these cards to the side deck bc of how inconsistent this combo was during each duel (it can work but its kinda hard to pull off in THIS deck, might have to make a seperate one just for that). Anyway.....  Using One For One, summon Glow-Up Bulb, send Dandylion to graveyard. Summon 2 tokens, then synchro summon Formula Synchro. After that, normal summon Debris Dragon then using its effect, special summon Dandylion. Synchro summon Stardust Dragon, then special summon 2 tokens with Dandylion's effect, activate Glow-Up Bulb from the GY, then Synchro summon T.G. Recipro Dragonfly. Once they're all on the field synchro summon 1 Stardust Sifr Divine Dragon.  &nbsp;  That's all that is packed in this deck. The rest of the cards are there for support, support meaning excessive drawing power using cards such as Graceful Charity, Pot Of Greed, Morphing Jar, Magical Mallet, Reload (x3).  &nbsp;  29/01/2022 edit:  Deck can be tuned to be tournament friendly by removing Graceful Charity and Pot Of Greed for Magical Mallet/Card Destruction/Card Trader (your choice).  Crystal Clear Wing Synchro Dragon summon conditions (1 turn summon): you need Righty Driver, Double Summon and Angraecum Umbrella, plus one level 4* monster in your hand or GY. Activate Double Summon then normal summon Right Driver. Summon Lefty Driver using Right Driver's effect then once both are on the field Synchro summon Tatsunoko. Normal summon Angraecum Umbrella, activate its effect, pick a level 4* monster, special summon it, then synchro summon Clear Wing Synchro Dragon. Once Tatsunoko and Clear Wing Synchro Dragon are on the field, you can freely summon Crystal Clear Wing Synchro Dragon. <h3 class=""LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md""></h3>"

Kaiju and Barriers. Puppet Queen is an OCG exclusive atm. ,"<span>WR Meteoragon 2600</span>  <span>WR Bashileos 2700</span>  <span>War Rock X</span>  <span>Puppet Queen 2200</span>  <span>Puppet King 2800</span>  <span>+600 War Rock</span>  <span>+1000 for 2 turns </span>  <span>Solemn Strike</span>  <span>Negate </span>  <span>So, I've been keeping my eyes on War Rocks even with all the hate it's been getting. I especially love the Myutants-angle when people discuss their hate for War Rocks. </span>  <span>Over the last month-ish I've been stockpiling bad cards ahead of the Armageddon. With the introduction of another hate magnet of a card. Puppet Queen. I've been digging deeper in bad side of bad decks and then I see that there is a bit of hope coming in the direction of War Rocks and pure warrior decks. Though this hope is very basic. It is not a combo-enabler. Or 1 card AAccesspollousa. It won't even contribute to the traditional concept of control. I just saw a potentially, oppressive board that made me think of an old movie with a tide turning ambush scene.</span>  <span>First off, this deck to work. You need access to a War Rock Mountain to get your War Rock targets out. A Puppet Queen in hand and a lv7 Warrior in GY or hand. You have to manage to get 1-2 warrior's on board with Queen in hand and a target for her effect.</span>  <span>Queen's effect is to SS a lv7 and buff the board (of Warriors) by 1000 until the end of the next turn. 2 turns.</span>  <span>So, with 2-3 War Rocks and Puppet Queens boost. That will be a 1400-1600 attack boost to your War Rocks, for 2 turns.</span>  <span>Meteoragon with boost, can sit at  3600-4200 and can attack two targets with 1 of it's own monster effects and lockdown monster effects during Battle Phase</span>  <span>Bashileos can/will be able to attack directly with 3700-4300+.</span>  <span>Then add another 400-600 Atk boost to your War Rocks if your opponent doesn't read your cards and tries to attack during their turn. </span>  <span>Anyways, I'm playing around this pile of cards and searching for consistency cards to get out early high level warriors and the field spell. Field spell support that doesn't help War Rock Mountain miss timing. There is not a lot of generic Field Spell support that gets around a ""when"" condition. AND! War Rocks are missing better ways to get it out outside of Fortia attacking or being attacked. It's kind of of a sad situation... </span>  <span>Anyways(again), I've been toying around with basic hand traps, Kaiju's and a barrier statue.  With the lopsided loadout; They have been proving too strong against weak decks to properly test progress and too often, too slow against proper rogue and meta decks. So, I am trying to find a middle ground while keeping the identity of the deck.</span>  <span>What I would love to see added (now that they are imported over to the OCG is): An Archetypal Field Spell/Spell card search that immediately activates. A counter trap or strong board disruption to assist and coordinate you into the Battle Phase. Like, a battle prep kind of effect. </span>  I'm actually currently using a 42 version of all this."

This is not the typical control style Sky Strikers deck. This deck is very aggressive.  Crystron Halqifibrax is the easiest way into Accesscode so having access to a tuner is of course required. Shaddoll Falco, Effect Veiler and Instant Fusion facilitate this requirement.  <strong>Shaddoll</strong>  Shaddoll Fusion will bring out Winda or Construct, and can also send Raye or Roze to the GY. Winda is also a bridge into Selene which gets to Accesscode.  Having Falco also increases the odds of Allure of Darkness being successful.  <strong>Spells</strong>  -Monster Reborn to bring out Falco, Veiler, Winda for the Accesscode play or any Sky Striker for Striker plays. -Mystic Mine to stall. -Instant Fusion to bring out Winda for Selene or Sea Monster for Halq. -Metalfoes Fusion - extra draw power -Foolish Burial - to get Metalfoes or other spells to GY -ROTA - For Raye/Roze -Pot of Avarice - Draw power + recycle monsters"

Now the film also becomes a game. <a>https://yourdramainfo.wildapricot.org/balsinjehan</a>  The game in question is simply called ""Space Jam: A New Legacy - The Game"" and seems to be inspired by 90's beat em up games like ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time"" and ""Final Fight"". <a>https://yourdramainfo.wildapricot.org/jombikeuleoswi-heili</a>  The game was apparently created after fans sent in ideas for a ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" game, where Narayan from India and Ricky from the USA won. The developers behind it are Digital Eclipse, which made some games in the 90's and made itself known for releasing old games in new formats. <a>https://yourdramainfo.wildapricot.org/yeol-ahob</a>  The premise of ""Space Jam: A New Legacy - The Game"" seems simply inspired by the movie where the playable characters LeBron James, Snurre Sprätt and Lola must fight The Goon Squad to get out of Warner Bros.'s servers and save the basketball star's kidnapped son. <a>https://yourdramainfo.wildapricot.org/goegimaensyon</a>  Also read: The first trailer for ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" has landed <a>https://yourdramainfo.wildapricot.org/bichnaneun-sungan</a>  The game will be released exclusively to the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription service on July 1st.

The entire core of Orcust is really cheap (besides Girsu).  My advice is to take your money and invest it into stonks that cover a variety of future-proof innovations, like the development of nuclear fusion generators and oversized bananas for scale.  No? .... Oke!  Jokes aside, this deck can be very fun! It has taken part in the imnious ""Eternal Format"", and who knows? As things develop, maybe we will return to it after the next ban list. Or should we ask: Did we really ever left it?  The side deck presents hopes, dreams and disappointment and can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!  &lt;&lt; Edit:  For SOME reason I didn't include Foolish Burrial in the deck list. I took out One for One for it.  Orcust Cymbal went from 2 to 3.  Orcust Bass went from 2 to 1.  I took out Dingirsu for a Linkuribo. &gt;&gt;  &nbsp;"

The red eyes monster might feel out of place but it can be special summoned by banishing a dragon, something this deck has plenty of, and then lets you special summon a dragon once during each main phase for free, from the graveyard or the hand, this provides plenty of recycling considering all but one of your level 8 monsters are dragons as are five of the available tuners. Metaltron requires three tributes but will let you tribute continuous spells and traps as substitutes for monsters and he is level 9 so while he can brick he helps  somewhat, plus call of the haunted doesn't leave the field unless the card it brought back was destroyed so if you use the monster it brought back as a tribute for something, it will just sit there clogging up a backrow space. but you can tribute it to summon Metaltron which makes him more useful. And Cloudcastle revives a level 9 when summoned but prevents level 8 or lower monsters from attacking the turn they were summoned."

Time for Salamangreat to turn up the heat!","Now that Miragestallio is back, Salad builds have started to run <a data-name=""Backup Secretary"">Backup Secretary</a> and <a data-name=""Sea Archiver"">Sea Archiver</a> again. While this does make it easier to access Miragestallio, I think that it's not necessary, as you already have plenty of level 3s in the deck (Foxy, Spinny, Gazelle, <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a> even) that you'll either draw or add to hand during your combos. You also only have 1 rank 3 that you'll want to go into in this strategy, that being Miragestallio. Instead, I continued to include <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed (from earlier builds)</a> for easy access to rank 4s (which are less accessible to this deck.)  Extra deck ratios are pretty standard, just sided the usual Bagooska for Miragestallio. Also, I know I'm not running that many hand traps, but I built the deck to be more focused around playing through hand traps than using them, but I still included the best ones.  Anyways, feel free to leave suggestions in the comments about how to improve on this deck, and also tell me what deck I should make next."

A very consistent one.  Reasons therefor is mainly their field spell. Any link 3 or above Marincess monster combined with the field spell is good. The big problem is that those protection effects are only applied while the field spell stays on the field.  Beyond the boss monster you are able to put up there is nothing to interact with the other player. No negates or whatsoever (Except for Marincess wave). My wish would be to get another Monster that is able to interact more...  So we desperately need some way to keep our field spell on the board. Either by protecting it (Field barrier) or by interrupting the opponent. Normally the way to do this would be by putting up some negates.  &nbsp;  We need to know just little things about this deck: <ol>  	<li>Your hand is dead if you have no Marincess monster card hence why we are playing some of the trash cards (and more than one mandarine).</li>  	<li>How many Marincess monsters you need to summon one link 4 marincess monster with searching the field spell and the summoned monster needs crystal heart as material.</li>  	<li>How can I utilize the other cards to put up more protection.</li>  	<li>The magical number is level 8. (Synchro summon).</li>  	<li>The field spell only protects from the opponents effects (torrential).</li>  	<li>You have a lot of built in protections (field spell, Basilalima, Marbled rock, Wonder Heart, dont sleep on Fury of Kairyu-Shin).</li> </ol> A few combos you need to know: <ol>  	<li>Blue Tang or Sea Horse = field spell + link 4: NS Sea Horse --&gt; Link 1 Blue slug, effect add back Sea Horse --&gt; SS Sea Horse --&gt; Link 1 Sea angel, effect add field spell --&gt; link 2 splash mage, effect special sea horse --&gt; link 2 Coral anenome, effect reborn splash mage, activate field spell --&gt; link4</li>  	<li>Blue Tang +  Pascalus + any extender = field spell + link 4 + toadally awesome (Careful with zone placement): NS Pascalus, effect, SS Blue Tang, pitch Sea horse --&gt; link 1 (Blue tang) Blue Slug, effect Sea horse to hand, effect draw Blue tang (<strong>CHAINBLOCK</strong>) --&gt; SS Sea horse --&gt; link 1 Sea angel, effect search field spell --&gt; link 2 Coral anenome (both link 1s), effect reborn blue tang --&gt; XYZ Bahamut, effect SS toad --&gt; activate field spell, link 4, effect field spell</li>  	<li><strong>PERFECT COMBO: </strong>Pascalus + Blue Tang + (1. Instant Fusion + 2 ways for level 3 (Sea horse, Sea archiver, monster reborn, world legacy suc)/(2. Scrypton + Arboria + extender)/(3. <em>Always have in mind that WHITE Stingray reborn can be a tuner</em>) = field spell + link 4 + toad + Dragite: basically the same as the 2. combo but in case of 1. make sure to summon the Sea archiver when possible or just reborn + Theseus (Instant Fusion) for Dragite; 2. Arboria can be summoned at the end in a zone and scrypton should be easy too; 3. white stingray can be a tuner and therefor is + another level 4 after being reborn (Coral anenome is always a 100% reborn) is Dragite too. Extenders for that are Shthana, Silent Angler, Aqua Spirit, another Stingray, etc.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  Thinks i tried but really disliked were handtraps. They were always the keyfactor to bricking. Without handtraps there are just a few unplayable hands. It's actually good.  I really hope you enjoy this build! Any ideas are welcome!  &nbsp;"

Can beat some fairly competitive decks like Salamangreat.,"Deck Profile, How to, Combos, and Duel Replay:  https://youtu.be/Jd7Gb91iWMY  You should focus on using Different Dimension Capsule to banish Obelisk The Tormentor so you can add it to your hand two turns from activation. During the 1st turn after that, you should focus on using the Photon Sabre Tiger or Nimble engine to get monsters on your field and protect yourself. The Nimble engine will keep your opponent busy. The second turn after you should use the Condemned Witch engine to grab a Forbidden Chalice from your deck, and then during your opponents turn activate its effect to summon Ra's Desciple, which will activate and allow you to summon two more Ra's Desciple. On your third turn if you didn't get board wiped you should have enough monsters to tribute summon for Obelisk.  Tribute summon for Obelisk earlier if you also can get Exchange Souls in hand.  Use Supply Squad to draw through your deck and the other cards to protect you and control the board. When you have used up your Nimble or condemned witch's, use Pot of Avarice to recycle them back into the deck and draw two.  Try to also time your Obelisk Summon so you can use Fist of Fate to board wipe your opponent's backrow.  Also have a blast!"

This time I will discuss about other cards, additional cards, and replacement cards th","I will continue with the YuGiOh Duel Links guide on Worm decks. This time I will discuss about other cards, additional cards, and replacement cards that you can use on the Worm deck. You can replace some cards, add cards, and even remake the Worm deck that I created in the first part of this article.  You can replace all the cards in the Worm deck using all the cards that I will discuss, except the Evil Dragon Ananta card. This is because, Evil Dragon Ananta is a mainstay monster card that is in synergy with the Worm monster card.  In addition, if you don't use Evil Dragon Ananta, the Worm deck is not strong enough to face other decks in the YuGiOh Duel Links game.  Regarding the character's ability, you can actually replace it with all the existing character's abilities or you think are suitable. Alternative character abilities that I recommend when using the Worm deck are Yami Yugi's Destiny Draw or Joey Wheeler's Last Gamble.  To find out what other cards, additional cards, and replacement cards you can use on the Worm deck, see the cards and their explanations below.  A monster card that has the following effect: if flipped, you can destroy an enemy's Spell/Trap card in the field. This card is suitable for destroying/controlling the enemy's back row.  If you have trouble destroying the enemy's back row before you can special summon Devil Dragon Ananta, then you can use this card first.  You can get this card through the Generation Next pack gatcha.

The purpose of using this monster card is to use it as a beater, because it has a fairly high ATK, namely: 1850. One of the Reptile-type monsters that has a fairly high ATK.  You can get this card through the Echoes of Silence pack gatcha.  Reptile type monster card which has the following effect: if it is flipped, you can return one monster card in the field.  A Reptile-type monster card that has very useful effects on you!

Regardless the presence of Halqlifibrax, Selene, Diviner, and especially Masquerena still means this isn't a budget deck. I decided to make this a seperate decklist as the intention will be to eventually buy the missing cards and use the original deck, or playtest the changed cards to see which ones work better. As such this is a stop gap.  The primary gameplan hasn't changed, this is a control deck with a small emphasis on getting out I:P Masquerena, Absolute Dragon and a 3rd monster to summon Avramax and Vortex during the opponent's turn, While using any remaining cards in the hand to fortify the board. One possible combo is detailed my my original deck post.  As for the changes, The Solemn traps are replaced by one <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>, and two each of <a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance</a> and <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a>. This is mainly for another card to get Cutia out and backrow hate, respectably. For the Extra, <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> replaces Abyss Dweller as I don't have a 3rd copy of the latter yet. For the side deck I went with 1 <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>, 2 of <a data-name=""Denko Sekka"">Denko Sekka</a>, and 3 of <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>. this is in place of the Ash and Nibiru. With Veiler as a lateral move form Ash and Sekka and Twisters being more backrow hate for the recently empowered Sky Striker matchup, as well as Pendulum deck (such as the mirror) and trap-heavy decks like Eldlitch (since Sekka blocks Traps)  &nbsp;  Minor updates would warrant changing this list, directly, while more substantial updates (being it adjusting for the banlist or changing out 7 or more cards in total) would parent a new iteration which would be labeled 0.2 or 1.0 depending on how tournament ready (Locals mainly) I think this list is.  <hr />  EDIT:  -2 Denko Sekka, -2 Anti-Spell Fragerance  +1 <a data-name=""Trias Hierarchia"">Trias Hierarchia</a>, +1 <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>. +2 <a data-name=""Archfiend Eccentrick"">Archfiend Eccentrick</a>"

Generic beast support while trying to annoy your opponent as much as possible but with cute cards. ,This deck relies on special summoning as much as you can. Ideally you want to see rescue cat and obedience schooled in your opening hand so you can bring out naturia beast and Melffy of the forest turn on going first to deny your opponent plays and then set up a board of beefy extra deck monsters to attack with. It’s very reliant on seeing specific cards as early as possible which is why it’s a super casual deck but I still tried to make it work.

Frist of all i won`t explain the standart Lyrilusc Tri-Brigade combos there are enough Youtuber`s that do that, i rather focus on the cards that are unusual in this deck.  The only thing i will say is <u>don`t</u> use Fraktall to send Kit to the Gy and then send Nervall and then search 4 something.  Just use Fraktall to send Nervall and then search and in the 1st turn u most likely want to search Kit and NS her.  So now to the unusal cards in this deck.  Main Deck:  Danger Thunderbrid/ Jackalope  Thunderbird is the Wingedbeast extender that u somtimes need and Jackalope can SS him from the deck and also u can pop a set card with it if u play u`r hand out first.  Jackalope can be searched with Shuraig and is also a target 4 Rescue Cat waht somtimes will come in handy.  Reborn Tengu:  Can SS a other Kopie from the Deck (<u>not</u> once per turn) can get u to high Link`s very esay and fuels the GY.  Can be searched with Tenki and SS from the deck with Airborne.  And i know u can draw 2 ore 3 Kopies of it but keep in mind this is a 50 card deck so it won`t happend that much.  Simorgh of the Beginning:  If u really need a Wingedbeast or lvl 1 on the Field u can send him from the deck to the GY an SS him but keep in mind that he locks u under Wingedbeast.  He also can protect Simorgh bird of sovereignty because of the eff of Simorgh bird of sovereignty.  Can also be SS with the eff of Simorgh of the Kings.  Watch Cat:  Is importent 4 Ariborne because of the low ATK of Lyrilusc mons and Nervall so u always have a traget in the deck to SS.  Is a traget 4 Rescue Cat  A free lvl 1 extender.  U leave it on the field if u dont need it to bann it in the EP and search Tenki 4 the next turn.  Extra Deck:  2x Shuraig 2x Ferrijit 2x Simorgh bird of sovereignty:  Because u`r board can be broken and this deck is not a Glasscannon. Playing 2 of each of them will help u build up u`r board agian and gain the control of the field back.  Cross Sheep:  Is the Link that u just  want to summon if u just need a link 2 and if u summoned Gamma and Driver in ur turn because u dont have a other easy way to use them but if u want to do that keep in mind to do that before u use the Linksummon eff from one off ur Tri-Brigade mons.  Side Deck:  Archnemeses Eschatos:  U only want to side him in Game 2 or 3 when u know that u`r going 2nd or u`r going first and u`r opponent is playing a dragon deck because the eff only works with types that are on the field. But it is very powerful it can nuke u`r opponents board and lock him so he can`t summon.  Spiritualism:  The beast way to out Spells and Traps that are strong agianst this deck like Zombieworld or Mine it don`t taget, don`t destroys and can`t be negated.  There is no way that u`r opponent can protect his spells/traps from this card, it will gives u 1 turn and this is all waht u need.  The rest of the deck is common stuff. If u want to test out this deck u need to know it is not 4 starter it can take some time to get used to it u will make many missplays and most important have Fun with this Deck.  I would love if u leave me a Komment if u Like this deck and waht do u think waht could i do to make it better."

However, it can still become a reality. About a month ago, the collection ""Mass Effect: Legendary Edition"" landed, which are nicer versions of the beloved science fiction trilogy. <a>https://oss1173filmguide.wildapricot.org/</a> In an interview with the site Business Insider, project manager Mac Walters says that several film adaptations of the games have been underway, but have failed. <a>https://conjuring3deutschguide.wildapricot.org/</a> Also read: 5 games that should be a movie or TV series  As early as 2010, a ""Mass Effect"" film was announced by Legendary Pictures, which never materialized. Walters says that one of the difficulties was to compress the expansive and story-heavy universe in a film. <a>https://thesuicidesquaddeutschguide.wildapricot.org/</a>  - It felt like we were always fighting headwinds with the franchise. What story do you tell in 90-120 minutes?  Instead of a film, the project was transformed into a TV series, which also did not lift from idea to reality.  Mac Walters says, however, that this does not mean that it will never get rid of, but rather that it is a matter of time before it becomes a film or TV series of ""Mass Effect"".  - It's more about when, than about. It is such a vast world and so many in the TV and film industry have asked us if we want to do it and said that we really should do it, he says. <a>https://spacejam2deutschguide.wildapricot.org/</a>  The first ""Mass Effect"" was released in 2007 and is about the human soldier Shepherd, who together with an ensemble of interesting types goes into space to defeat the synthetic Reaper creatures who want to kill all biological life in the universe. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://twitter.com/FilmKaamelott"">Kaamelott : Premier volet </a>"

I choose Crashbug cause they are Trash and Dzeeff made a video about them 7 months ago.  The decks original strategie is like making Rank 3 Xyz's!?? I tried to support them as good as I could in that matter.  The archetype consists out of 5 cards. I included all but one of them, since Super Crashbug doesn't serve the strategie of making Rank 3 Xyz plays.  Tour Guide From The Underworld is a natural inclusion to the deck, as well as the little Speedroid engine.  The rest of the cards is just genric goodstuff that fills up the empty space.  Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!"

It got its own structure deck but it started earlier than that, it first debuted with the monster geargiano who was in Generation Force, the was the only card of the archetype at the time and didn’t have specific name listing so it wasn’t an archetype quite yet. Later it got actual support in Rise of the Duelist. Later they would go to get their own structure deck, and, despite never taking off too far, got their own little following. But they’re also known to be pretty bad, sure they got monster spam but they also are pretty underwhelming these days, but here we are! Earth machines to save the day! With all of the new earth machine cards making machina one of the better decks in the game I decided to use that for geargia, I took an ancient gear spin to make the deck have a little more brute force and trains for an OTK swing, I could’ve added more but I felt that then it wouldn’t be a Geargia deck anymore."

Then, if you activate Vampire's Domain and then summon Vampire Red Baron, activate Domain to normal summon Scourge and then use his ability to bring Baron back? That gives you your ace monster, Vampire Sheridan and there's a few fun things that can do from there depending on the stage that the duel is at.  The Retainer and Familiar play on sending your own Vampire cards to the graveyard so Voivode is one of the first ones you'll want to try to send there if you can because when you use Bram's effect to special summon monsters from your opponent's grave, it's easy to get Voivode out on the field. Then, if you use Bram and Vampire Sucker's effects on the same turn, you can just sacrifice 2 of your opponents special summoned monsters to get Voivode out on the field so you don't have to sacrifice your own monsters.  Just a deck for casual play but I have fun with it"

Feel free to leave suggestions on how I can improve the deck.,"Hello everyone, its very nice to see you guys again and I hope you guys are keeping safe during these times. So just recently I've attended my first yugioh locals and it was a pretty fun and interesting experience for myself even though I didn't expect to perform well I still got the chance to learn from my mistakes whilst trying to improve &amp; tweak the deck a little bit.  So far I've made a few adjustments to the deck such as adding Jack-o-bolan for more GY extenders as well as a copy of Drowning Mirror force to the deck. At the moment I am planning on making the deck competitive being that its the only deck that I am playing at this point and personally I don't see myself playing different deck such as the Mayakashi. However my best friend Zoroark_Gaming was luckily enough to pull 1 copy of Eldlich the Golden Lord from Maximum Gold recently and from there I thought to myself that maybe there is a chance I can make this deck more competitive once I've figured out a well balanced ratio for the deck as well as I am thinking of replacing a copy of Oboro-Guruma, the Wheeled Mayakashi for a copy of Draconecro Nethersoul Dragon in future builds of the deck.  &nbsp;  I would love to hear your guys thoughts and suggestions on how I can improve my Mayakashi deck as well as what cards should be taken out and replaced with and also what ratio of cards that I could play to make the deck more balanced."

The main combo is to get light+past on the field, to banish light with past to get Water from the deck and draw 2. From there on, you need to synchro and then de-synchro with your fortune ladies to keep spamming Fortune Lady Water's draw 2 effect, until you find a card that'll let you summon a second FL Water.  Once you have 2 FL Waters in rotation, you can start making Lv9 Synchros like Ravenous Crocosaur and Trishula, and then draw 4 every time you de-synchro.  For an example, check near the end of the video (timestamps are in the description)."

Welcome.  ENGAGE is back, expanding the Sky Striker's toolset. <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!"">Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</a> is a spell for Sky Strikers that searches any card besides itself, and lets you draw 1 if you have 3 spells or more in your GY. Crazy, isn't it? For first time Sky Striker players, this deck may prove to be challenging, but fear not, because I will help you along the way!  Let's engage!  I have been playing Sky Strikers since its release in 2019, and I have to say it is one of the most fun and rewarding decks to play if done right. It certainly plays out a lot of cards at once, so newcomers to YuGiOh may not know what to do with all of the combos. Here are some examples:  <strong>Sky Strikers go first: </strong>  For this starting hand we have: Multirole, Area Zero/Terraforming, Roze, and There Can Be Only One <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole"">Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole &gt; <em>Destroys</em> </a><a data-name=""Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero"">Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero</a><a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole""> &gt; <em>SS</em> </a><a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Raye"">Sky Striker Ace - Raye &gt;</a><a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Raye""> <em>Link</em> </a><a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Kagari"">Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</a> &gt; Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero <em>to hand &gt; </em><em>Play </em>Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero</li>  	<li><em>Play </em><a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a></li>  	<li><em>SS</em> <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Roze"">Sky Striker Ace - Roze</a></li> </ul> OR <ul>  	<li>Sky Striker Ace - Raye &gt; <em>Link</em> <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku"">Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku</a> &gt; <em>End And Search </em>Sky Striker (Any Spell)</li> </ul> So, even though it's not shown, there are many different variations of just 1 turn with 5 cards. Sky Strikers can be extremely powerful in 1:1 exchanges and can be further empowered by Kaiju support.  I believe that running 2 of any Kaiju (I prefer Gameciel and Gardala) could work as a helpful support. Running 3 is okay, so long as you have the space for it.  I also run a <a data-name=""Kyoutou Waterfront"">Kyoutou Waterfront</a> here because the effects that come with Kaiju cards could greatly benefit Sky Striker gameplay. Especially Gameciel's.  Why do I run <a data-name=""Summon Limit"">Summon Limit</a>? Because it's simply a good stall tool, but obviously you don't need to run it always. Try Mystic Mine if you don't like people getting advantages.  <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One "">There Can Be Only One</a> simply just helps against a variety of different types of decks. You might want to switch out against decks like Dragon Link and Dinosaur, though.  <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> gives you a good +1 for extra resources. Sure, it may give them 1000 LP, but no one really cares when you have their board wiped out.  <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a> is a good counter to Ghost Girls.  ROTA helps get out Raye or Roze.  Cosmic Cyclone because some spells can be pesky.  Forbidden Droplet because of its power and utility in the current meta.  Accesscode for smashing other people's monsters.  There are many decks for Sky Strikers, but it's up to you to find a deck that works for you. I hope this helps. Thank you!  See you next time!"

Actually, even if you don't end on those two, going first is your best option.  If going first, you can sit on a Number 59: Crooked Cook that was summoned with Right-Hand Shark, leaving you with a Rank 4 that can't be destroyed by battle, and is unaffected by everything if it's the only card on your field. OR you can set up boards of Toadally Awesome, Torrential Tribute, and even Utopic Future Dragon.  But if you need to go second, you have Utopia Double for OTKs and 2 Cosmic Cyclone and Harpies' Feather Duster because screw backrow.  &nbsp;  As for this card's name, it's named after ""The Great Wave off Kanagawa"", one of Japan's most popular paintings and works of art."

Fight me.,"Oh boy it's banlist season. Dino got hit, Dragons finally got hit and Drytron's allowed to live for once. While these changes were to be expected Konami went a little wilder than last time. There's the Drident ban. A *checks notes* quick effect, targeted destruction for *checks notes again* face-up cards? I'm sure that'll stop Zeus. It does stop Utopic Future Dragon from selling but it's not like that card releases next set in 2 weeks or anything, right? Right? Then there's Engage back to 1, making Sky Striker meta again. Well, every eight match at least. And how does Konami justify bringing back such a powerhouse? By giving us Salamangreat players a...chokepoint? Don't get me wrong, bouncing a monster's fun and all and summoning Jack from your deck to add Gazelle back to hand is great but it's not like it increases the deck's power level like Engage does. It did, however, invite a lot of people to brainstorm on how to best play Salamangreat. And the results are...mellow. What do I mean by that? Let's break down the issues modern Salamangreat deckbuilding has.  &nbsp;  <span>The Flame Bufferlo versus Lady Debug debate:</span>  Salamangreat has two main starters, Bufferlo and Debug. Both are fantastic cards but each for completely different reasons. Let's go over their core strenghts. I'm a fan of Bufferlo so I'll start with that one.  <span><a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a></span>: While it is a level 3 Fire Effect monsters let me be clear: There's an almost 0 percent chance you'll use it to make Miragestallio! It's strength is that it's effect doesn't trigger until it's linked off, meaning you can ""chainblock"" it's effect with Balelynx, guaranteeing you a draw 2 effect. It discards when resolving it's effect, making way for another great strength of his. It doesn't contest with your Salamangreat monsters for your Normal Summon. Jack Jaguar, Falco and especially Foxy are other cards that you could normal summon to start your combo. You can discard them with Cynet Mining but it's far more likely that you'll get them into the GY by linking them off. If you normal summon Bufferlo instead he then discards them, turning your otherwise normal summon into an extender. In short, he doesn't ""add"" to your normal summon since he'll just turn your other normals into specials. What he doesn't do is search Gazelle. That makes him fairly weak in a deck that runs only one of each trap and a lot of handtraps. If you're going first seeing handtraps is great and all but traps are generally stronger and if you're going second drawing into your handtraps then is usually too late. but if you're heavy on traps, and on 2 of each Salamangreat trap, it doesn't matter as much if you go first or second, you'll draw, set, pass and win the game during your opponents turn. After all, Gazelle only sets up one interruption anyways and good luck resolving that against an established board. Since it ""converts"" your Salamangreat normal summons I'd recommend 3 Foxy and 2 Spinny (Foxy is great at playing through Nibiru as you don't need to control a Salamangreat monster).  <span><a data-name=""Lady Debug"">Lady Debug</a></span>: This card is a powerhouse. It's a one card OTK with Accesscode Talker and searches Gazelle or a Spinny if you already have access to Gazelle. But the strength of a card's usually negatively correlating to how often you'll resolve it. It's an easy choke and loses to both negates and spot removal. That's why it's generally used in a deck playing a more handtrap/extender oriented version (I say extender oriented but I don't think there's much of a difference in how many extenders both versions play unless you're leaning strongly towards level 3 spam). If it resolves you might just as well win and if you don't you just try again next turn and stop your opponent with your handtraps. Another strong suit of Debug is that it searches <a data-name=""Prohibit Snake"">Prohibit Snake</a> which, in this Winda infested format, is one of Salamangreat's only outs to that card. Since it does use up your normal summon I'd recommend 2 Foxy and 3 Spinny.  <span>The Mix</span>: This is where I find my issues with late Salamangreat deckbuilding. A lot of people like running Bufferlo and Debug in a 3-2 or 2-3 ratio, which I personally don't think is a good idea. As a normal summon they conflict with each other, bricking if you draw both. It also results in people playing both handtraps and traps but both only to a smaller amount, making both strategies less impactful. Now Bufferlo might just draw handtraps going second and your Debug is less likely to resolve as you have less of a chance to disrupt your opponent on their turn. I saw some people run both at three to which I gotta say: Why? In short, I think both version's have their own individual strenghts and weaknesses and I'd advise not to play a mix of both. You'll just end up playing into both weaknesses without gaining much of their individual strengths, resulting in, as I said earlier, mellow decks.  &nbsp;  <span><span>The Bufferlo Version:</span></span>  I said I before and I'll say it again, I love Flame Bufferlo. Drawing 2 and worst case setting a few feels great. Not having to worry about having your normal summon negated is awesome. Seeing your opponent's reaction in realtime when they learn that Bufferlo triggers in hand if they bounce it is priceless. Also I played Drytron when it was meta with VW and everyone was siding against it. No need to say, I did not often resolve my cards and started leaning towards control in the process. Anyways I don't think there's one right version of this deck. Some might play <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>, some might not. Some might play less Spells and add <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> to their list. <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a>'s also totally optional and just a card I personally like a lot. Heatleo is just as good at two but I needeed space for Linguriboh and I mostly summon one to force out backrow anyway. So this is not so much me asserting Bufferlo's dominance or claiming to  have figured out the perfect deck but rather an introduction into the diversity of Salamangreat. The same is true for the side deck. There are a lot of good cards to side and I personally feel like it's hard to settle on which cards are best, especially now that the format is so young (so young in fact that hasn't even started). Nibiru, Lancea and Droll are all incredible blowout cards when you know you're going second, while floodgates might just win you the match going first but Rivalry and Gozen's strength is directly related to the current meta. Some backrow removal is important too and other's - and maybe I myself later down the line - might lean a little deaper into backrow removal. Reboot's great though, pretty much instantly wins you the game against control but too situational to play in Main. If there's anything I strongly stand by in this deck profile it's that I don't think the Bufferlo-Debug-Handtrap-Trap mix I see a lot of lately is the way to go and that purer version's of each will be the way to go. Also don't get me wrong, Miragestallio's great and I'm happy to have it back!"

The Charmers are a group of students with the potential to become such mages. They train under with the great Doriado, a dryad that not only mastered one element, but six. They train so that they can become masters of their element  Originally there were four, Eria, Wynn, Hiita and Aussa. these maidens were discovered when their respective families noticed them in a trance and acting strangely. Their trance was a result of possession by a being aspected to the same element. Doriado managed to find such beings and quell their hold before taking the girls who then adopted their possessors as familiars. The bond between the students and their familiars, as well as each other, strengthened over the years.  Lyna and Dharc came later. A pair of siblings tuned to the primordial and chaotic elements of light and shadow. Doriado noticed they seemed to have greater control over their powers and even contact with their possessors before meeting her, and that their previous circumstances weren't as king to them as their peers'.  The fates of these six are now as avatars of the elements. Forces of nature and elementals themselves. Will these roles lead to them being consumed by that they study to tame or will their humanity shine through and make them powerful mages in their own right? And what will become of the familiars as their training is compete?""  What we have here is a Familiar-Possessed Charmer Control deck. As such it relies mainly on two cards. <a data-name=""Fairy Tail - Luna"">Fairy Tail - Luna</a> and A<a data-name=""wakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend"">wakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend</a> for consistency and power. While most people likely use the original quartet of Aussa, Hiita, Eria and Wynn and some had decided to add in Lyna as well since LIOV, I make the decision to run all 6 of the FP cards and all the available Link counterparts, as well as all 4 of the Awakened Familiars (thought they are all at one each)  The gist of their game plan seems to be to use <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> to turn your Charmers into beatsticks, but also to go for a control playstyle with Luna. To the latter end I use the in-theme cards <a data-name=""Possessed Partnerships"">Possessed Partnerships</a> and <a data-name=""Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin"">Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin</a>. For off-theme cards I run <a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spellcasters"">Secret Village of the Spellcasters</a>, <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Golemn Aruru"">Witchcrafter Golemn Aruru</a>, <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> and <a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries</a>. the Side deck also plays into this with <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>, <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> and <a data-name=""Denko Sekka"">Denko Sekka</a> in triplicate as well as a 3rd Possessed Partnership and for one-offs Raigeki and Dimensional Barrier. I also run two copes of Fairy Tail Tales, but for some reason that's not in the database (Rohcha however is, but I'm obviously not running her). <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>, <a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledge"">Spellbook of Knowledge</a>, <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> and <a data-name=""Metaverse"">Metaverse</a> are there to help me get to key cards.  &nbsp;  Rounding out the extra deck would be... <ul>  	<li>Cherries Targets: <span>Winda</span>, <span>Trishula</span> and <span>Vortex</span> (might replace Trish with <span>The Arrival Cyverse</span>, <span>Dark Templar</span> or <span>Dark Infant</span>)</li>  	<li>Rank 4s: <span>Castel</span>, <span>Emeral</span>, <span>Dweller</span> and <span>Tornado Dragon</span> (Some can double as Cherries targets, thought I might replace Dweller for another Cherries target)</li>  	<li>Links: <span>Apollousa</span>, <span>Borrelsword</span>, <span>Barricadeborg Blocker <span>(Link-4s can also double as Cherries targets)</span> </span></li> </ul> I'm certain there is room for improvement, especially regarding the ED (and the lack of Trap Trick), so any and all feedback is appreciated."

We have <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Red-Eyes+Dark+Dragoon"">DRAGOON</a>, which has good synrgy here, firstly he is the main spellcaster for <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Secret+Village+of+the+Spellcasters"">Secret Village</a>, also the Prolog combo happends in the opponent turn so we happy to use <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Red-Eyes+Fusion"">Red Eys Fusion</a>. We have the base Buster Blader cards for the combo (we play 2 of each ""brick"" so we can still combo if we draw them). Lastly we have 7 card that each allow for spell block. prosperety is optinal but good for acquiring last pice for perfect combo. 0 handtraps becose this build only tries to combo, feel free to add some. Fun fact this deck can play TCBOO if you want.  &nbsp;  1 card well known prolog combo.  hand: prolog + dragon / Buster Whelp. normal your dragon, make link 1 (defult is striker go for anima if need spellcaster). set prolog. opponent turn activate prolog send memories and buster blader. chain memoris banish buster blader and dragon from grave. resolve both  end board: Buater fusion+syncro.

Make protector, send to GY <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dragon+Buster+Destruction+Sword"">Dragon Buster Destruction Sword.</a> Set Prolog same as before. After prolog combo activate the syncro to equip DBDS to fusion.  end board: Buater fusion+syncro+equip. (+link2)  full moneymaker combo  hand: acs to prolog, acs to village, any way to Summon 3 monsters this turn. normal summon+extender link to protector send to GY the equip lvl1. (if have BB in hand can SS here). protector + extender link to verte anaconda. anaconda make dragoon. set Prolog. activate Village.  end board: Buater fusion+syncro+equip, dragoon, verte, village.  general tips: Try exploring how to summon combo picese. protector can SS the brick from hand. syferd can suffle red eyes back to deck. if you have sword in hand + dragoon you can discard for cost and equip with syncro at any time. village works here since syncro makes all monsters opponent controll dragon. can side <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Anti-Spell%20Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance</a> as ""exstra village"" acsees.  hope you find this build interesting."

You don't use your normal summon in any of that, so there are some normal summons included :  -Iblee, since if you summon it before any impcantations, you can link it away into an Almiraj, giving your opponent a 0-def monster to OTK with thanks to Chaos MAX, and as a bonus, it restricts your opponent to only special summoning links while they control it.  And then, if you have two impcantations out by using their effect, you can do a tribute summon instead :  -Zaborg, to destroy itself and then send 8 cards from both player's extra decks to the GY. You can sent N'tss or the Fossil Knight to destroy enemy's cards, or Arc Light to search ritual pieces.  -Vanity's Ruler, to prevent your opponent from special summoning.

Sick of losing to nibiru and dark ruler? Look no further.,"This deck theoretically is good. It is nibiru proof, is hand-trap resilient and doesn't run as many bricks as dark warriors do. It also is drnm and forbidden drip proof. The only things that can beat it going second are cards like cosmic cyclone or blizzard, or handtraps like lancea or d shifter. It also does relatively well against trap decks, having a built in heavy storm. Not only this, but it is also relatively budget, especially if you drop a few of the expensive cards for extenders or generic cards. This is of course, all theoretical, as i have not done any real testing on the deck.

Ways to special summon it:  -If you have <a data-name=""The Black Stone of Legend"">The Black Stone of Legend</a> you can use the effect to get a red-eyes-monster without losing a monster from the tribute.  -If you tribute <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> to prevent battle damage it triggers the effect, if you use Linkuriboh's second tribute-effect from the graveyard on dark monsters it also works.  -When you play <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> to summon <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>, it has also a tribute effect that triggers the effect. When you use <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>'s effect to destroy all cards on the field when it's summoned you destroy also <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a>, because you can only chain the summon effect after the trigger-effect of <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>. This means he will also get destroyed then, so you can still use it to get <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a> but then you can't use <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>'s effect.  -<a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a> can also tribute dark monsters to put a card from the opponent's hand to the deck.  -<a data-name=""Advance Draw"">Advance Draw</a> tributes a level-8-or-higher monster  <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a>:  it has multiple different effects.  -When you draw it you can shuffle it back into the deck, to draw a new card and bring <a data-name=""Fallen Of Albaz"">Fallen Of Albaz</a> to the Graveyard in the same time. This is good because then you can use <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> to fusion summon from the Graveyard or you can special summon <a data-name=""Fallen Of Albaz"">Fallen Of Albaz</a> to trigger the fusion-summon effect of it and use a 'level 8 or higher'-monster of the opponent as fusion-material.  -When you have <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> in the hand or it is in the Graveyard, you can special summon it, but you have to discard <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> or <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> from the hand.  -When <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> is in the Graveyard it can trigger the effect even when you do not have <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> or <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> in the hand, then you can shuffle it back into the deck and bring <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> or <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> to the graveyard. If you put <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> to the graveyard from the deck in this way you can set it to the field in the end phase. This works because it's name become <a data-name=""Fallen Of Albaz"">Fallen Of Albaz</a> when it's in the Graveyard or on the field, but not when it's in the hand, then you wouldn't get <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> in the end phase.  <a data-name=""Sage De Fleur"">Sage De Fleur</a>:  It has a special summon effect, that destroy's one of your monsters and one of the opponent cards, so you can shoot an important card with this effect, with <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi</a> and a normal monster or token you can choose it as a target and it won't get destroyed, because the monsters get destroyed after the special summon happened. When this card is sent from the field to the graveyard you get a level-1 plant monster from the deck to the hand, which is <a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a>. It has to be on the field before it is sent to the graveyard, so you can not fusion summon it from the hand or discard it to trigger the effect, but you can fusion summon or link summon it from the field. It puts a monster from the graveyard back to the deck as the second effect then, and when you do not have a monster in the graveyard, the effect does not trigger and you won't get <a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a>. With this second effect you can put fusion material for the red-eyes fusion back to the deck, so it can work even when one of the materials got destroyed first. You can for example also put <a data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew</a> back to the deck to maybe fusion summon again with it later. You can let <a data-name=""Sage De Fleur"">Sage De Fleur</a> get destroyed if you have no other monsters and then special summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a> when the opponent attacks directly to destroy another monster and to get <a data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew</a> for the next turn.  <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a>:  To fusion summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"">Red-Eyes Slash Dragon</a> with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> you must have <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> and a Warrior-monster (<a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a>) in the deck or in the hand, or it won't work. You can also summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> with <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a> or with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a> and use it as a normal monster. This is good with <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi</a>, or if you cannot fusion summon it with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> and you want to use <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> or <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a>.  <a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a>:  The Red-Eyes Fusion target, it can shoot spells/traps with the '<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a>'-combo. It can also special summon a Red-Eyes-Monster but then you can't use the shoot-effect.  <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a>:  When you use <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a> it's best to summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a> with the tribute-effect. Then you can wait for an attack or attack an opponent monster, if you attack and it gets destroyed by battle you get <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a> in the same battle-phase, so that you can attack again. With <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> you then have 2700atk and a normal monster, and with <a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a> you can unequip <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a> directly to shoot a spell/trap. If the opponent has a spell/trap this is the fastest way of shooting it without extra-costs, you get then a level-1-dragon to the hand, so it's also more effective then getting a 2700-monster. The best level-1 Dragon is <a data-name=""Rokket Synchron"">Rokket Synchron</a> because you can get a level-8 Synchro when you normal summon it with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> in the graveyard, as an alternative you can also get <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a>. To trigger this second effect of <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a> it has to get sent to the graveyard as an equipment (spell/trap), so if the monster gets destroyed you get nothing, because the equipment-target gets destroyed before the effect triggers. This is why you must unequip it with <a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a>'s effect,  you can also trigger this effect with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"">Red-Eyes Slash Dragon</a>'s effect which can destroy any equipment-cards for the negate-effect. Other alternatives are the shoot-effects of <a data-name=""Sage De Fleur"">Sage De Fleur</a> and <a data-name=""Paleozoic Olenoides"">Paleozoic Olenoides</a>, that you could also use to shoot your own cards, or with the effect of <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>. <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> destroys the monster and the equipment at the same time, so the effect gets triggered by it.  <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a>:  You can use it to summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a>, to have a better defense, or you can use it's tribute effect to trigger <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a>'s special summon effect. The second effect of it can bring <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a> back in the deck if you want to fusion summon it with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>. This effect can be used to get <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a> back to the hand. You can not use the tribute effect in the same turn you got it back to the hand, but you can use it for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>, or to get <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>.  <a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a>: It's a good special summon card. It can be used as a monster with a different type to link summon <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a>. It's second effect can bring <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a> or any other monster-card to the graveyard, but only when you play the second <a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a> in one duel to banish the first from the graveyard, you can not use the effect twice in one turn.  <a data-name=""Phantom Skyblaster"">Phantom Skyblaster</a>: Good Token-card that works good with special-summons. The tokens are good with <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi</a>, and you can also link-summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, without other cards when you use <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>.  <a data-name=""Fallen Of Albaz"">Fallen Of Albaz</a>: When it get normal summoned or special summoned you can discard one card and fusion summon a level 8 or higher monster of the opponent to <a data-name=""Brigrand The Glory Dragon"">Brigrand The Glory Dragon</a>. You could also use an opponent's fusion-monster to summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a>, or 2 opponent dark monsters, when you have Lair of Darkness, to fusion summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a>. You can put it with <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> from the deck to the graveyard, to special summon it later, if you draw <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> first. <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> is a Fusion-card that only works with at least one dragon as material, and that can be only used with cards in the graveyard when <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> (or <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a>) is one of the materials. Another secondary effect is that you can Discard <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> with <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a>'s Trigger-effect if you have both in the hand, and then set it in the End-phase, this is powerful, because then you can fusion summon with <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> from the Graveyard in the next turn. If you summon <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> with <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a> or <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a> it also triggers the fusion-effect.  <a data-name=""Roxrose Dragon"">Roxrose Dragon</a>: When you normal summon it you get <a data-name=""Blooming of the Darkest Rose"">Blooming of the Darkest Rose</a> as the only 'Rose'-card in the deck. When it is in the Graveyard and <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> gets destroyed by an opponent's card effect or by battle, you get it back to the hand. You can use it as a level-3 tuner with a level-4 monster and a level-1 monster to summon a level 8-synchro-monster. You can also summon <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> with only one other level-4 monster, but then you can not revive <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> with <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a>'s effect, after you used the destroy-effect.  <a data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew</a>: If you have a level-8-monster in the hand you can summon <a data-name=""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon"">Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon</a> with its fusion-effect, and then you also have a level-8 monster in the graveyard that you can banish when <a data-name=""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon"">Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon</a> gets destroyed to summon it again. You can also use it to fusion summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> or <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a>, and if you already have <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> you can put predator tokens on the opponent monsters and then also use them as fusion material.  <a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a>: When it battles the opponent monster gets destroyed, so is good to set it as a defense, but you can also attack monsters to destroy them with the effect. When you have it in the hand you can special summon it when an opponent monster attacks directly, and you can get it to the hand with <a data-name=""Sage De Fleur"">Sage De Fleur</a>'s effect. When it gets destroyed by battle or when it gets detroyed by your or your opponent's card effect you get <a data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew</a> from the deck which you can use to fusion summon a Predaplant-monster.  <a data-name=""Rokket Synchron"">Rokket Synchron</a>: It's a level-1 Tuner to summon <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of The Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of The Tenyi</a> with only one level-7 card. When you have it in the hand or maybe get it with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a>'s effect, you can normal summon it to summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> from the Graveyard and use it as Synchro-material.  Spells:  <a data-name=""Allure Of Darkness"">Allure Of Darkness</a>, <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Advance Draw"">Advance Draw</a>, <a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>:  Draw cards, <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi</a> is as a Field Spell also used to get more Tokens with <a data-name=""Blooming Of The Darkest Rose"">Blooming Of The Darkest Rose</a>, it can be used when you set monsters, when you summon tokens with <a data-name=""Phantom Skyblaster"">Phantom Skyblaster</a>, <a data-name=""Blooming Of The Darkest Rose"">Blooming Of The Darkest Rose</a>, <a data-name=""Paleozoic Olenoides"">Paleozoic Olenoides</a>, <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a> and maybe <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a>. It also works with normal monsters and gives them a 'monster-effect'-immunity, you can use <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Berserker Of The Tenyi"">Berserker Of The Tenyi</a> then. <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi</a> can be used to secure normal monsters and tokens from the destroy-effect of <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>, but it will also get destroyed after the monsters got protected by its effect. <a data-name=""Advance Draw"">Advance Draw</a> is a better alternative to <a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a> because you can summon level-8-or-higher-monsters very fast in the midgame, if you use the tribute effect it will also summon <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a>, so you could tribute a fusion monster and still have a monster with 3000 atk then, it can tribute an opponent monster if you have <a data-name=""Lair Of Darkness"">Lair Of Darkness</a>. Chaos space brings Chaos Valkyria to the hand, you also have to discard a dark monster, this way you can instantly special summon Chaos Valkyria by banishing a monster in the graveyard. For the draw effect you can banish <a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a> or any extra-deck monster (they cannot be normal summoned) with the second <a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a>. You could also banish <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> with it's own effect or a fusion/synchro monster with <a data-name=""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon"">Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon</a>'s effect, it also works for <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> as the 'Instant Fusion'-target  <a data-name=""Lair Of Darkness"">Lair Of Darkness</a>: If you have Tribute Effects that tribute monsters you can also tribute the opponents monsters. You can use this effect with <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a> on any monster, with <a data-name=""Advance Draw"">Advance Draw</a> and with <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> on level-1 monsters if it is in the graveyard. You could make a monster level-1 if you have <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> with the Predator counters. You also get tokens with it together with the other tribute-effects that are self-tributes and with normal tribute-summons. The Second effect makes all monsters dark so you can fusion-summon the opponent's monsters with <a data-name=""Super Polymerizatio"">Super Polymerizatio</a>n or with <a data-name=""Fallen Of Albaz"">Fallen Of Albaz</a>.  <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">, </a><a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">, </a><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>: Reborn-Effects, Special summon-effects, with <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a> summoned in the opponent's end phase, it's possible to summon <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> to clear the whole field with <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> and then normal summon after the destroy-effect, you can also use the tokens for defense or only for <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>.  <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>, <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a>: Fusion cards, you can 'copy' <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> and <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> with <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>. It's always best to first use <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>, to make the draw phase better and to not draw the fusion-material-cards later. You can get <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> with <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> if you discarded <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> first with another effect so that it is in the graveyard. <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> can fusion summon with material from the graveyard if you have <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> or <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> in the hand, on the field or also in the graveyard.  &nbsp;  Traps:  <a data-name=""Call Of The Haunted"">Call Of The Haunted</a>, <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a>:  Special Summon-Cards from the graveyard and the banished cards from <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> or <a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a>.  <a data-name=""Paleozoic Olenoides"">Paleozoic Olenoides</a>, <a data-name=""Blooming Of The Darkest Rose"">Blooming Of The Darkest Rose</a>:  good token-cards for <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Blooming Of The Darkest Rose"">Blooming Of The Darkest Rose</a> can be used more than one time because you can shuffle it back into the deck. With <a data-name=""Blooming Of The Darkest Rose"">Blooming Of The Darkest Rose</a> in the graveyard you have also a good protection for <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a> and <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>, if they would get destroyed by a card-effect, you can chain this card to it and banish them first until the next turn. You can also protect them from battle damage, especially <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> with 500 atk, if you use it before the battle.  <a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a>: good defensive card that works good against other extra-deck monsters, it has a good earlygame-strength. This deck is best with <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a>or <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a> in the graveyard, then it becomes fast in the midgame. The deck is also a bit counterplay-heavy, so it can be good to wait a turn with some plays.  &nbsp;  Extra Deck:  Link:  <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>, <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>: used to use the tokens, <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> has also two tribute-effects that trigger <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a>'s special summon effect, and that work good with <a data-name=""Lair Of Darkness"">Lair Of Darkness</a>. You can also link-summon <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> when you have <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a>. When you tribute it to prevent battle-damage, you can get <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a> back to the hand and link-summon <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> again.  <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>: It's best to alyways summon it first to get <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"">Red-Eyes Slash Dragon</a> and to have <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a> in the graveyard and not in the deck for a better draw phase.  <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a>: You can summon <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> and destroy all cards on the field then with its effect. You can use it as a quick effect in your or in the opponent's turn. You need two monsters with differens types to summon it, and then you also need a plant monster that you can tribute for the effect. As plant monsters you can use <a data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> or tokens from <a data-name=""Blooming Of The Darkest Rose"">Blooming Of The Darkest Rose</a>. You can also use the Fusion-predaplant-monsters because all cards get destroyed anyway. If you have 4 monsters a good play would be to summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, and then use the effect to summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a> by using it and one of the opponent monsters as material. Then you can't special summon, but you can activate the Crossrose-effect in the opponent turn and use the <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a> as the tribute, this way you get <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> to the hand in the next turn because of the secondary effect of <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>.  <a data-name=""Berserker Of The Tenyi"">Berserker Of The Tenyi</a>: It's a normal monster if you have <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi</a>.  Synchro:  <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>: It's effect can destroy all cards on the field, which is good to outplay a lot of combo's that need 2 or 3 cards to work. When you summoned it with <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> you also get it back after all cards got destroyed but it only has 2400 atk. You don't have to use the destroy effect but then you can not use it later, if you have it on the field with or without the destroy-effect you can also turn monsters from defense position to attack position and change the atk to 0, by banishing a plant-monsters from the graveyard. <a data-name=""Ruddy Rose Dragon"">Ruddy Rose Dragon</a> as a level-10-synchro-monster is also not a good card in a graveyard deck because it only destroys all cards when you banish the graveyard-monsters.  <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a>: The level-7-alternative to <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> if you have <a data-name=""Roxrose Dragon"">Roxrose Dragon</a> and a level-4-monster. <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a> can put extra-deck monsters back into the extra-deck by attacking them, so they won't get targeted, with a link monster you can also build a 'wall' with it.  <a data-name=""Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi"">Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi</a>: It's a strong Level-8 Snychro-monster that you can summon very fast when you play <a data-name=""Rokket Synchron"">Rokket Synchron</a> to get <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> from the Graveyard. 'Level 8'-monsters are goot for <a data-name=""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon"">Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon</a>, then he can come back one time for every level 8 monster in the Graveyard, you can also use it as fusion-material. This card is an alternative to <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> is slower in the early-game and in the deck are only a few link-monsters, it is a dragon and also stronger as a 'midgame-card', but this deck needs fast combo's for the early-game because most combo's need 1 or 2 turns to function. You can also revive <a data-name=""Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi"">Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi</a> and it still works, but you can not revive <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> and use its effect. <a data-name=""Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi"">Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi</a>'s negate works only for monster-effects but it has a banish effect and a double-attack-effect.  Fusion:  <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>: 'Instant Fusion'-target  <a data-name=""Brigrand The Glory Dragon"">Brigrand The Glory Dragon</a>: It is a '<a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a>'-Fusion to use the fusion-effect of <a data-name=""Fallen Of Albaz"">Fallen Of Albaz</a> with an opponent monster. It has to be level 8 or higher as an alternative to <a data-name=""Sprind The Irondash Dragon"">Sprind The Irondash Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Titaniklad The Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad The Ash Dragon</a>. It also has the best effects together with the other monster, because it has 'battle-damage'-immunity and can protect other monsters from the opponent targeting monster-effects.  <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"">Red-Eyes Slash Dragon</a>: It is a bit like <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> but a bit weaker. You have to summon it as the first 'boss-monster' if possible in every duel, to have a better draw phase. This makes the duels similar to each other, and it's often about the flow how you archieve the set goals of the deck. It can negate one card or monster effect per turn, but only if you already attacked the opponent. When you attack you get the equipment that you can destroy to trigger the effect, the only way to get a second negate in one turn is to destroy <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a> while it is equipped to <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> because in the deck are no other Equip-spells and also no other warriors, and it would also take too long to use them, <a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a> could have an equip but it is already used as the 'equipment'-warrior. You still can attack with two Red-Eyes-monsters, this way, if you negate one time during the battle, you then maybe get the negate-effect back when you attack with the second Red-Eyes-monster. It is not good to play <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"">Red-Eyes Slash Dragon</a> in the first turn, because you only have 2800 atk then instead of 3000 and also no negate, so you have to wait until you can attack after you summoned it or you revive it to attack then. Then it can be strong, because it can negate every turn after it attacked without further activation costs but attacking.  <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>: it's a good starting-monster in the early-game, because you have 3500atk in a battle and the opponent loses 1000 atk, so the opponent has to destroy it with card-effects. You also get <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> or maybe <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> to the hand in the next turn after it got destroyed.  <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a>: it can negate monster effects by putting predator-counters on them as a quick-effect that works once per turn.  <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a>: It can be often summoned with <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> and <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a> with up to 3 of the opponent's monsters. It has a special-summon negate as effect, and if you fusion summon it then with one dark monster to <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> you can put one predator counter on a monster and directly special summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a> again from the graveyard.  <a data-name=""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon"">Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon</a>: It is the strongest Predaplant-monster as a 'midgame'-monster. Every time it gets destroyed all monsters on the field gets destroyed, then you can get it back by banishing on of the level-8 monsters from the graveyard.

This is a suuuuuper fun deck i've been working on, the Harpies and Dragunity have massive synergy with each other, and Harpies are such a nostalgic archetype for me and so many other players, and they're actually pretty damn good, don't get me wrong, they're not a meta deck, but god damn they're a lot of fun (and also pretty cheap).  So, why Dragunity and Harpie? Wellllll, first off, I love Dragunity, but we all know what they're lacking. M̶a̶s̶s̶i̶v̶e̶ ̶m̶o̶m̶m̶y̶ ̶m̶i̶l̶k̶e̶r̶s̶  Combo Starters. with this deck, Perfumer and Channeler (provided you have a discard) will give you full combo, plus more than often a few extenders. As well as this, <strong>HAVE YOU READ ANY HARPIE SPELL/TRAPS????????????</strong> Harpie's feather storm is literally a quick play dark ruler no more, and Hysteric Sign searches a free extender and is a block dragon in the end phase.  I'm not kidding.  So the general idea of this deck is to use elegant egotist and world chalice guardragon to spam out them vanilla harpie ladies, and make big link monsters, and then use your Dragunity monsters to put up synchro negates or big chunguses.  This deck was very much made with budget in mind, and accordingly, the most expensive card in the deck is harpie perfumer, that's right, you'll find no Noodles or Savage Dragons or Zeus or Dragoons in this deck.  Let me explain some of my card choices real quick, first of all, why Crystal Wing over Borreload Savage Dragon or any other synchro? Cos I think it's funny. Why Avramax over Borrelsword or Accesscode? Cos I think it's <strong>REALLY</strong> funny. Why Harpie Conductor over any other generic link 2? Well, the reason rhymes with ""Leather Pants"". wait.  In all honesty, this deck was made with fun in mind more than competitive viability, because I feel these days we're so focused on how GOOD a deck is, we forget the simple things, like putting big chunguses on the board and slapping your opponent. We forget how hilarious it is to use waifu cards (we all know that's part of the reason you're playing Harpies ;) (Don't worry I won't tell anyone)) to combo up into huge boys with big numbers and slap the shit out of your opponent. That said, there are a few cards in here that make the deck more viable if you did want to go play this at your locals. For example. Dragunity Arma Gram is your out to Winda, and Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds is just funny lol.  Now, how about tech cards? We got Tempest, Dragon ruler of motherfuckin' storms babyyyyy, this boy provides a healthy dose of nostalgia whilst also being a searcher and combo extender! We also got Queen Dragun Djinn, which is a blast from the past, but this Dragun ain't nothing like the one you're probably used to. She's a solid extender in this deck, and comes up a lot more often than you'd think! You can use her to quickly get out a synchro in your grave and make a crystal wing, or get another dragon to make Heavenly Spheres. Harpie Dancer has a really funny interaction with Harpie Perfumer. Notice how perfumer isn't once per turn? Yep, you can add as many elegant egotists as you want by bouncing back your harpie perfumer.  Speaking of funny interactions, you can discard Hysteric Sign off Dragon Ravine and just add 3 cards from your deck to your hand in the end phase. Funny, right?  In short, this deck has everything from semi-viability to cool dragons to Mai Valentine's massive b̶o̶o̶b̶s̶  personality and character.  Give it a shot! :)"

Today, butter in its many flavorful forms is the world's most popular fat. As a versatile spread, a delicious enhancer for so many foods, and the essential ingredient for baking, butter's simple goodness has no equal...  The first reference to butter in our written history was found on a 4,500-year-old limestone tablet illustrating how butter was made. It is generally believed the word butter originates from the <em>boutyron</em>, Greek for “cow cheese”, however it may have come from the language of cattle-herding Scythians.  &nbsp;  <strong>Butter</strong> is a <a>dairy product</a> containing up to 80% <a>butterfat</a> which is solid when chilled and at <a>room temperature</a>. It is made by <a>churning</a> fresh or <a>fermented</a> <a>cream</a> or <a>milk</a> to separate the butterfat from the <a>buttermilk</a>. Butter consists of <a>butterfat</a>, milk <a>proteins</a> and water.  &nbsp;  <strong>Unsalted Butter</strong>  This is your best bet for cooking and baking. For many recipes, it is recommended that you bring the butter to room temperature first so that it better incorporates with other ingredients. The exception is pie crust, for which cold butter is a must. If you wish, you can season unsalted butter yourself to meet your personal taste preferences when using it as a topping or spread.  &nbsp;  <strong>Clarified Butter</strong>  When butter is melted and made clear by separating and discarding the milk solids and water, it makes the perfect dipping sauce for shellfish and other seafood. But because it will not burn at high temperatures, it is also a good choice for frying and sautéing.  &nbsp;  <strong>Cultured Butter</strong>  Made from cultured cream, cultured butter has a rich, complex flavor. It is ideal for baking because the lower moisture content produces flakier pastries and fluffier cakes.  &nbsp;  <strong>European-Style Butter</strong>  This old-fashioned variation is made from cream that is churned more slowly and for a longer time.

This Magnet Warrior Deck operates a lot like most present day Cyberse Decks, the only difference being that it is made up of Rock-types (because Rock-types need love too).  The Deck offers mediocre swarming potential which allows it to easily crank out the Level 8 ""Magna Warrior"" monsters from the Main Deck and a lot of the offensive threats present in the Extra Deck.  The Deck also has a lock down mode, where you'll want to have the following cards on the field (note that although this field IS achievable, it requires a couple turns of set-up): <ul>  	<li>Monsters: Knightmare Griphon (who must be linked to as many of your monsters as possible), Adamancipator Risen - Dragite, Gorgonic Guardian, and Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior.</li>  	<li>Spells/Traps: Magnetic Field, and Triamid Pulse.</li> </ul> Knightmare Gryphon in the Main Monster Zone shuts down your opponent's Special Summoned monsters if they aren't linked, while protecting your own monsters, assuming it is linked to all of them. Adamancipator Risen - Dragite provides Spell/Trap negation as well as non-targeting and non-destroying removal of your opponent's cards. Gorgonic Guardian shuts down your opponent's monster effects and can eliminate defensive tokens (if you're into that). Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior adds extra coverage and is the only monster that can take advantage of Magnetic Field's secondary effects. Traimid Pulse let's you revive Adamancipator Risen - Dragite and Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior upon destruction (which works well with Magnetic Field), has the ability to recover Magnetic Field, and has the ability to destroy an opponent's card during their turn. Your opponent cannot do much in this situation with all of the limits brought forth, what more when the other capable monsters are brought forth?"

This deck is more of a nostalgia deck for people who are looking to get back into the game casually and want to play newer versions of old cards. This deck goes first to end on ""At Best"" an <strong>Arcana Knight Joker</strong>, an <strong>Arcana Extra Joker</strong>, and 1<strong> Thunderspeed Summon</strong> which will summon <strong>Sphere Mode</strong>. This is only if you draw literally the god hand going first as your end board is usually only 1 of those 3.</span>  <span>First the poker knights: 1 <strong>Jack's Knight</strong>, 3 <strong>Queen's Knight</strong>, and 3 <strong>King's Knight</strong>. 3 <strong>Arcana Triumph Joker</strong> which is a horrible card going first while decent going second since she could've been a quick effect and nobody would've cared. She is a nice discard since you can summon her from grave using her own effect later on in the duel. 3 <strong>Joker's Knight</strong> who foolishes a poker knight to summon himself as a body with the same name. He can be used for <strong>Arcana Knight</strong> and <strong>Extra Joker</strong>. 3 <strong>Imperial Bower</strong> which is literally <strong>Rescue Rabbit</strong>. 3 <strong>Sphere Mode</strong> is the god I chose to maindeck since <strong>Thunderspeed</strong> doesn't have the <strong>Soul Exchange Effect</strong> that<strong> Soul Crossing</strong> has and it can search <strong>Sphere Mode</strong> on top of that since you can either choose to have 3 poker knights on field or use them for <strong>Arcana Knight</strong>/<strong>Extra Joker</strong>. 1 <strong>Fire Flint Lady</strong> for either an extender or fusion material for <strong>Gilti-Gearfried</strong>.</span>  <span>1 <strong>ROTA</strong>. 3 <strong>Fusion Deployment</strong> which is <strong>E Tele</strong> for any poker knight. 3 <strong>Unexpected Dai</strong> which unfortunately clashes with Imperial Bower, but you have no way of searching Bower so it's rarely a problem. Only 1<strong> Face Card Fusion</strong> since your only fusions can only negate things that ""TARGET"" themselves. 3 <strong>Joker's Straight</strong> which is literally begging to be negated since it essentially gives you 3 bodies in the 3 poker knights. 3 <strong>Extrav</strong>. 3 <strong>Thunderspeed Summon</strong>. 3 <strong>Joker's Wild</strong> which copies one of your poker knight spells. Something to consider about the spell/trap lineup is that you can choose to run things like<strong> Pot of Avarice</strong>. All of the new support takes almost all copies of your poker knights out of the deck turn 1 so you have no follow-up if you draw something like <strong>Joker's Straight</strong> or <strong>Joker's Wild</strong>. You need some way to put your materials back into the deck to actually use your cards in later turns.</span>  <span>Extra Deck is an <strong>Extrav</strong> build. 3 <strong>Arcana Knight Joker</strong>, 3 <strong>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</strong>, 3 <strong>Arcana Extra Joker</strong>, and 3<strong> Link Spider</strong>. 3 <strong>Gilti-Gearfried the Magical Steel Knight</strong>. It is simply <strong>Arcana Knight Joker</strong> combined with <strong>Bad Aim</strong> that can also attack twice and has relatively generic fusion materials.</span>  <span>Side Deck is just cards you can consider running. <strong>Obelisk</strong> cannot be targeted and with how easy it is to get monsters on the field in this deck, you can also tribute 2 monsters to<strong> Raigeki</strong> your opponent. <strong>Slifer</strong> is literally a floodgate that gets rid of normal summons and starting plays. <strong>Soul Crossing</strong> is insane if you open it and a god. Going second, consider breaking boards with <strong>Dark Ruler</strong> and spell/trap removal like <strong>Twin Twisters</strong> or something of that sort.</span>"

This is the base strategy.  &nbsp;  Play Numeron Network and either use its effect to activate or activate Numeron Calling from your hand. Summon all 4 Numeron XYZ monsters for the extra deck. Then you can activate Memories of Hope to draw 4 cards for free. Then you use the 4 Numeron XYZ monsters to summon Saryuja Skull Dread. Then activate its effect to draw 4 cards and the shuffle 3 back into the deck. Then you can activate Link Bound and draw 4 cards to shuffle 4 back into the deck. Don't worry if you don't have Exodia. There are many more ways than this to draw from your deck.

Get tribute fodder, summon Slifer, opponent cant summon anything with 0 or ","Purpose of the deck, get tribute fodder on the field and summon Slifer. Its a fun deck that isn't perfect (can brick a little sometimes). A lot of people on here could make it better and stronger by throwing in more meta cards like hand traps and such but this deck is designed for fun using God support cards, God themed typed cards or cards similar to the cards used in the anime by characters who summon the God cards (Reactor Slime/Egyptian God Slime for example).  &nbsp;  The point of the deck is get tribute fodder (mostly tokens) on the board and get Slifer in your hand using spell cards or through the draw power and then lock your opponent out of summoning &lt;2k monsters as your hand builds up and Slifer becomes a massive beat stick.  Below is a quicks breakdown of the deck and why they are used:  <strong>1 x Obelisk:</strong> is thrown in because its only God that has built in protection and increase odds of you getting a God in your hand since just 3 Slifer isn't enough. Other monster's are pretty self explanatory.  <strong>3 x Reactor Slime:</strong> for its token effect and ability's to bring Metal Reflect Slimed on the field, which is then used for Egyptian God Slime.  <strong>3 x Ra's Disciple:</strong> gets another 2 and if you got a god and Advance Draw (combo this with The True Name), you'll get a God out on your turn or use Soul Crossing during your opponents turn, tribute their monster's and you then keep a few ready for another god to come out later.  <strong>3 x Scapeghost:</strong> is slow being a flip effect, but if it Flips, BOOM! 4 monsters....cant say no to that.  <strong>1 x Vanitys Ruler:</strong> because why not (can easily be taken out if don't like as the deck is at 41) Another tribute summon option with a good effect. Doesn't need to be here but fun if he is  For the spell cards I've quickly explained above the combo of Card Advance and The True Name and the usage of Soul Crossing.  <strong>2 x Thunderforce Attack:</strong> Doesnt need to be at 3, easily a brick card early game but good enough to utilize for its destructive power on opponents turn, or its destructive and draw power if used on your turn. plus its a Slifer card so why not.  <strong>2 x Mound of Bound Creator + 1 x Terraforming:</strong> Extra protection for Slifer, plus using a Terraforming to get one to hand thins the deck (Can easily be taken and replaced if wish for hand traps or other cards you might prefer)  <strong>3 x Supply Squad:</strong> If you don't get a God, and your tokens are just a line of defense, this works quite nicely just to help get to Slifer or other cards. Especially fun when have 2 or all 3 copies out (if they don't get destroyed ofc)  <strong>1 x Scapegoat:</strong> Play during opponents turn, use them for link bait (hence the Link-1s and 2s in Extra Deck)  <strong>1 x Upstart Goblin:</strong> Thin deck  The Monster Reborn, HFD and MST are there for the back row destruction and free special summon. These can easily be changed if you want for stronger/better/preferred cards, I use them cos I like them and when I paly casually with friends, back row is used quite a lot (plus HFD was in the Structure Deck, i enjoy the nostalgia)  For Traps:  <strong>3 x Reckless Greed:</strong> used for more hand size and getting a Slifer in hand. Best played in conjunction with another copy of its self making it worth the loss of a draw phase for 2 turns. Combos nicely with Supply Squad as that allows you to draw as your tokens are maybe getting destroyed whilst you Reckless is stopping you drawing so you don't real feel the draw back as much.  <strong>2 x Metal Reflect Slime:</strong> in here for Reactor Slime effect and to get Egyptian God Slime out. Doesn't need to be at 3 cos Reactor Slime can get it from Graveyard and tbh could easily be a 1, but its a card I've always loved and I have 2 Ultimate rare copies so thought might as well use both. Can be reduced to 1 and throw in cards you'd like to use but its still a nice 3k DEF monster if used from hand.  The Extra deck revolves around  <strong>2 x Egyptian God Slime:</strong> 3k beat stick, offer protection to other things and can be sued as 3 tributes for Gods. He is the sub-boss monster of the deck. Bring out using the Reactor and metal Reflect Slime combo mentioned previously  <strong>Links:</strong> The link-1s and 2s are in here to be used in conjunction with Scapegoat and if they allow, for use with other tokens and monster's so your deck can possibly do something if all 3 Slifer's are hiding at the bottom of your deck. If you wanna use this build my links are probably not the best choice so they can all be changed for better cards or better choices, I'm just using the cards I have. Just ensure whatever link monster's you pick, tokens can be used to summon them and that you have enough Link1s/2s so you can have at least 3 link monster's on field to make full use of Scapegoat's effect.  &nbsp;  Hope everyone has fun trying out my build, suggestions welcome. To be honest you could alter this build and make it Obelisk, just replace the Slifer specific cards with Obelisk and his specific cards. If your looking for a cheap build the money card in this is Egyptian God Slime its cocsltys roughly £20+ last I checked in UK (Not inc Black Luster but he's actually a proxy in my physical deck) so you can take him out and leave Reactor Slime and Metal Reflect in as their effects are still good and Metal Reflect has 3k DEF so not easy to power past."

The scales help you summon monsters up to Odd Eyes Pendulum Dragon and you can switch them by special summoning Pendulum Sorcerer. Most of the Times i use Pend Sorcerer to bring one scale 1 or 8 and Skullcrobat Joker and by normal summoning Joker i can get another scale 1 or 8 depending on what i previously searched.  They main plays come from Luster Pendulum and Harmonizing Magician allowing you to use Ignister, Majester and Dinoster to protect your pendulums, have 1 search on summon and 1 search at the end of your turn of whatever pendulum you like"

I really enjoy this as a rogue option and you fill the side with any going second options you see fit. This deck does not have a lot of interruption and your dark attribute boat is what can really hurt your opponent. End your first turn on a couple of monsters and the link with at least a handtrap or two to stop your opponent. This deck also has a going second option that may be better for this format.

The original idea was to go for an affordable Sky Striker deck that would hold it's own against meta decks, but eventually I started to get my hands on staples and other higher value cards through lucky pulls and trades. The main strategy here is going second with the goal being to disrupt your opponent during their turn, break their boards and get your resource cycle going. Link Hayate, poke for damage and send Engage, grab engage with Kagari and search for whatever Sky Striker tool you need, link to Shizuku and grab Multirole to start recycling resources as you need them."

Para eso hay muchísimas cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo. Si tenemos suerte, sólo hará falta 1 carta!  <strong>Extenders para invocar a Isolde</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Neo Space Connector: </strong>Con esto no hará falta nada más, adicionalmente, al traer a Dolphin, podremos encargarnos de una handtrap.</li>  	<li><strong>Marauding Captain: </strong>Sirve junto con otro guerrero en mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk Forward: </strong>Se invoca gratis si no controlamos monstruos.</li>  	<li><strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin:</strong> Es una Normal Summon bastante decente (ver Connector)</li>  	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady: </strong>Se invoca gratis si controlamos otro guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Blue Mountain Butterspy: </strong>Se invoca gratis cuando invocamos otro guerrero. Ojo con el timing.</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha knight:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial cuando invocas otro monstruo de nivel 3 de modo normal. Ojo que puede perder timing.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales: </strong>Manda al Cementerio a Cloak, que añade a la mano a Boots, quien se invoca gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine: </strong>Es un cuerpo gratis. Ojo que no cuenta para el Phoenix Blade, así que tendremos que descartar el guerrero que nos da Isolde para seguir con el combo.</li>  	<li><b>Reinforcement of the army: </b>Trae a cualquier guerrero.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente. Incluso si roba un garnet, es posible devolverlo con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>  	<li>El deck no depende del burn, por lo que no es afectado por incrementos de LP del oponente.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene muy pocos garnets (6).</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene acceso a protección como Sauravis y Dragged Down into the Grave.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck requiere de varios pasos específicos para lograrse, si alguno no se realiza correctamente, uno puede bloquearse.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, si se roba 2 Garnets, será gg.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>A pesar de tener burn infinito, sigue perdiendo ante Ghost Sister.</li> </ul>"

The main strategy of the deck is to activate Cynet Codec and basically abuse the card to search all of the cards you need to combo with. You will mostly want to search the cards that can special summon for the hand fairly easily. For Earth, search Gatchiri, Wing search Link-infra Flier, ect. You can find combo guides and other deck profiles on Youtube but I wanted to share my own build here. I play 0 handtraps bc it is easier to get the pieces of the combo you need just by drawing into them. Also you want to play the deck going 1st and generally try to make a U-Board with Iblee on the opponents field and Salamangreat Sanctuary active which would lock them into only link monsters but the zones are taken so they basically can't do anything. The only way to get Iblee off of the field is for your opponent to either tribute it or use Dark Hole, or negate its effects or something of the sort."

Call Redoer and company! They'll do stuff! (In depth profile),"<h2>Stolen Utopia: Breakdown</h2> Howdy! Welcome and thank you for checking out my deck profile! If you bother to read this essay on a children's card game, you will obtain a better understanding of why I made specific card choices, other options for the deck, and some of the optimal end boards. <h3>The Ideal Utopia(?):</h3> As the majority of the play base is aware of, ""Utopia"" and it's related cards/archetypes have been receiving copious amounts of support within the last two years, whether it be from Lightning Overdrive, Legendary Duelists: Magical Hero, the new Overlay Network: Structure Deck, or King's Court. No matter where you are getting your support from, as long as it's current, it's bound to be playable. <h5>Legendary Duelist: Magical Hero:</h5> First off, I'm not main decking any of the support from this set, but I still figured it'd be worth mentioning how it did give the deck some much needed field presence and searching for said field presence. As I have found, ""Time Thief"" has better interactions with the Lightning Overdrive support versus Magical Hero's ""<a data-name=""Zubababancho Gagagacoat"">Zubababancho Gagagacoat</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Dododowarf Gogogoglove"">Dododowarf Gogogoglove</a>"", but I'll elaborate later. <h5>Lightning Overdrive:</h5> This set introduced two new Level 4 ""ZS -"" monsters and ""ZW -"" monsters, along with a ""Utopia"" themed R.U.M. and other ""Zexal"" Spell/Trap support. ""<a data-name=""ZS - Ascended Sage"">ZS - Ascended Sage</a>"" has the inherent Summoning ability that's active while you control no cards. A free body? Yes, exactly, but it gets better with ""<a data-name=""ZS - Armed Sage"">ZS - Armed Sage.</a>"" It too has the ability to inherently Special Summon itself, but only if the only monster you control is a Level 4 monster that's not a copy of itself. These two are great cards, they allow you to get to Rank 4 easily and when used as material for the Xyz Summon of a ""Utopia"" monster, they search for a R.U.M. (Ascended Sage) and a ZW - monster (Armed Sage). As an honorable mention, ""<a data-name=""Ultimate Dragonic Utopia Ray"">Ultimate Dragonic Utopia Ray</a>"" the new retrain of ""<a data-name=""Number C39: Utopia Ray"">Number C39: Utopia Ray,</a>"" is the only TCG legal ""Utopia Ray"" that sees play, but as soon as ""<a data-name=""Leo Utopia Ray"">Leo Utopia Ray</a>"" is available, it'll be the less preferred card. ""<a data-name=""ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber"">ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber</a>"" is a Level 5 monster with the ability to Special Summon itself if your LP is 2000 or lower than your opponents. Rarely is it going to be used for Xyz Material, more often you'll be equipping it to a ""Utopia"" monster by a card effect. It has a similar effect to ""<a data-name=""ZW - Eagle Claw"">ZW - Eagle Claw</a>,"" but it negates monster effects on the field instead of Traps. ""<a data-name=""ZW - Dragonic Halberd"">ZW - Dragonic Halberd</a>"" is the second ""ZW -"" introduced. Not much else to say other than it can search ""Zexal"" Spell/Trap cards.  The three playable ""Zexal"" backrow released are ""<a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</a>,"" ""<a data-name=""Zexal Construction"">Zexal Construction</a>,"" and ""<a data-name=""Zexal Entrust"">Zexal Entrust</a>."" ""Construction"" allows you to search ""ZW -,"" ""ZS -,"" other ""Zexal"" Spell/Traps, or ""R.U.M.""/""R.D.M.,"" which is why there is only one ""Entrust."" Speaking of it, ""Entrust"" allows you to revive or recover a ""Utopia,"" ""ZW -,"" or ""ZS -"" monster and during the next turn, if your LP is 2000 or lower than your opponents, you can add one ""Zexal"" Spell/Trap in your GY to your hand. Finally, ""R.U.M. Zexal Force."" It works like most ""R.U.M."" Spells, but it requires the player to summon a ""Utopia"" or ""ZW -"" monster, then you place one ""ZW -"" or ""ZS -"" monster from your Deck on the top of the Deck. (Not optional if the Xyz Summon goes through.) Lastly, it's GY effect. It too revolves around 2000 LP difference, and it lets you draw a card by banishing it. <h5>Structure Deck: Overlay Universe</h5> Hoooooooo boy! I thought the LAST section was a lot, but here we go, even mooooooore!"

I seek feedback for this concept with the following questions <ul>  	<li>What Trap Holes should be ran besides Gravedigger's. I'm waiting until the inevitable mega-tin reprint to get those. But I also want to know what other holes are ran alongside that card</li>  	<li>Are there any cards that recover Banished Traps? They might be useful for later.</li>  	<li>What other ED monster could be ran in this build besides the obvious (Knightmares, Link-4s, Utopia)? this is mainly to replace the Tornado Dragons.</li>  	<li>I'm also considering running Utopic Dragner and Chateau Hyuck, but I'm weighing if that would take up too much space (since the later needs material to be of any use)</li> </ul>"

The main strategy is to get lair of darkness onto the field and oppress your opponent's side of the field through tributing there monsters. knightmares help with backrow and special summoned monsters negations(gryphon and phoenix).  diabolos are there for both; lair of darkness synergy and dark world dealings to essentially get a free draw.  Blazing mirror force for millennium seeker special summon and burn damage.  Card advance+ draw of fate for setup.  Everything else is up to you(side deck is also your choice)

Flundereezenuts,"This deck in my opinion is extremely fun and really reminds me of the play-style of PK Fire. But first things first, this deck ""kinda"" solves the problem with flundereeze instantly having to pass after being ashed or imperm, as the simorgh field spell gives you a second normal in some situation and the baby simorgh birbs can sometimes bait a negate, but as it stands, it's still an extremely hard deck to pick up and learn, as your combos really depend on you going first and not drawing a hand full of monsters that require a 1 to 2 tributes to summon, but if you are willing to learn this deck, you will find that a lot of the recent meta decks can't play through Empen, Surprised Raiza and for some really odd reasons, Dark Simorgh.  <hr />  DUMB SYNERGY FILLER :  First, THE SIMORGH FIELD SPELL IS OP AF, HOLY HELL DOES IT HELPS FLUNDEREEZE.  Second, The simorgh birbs triggers the flundereeze's banish effect. (simple enough)  Third, Darkness Simorgh gives flundereeze the option for a negate, but remember you can't special summon the turn you used any of the flundereeze effect. So the main strat with it is to special summon it during your opponent's turn with the effect of the Flundereeze field spell tribute summoning something like Raiza or Empen or you can normal summon it on your turn. Whatever situations suits you.  <hr />  That's all I got to say, but is this deck is hella fun. Really reminds me of PK Fire and really does live up to it's legacy."

You'll normal summon onomat, activate its effect to ss both dwarf and bancho from hand, xyz into utopic sage, then detaching from utopic sage to ss the ascended sage from deck, from there you overlay the sage and whichever of the Lv 4 you have left following the same line of play as the other combo, this combo does have better perks such as the utopic sage being able to protect one of you utopia monster, and also being able to extend further with the effect of dwarf in grave to ss and bancho on field to ss from grave. there are indeed many more ways to do combos in this deck and to be honest it feels like you'r able to freestyle into whichever combo you want. I hope you try out this deck and it shows a side of something interesting to you."

Or use Return of the Red-Eyes and get your Monsters from the Graveyard.  Return of Dragon Lords, Red-Eyes Baby Dragon and Red-Eyes Alterantive Dragon also help getting your Red-Eyes on the Field. The later one can get you a Red-Eyes Black Dragon with 4800 ATK.  Red-Eyes Fusion is the the Red-Eyes version of Fusion, most of the Time you want Red-Eyes Slash Dragon or Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon.  Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon and Darkness Metal, the Dragon of Dark Steel can also help getting your Dragons out.  <strong>Protection:</strong>  Red-Eyes Slash Dragon and Meteor Dragon Red-Eyes Impact are the Main ways protect your Red-Eyes.  Catalyst Field is the main way of getting rid of Spell/Trap Cards and powerfull  Monsters (that are not protected from destruction).  Red-Eyes Fang with Chain can get rid of (most) Boss-Monsters, since it doesn't destroy them. As long as you can target the Monster and the effect is not canceled you can turn the Monster into equiptment.  Return of the Dragon Lords can also prevent the destruction of one of your Dragons.  (Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon can also stop one effect per Turn and destroy up to 2 Monster if put in)  <strong>Getting Cards:</strong>  Red-Eyes Insight, Black Metal Dragon and Red-Eyes Baby Dragon are the main ways of getting Cards you need. Since you need to send Red-Eyes to the Graveyard for Red-Eyes Insight it supports summoning or helps getting the second Gearfried the Red-Eyes Iron Knight into the Graveyard for Red-Eyes Slash Dragon.  If your Galaxy Satellite Dragon can survive till your Opponents End-Phase you can also get a card on the next turn. But Galaxy Satellite Dragon is mainly in this Deck to help summon Darkness Metal."

You can absolutely summon the three knights up to 3 times in one single turn with your best hand, and even if you don't, Joker's Straight not only makes you summon the three knights, but also gives you an extra normal summon, which you can use to get another set of knights on the field, or even normal summon an egyptian god. Joker's Straight, Joker's Wild and Joker's Knight are definitely the best of this deck, always recycling at the end of either player's turn. Which allows you to play them every single turn.  With Thunderspeed Summon you can normal summon Slifer (even from the deck) or Ra, at the beginning of your turn, during the battle phase (which would allow for a Ra one turn kill) or even during your opponent's turn. (Ra Sphere Mode is also eligible).  Even if you are not capable of ending things with a God, with so many summons of level 4s and 5s, you have access to a lot xzys and link monsters, from Isolde, to Utopia Lightning, Constellar Pleiades and even Zeus in the right stituation.  Court of Card might be a bad second turn card, but it's absolutely useful if you choose to play slifer, or if you brick, which as in any deck, might happen.  Arcana Knight Joker is just a targer for Pot of Prosperity.  Give it a try and make it your own with any changes you may see fit. It has enough hand traps and support to compete in a tournament."

Sooooo, this deck is kinda amazing. Drawing 20 cards in a turn is nuts.  The board is leo with all three ZW + Number 38 + some other stuff that isn't really important.

Like the last two entries, I enjoyed reading the feedback about them. especially the huge majority of people talking about the quantity of Maxx “C” that they were uncomfortable with, and occasional snark remarks about the region as well. Unfortunately, KONAMI has not yet decided Maxx “C” is problematic in the OCG. So my dear TCG readers, I apologize for the distress this may cause you for the next three months.  This article, as per namesake, is about me breaking down the Limit Regulations for the next three months. I will do my best to explain various reasonings behind certain factors with the current metagame in mind.

You can later fusion summon it fast with only 2 other effect-monsters, that you can link-summon to <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a>, to <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> which has then 4500atk (with link-2 material) for one turn of each player, and a 'wall'-effect that works best with <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a> or <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>. You can also special summon it with <a data-name=""Fusion Deployment"">Fusion Deployment</a> from the deck, but you must fusion summon it then directly without link-summons, you still trigger the token-effect, so you could use it as 2 free-tributes for <a data-name=""Metaltron XII, The True Dracombantant"">Metaltron XII, The True Dracombantant</a>. You also trigger the token-effect by special summoning it from the Graveyard with <a data-name=""Call Of The Haunted"">Call Of The Haunted</a> or <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>.  <a data-name=""The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion"">The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion</a>: You can use it to get <a data-name=""Amazoness Empress"">Amazoness Empress</a> or <a data-name=""Amazoness Pet Liger"">Amazoness Pet Liger</a> with one generic Amazoness-monster. You can not use the tribute-effect to summon <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> because it its not an earth-monster, but this would be not a good play anyway because you wouldn't get the 'fusion-summoned'-effects. You can still use it as substitude for <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a> with <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a> or <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a>.  <a data-name=""Cosmic Compass"">Cosmic Compass</a>: A fast token-summoning monster that can be special summoned with <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a> from the graveyard and that works in the same turn it gets summoned, so it's good for the earlygame and to rush for link-monsters.  <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>: a level-1-tuner and a good token monster that also can be special summmoned with <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a> from the graveyard. It's good for Tokens and for synchro-summoning, you get <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a> with 1 <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> (level 6), then you could revive it to summon <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> with <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a> (level 7-synchro). With amazoness cards you always have an <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> on the field so it's a good support for amazoness-monsters, you could also use two level-3 monsters if you want.  &nbsp;  Spells:  <a data-name=""Amazoness Call"">Amazoness Call</a>, <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a>, <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a>:  draw cards, with amazoness call you always get <a data-name=""Amazoness Princess"">Amazoness Princess</a> to then get <a data-name=""Amazoness Village"">Amazoness Village</a> or <a data-name=""Amazoness Onslaught"">Amazoness Onslaught</a> by summoning it, and also get <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> with the attack-effect, but you can also get all other amazoness cards, but you can not use it twice in a turn. <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi</a> is the best draw card with tokens that you need for the link-monster-support anyway, you can not use the effect with normal-monsters but you get tokens from <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>, <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>, <a data-name=""Cosmic Compass"">Cosmic Compass</a>, <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a> and <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a> and you can also set monsters like <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a> (flip effect) and amazoness monsters ('battle-damage'-immunity or <a data-name=""Amazoness Spy"">Amazoness Spy</a>'s GY-summon-effect). <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a> is best with <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> (graveyard-summon-effect) or <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a> (you can shoot two monsters instead of one , and it also comes back from the graveyard).  <a data-name=""Amazoness Village"">Amazoness Village</a>, <a data-name=""Fusion Deployment"">Fusion Deployment</a>, <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""Swords of Revealing Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a>, <a data-name=""One-Time Passcode"">One-Time Passcode</a>,  <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>, <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>:  Good defensive cards for tokens and special summons, with Amazoness cards it's good to rush for fast wall-effects, with <a data-name=""Swords of revealing light"">Swords of revealing light</a> the opponent has to decide between it, <a data-name=""Amazoness Village"">Amazoness Village</a> and <a data-name=""Amazoness Onslaught"">Amazoness Onslaught</a> with negate-cards, so it's also good because it gets 'aggro' and the opponent hast to negate it, you can also discard it with <a data-name=""Amazoness Princess"">Amazoness Princess</a>'s attack-effect. <a data-name=""One-time Passcode"">One-time Passcode</a> can be used for fast Cyberse-link-monsters whenever you have it or as a tribute for <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> or <a data-name=""Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant"">Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant.</a>  &nbsp;  Traps:  <a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a> – With it you get a 'wall' as fast as possible by special summoning <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a> with it, this protects the other amazoness-combo's. You can also use it to summon <a data-name=""Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant"">Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant</a> with only one tribute and then get a good 'boss-monster' that negates the opponent cards.  <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a> – good special summon, If you special summon <a data-name=""Amazoness Princess"">Amazoness Princess</a> with it you can search for another Amazoness card from the deck, and if you summon <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a>, your Amazoness-monster-cards get undestroyable, if you summon <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a> you get a token.  <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a> - fusion-trap that works good with amazoness cards, amazoness princess's name is in the graveyard also 'amazoness queen, and you cana also use <a data-name=""The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion"">The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion</a> as material from the graveyard, you can also fusion summon <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> fast with it<a data-name=""The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion"">.</a>  <a data-name=""Amazoness Onslaught"">Amazoness Onslaught</a>: Amazoness-support card, special summons one amazoness-monster per battle phase fro the hand with +500atk in that battle phase and opponent monsters get banished everytime they fight amazoness-monsters, so the opponent has to clear it especially if you have 'battle-damage'-immunity, it works more than one time, so with <a data-name=""Amazoness Call"">Amazoness Call</a> you could even attack all opponent monsters with <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> and banish them. If it gets destroyed you get one amazoness-monster special summoned from the graveyard.  <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> – good negate that works twice  &nbsp;  Extra-deck:  Fusion:  <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> – the '<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>'-target, 'eats' one monster and can then be used for <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>  <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> – you get 4500atk when you used Link 2 - <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a> to summon it, for one turn of each player, if you have another link-monster on the field you get a wall-effect that gives target- and attack-immunities to other monsters. You get a spell from the deck if it gets sent to the graveyard by an opponent's card effect (not by battle).  <a data-name=""Amazoness Empress"">Amazoness Empress</a>, <a data-name=""Amazoness Pet Liger"">Amazoness Pet Liger</a> - High Atk Monsters with good effects that can attack all other monsters with <a data-name=""Amazoness Call"">Amazoness Call</a> in the GY. <a data-name=""Amazoness Empress"">Amazoness Empress</a> is only good with <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a>, so that both have 'battle-damage'-immunity, then it gets even stronger with more wall-cards. The 'wall'-monsters that you can play are <a data-name=""Amazoness Pet Liger"">Amazoness Pet Liger</a>, <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a>, <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a>, the other monsters can be used to have more negates and 'boss-monsters'.  <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a>: Good 'wall'-monster with Amazoness Cards that can be special summoned with one <a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a>. The opponent has to attack and to target it first,and it won't get destroyed by battle, so it can defeat any monster in battle that has 3000 or less atk.  &nbsp;  Link:  <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>: You can use the tokens from <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a>, <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>, <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a> and <a data-name=""Cosmic Compass"">Cosmic Compass</a> or <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>, <a data-name=""Cosmic Compass"">Cosmic Compass</a> and <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> as level-1-monsters.  <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a>: It's only used to get more monsters for link summons on the field. You can get <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a> with only one <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a>, but you can also use it to get a fast <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, and summon as much Link-monsters as possible before it to destroy more cards with it. <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> is the only Link-monster that is not Cyberse, so you can not summon it in the same turn after you used the effect, you can also not special summon other monsters after you used it, if they are not cyberse, so you have to special summon amzoness-monsters or token-monsters before you use it if you want to special summon more monsters. With the effect you can special summon <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a> and <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a> in defense position and with effects negated, but you can't summon link monsters because they can't be in defense position, so you have to calculate that if you summon link-4 monsters.  <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a> – Good alternative to <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a> and <a data-name=""The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion"">The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion</a>, when you have enough tokens, but it only needs generic effect monsters. It can also use itself as fusion material if you summon <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a>.  <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a>: You can summon it with <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a> that you can turn to <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> in one turn. It can shoot 2 monsters instead of one if you use <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a> on it, it is a good 'Wall'-Link-Monster to support <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a>, because both need a link monster for their 'wall'-effects.  <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>: The best Link-monster that can also be summoned very fast in the earlygame if you have a token card. You can then special summon <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a> and <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> if possible to have more Link-monsters in the graveyard and then summon it to destroy a card for every link-monster in the graveyard or on the field. You have to banish them but you can destroy 3-4 cards in one turn, and then have a monster with at least 4300 atk. This can counter most boss-monsters of other deck-combo's if they don't have any negates to stop the summon or destroy-effect. It can also banish itself to destroy another card if you don't need the atk-damage. If you can summon <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a> before you get it, you only need another level-1-Token or 1 Monster, and you already have 5300 atk then. This is nearly as strong as <a data-name=""Red-eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-eyes Dark Dragoon</a> was before it got banned, but it does not have the negate power against the otk- and early-lockdown-strategies that are most important to counter somehow if it's possible, it also cannot be summoned with only one spell and it's harder to summon it in the first turn.  <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> – You have to summon with 4 materials to be effective, then you can draw 4 cards and put 3 back into the deck, to then easily play the right amazoness-combo's with also one more card in the hand. It depends if you have enough tokens and other monsters to play, if it's an effective play, then you can also use the special summon effect to summon one monster from the hand, so it can be fast worth it to summon it. It's also Link-4, so if you have it in the graveyard when you have Accesscode Talker you get 6300atk with it.  &nbsp;  Synchro:  <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a>: You can summon it with <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a> and <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> (level 6) or for example with two level-3 monsters instead. It can knock-out all extra-monsters by sending them back to the extra-deck without targeting them. It has to be attacked and targeted when you have another link-monster. It is also possible to summon <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> with another <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>.  <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> – One of the targets that are good to summon with <a data-name=""Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant"">Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant</a>. It would be normally harder to summon it in one turn, and it has a good monster-effect negate, and it's also hard to defeat it in a battle.  <a data-name=""Crystal Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Clear Wing Synchro Dragon</a> – One of the targets that are good to summon with <a data-name=""Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant"">Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant</a>. It would be normally harder to summon it in one turn, and it has a good Spell/trap-negate, you get <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a> as a wind-monster from the deck to the hand if it gets sent to the graveyard by an opponents card."

Women that are born from a plant's flowers during the winter. their original form is a single petal, but as they grow past their infancy, they begin to resemble human girls. They also tend to be fashionable and trendy. for their unusual biology they are referred to as Fairies while their leaders are called Queens.  While they often mingle with the outside world, their cultural quirks indicate that they are more comfortable in colder climates, and that they tend to feel drowsy in warmer climes. Scholars speculate that they evolved from sentient fauna that aestivates during the summer. the hypothesis has some evidence as the gardens where the Rikka gather and are born from bloom in the winter.  Furthermore they are also more capable of survival in subzero temperatures than humans are, but aren't completely immune to freezing. In fact there were some incidents where some of them froze solid and stayed frozen even as the temperature reached 30 degrees Celsius.""  A Rikka deck that with some Rose cards as techs. The strategy of the archetype revolves around tributing your mosnters and your opponents mosnters for advantage. As well as access a toolbox of Xyz monsters via the level modification effects of the Rikka Fairies.  <a data-name=""Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy"">Snowdrop</a> is the best playmaker of the deck as her ability allows you to make every plant monster have the same level as one of them and she can summon herself and another plant form your hand at the cost of not being able to summon non-Plants that turn. <a data-name=""Primula the Rikka Fairy"">Primula</a> is second as her effect raises the levels of two Plants by two and she can summon herself if a monster if tributed. In between them is <a data-name=""Mudan the Rikka Fairy"">Mudan</a>, who can add one of the archtype's backrow to your hand form your deck. Note that these monsters are statistically defense-oriented. I run each at 3.  The Fairies come in pairs, with one of them having high DEF and the other having High ATK but more situational effects, as well as an effect to revive themselves under specific circunstances. Of the attack-oriented ones, <a data-name=""Cyclamen the Rikka Fairy"">Cyclamen</a> is the most situational, foe her effect is the opposite of Primulas and it work by tributing her form the hand. <a data-name=""Erica the Rikka Fairy"">Erica</a> has an effect that works like <a data-name=""Blackwing - Kalut the Moon Shadow"">Blackwing - Kalut the Moon Shadow</a>, boosting the stats of a battling Rikka monster by a set amount by tributing her form the hand or field. <a data-name=""Hellebore the Rikka Fairy"">Hellebore</a> is a handtrap of sorts, stopping opponents effect as long as they target and you have a Rikka onboard. I run 2 of each.  &nbsp;  For each pair of fairies there is a queen. The Queens are Xyz monsters that serve as the bosses of the deck. <a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop</a> being their primary boss, allowing you to tribute any monster and do it during the opponent's turn if she has a Plant as an overlay unit and gains ATK with each tribute. <a data-name=""Kanzashi the Rikka Queen"">Kanzashi</a> is an analogue of sort so to <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>. In that they allow you to take an opponents monster. However Kanziashi needs a monster to be tributed first and she affects monsters on the field, also changing them to Plants. Het other effect lets you tribute a plant to take the deathblow an an opponent's effect. Last but not least is <a data-name=""Rikka Queen Strenna"">Strenna</a>. An adorbale little scater that can recover backrow form the GY and if she is tributed while haivng material lets you bring forht a bigger plant with herself as their overlay unit. This means you can get out monsters like <a data-name=""Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton"">Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton</a>, and Teardrop without running the right levels. Of course they'll only have one material in that case, but Hyperyton can get more every turn.  The last monster of note is <a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Rikka Petal</a>. She can special summon herself from the GY and also lets you search or mill a Fairy to use their effects. Of course she also plant-locks you, so I can understand if people don't play her as much. I also run 3 <a data-name=""Rikka Glamour"">Rikka Glamour</a> and one each of <a data-name=""Rikka Flurries"">Flurries</a>, <a data-name=""Rikka Sheet"">Sheet</a> and <a data-name=""Rikka Tranquility"">Tranquility</a>.  The rose cards I added for the main deck are <a data-name=""Ruddy Rose Witch"">Ruddy Rose Witch</a>, <a data-name=""Witch of the Black Rose"">Witch of the Black Rose</a>, <a data-name=""Rose Fairy"">Rose Fairy</a> and <a data-name=""Rose Girl"">Rose Girl</a>. This is a small-ish engine that lets you pull off a <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> or other plays involving <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Garden Rose Flora"">Garden Rose Flora</a>.  Other monsters include <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>, <a data-name=""Evil Thorn"">Evil Thorn</a>, <a data-name=""Staysailor Romarin"">Staysailor Romarin</a>, <a data-name=""Tytannial, Princess of Camellias"">Tytannial, Princess of Camellias</a>, and of course Plant Staple <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a>. For the Extra Deck, besides those already mentioned, I run <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Titanic Galaxy</a>, <a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the timeless"">Number 60: Dugares</a>, <a data-name=""Number 87: Queen of the Night"">Number 87: Queen of the Night</a>, <a data-name=""Sunavalon Dryas"">Sunavalon Dryas</a>, <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a> and <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a>.  The side deck includes additional copies of Flurries, Sheet and Tranquility and 3 copies of <a data-name=""Rose Lover"">Rose Lover</a>. As placeholders I also have 3 <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> and <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> each.  That about sums up my deck for now. I'll make some updates if I can get some Garden Rose Maidens and a Ruddy Rose Dragon. I'll eventually do some test hands to see if there are other changes to make, but for now I'm open to suggestions."

Your Amazoness archetype is the meat of the deck, working as your frontline to bait enemy effects and build a wall of offense while you have The A. Forces active. Their 1100-1500 statline makes them easy to search off of Rat, WLotW, and Last Will, giving you constant field presence with the exception of Paladin, who requires a search off of RotA. Paladin and Tiger are your primary battlers especially while you have one or both The A. Forces active. Chain Master is best to employ early in the duel, as her effect allows you to steal an opponent's monster from their hand, potentially denying them of a valuable resource, at the cost of 1500 Life Points. Finally, Swordswoman is a sneaky option to deal consistent damage to your opponent in battle while protecting your life points. They are supported by several other EARTH and staple monsters depending on the situation you find yourself in. Granmarg is the goon of the deck, removing what is hopefully a critical set card and giving you access to a 2400 body, while Injection Fairy Lily is the deck's back-up win condition, and is searchable by almost any option at your disposal for a surprise attack. Legendary Jujitsu Master serves as your primary wall, forcing opposing attackers to bounce back to the top of the deck to give you some breathing room. Giant Rats and Warrior Lady of the Wasteland serve as your recruiters, and although WLotW may seem like a worse fill-in for a third Giant Rat, her Warrior typing allows her to benefit from the A. Forces where Rat does not, giving you the extra ATK boost you might need. Finally, some staples you see in every deck of the era: Breaker, MoF, Mask and Sangan, who need no explanation.  The predominant trap of this deck is Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane, which I find to be a criminally underrated tool for EARTH decks. With the exception of Granmarg and your non-EARTH monsters, Kurogane allows you to pull anything in your GY back to your field at a moment's notice, allowing surprise tag-ins with the resources you've accumulated over the course of the duel, and any of your monsters can be relied on depending on the state of the field. Even better, Kurogane can swap a monster that has already attacked in your battle phase for a fresh monster for an additional attack that might just win you the duel. For the same reason, this deck has a method to summon or swap monsters from any location: Last Will and your recruiters can call from the Deck, Dramatic Rescue enables your Amazonesses to switch with a monster in the hand, and Interdimensional Matter Transporter lets you turn any of your monsters into a one-turn Strike Ninja to evade almost anything your opponent has in store for them, and Kurogane and Call of the Haunted obviously access your Graveyard. Other than the staple Spell/Traps, Amazoness Spellcaster allows you trade ATK values with an opponent's monster to potentially go over something troublesome such as the ever-present Cyber Dragon and Monarchs.  In the Side Deck, Millennium Shield exists specifically to counter Skill Drain decks as that trap card is a hazard to this effect-heavy deck. As an EARTH Warrior monster, it is very searchable and triggers the A. Forces, giving it more utility than something like Labyrinth Wall. D.D. Warrior Lady is only here due to not being EARTH, making her less useful in the main deck. Amazoness Blowpiper and Amazoness Archers are available in case your opponent's attacking monsters are just a little too out of reach of your A. Forces boosts. Scapegoat is also important to be mindful of. It's not in the main deck due to the need for open field spaces in case your opponent is vulnerable to an A. Forces Amazoness beatdown, but as the tokens are EARTH, you can trade them with Kurogane for anything in your GY for free, in case you do decide to side the card in.  I find this deck's strength to be in its ability to tempo out an opponent with your constant tag-ins, switches and self-banishes. By retaining and trading field advantage and forcing your opponent's removal effects to be wasted, you can consistently drain your opponent of their options while chipping away at their life points. There are certainly options to consider adding that I chose not to that could boost this deck's efficiency. I believe EARTH monsters like Berserk Gorilla can be useful to drag out of the GY with Kurogane, and obviously this deck chooses to avoid the two biggest Warrior Toolbox monsters of Marauding Captain and D.D. Assailant for the sake of Amazoness Consistency, but so far this build has worked well as it is, even if it remains a work in progress.  The major weaknesses to look out for: Skill Drain as I mentioned, as this is a very monster effect-reliant deck. Jinzo and other anti-trap cards are also something you need to take into account, as losing your surprise switches and stranding your monsters will deprive you of the field presence you need to keep pressure on your opponent. Similarly if your opponent is invested on banishing your cards, it will cut you off from valuable options to tag into when you need them. While I haven't had cause to add it to the side deck, you should consider a copy of Return to be able to recover from an opponent's deck that features a lot of banishment. Finally, always play around Heavy Storm and Dark Hole if you possibly can."

I put Borreload Savage for additional negates and OTK. I'm not really sure on my side deck, forgive me if it sucks. I tested the deck and theoretically, it can make up to 12 negates/interruptions.

Then you can activate Joker's Wild on your first turn (or Trap Trick which searches Joker's Wild and lets you activate it the same turn). Joker's Wild can send Face Card Fusion or Joker's Straight, depending which one you need at that moment. If it sends Joker's Straight you can retrieve both it and Joker's Wild at End Phase.</li>  	<li>Isolde can search Kaiki the Unity Star to your hand upon its Link Summon.  If you have Face Card Fusion (or if you can activate Joker's Wild due to Makyura the Destructor's effect and resolve Face Card Fusion that way) while you control Jack/Queen/King's Knight, you can send Arcana Triumph Joker from your Deck to the GY and Kaiki the Unity Star from your hand to the GY to summon Idaten the Conqueror Star, which searches Joker's Knight on summon. Afterward if you use Joker's Straight, you can easily revive Arcana Triumph Joker.</li>  	<li>Isolde can send Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade as one of its 4 Equip Spells required to summon Makyura the Destructor. This can be retrieved easily and used for discard costs for Joker's Straight, Idaten the Conqueror Star, Arcana Triumph Joker (when destroying Spell Cards), or can be used to power up Arcana Triumph Joker by keeping it in your hand. This card plus the three self-retrieving Joker cards give Arcana Triumph Joker a minimum of 2000 ATK.</li>  	<li>Kaiki the Unity Star can revive on the opponent's turn if you control a Level 5 or higher Warrior whose current ATK is different from its original ATK. This can be achieved by controlling Arcana Triumph Joker with 1 card minimum in either player's hand (since its effect says it gains ATK, its original ATK is 0), or discarding a card using Idaten the Conqueror Star's effect to allow it to gain ATK, or by equipping Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade or Sword of Deep-Seated to a Level 5 or higher Warrior of your choice. Once Kaiki the Unity Star summons itself, it can initiate a Fusion Summon using itself and Idaten the Conqueror Star as materials to make Shura the Combat Star, or Gilti-Gearfriend the Magical Steel Knight using itself and another Warrior with a different attribute. Shura allows you to make all monsters the opponent controls have 0 ATK during the Battle Phase, while Gilti-Gearfried can negate effects that target it and gains ATK equal to its DEF if you banish a Spell while battling an opponent's monster. It can also attack twice if it was summoned using only materials on the field.</li>  	<li>The rest of the Extra Deck not mentioned so far is currently in testing and may be subject to change. Feel free to use different cards in those slots. Number 39: Utopia Double is a possible inclusion to secure a quick OTK.</li>  	<li>A common first turn end board consists of Arcana Extra Joker (summoned using Isolde, Makyura and a third card), Arcana Triumph Joker, and Idaten, with the ability to revive Kaiki to summon Shura on the opponent's turn. You will also likely have Phoenix Blade, Joker's Knight, Joker's Straight and Joker's Wild in your hand at minimum.</li> </ul>"

Steps:  1) SS Apprentice by discarding any card to grave  2) Activate Souls and dump DM Girl to GY  3) SS DM Girl using Souls effect  4) XYZ summon Norito using Apprentice and DM Girl  5) XYZ Norito into Ebon Illusion Magician  6) Activate Ebon effect to SS DM  7) Use DM to Link summon Imduk  8) Link summon Predaplant with Ebon + Imduk  (You now have 5 different spellcasters in the grave)  9) Activate Predaplant effect to copy Magicalized Fusion and summon Quintet Magician by banishing all 5 spellcasters in GY.  <strong>Combo#2</strong>  Initial Cards:  1 Magicians Rod  1 Magician Souls  Steps:  1) Send DM to GY with Souls, then use Souls effect to sp summon DM  2) Normal Rod, search Soul Servant  3) Activate Servant, chose Mahad, then use servant 2nd effect to draw which will sp summon Mahad  4) Overlay Mahad + DM into rank 7 xyz spellcaster (Ebon Illusion or Ebon High). Use Illusion for an extra DM in field If you want.  5) Link summon Anaconda with Ebon + Rod,  6) Use Anaconda to copy Magicalized Fusion to sp summon Quintet Magician.  <strong>Other Strategies:</strong>  Your next strategy after Quintet should be to get DM Dragon Knight along with Eternal Soul and Circle with Apprentice acting as your Honest ATK boost. You can get to DM Dragon Knight using Keeper to search Poly, next using Keeper 2nd effect to sp summon DM from grave, and then using poly on DM + Keeper to get DM Dragon Knight. Keeper can also search Fusion Deploy and Magicalized Fusion should you need that. Aside from that, other ways to summon Dragon Knight are:  Phantazmay + DM with Secrets or Poly  DM + Imduk with Secrets or Poly  DM + enemy Dragon using Super Poly  DM + Eye of Timaeus  <strong>Notes:</strong>  There are other ways to 1-turn turbo Quintet with this deck but they may require 1 more necessary card. The listed combos are the least resource intensive.  Should you be wary of hand traps/negates, I suggest you bait them out with your other starting cards first or use Apprentice next since her effect isn't necessary to pull off the combo anyway."

","A version of Dragon Link with a more significant emphasis on Dragonmaids.  &nbsp;  Why Should I play this deck?  They hit two of Yu-Gi-Oh's most popular archetype, Dragons and Waifus.  Archetype gimmicks turns battle phase into crazy advantage. Its cards are also all good.  Dragonmaid Tidying is a very good card.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  How to play:  Turn 1: Try to make Hieratic Seal. Then look to set up Tidying, and depending on the hand, you can either make Borreload Savage or Dragonmaid Sheou.  Turn 2: Try not to die. If they tried to enter battle phase to force seal, tribute seal in battle phase. Consider whether you need to use Tidying's removal on your turn against multiple backrow or as a extender.  Turn 3+: Don't tried to force a OTK, use the battle phase to bounce the Dragonmaids to hand and make Seal, Sheou, or Tidying, or all of them.  &nbsp;  Card Explanation:  Noctovision Dragon: There are several version of decks where its cut down to 1. Maybe it bricks, but the deck is slow enough that drawing two isn't a death sentence, and it can also be used as fusion material for Dragonmaid Sheou. It is a crazy card that protect your backrow.  Dragonmaid Nudyarl: The other option is Dragonmaid Ernus, which special a Dragonmaid from hand. I don't feel the need for the extra summons, and the slow D.D. Crow can be useful.  Dragonmaid Hospitality: It bricks at 3. :) You can cut it down to one, but I run two because I do use the second one.  Rokket Recharger: Honestly, I haven't think too much about the Rokket card. Its a target for Rokket Tracer that isnt too bad when you draw it.  World Legacy Guardragon: Broken card, I once move Dragonmaid Sheou across the board 2 times. Its a reborn that enables Pisty. Its better than hospitality because it can target Rokket cards.  Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay: Its bad for some matchup, but just use it as a fusion material.  Dragonmaid Sheou/ House Dragonmaid: Sheou needs a House Dragonmaid to negate, and it comes up.  Halqifibrax: Ash is the only target, I haven't really tested other targets, but Rokket Synchron is target to replace with Upstart Goblin.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

I've chosen more of a control strategy for this deck as it plays into the strengths of Bufferlo and Desires.  This deck plays a Budget 2-Card OTK (not Accesscode) that gets rid of 3 cards in the process, you just need to see Gazelle and one of Spinny or Foxy. <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Spinny (or Foxy)</li>  	<li>Link summon Balelynx using Spinny (or Foxy)</li>  	<li>Chainlink 1 special summon Gazelle from hand, Chainlink 2 activate Balelynx effect to grab Sanctuary from your deck</li>  	<li>Activate Gazelle effect to send Will to grave</li>  	<li>Activate Spinny effect in grave (or Foxy by sending a Salamangreat card from your hand to grave and there will need to be a face-up spell/trap card on the field which you can use Sanctuary for) to special summon itself to the field (if using Foxy you can pop an opponents face-up spell/trap card)</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Miragestallio using Gazelle and Spinny (or Foxy)</li>  	<li>Activate Miragestallio effect (locks you into fire monsters for rest of turn) by detaching Gazelle then special summon Jack Jaguar from your deck in defence position</li>  	<li>Link summon Sunlight Wolf using Balelynx and Miragestallio, then use Miragestallio effect to spin an opponents monster back to their hand (or extra deck)</li>  	<li>Link summon another copy of Sunlight Wolf using Sunlight Wolf and Jack Jaguar</li>  	<li>Activate Sunlight Wolf effect to add Will from your grave to your hand</li>  	<li>Activate Jack Jaguar effect in grave to send Sunlight Wolf in grave back to the extra deck to special summon Jack Jaguar under your Sunlight Wolf, then activate Sunlight Wolf effect to add Gazelle from grave to hand</li>  	<li>Link summon Heatleo using Sunlight Wolf and Jack Jaguar, then use Heatleo's effect to spin one if your opponents backrow back to their deck</li>  	<li>Activate Sanctuary from hand</li>  	<li>Link summon another copy of Heatleo using Sanctuary effect, then use Heatleo's effect again to spin another one of your opponents backrow back to their deck</li>  	<li>Activate Heatleo's other effect changing one of your opponents attack position monsters to the same attack as Balelynx (your lowest monsters attack in grave) which is 500</li>  	<li>Activate Will from hand, then choose it's second effect sending Will to the grave targeting Heatleo to special summon 3 Salamangreat monsters from your grave in defence position: Spinny (or Foxy), Jack Jaguar, and Miragestallio</li>  	<li>Link summon Proxy Magician using Spinny (or Foxy) and Jack Jaguar</li>  	<li>Activate Proxy Magician effect to fusion summon Violet Chimera using Proxy Magician and Miragestallio</li>  	<li>Activate Violet Chimera effect to add half the attack of the materials used for its fusion summon which will be 1700 making it's new attack 4,500</li>  	<li>Use Violet Chimera to attack the monster changed to 500 attack through Heatleo's effect, where you activate Violet Chimera's second effect to double its attack when battling a monster that's attack is different from its original attack, making Violet Chimera's attack 9000, swinging for 8,500 damage, and that is game.</li> </ol> You are doing this combo under the protection of Balelynx once it's in the grave and if it doesn't go through you've got your grave set up for next turn, as well as Gazelle back in hand plus 4 other cards to work with (6 if you use Bufferlo for the normal summon sending Spinny or Foxy to grave).  Going first you are trying to dig into your traps and get Bagooska onto your field as it's a hell of a card. I side in anti-spell going first which if you can pair this with a Bagooska and set Roar it's going to be a hell of a board to break as your negating all spell effects, monster effects on field (except link monsters but that's where Roar and Solemn's come in), and your opponents monsters can't attack (except Link). I have weighed up between Dweller and Rasterliger but opt for Rasterliger (the wish Accesscode) because it helps you win games whereas Dweller is circumstantial. Torrential Tribute is a 1 way nuke as Balelynx will protect your monsters, and Gozen Match is one of the most underrated floodgates as it will stop just about every meta deck if flipped at the right chokepoint, and if you get hit with Nibiru you can flip Gozen then they are locked into light monsters only which stops just about every meta deck except Drytron.  One last thing, Falco can pull off some amazing plays, one of my favourites is if you have Sunlight Wolf, Balelynx, set Rage, and Gazelle in hand (fairly common and achievable set-up) you can use the first effect of Rage to pop your Balelynx then popping one of your opponents cards, then because a Salamangreat monster is hitting the grave you can special summon Gazelle under your Sunlight Wolf where Gazelle will send Falco to grave and Sunlight Wolf will activate to add a fire monster from grave to hand (Foxy, Spinny Jack Jaguar, Bufferlo, Ash if you play it), then Falco will activate its effect in grave to reset Rage back to your field. Then on your turn you can activate Rage again to pop 2 more cards of your opponents (3 if you climb into Heatleo) as well as activating Falco's effect in grave to send Gazelle back to your hand and then you can normal (or special if another Salamangreat monster hits the grave) summon Gazelle back to your field triggering it's effect again to send another card to your grave. This play is extremely effective in your opponents end phase as they can't really follow up, overall Falco get's you at least one extra pop with Rage and at least a plus 3 in resources. If you play Dweller you can do a similar play where if you activate Roar or Rage before activating Dweller's effect, once Dweller detaches Jack Jaguar, Gazelle will activate in hand, sending Falco to reset Roar, and repeating everything else."

A Monster Mash WATER deck...,"""Within the depths of the ocean, there exists three tribes of merfolk. The first, clad in armor, fight against their oppression. The second, soldiers that betrayed the rulers of Atlantis to aid the rebellious merrows. The third hail from a group of troubadours that seek to bring joy through song.  Through their combined might, they call upon the powers of their sacred treasures, the harmonies of the Deep Sea will creatures of the alabaster seas. The Atlantean traitors will support from afar, aiming to bring down the tyranny of Porseidra. The Mermail in turn shall serve as the face of their resistance, as they fight Poseidra's forces and draw their ire away from their allies. Together, they will break their fetters.""  The idea is Synchro Mermail. or that was the basis of it at least, but As the ED can attest I haven't quite shunned Xyz monsters. The Mermail are capable of swarming the field largely in part to <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssteus"">Abyssteus</a>' power, as well as that of <a data-name=""Mermail Abysshilde"">Abysshilde</a>, <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssgunde"">Abyssgunde</a> and <a data-name=""Neptabyss, the Atlantean PRince"">Neptabyss</a>. The Mermails and Atlanteans both have effects that proc when discarded which allows them to synergize decently enough. The Deep Sea Tuners, <a data-name=""Deep sea Diva"">Diva</a> in particular, allow for Neptabyss plays and Synchro access. <a data-name=""Moulinglacia, the Elemental Lord"">Moulinglacia, the Elemental Lord</a> is there because its searchable and I'm certain combos exist to get just the right amount of Water monsters for it in the GY. Also worh noting is the Genex Package that can turn the NS into a Lin-2 with <a data-name=""Crystron Rosenix"">Crystron Rosenix</a>'s token.  For the more unusual on-theme monsters. <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssdine"">Abyssdine</a> is there because the little clionid is my favorte, but also becuase she serves as an extender with Abyssalacia's effect, <a data-name=""Mermail Abysshilde"">Abysshilde</a> is there because I also run her sisters <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssgunde"">Abyssgunde</a> and <a data-name=""Mermail Abysshilde"">Abysshilde</a>. More questionable is <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssmander"">Abyssmander</a>, while he helps with Synchro and sometimes Xyz plays, he's mainly here because of the Very Fun Dragon...who is now banned and pending a replacement with a certain Level 7 Synchro soon, plus I also have <a data-name=""Guitar Grunards Duonigis"">Guitar Grunards Duonigis</a> for level modulation. Also questionable is <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssleed"">Abyssleed</a> and <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssbalean"">Abyssbalean</a>, but the former at least has a use with the side deck. The lone spell is <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> which has the obvious purpose of procing effects like Neptabyss and Abysshilde (might replace with <a data-name=""Light of Sekka"">Light of Sekka</a>, but then again maybe not).  The Extra Deck as noted, is focused on Synchros but with some Link and Xyz monsters thrown in for good measure. <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> is there as a generic way to get to <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>. I'm also planning to run a suite of Synchro Tuners to make the players easier such as <a data-name=""Tatsunoko"">Tatsunoko</a> (Made with Diva and Neptabyss and can use a Level 7 if they otherwise brick the hand), Crystron Quandax (Which can allow for Accell Synchro-like shenanigans), Coral Dragon and Deep Sea Prima Donna (the card pending to replace Calamities, also makes the Level 3s better and grans a monster some much needed protection). The ideal plays would be involving the White Aura monsters, especially <a data-name=""White Aura Biphamet"">Biphamet</a> and with Quandax, <a data-name=""White Aura Whale"">Whale</a>. I know what you're thinking and yes I'll eventually get <a data-name=""Crystron Halifibrax"">Crystron Halifibrax</a> to repalce another Link (Likely <a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a>). And yes I do run each of the Mermail ED mosnters.  The side deck is admittedly haphazard, currently holding 9 cards ATM (Veiler and Twin are palceholders) and they all are the Abyss-scales. I could probably do a bit better, maybe I can side the Abyssleed and Pankratops to make room for the minstrels (or replace the sleeves)  It was a deck I built a few years back and I had prioritized recent decks so bear with me here. Its also way monster heavy due to the amount of WATER goodstuff there is.  As usual, I'm open to suggestions and ideas. Namely to replace Abyssmander and Abyssbaleen and what to fill the side deck besides the obvious (and expensive) hand traps."

I decided to name this card after the theme song of an old video game I had as a kid, <em>Sonic and The Black Knight. </em>I was a major Sonic the Hedgehog fan as a preteen.  &nbsp;  Anyways, this deck is good going first or second. If you're going first, just summon Crystal Wing or Crystal Clear Wing and set Speedroid Dupligate. If you're going second, use your 9 hand traps to disrupt your opponent's plays so you can OTK them on your turn."

Not at all perfectly consistent but good enough to play some games at an affordable price with friends.  Stranger Falcon and Silent Honor Ark are definitely the highlights of the deck!

Now extremely consistent with Pot of Prosperity! Slow down your opponent with handtraps the,"Windwitch Generaider combines the staying power of Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon with the resource generation of Generaider Bosses for a surprisingly competent grindy control deck. Since both deck cores are so small, you can easily slow down your opponent with 15+ handtraps then outgrind them with two strong engines! This deck may have 6 bricks, but worry not! There are 13 starters in this deck which provides access to Windwitch cards or Generaider Boss Stage. This deck is now extremely consistent with with Pot of Prosperity, allowing it to field its several one card starters to dominate the gamestate. This deck is composed of three types of cards: Windwitches, Generaiders, and Staples.  The <span><strong>Windwitch Engine</strong></span> is comprised of 5 cards: 3 <em>Ice Bell</em>, 2 <em>Glass Bell</em>, and 1 <em>Snow Bell</em>. The main reason for this engine is to give you a powerful wind synchro to reside in your EMZ, which typically is a ""immune to destruction"" Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, which is a monster negate, + to send Wind Pegasus to the GY, giving you a powerful ""target and shuffle"" back into the deck removal once a card of yours is destroyed. Best of all, this is accomplished <em>without using your normal summon.</em>  The <strong>combo</strong> with this engine is fairly simple and straightforward.  1.The main starter here is Ice Bell, allowing itself to special summon from the hand if there are no monster cards on the field.  2.Ice Bell summons Glass Bell from deck, triggering both of their field effects at once (Glass Bell searches Snow Bell from deck and Ice Bell burns for 500. hint: Chainblock with Glass Bell as chain link 1 and Ice Bell as chain link 2 so they cannot handtrap/negate your Snow Bell search).  3. Summon Snowbell from the hand since you now fulfill it's special summoning requirement of controlling 2 wind monsters.  4. The level 7 synchro you summon using Icebell + Snowbell depends on your choice. Usually you summon Wind Pegasus to destroy an opponent's backrow with it's effect, and allow for a potential ""shuffle an opponent's card back into the deck"" effect when a card of yours is destroyed. You can also summon Winter Bell if you want to give Diamond Bell its ""twice"" per turn destruction effect.  5. Finally, you summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon into the Extra Monster Zone (to allow more space for generaider tokens) using your level 7 synchro + Snow Bell. Using Snow Bell, your synchro monster is now immune to destruction effects, which makes it very annoying to out. You can also summon Diamond Bell for it's board breaking capability (it can destroy up to two cards on the field with it's effect.)  The <span><strong>Generaider Engine</strong></span> is comprised of 15 cards. The main goal of this engine is to allow access to Boss Stage so you can begin the Generaider grind game vs. your opponent. Once your opponent draws a card, you can begin summon Boss Monsters from the deck.  1. <strong>There are 10 ways to get Boss Stage</strong> out of a 40 card deck, giving you a very good chance of seeing an active Boss Stage for your opponent's turn. First, there are the three copies of Boss Stage itself. 3 Generaider Boss Fight activates as a archetypal ""metaverse,"" activating Boss Stage from the deck or GY. 3 Loptr acts as another copy of Boss Stage by tributing itself to special summon Mardel, which searches out Boss Stage. Finally, Terraforming searches out Boss Stage from the deck.  2. There are <strong>5 maindeck ""Big"" Generaider Bosses</strong>. <em>Mardel </em>searches any generaider card, which our target is typically Boss Stage. <em>Hela</em> is a monster reborn for any Generaider or zombie (notably ash blossom, then you can link up to Accesscode from there using Halq) in the GY. <em>Dovelgus</em> unclogs your hand if it's too full of bricky Generaider monsters. <em>Utgarda</em> is targeted spot removal in a form of a quick effect banish for two tributes. The main boss monster you'll summon is <em>Harr</em>, which functions as a omni-negate. Also, if you opponent adds a card to their hand (except during the draw step), they will have to discard a monster from their hand as well, which certainly messes up combo decks as well.  The rest of this deck is comprised of<strong><span> staple cards</span>. </strong>  The recent creation of <em>Pot of Prosperity</em> is part of the reason this deck is viable - it allows access to one card starters like Ice Bell or Boss Stage to give access to two separate engines. Before this card, this deck ran a serious problem of bricking disastrously since it runs 6 bricks (5 generaider bosses + Psy-Frame Driver), or only having access to one side of the deck rather than both Windwitch and Generaiders. Thanks to this card, you can see both much muuuuch more consistently! When this card gets reprinted at a cheaper price, I'm totally buying a playset!  After consistency cards like Pot of Prosperity, Terraforming and Called By the Grave, there are 15 spaces for staples. You can run any handtrap to match the meta, but here are my personal must-haves since they compliment the deck so well:  1.The ""Solemn"" package of Solemn Strike and Judgement are there since this deck wants to go first. With these cards in the backrow as you go first complimented by Crystal Wing and Harr, you will lose less likely to common blowout boardbreakers like Nibiru, Lightning Storm and Ash.  2. 3 Psy-Frame Gamma + Driver helps insulate your lines of play vs. Ash. This card is usually live when you summon from deck, since both engines activate with no monsters on board (Ice Bell activates from the hand and Boss Stage is a spell). It's like a pseudo Called By The Grave to help guarantee you can establish the board. Also, this card is a devastating card to play when you negate  destroy your opponent's card at an essential choke point of their combo!  3. 3 Ash is always relevant. Counters all the pots, destroys deck searches, etc. Nuff' said.  In the side deck, you have combo killers like Dimension Shifter (This deck can function almost unhindered by the card!) Lancea (for Dino/Virtual World) and Droll &amp; Lockbird (For Drytron/Dragon Link). There are also Feather Duster and Twin Twisters to destroy backrow decks like Altergeist, Eldlich and Sky Strikers running around.  <span><strong>General Tips - </strong></span>I play tested this a lot in Yugioh OMEGA, even reaching top 30 with this deck! It's surprisingly competent. Here are the things I've learned about it. <ul>  	<li>If you already have Generaiders on the field, they may easily tribute themselves so that the field can be empty. Ice Bell will be then able to special summon itself from the hand since your field is empty, also, Psy-Frame Gamma is live.</li>  	<li>Games with this deck tend to end after 1-2 turns. You generally handtrap your opponent to a standstill, and they still have to face down high atk/def dangerous boss monsters with negates like Crystal Wing and Harr.</li>  	<li>If you are facing a Link/XYZ monster with ridiculously high attack (Crystal Wing's attack boosting effect isn't live since these type of monsters don't have levels), you can negate/destroyed your own monster with Crystal Wing, boost it's own attack with your own destroyed monster, and hit over your opponent's monster. This came in clutch when facing down a 6000 atk Arrival @Cybverse and a 5300 attack Accesscode.</li>  	<li>Opponents spend every single resource trying to out Boss Stage, often neglecting other things on your board, like your boss monsters, handtraps or facedown backrow. Use this psychological trick to your advantage! Opponents get so disheartened when you simply activate another Boss Stage to replace it.</li>  	<li>You can tribute your own Generaider monsters to activate their effects (novice players tend to forget this.) It's fine if you tribute them, you can just revive them next turn with Hela anyways.</li>  	<li>Summon Loptr with Generaider Boss Stage first to give all your Generaider monsters and tokens an attack boost. Opponents tend to attack the low ATK tokens since they're a weak point in your defense. Tribute them before they get a chance to!</li>  	<li>If one of your Generaider monsters get negated or rendered useless, you can tribute it with Loptr to summon another Generaider Boss from deck, giving you another form of interaction.</li>  	<li>Summon Loptr instead of Harr is kind of a greedy play if you have no form of negation on board (Like Crystal Wing/Solemns), since they can easily Nibiru you, Imperm/Veiler Loptr upon effect activation, etc. Keep this in mind when making your board!</li>  	<li>Be aware of being locked into WIND! If you have normal summoned Loptr after you summon Crystal Wing using Windwitches, you're locked into wind for the rest of the turn so you cannot summon light attribute Mardel to search out Boss Stage. If you intend to summon Accesscode using Halq, do not activate Glass Bell's effect after you summon her with Halq, since it locks you to wind rendering the combo line null and void.</li>  	<li>You can summon Ash (since it's a zombie) from the GY with Hela, which grants you access to Halq -&gt; Accesscode.</li> </ul> <span><strong>Concluding Commentary</strong></span>  Whether you go first or second, this deck consistently (thanks to Port of Prosperity) pumps out a board of Crystal Wing (monster negate). Harr (omni-negate), and Wind Pegasus in the GY (shuffle back opponent's card into deck upon card destruction). You often have set-solemns and hand traps like Ash/Gamma. Going second? No problemoooo, you have 15 handtraps you can jam into your deck since the two engines are so small! Your opponent's board is so weak you can easily set-up your bosses to outgrind and defeat your opponent with!  The gameplay is tempo based, where you go for 1 for 1 trades vs. your opponent until you come out on top because of Generaider Boss Stages sheer grind power and free resource generation every turn. Crystal Wing's monster negate, destruction protection, attack boosting ability is incredibly effective as well! It's not too complicated with it's combos which is perfect for duelists who just want to play Yugioh without worrying about messing up their complex combo/gameplay (like me lmao). I just hope this deck becomes a bit more affordable in the future, because Pot of Prosperity is incredibly expensive. I also like the concept of Bosses and Dragons, since I'm a big fan of RPGs like Dark Souls, Skyrim and Final Fantasy, and this deck brings it to life for me. All in all, this grindy control deck is very fun, refreshing and new! I hope you have as much fun as I do piloting this deck online or IRL.

They also like to link your opponents monsters away for your benefits for the best board breaking. Spells searches and the traps SS from GY or destroy 2 cards, no matter which way they are all good to use. Only 1 ""brick"" card in the archetype but the unchained monsters can special from hand or deck so its not too bad.  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>Why Blind 2nd?:</span></strong></span>  Because this deck can link your opponents monsters away that is a good start for disrupting your opponents monster and clearing there beat sticks easily. Also Kaiju monsters are very good as you can tribute your opponents monster to the link with your own Kaiju, this is an ideal ""combo"" unless they have multiple difficult to out monsters. Also this deck uses some special spice, Super Poly. This is even more helpful to remove difficult monsters and works wonders in this deck, although targets are few and far between. Handtraps are essential for going 2nd, this is completely upto you which you run and what you can afford, i personally like the 2 Ash + 2 Ghost belle but you can change these about to suit your needs. (i know the video shows 3 Ash but its still a deck that is evolving and changing based on the meta)  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Can this deck go first instead?:</strong></span>  Technically, Yes. you can change your side deck to run trap trick and cards that are better for going first like IDP and solemn cards, however i prefer going 2nd.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Deck Video:</strong></span>  <span><strong></strong></span>  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH7-2i-jAnI&amp;ab_channel=AstroKnightYGO</a>"

In MP2, use either your normal summon or your last Ojamatch to summon Ojama Red and special 4 other Ojamas from hand.  Once you have five monsters on board, you can summon Masquerena, Barricadeborg, then with the last Ojama turn it into Link Spider, link the Spider with the Barricadeborg into Verte Anaconda. Finally, link Masquerena with Anaconda for a 4300 Accesscode.  Since your grave has Barricadeborg, Verte and IP, special summon three DADs from hand and set Ojama Pajama to protect them ~11 times. Next turn, beat them down with Accesscode and triple DAD for game."

Since she is very casual (aka only likes this deck because she saw a melffy card) i tried to make it so it can protect itself a bit either from spells with Naturia Beast, from destruction with melffy hide and seek or if all goes wrong and the opponent attacks with a beefy monster then a Bye Bye damage should be a quick way to deal some damage at least.  It is also very simple since the biggest play is the monster destruction/spell trap removal with Kalantosa and use Obedience Schooled to make either Melffy Mommy and get the materials quick so every attack burns the opponent or make a synchro (Beast)  Again, not at all competitive, can get some surprise wins and could be a fun way to ge someone into the game"

The set up is quite simple All-Out Attack and Morphing jar 2... thats it any other critter you have on the field is a bonus. MJ2 Special summons a mon from your deck; A-OA forces every special summoned mon to flip into atk mode and declare an attack if possible. So long as you can keep hitting an MJ2 as one of your summons the loop continues indefinely and since everything that cannot be summoned is sent to the GY. it only takes a few hits of Morphing Jar (1) to destroy the rest of an opponents deck already near exausted from there use of cards like Desire and all their searching.  Destroy the field build the field then destroy it once more; thats what this deck is about at its core.

More friends on the field the greater t,Anzu=Tae was all about friendship; she herself was not much of a player so her decks were questionable at best. I am trying to correct this by showing a deck centered around swarming being enough even if the brute force is lacking.  Athena is the heart of the deck and its not easily gained; but once Big Sis Athena is on the field directing her Sisters in arms it all comes together. Athena's effect is that each summon of a fairy type causes 600 dam; once per turn she can tribute another fairy to summon a fairy from the GY. Fairy Archer is the best friend of Athena and she only shines when Athena is surrounded by many friends. Fairy archer is the other corner stone as she can inact some of the larger effect damage pushes in this deck. For each light fairy I think its 300 dam; she launches her Solar Ray some times but its only good for 600 per itself.  Once when using it against another of my decks I wanted to see how much effect damage was possible... well 6 light fairy times 900+ 2 or 3 summons for 600 each= 7200 damage and thats 1 Solar ray with all copies going its another 7200 more so unlikely as it is to pull off 10K+ effect damage is possible in one round; how much can you pull off?

The entire deck is a smoke screen so that you can set up for Chaos necromancer the entire time without being figured out. Then in one atk you end your foe.  The ""draw"" power in this deck exists and that is why Pashuul is in there. you give both to the opponent to draw 2 cards using that one Super Heavy Sam and then your foe has costly dead weight to use if they can otherwise they do not die in battle and inflict damage while in def.  The Sam strat is Benkai and Sword master based and simple drag other fields down to my level so I can bully them."

Exchange and Gift card and what not like that means I g,Do not worry this deck will provide enough bricks to build many a home; but this deck is about those times the stars align and your opponent is caught napping.  You see Black Garden ensures that monsters in the form of tokens can be summoned to your field as often as the other player wishes to provide them. and those tokens are both plant and Dark effect monsters. The majority of the deck is designed to defend and trade for better cards. But the side deck provides another strat where you can use some powerful fusions and make the other guy pay for summoning up a storm 300LP at a time with Coffin Seller.  Made for fun and slower games.

It is not intended for modern day play.,"This Deck is built to archive the old 2002 video game <em>Eternal Duelist Soul</em>. Deck #1 by SlimSleezy  <strong><a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier"">Black Luster Soldier</a></strong> deck revolves around trying to stall until you can pull out your <strong><a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier"">Black Luster Soldier</a></strong> through deck-searching. You do this primarily by using beat down 4 stars, or high defense stall monsters. In this case, this version of the deck is all traditional attack based monsters. However, you can get creative and add in high attack but improbable monsters that won't likely attack on their own, like <strong><a data-name=""Jirai Gumo"">Jirai Gumo</a> (</strong>2200ATK<strong>)</strong>, <strong><a data-name=""Dark Elf"">Dark Elf</a>(</strong>2000ATK<strong>)</strong>, and <strong><a data-name=""Panther Warrior"">Panther Warrior</a>(</strong>2000ATK<strong>)</strong>. Keep your high attack monsters on the field while working towards your win condition. You don't necessarily have to attack, in fact, while stalling it may be in your favor to reconsider playing too offensive without your trump card ready. You can experiment with having defense cards in your deck as well. However, the difference between having 2000 defense or 1900 attack is so little that it's worth being able to steadily beat down the enemy while you wait.  You look for your <strong><a data-name=""Black Luster Ritual"">Black Luster Ritual</a></strong> with <strong><a data-name=""Sonic Bird"">Sonic Bird</a></strong>, and you look for <strong><a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier"">Black Luster Soldier</a></strong> with <strong><a data-name=""Senju Of The Thousand Hands"">Senju Of The Thousand Hands</a></strong>.

However I can only recommend trying it against the other meta decks.  Also because of the new ruling with Sky Striker Ray working under Gozen Match and just because rivalry is a better card, I would change 2 gozen to 3 rivalry of the warlords.  Also if you have acess to any money stables like lightining storm I would recommend chaning the side deck accordingly.  I dont think there is much to say about the gameplan of the deck.

Your combo will start by trying to get 2 level 7 monsters on the board. This can be done with <a data-name=""Dark Magic Veil"">Dark Magic Veil</a> bringing out a level 7 from the GY, with <a data-name=""Magician's Souls"">Magician's Souls</a> special summoning a <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> from the GY, or with <a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Art"">Advanced Ritual Art</a> summoning <a data-name=""Magician of Chaos"">Magician of Chaos</a>. Once you have accomplished that, you can go into <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Arsenal Falcon"">Raidraptor - Arsenal Falcon</a>. Using Arsenal Falcon, you can special summon <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Tribute Lanius"">Raidraptor - Tribute Lanius</a>. Use Tribute Lanius to send <a data-name=""Raider's Wing"">Raider's Wing</a> to the GY. Detach one material from Arsenal Falcon and special summon <a data-name=""Raider's Wing"">Raider's Wing</a> from the GY, then link summon <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Wise Strix"">Raidraptor - Wise Strix</a> using Arsenal Falcon and Tribute Lanius. Special summon another copy of either Tribute Lanius or Raider's Wing from your deck and Xyz into <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Force Strix"">Raidraptor - Force Strix</a>. Using Force Strix's effect will allow you to add <a data-name=""Raidraptor -  Singing Lanius"">Raidraptor -  Singing Lanius</a> to your hand and set <a data-name=""Phantom Knight's Rank-Up-Magic Force"">Phantom Knight's Rank-Up-Magic Force</a> to your field. You can now sepical summon Singing Lanius and link away Wise Strix. Once you are done, use the Rank-Up-Magic to special summon Ultimate Falcon using Force Strix. Optimally, your end board is now Crusadia Astram + Ultimate Falcon with Dark Magician distruption during your opponents turn. </span>  <span>If you did not open a way to get 2 Level 7 monsters on the field, or you know your opponent can easily disrupt your path to ultimate falcon, you still have the Dark Magician path open.

The Synchro half is mostly about emptying the ED to fuel the Necomancer in the main deck; and Fenix is easy to summon with over a fourth of the deck dedicated to it.  Simply put you either get a play or the deck falls on its ass; it does not really have middle ground.

Her only attack deck is great at overwhelming opening hands when ,"Kodachi is what you might call a muscle brained and honest fool. She believes in one truth and one person and nothing else.  Yume is the person; and the truth is Atk is the only form of def that exists in a fight. So her decks contain weapons and those that wield them and going second is her only choice. Turn without a battle phase is a waste of time.  This deck is the version she starts with in my story. Harpy Girl and Souls of the forgotten are some of my signature cards with my characters if they have a purpose at all. Amulet of Ambitions turns my Lv 2 normys into dangerous threats against high level synchros or main deck monsters.  Benny is her ultimate atker as he gets one per equip on him his norm and a ""second"" with Twin swords meaning he can overcome a lot. one megamorph on a chainsaw is enough to overcome most threats.  remember with this deck attacking really is your only chance at preventing future threats so never hesitate."

More evil!!</b>  &nbsp;  <span>Good day ladies and gentlemen, today another remaster of another crazy inspiration I had months ago, but now totally (or almost) competitive . I present to you My Evil eye &amp; Evil★Twin deck!!</span>  &nbsp;  <b>How did this come to be?</b>  &nbsp;  <span>Think about, the main aggressive core of each archetype is fiend, Evil★Twin monster locks you on fiend type  from extra deck… was natural (at least for me) to use these two archetypes together like best friends, to become  the most evil deck of my house!!</span>  &nbsp;  <b>What is the point of playing this deck?</b>  &nbsp;  <span>If you like the gameplay of the Evil★Twin(summon one of lil-la or ki-sikil to summon one different of the one that you summon and go in the control aspect of this archetype) will love this deck, because Evil eye  is an extreme versatil and control deck as well . Serziel can seach   eye of selene and from there... mate... your opponent will be lucky if he’d have a chance to play . Now you can imagine how  these two engines would work together... Am I right?!!</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Downsides??</b>  &nbsp;  <span>This deck is to normal summon reliant, because  Serzie for some reason can only search Eye of selene if she  was normal summon , and guess what?</span> <span>The  </span><b>Live☆Twin </b><span> can only active their effect if you control no monster on the field, becmo a little incosist . To mitigate this effect, Secret password and  Live☆Twin Home will be yours bests friends . Why? Let’s found about!!</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Starter:</b>  &nbsp;  <b>3XSecret Password;   3xLive☆Twin Home;  1xTerraforming; 3xEvil Eye Domain - Pareidolia: </b><span>if for any reason your first hand  be at least on of this card, you will have a good live playing in this game . </span><b>Secret password</b><span> can search your </span><b>Live☆Twin Home </b><span>from then you will be able to summon  any </span><b>Live☆Twin </b><span> monster  without wasting your normal summon . From there if you have  </span><b>terraforming</b><span>  you can  bring </span><b>Evil Eye Domain - Pareidolia,</b><span> to finally use your normal summon and summon  </span><b>Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye, </b><span> to continue your play .  </span><b>Evil Eye Domain - Pareidolia </b><span> can also recover any of your Evil eye monsters from you GY if were pop up by effect( even yours effects) . The perfect hand would be at least one </span><b>Secret password</b><span>  and a terraforming .</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3 Live☆Twin Lil-la: </b><span> you can normal summon her and go in typical evil twin play with need . I recommend  bringing  </span><b>Live☆Twin Ki-sikil Frost</b><span>  with her toeffect, from then  draw a card with your opponent  try anything naughty .</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3 Live☆Twin Ki-sikil: </b><span>The same as Lil-la , you can bring </span><b>Live☆Twin Lil-la Treat </b><span> for later on .</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3 Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye: </b><span>Her effect while equipped with Eye of selene is… outrageous, use as a machine gun! </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Extenders!</b>  &nbsp;  <b>2 Live☆Twin Ki-sikil Frost 1 Live☆Twin Lil-la Treat:  </b><span> both can be summoned easily by their own effect (if you control the other live twin for exemple .</span>  &nbsp;  <b>2 Evil Eye Awakening:  </b><span> if you are low  in resource,  </span><b>Evil Eye Awakening </b><span> to revive any of your evil eye monsters or  if  you have Eye of selene on the field, you could even summon  Serziel or </span><b>Medusa, Watcher of the Evil Eye </b><span> to your field from  your deck .  Neat, isn’t it?</span>  &nbsp;  <b>1 Medusa, Watcher of the Evil Eye:  </b><span>to recover any evil eye’s spell from your grave .</span>  &nbsp;  <b>2 Evil Eye Reemergence: </b><span> this card can easily put a token (or 2 depending on Eye of selene) , on the field, helping even more the </span><b>Evil★Twin </b><span> link play , for example . It also provides a decent protection for your Evil eyes spell cards .  </span>  &nbsp;  <b>1 Monster Reborn: </b><span>Free summon from my Gy . You can even steal a dragoon!! Cheers! (Remember to  give back his/her card , you thief!)</span>  &nbsp;  <b>1 Knightmare Gryphon: Evil★Twin </b><span>best friend .

Slow and sturdy as a turtle.,Yume is my character and the best way to describe him is Sasquatch size. He is 8'5 and built like a football player. His strength is so great that he has a phobia about his own power.  This terror of letting lose has caused him to become one that does not fight back with his strength but rather have a never fall attitude and an indomitable spirit.  His deck is similar in that he takes hit after hit not going down.  So rocks and holding off until he can one shot with Megarock dragon.  This version is his deck before the story starts and he begins journeying trying to save mankind.
