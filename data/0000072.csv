Happ,"First off I'd like to congratulate Gabriel Netz for winning the WCQ Folkestone event. He played well and ran a rather <em>unusual </em>deck that seemed to work outstandingly well. The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch coming off the banlist was a huge and undoubtedly grave mistake on Konami's part - but hey, if more cool decks utilize it such as Lunalights for example - then who knows. Back to the subject at hand, for today's deck I have prepared a spicy and slightly different Train deck profile. I'd like to thank the man himself Thomas for managing to top with the deck despite one of its powerful engines being, to put it nicely, absolutely <em>slaughtered </em>by the banlist. My variation of the deck draws heavy inspiration from the deck itself - so there are a few similarities in that sense. Without further ado, here is my Choo Choo turbo deck:  Sky Striker was a very prominent engine in its prime time. Heck - Sky Striker Orcust made all of Top 8 at a YCS at one point. The reason it was so beneficial to <em>this</em> deck however, was the fact that it allowed a solid game plan going first - and opened up combos for OTK'ing turn 2. But, all is well as the deck has now been optimised to open your OTK no matter what the hand. To elaborate; Rank 10 Trains have always been able to break boards - but in today's newly developed meta, board breaking decks like Cyber Dragon have gotten a heavy boost. Many decks try to make a good board going first, allowing trains to establish enough damage for lethal almost every time. 42 cards may seem cloggy for a deck that wants to OTK, but since I run the Toon Package - the deck can technically be shortened to 39-38 cards. The toon package is also good for breaking boards. Many people usually set up an Apollousa in order to shut off monster effects. Since Megafleet isn't specific to just Cyber Dragon - you can use Toon Cyber Dragon to contact with use with an opponent's monster; giving you a free level 10 monster that can be used with Pegasus for your OTK, along with one your opponent's negates being gone. We also run Kaijus in this deck - meaning that if your opponent sets up a pesky monster that prevents you from summoning like Vanity's Fiend - you can simply get rid of it with a Jizukiru.  Other than that: the extra deck is pretty standard. The only thing that is set in stone are the Xyz ratios. Most of the link monsters are simply there to ensure your OTK: Pentestag, Underclock Taker, etc. A good card to consider running would be Landscaper Goldilocks. As of right now I can't really tell what the ratios or advantages of it are, but it is a free level 10 EARTH machine that allows you to nuke your opponent board.  In conclusion, I'd rate this a nice 8.4/10. It's very simple to pull off and doesn't take much skill - but can definitely pack-a-punch if needed. It's interesting to see if and how this deck will play in the upcoming format. It can be surprising at times - and is probably one of the first decks I know that can easily run a under 15 card extra deck and still top an event. Hopefully we'll see more decks like these come out on top - and hopefully our lord and savior Thomas will pull through and make a name for trains and rank 10's in general. It's definitely a surprise for your opponent when they see your deck - which can be helpful at times. The only things that are really holding this deck down, in my opinion, are stuff like going 1st and possibly wasting a handtrap on a card you don't know. Every deck has its flaws but I think that this build will surely see a lot more play to come in the future..."

First of all, this Deck can only uses his full combo potentioal when you go second.  Your main goal/stradegy with this deck is to wipe your opponents field with cards like Frightfur Tiger/Kraken, than summon Sabre-Tooth out of it, to finally hit your opponent with an full OTK combo.  Like for example, a good combo would be, to summon Kraken, destroy a monster, summon Sabre-Tooth out of it, special summon Kraken again, destroy another Monser if you will/need, use that one Sabre-Tooth to fusion another Sabre-Tooth out of it and than, for the finishing blow (when needed), summon a Frightfur Wolf with Frightfur Fusion with all the monster in your GY to let him attack multiple times, so that you opponet don't have a chance to survive this.

The main goal of the deck is to get out the three key players of the Extra Deck as quickly as possible: Aromaseraphy Jasmine, <span>Aromaseraphy Sweet Majoram, and Aromaseraphy Rosemary. We will go over the Main Deck, Extra Deck, and Side Deck to see what each card does and how this deck essentially works.</span>  <strong>MAIN DECK MONSTERS</strong>  <strong>Aromage Jasmine</strong>  One of the many Aromage Plant cards in this archetype, Jasmine serves as an important starter for the deck. Even with a measly 100 attack (ATK) points, this card's main strength is to get advantage from your LP gain. When you gain LP, Jasmine lets you draw a card, an instant +1 in hand advantage. Not just this, but you have more LP than the opponent, Jasmine allows an additional normal summon of a Plant monster for the turn, allowing you to pop off with their plays. We run three of Jasmine to make sure we can get as much card advantage as possible.  <strong>Aromage Laurier</strong>  Another important card that helps you gain advantage is Laurier. While you have more LP than the opponent, Laurier can Special Summon itself, a +1 in field presence. When it leaves the field, you gain 500 LP, which can trigger all Aromage monsters on the field, including Aromage Jasmine. We run this at three to get this advantage.  <strong><span>Aromaseraphy </span> Angelica </strong>  This is our turner for the deck. Unfortunately, nothing special happens when you summon this card; that is reserved for cards like Aromage Jasmine. So what do you do with this card? Simple. If you have an Aromage monster with ATK points in your Graveyard (GY), you can discard this card to gain LP equal to that monster's ATK. You can actually activate this card during your opponent's turn, so you can devastate your opponent with Aromages on your field. Not just this, but while it is in the GY, you can just bring it back to the field for free (while the you have higher LP and an Aromage on field). Sadly, it banishes itself from the field if you use this effect, so we run three. So, be efficient with your Angelicas! (We don't run Angelica at three because of this effect; it's a really good card. That's why.)  <strong>Aromage Rosemary/Aromage Majoram</strong>  This section covers two combo pieces. Essentially, these are the pawns of our deck, and the others are like rooks or bishops. First, Rosemary is not important for its effect but rather to special summon its Extra Deck counterpart, Aromaseraphy Rosemary.  Majoram is the same. One changes battle positions, and the other banishes cards from your opponents GY. Although Majoram has the better effect, it is a level 5. How unfortunate. Not much said can be said about these cards, so we run them at 1. Of course, we don't run them at 2 or 3 because we can run the risk of them getting banished. We are just that amazing.  <strong>Evil Thorn</strong>  Now we go to the staples of our deck. Yes, Jasmine is a good starter card, but Evil Thorn just trumps her in every aspect of the word. When it tributes itself, 300 LP are inflicted to your opponent. Already, you have higher LP than your opponent. The Aromage gods are pleased. Not just this, but you can Special Summon two copies of this card from your deck. You are now set up to Special Summon Aromaseraphy Jamsine. Congradulations. Always get to this card. It's a must. This card's only weakness is if you have two or three in your hand. Most unfortunate. Other than that, this card is the safe haven of the deck.  <strong>Lonefire Blossom</strong>  Lonefire Blossom, Tour Guide from the Underworld, and Deep Sea Diva. What do these three cards have in common? Exactly. They're generic. Lonefire Blossom is in a sense the king of Plant staples, aside from Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio. You get any Plant from your deck for free. Having three of this is undisputable.  <strong>Cactus Bouncer</strong>  This card is better for the middle or near end portion of the game when you have your board set up already. This card acts like a walking Vanity's Emptiness, only that it doesn't destroy itself when a card goes to the GY. This card is a one-of. Even if it's a great card that stops the opponent from Special Summoning, it doesn't make advantage. You can run two or three if you like, but one is a good number for this card to be at.  <strong>Glow-Up Bulb</strong>  The god of tuners. The OCG was right to ban this. It Special Summons itself from the GY by milling a card from the Main Deck! But we are not running Crystron Needlefiber in this deck, are we? No way. We are trying to keep this deck as fair as possible (aside from Cactus Bouncer and Naturia Beast). This is a one-of.  <strong>Spore</strong>  This is not as good as Glow-Up Bulb, but it Special Summons itself from the GY as well, just by banishing another Plant for the GY. We run this at one because of it's once per Duel effect and its sheer circumstantial use.  <strong>MAIN DECK SPELLS</strong>  <strong>Aroma Garden</strong>  Other than Laurier, these archetype based cards can help you gain LP for your Aromage cards to benefit from. One of these is Aroma Garden.  Not only do you gain 500 LP and have your Aromages gain 500 ATK/Defense (DEF), but whenever one of your Aromages is destroyed and sent to the GY, you gain 1000 LP. This is certainly a beneficial card and a three-of.  <strong>Aroma Gardening</strong>  This card is all not to different from Garden. You gain 1000 LP like Garden, but it's when you summon an Aroma monster. And even when your time seems dire and you can't seem to get going in your combo, Gardening protects you from a battle. When your opponent declares an attack while you have less LP, Gardening summons an Aroma from the Deck. The 1000 LP effect still triggers from this, making this a very useful card. A three-of is this card, too.  <strong>Cauldron of the Old Man</strong>  While not an Aroma card, this continuous Spell gives you 500 LP with every counter it has. As long as your opponent doesn't have something like Twin Twisters, you can keep this card on the field to gain as much LP as this card's counters can give. As for the burn effect, it doesn't exist. Just ignore it. We run this at three, but you can switch it for other cards if you want.  <strong>Super Solar Nutrient</strong>  Time for the spicy tech. Thanks to Duel Links, this card has become popularized for how it can be used to get Plant monsters, including Evil Thorn. THAT'S RIGHT! Just as long as you tribute a level (LVL) 1 or 2 Plant monster, like Aromage Jasmine, you can dig for any Plant monster whose level is less than or equal to the monster you tribute +3. This is a three-of. It is such an amazing tech card.  <strong>Called by the Grave</strong>  Now you listen to me. You, the player, are playing a combo deck. What does this mean? Any hand trap (that's a monster) can just ruin your combo in a heartbeat, like Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. How do we prevent this? Called by the Grave. This is at three for obvious reasons.  <strong>One for One/Terraforming/Monster Reborn</strong>  Three staples are here to fill in space. One for One gets Evil Thorn, Terraforming gets Garden, and Monster Reborn gets a monster from either player's GY. Plain and simple. Exchange these for other cards if you so please.  <strong>MAIN DECK TRAPS</strong>  <strong>Blessed Winds/Humid Winds</strong>  We run these two traps because they can be searched off of Aromaseraphy Sweet Majoram. We will get to her later. Blessed is the more important one, since you can send a plant from your hand/field to the GY  OR  shuffle a plant from your GY to the Deck to gain 500 LP  as well as  pay 1000 LP to Special Summon any Aroma from the GY to your side of the field. Humid searches an Aroma card for 1000 LP and gives you 500 LP if you are losing in the LP fight. We run these at 1. We don't run Dried Winds because that card is highly dependent and sucky.  <strong>EXTRA DECK</strong>  <strong>Aromaseraphy Jasmine</strong>  This is where the magic happens. Jasmine is truly our juggernaut of the deck, and possibly can be compared to Sweet Majoram in terms of awesomeness. After using Evil Thorn to summon this card, you have the power to protect your PLANT monsters as long as your LP are higher than your opponents. Not only this, but when you tribute a monster Jasmine points do, you can dig up for any Plant monster. Eat your heart out, Lonefire Blossom! Also, when you gain LP, search for a Plant monster. It's generic stature make this card a 2-3 of, but we run this at 3 to capture its full potential.  <strong>Aromaseraphy Sweet Majoram</strong>  This is possibly the heart and soul of the deck, other than Aromaseraphy Jasmine and Evil Thorn. When she is Synchro Summoned, you search Blessed or Humid (usually you want to get Blessed). If you have more LP, your opponent cant target your Plant monsters. If that isn't awesome enough, if you gain LP, you pop a card on your opponent's field. Simple, yet effective. Despite this card's awesomeness, we run two to leave room for generic synchro monsters.  <strong>Aromaseraphy Rosemary</strong>  Although not as profound as Sweet Majoram or Jasmine, Aromaseraphy Rosemary can still be effective by negating a face-up card when you gain LP. She also gives your Aroma monsters 500 ATK/DEF to make sure they are harder to beat in battle. With this, and the two other key players, you are bound to have a pretty strong board.  <strong>Generic Synchros/Links</strong>  The rest of the Extra Deck is filled with cards that don't really fit with our combo and just here because they are easy/beneficial to make. Since the effects and reasons for these cards are self-explanatory, they don't get their own section. They are just really effective and versatile cards that many people put in their decks as placeholders or offensive playmakers.  <strong>SIDE DECK</strong>  <strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>  Although a combo deck itself, Aromas might meet their match with another of their own, such as @Ignister or D/D/D. Nibiru is a three-of in the Side Deck to prevent these combo decks from getting a lot of advantage.  <strong>Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood</strong>  Some or many Aroma players have this card in the Main Deck, which is understandable. It fits with the Aroma gimmick. However, in many of my match-ups, this card just sits in my hand. I never really had a good time to activate its effect, but maybe I'm just bad at timing. You can play this card if you want, but I still am debating whether I should keep this card or not. We leave this card at three in the Side Deck for the time being.  <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>  This card is amazing to counter Stun and backrow heavy decks, such as Guru Control and Altergeists. Red Reboot going to one devastated me because I feared Altergeists moving to the meta and becoming competitive. I never have good match-ups with them, and I always get squashed. We have this card at three to counter these types of decks.  <strong>Twin Twisters</strong>  This is another card that destroys backrow decks or bait out counter traps, such as Salamangreat Roar. It also pitches a card that can float in the GY, like Glow-Up Bulb. I might move this to the Main Deck, but we leave this card at three in the Side Deck.  <strong>Infinite Impermanence </strong>  Say your opponent hits Infinite Impermanence on your Aromage Jasmine. Well I say fight fire with fire. This card will always be a good card going second, and we run this card at three in the Side Deck to commemorate its awesomeness.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

If you control <em>Weather Painter Cloud</em> when this effect happens, and you send canvases on the field to the grave; <em>you can immediately get those canvas' (or any other in your grave if you'd like) back</em> - <strong><em>making Souls a free +1 or +2 gain in card advantage</em>. </strong>  In addition to that, Souls can also help worse Painter hands by putting a free body onto the field, which in a pinch can be used to tribute for <em>Aurora</em> if you have no other better options available to get a Canvas on the field - or as link material for one of the <em>Topologics</em> or <em>Borrelsword</em>.  <em>Pot of Extravagance</em> is also there for additional draw power in cases where you don't see Souls. The two sometimes tend to clash since you can't use both in the same turn, but the extra boosted consistency you get is, in my opinion, worth it since chances are you may not see 1 of your 3 Souls in your opening hand. Or alternatively you can pitch the Extravagance with Souls when needed. Having both is nice, but if you had to choose one - Souls is by far the better singular option in this deck. Feel free to run 3 of whatever handtrap suits you if you'd like to replace Extravagance.  <em>Apprentice Illusion Magician</em> is the usual garnet. If drawn it serves the same purpose on field as souls for being potential tribute fodder for Aurora when need, or as link material.  The rest of the deck is pretty straightforward: <em>Imperial Order</em> shuts down spells, <em>Anti-Spell</em> for a pseudo Imperial Order (and can be used well in tandem with <em>Rain Canvas</em> for continued freezing of said spells), <em>Rivalry of Warlords</em> because other than Souls all the main deck monsters are Fairy (and works pretty dang well against decks with more than once monster type like <strong><em>Spyral</em></strong>), <em>Evenly Matched</em> because this deck can struggle against established boards going second, and <em>Skill Drain</em> because universal monster effect negation that rarely applies to yourself because Painters banish themselves for cost is very, very useful.  Side deck is pretty standard. <em>Niberu</em> and <em>Gadarla</em> for going second removal (any kaiju is fine, but I like it for dealing with the occasional anti-meta Barrior of the Storm Winds lockdown decks). Twin Twisters for backrow removal -Lightning Storm also works, but I'm not a fan of it's restrictions (or the price tag). <em>Drowning Mirror Force</em> for secondary removal since your painters banish for cost and can leave you open for direct attack a lot. <em>Aurora Pattern</em> works well against decks that like to do a lot of individual searching, and is highly searchable and accessible itself which means no more than 1 is needed. <em>Dimensional Fissure</em> and <em>Macro Cosmos</em> to prevent your opponent from abusing their graveyards. And <em>Unending Nightmare</em> as it's non once per turn face up backrow destruction works very well against control based decks - True Dracos and Altergeist especially."

Introduction</strong>  <strong>II. Strategy</strong>  <strong>III. Matchups</strong>  <strong>IV. Advices, grinding and so</strong>  <span><strong>I. Introduction</strong></span>  Wait, Pure Kaiju really exists? Well, if i´m making this of course they do, but... They work alone? Surprisingly yes, and very well to say the least, and you may be asking... How can someone be so cruel to make this kind of Deck? Well, me, and maybe you will want to try it you little sadist.  <span><strong>II. Strategy</strong></span>  Yes, i know the Introduction thing was pretty short but i don´t think this kind of Deck needs a long introduction, anyways, first of all, yes, the Deck has strategy, but not the kind of in-game strategy you may be thinking, , althrough it has a pretty simple PlayStyle (which isn´t the same thing as Strategy.) the part where it get complex is at the Mind Games, and no, tributing your opponent´s monsters can be annoying, but they can overrun you easily if you don´t intimidate them, how you do so? Well, playing Mind Games is hard, and even more when playing in Online, anyways, some basic examples of Mind Gaming is constantly checking your set cards, counting your opponent summon out loud and so on, also, and getting away from Mind Games this is the part where you just dump all the Strategy and Mind Games and have Luck, what i´m reffering to? I´m reffering to going first, you better hope you draw into Fairy Tail - Luna, Super Polymerization and/or some Handtraps, Luna can be a somewhat decent interruption during your opponent´s turn (Also remember to always activate Luna´s search effect to bait Ash, because her bounce effect can be Ashed since it sends from Deck to GY.) Super Polymerization explains by itself and Ash Blossom and/or Nibiru can win you certain Matchups, and talking about Matchups...  <span><strong>III. Matchups</strong></span>  Surprisingly enough, the Deck has a decent Matchup against a lot of Deck (Although is pretty obvious why...) It can also play around a lot of negates and Handtraps (Since most of them don´t hurt the Deck in any way.) also i´m gonna put Handtraps and some generic cards played in the format (Although they may be pretty outdated.) regardless this section is called <strong>Matchups </strong>and no <strong>Matchups and random cards</strong>...  Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - Use Luna´s first effect to bait Ash since Ashing Slumber can hurt you severely (Either it´s summon effect or it´s search effect (Although remember that if Slumber is negated you can activate another copy of it.).) Kyoutou, although a decent Ash bait you almost never get to activate it (I´m considering to cut it out entirely.)  D.D. Crow - Similar to Ash it stops Slumber effect (Although they have to chain it to Slumber being sent to GY and not his activation.) otherwise useless.  Effect Veiler/Infinite Impermanence - Since Denko Sekka and Luna are the only important Normal Summons (Since you almost never get to activate your Kaiju effects.) they normally get veilered/impermanenced , if you really need the Luna´s search effect (Although you normally don´t) you can Chain Block it with her own effect (Only works going second btw.) If you´re playing against some Set 6 pass Deck they will normally Veiler/Impermanence Sekka (Although Control/Stun Players have the magical ability called ""cartearse"" here in Argentina to always draw outs to Sekka if you draw her.) otherwise, also useless.  Evenly Matched - Since the only out to Evenly is Red Reboot (Which got limited for some reason...) You need to be very careful with all your Sets, if you´re unlucky and have to choose between Luna and Super Poly always choose Super Poly (Unless your current Matchup is Super Poly inmune) but normally if they´re Anti-Super Poly they´re extremely Normal Summon dependant (Doesn´t apply to Dracos  or Pendulums btw.)  Some other cards that my annoy you are Lancea, Droll &amp; Lock Bird and similar cards, anyways and going with Matchups...  Subterror - Kaiju Guru, also you´re Floodgate inmune since TCBOO doesn´t affect you at all (And you can only have 1 Kaiju in the field at the time.) The Solemn Package becomes pretty useless after you get your Kaiju, Subterror Clash Battle can annoy you a bit with all the flipping and that but Jizukiru and/or Thunder King can take care of that.  Altergeist - A pretty hard Matchup (And pretty prominent sadly.) If you are unlucky enough to play against this Deck you will need to remove their Multifaker and/or Meluseek as fast as possible since Meluseek can become a horrible problem by herself, the best thing you can do is try to Outgrind them (Although that is pretty hard by itself.) or Run a lot (A lot.) of Spell/Trap removal, they will also force you to go first if you get to win the first game and the Side Deck has few to zero outs to their field (The deck was pretty rushed so the Side Deck can be pretty wonky.)  SPYRAL - Just like almost all combo wombo Decks it is extremely vulnerable to your Kaijus, i mean, if you get to draw into Jizukiru or Thunder King you only need to Kaiju Sleeper (Since it can´t be destroyed by card effects when equipped with GEAR (Forgot his name :p.).) if you don´t, you Kaiju Sleeper (Again) and Slumber them, from there they will have almost no recovery options, When they force you to go first just side all your Sekka´s copies off and all your Nibiru copies in, some Anti-SPYRAL techs should do the job.  Lunalight Time Thief - IDK if this is considered a Tier 1 Deck but i´ll put it here regardless, It´s pretty funny when in Game 1 your opponent makes Dweller and they activate his effect only to get Kaijued a few second later, Imperial Order isn´t <strong>that</strong> of a threat to this Deck at all and Nightmare can be easily run over, IDK if most Lunalight Time Thief End Boards have Spell/Trap negation at all (From my experience they usually don´t.) but if they don´t just Slumber they away (Obviously i´m talking as if you had it, you aren´t gonna draw it every single game.) as almost every Deck in this list they will make you go First in second Duel, also from my experience if you activate Luna´s effect when they summon Kaleido Chick it will hinder them for the rest of the turn<a data-name=""."">.</a>  Salamangreat - Another somewhat easy Matchup for you, since their End Boards have become a lot weaker since Miragestallio ban you can easily disrupt them going First or Second, Luna (Yes, i´m mentioning this card in almost all Matchups advices but is in fact your only decent Normal Summon.) can bounce whatever they Summon and leave them with an open field (Fun Fact: Luna´s effect isn´t HOPT.) Cosmic Cyclone Salamangreat Sanctuary and hinder they grind ability a lot, (Always save Ash for Gazelle, his Lavalval Chain style effect is more important than ever.) If you ask me, i don´t think Salamangreats will be the Tier 1 that won almost all Continentals ever again.  Orcust - Are Orcust still META? Well, i don´t know, but they´re still as annoying as they were Pre-Banlist, as you can´t really Outgrind them (Since the Deck doesn´t have an actual Grind.) you will need to hinder their plays to a level where they can´t play anymore, try to banish Knightmare/Golem (You might wanna add D.D. Crow for this) and/or Ash Recycler (Ogre on Scrap Wyvern helps a lot.)  True Draco - As well as Orcust, they received big hits but are still alive, they´re one of the easiest Matchups since most of their Floodgates don´t work on you and their access to most of these is really limited now, and luckily it doesn´t matter what version of Draco they´re playing, if you duel Draco Hakai/Unchained just ""outgrind"" them until they burn out all of their Unchained, after that is just a matter of time, if they play Pure Dracos then do the same and wait until they burn all of their Spell/Traps and since you don´t normally activate effects they don´t get to search almost anything at all.  Pendulums - For this Matchup you will want to Side out Sekka, hope you draw into Super Poly or some Kaijus, Luna can get rid of Jackal King (IDK if he negated Monster Effects or it was Mighty Master or if you couldn´t target it at all.)  <span><strong>IV. Advices, grinding and so</strong></span>  The other part was long uh? Well, i though it was necessary (Also i love writing :v.) finally, lets talk about the Deck ""Grind"" game, but you may be thinking... Why grind in quotes? Well, if you playtest the Deck a bit you will understand that it only gives you the sensation of grinding, why? Well, it burns resources <strong>so</strong> slowly that it seems like a White Star, it burns so slowly that it seems that will never burn out, and in fact, is pretty hard to run out of Kaijus, but in reality, you never get to recycle your Kaijus (And Luna´s effect is looping, not recycling.) If you get a card that can recycle the Kaijus (Gonna add Pot of Avarice later.) then it will help a lot! And talking about advices...  Always end your turn with atleast 1 card in your hand, why? When your opponent knows that he is playing against a Pure Kaiju Deck they will go and try to OTK you, because although it seems logical to say that Kaijus are the Boss Monsters, the true Boss is fear, the fact that whatever board they make (Unless they end on Diabolos.) will get tributed will make them go for and OTK (Sorry for repeating what i say.) burning their resources to avoid the Kaijus, in fact, you should use that for your advantage, if they try to kill you and don´t accomplish that they will have a lot of cards in their GY, slowly grinding them out for what they have left.  That sums all things you should know about this deck, and although they were only 2 advices i couldn´t think in any more of then.  PD: Sorry if i have bad English, i´m not a native speaker."

Record ratio of this competitve deck.  -Salamangreat: 2 Wins/2 Losses (Debatable) -Thunder Dragons: 3 Wins (Beaten/or Surrender) -Altergeist: 4 Wins (Beaten) -DANGER!: 3 Wins (Beaten/or Surrender) -Trickstar: 3 Wins (Surrender) -SPYRALS: 3 Wins (Surrender) -Exodia Stall: 2 Wins (Surrender) -Chain Burn Stall: 4 Wins (Surrender) -Darklords: 2 Wins (Surrender) -Blackwings: 3 Wins (Surrender) -Blue Eyes: 2 Wins (Beaten) -Orcust: 5 Wins (Beaten/or Surrender) -Red Eyes/Dragun: 4 Wins (Beaten/or Surrender) -Dinos: 2 Wins (Surrender) -Cyber Dragons: 2 Wins (Beaten/or Surrender) -Zombie World: 3 Wins (Surrender) -Destiny/Elemental/Masked Heroes: 6 Wins (Surrender) -Sky Strikers: N/A (Has Not Dueled Yet) -Other: 25 Wins (Beaten/or Surrender)  The strategy set-up is easy and simple to understand. Dont need to break it down. Thoroughly I been testing it out and made this deck competitive enough to be played in the metagame. Do not switch out anything unless its for an alternative/replacement tech.  TECH: Shared Ride can replace Soul Servant. Magician Navigation could replace Illusion Magic but I would not recommend it. Super Polymerization could/can replace Timaeus, depending on your preference choice. Crack down could be replaced by Brain Control but its not needed in my honest opinion. Solemn Judgment could be replaced with any negate cards of your preference choice.  SIDE NOTE: DECK CAN COMPETE AND THIS IS BASICALLY A REUPLOAD BUT UPDATED WITH BETTER CARDS. IT HAS NOT OFFICIALLY LOST TO ANY DECK YET AS OF LATE WHILE STILL TRYING OUT NEWER TECHS/CARDS FOR IT CURRENTLY. THE DECKLIST MAY CHANGE IF I FEEL THE NEED TO IF ITS LOSES WAY TOO MANY TIME AND/OR IT'S CARDS ARE GETTING OUTPACED. THANK YOU! ENJOY! #DM2020 #TIERDECK"

This deck can also abuse Super Polymerization, which makes it better against aggro decks, it also uses Instant Fusion as a enabler for a quick Dragostapelia.  There is an easy combo that starts with only one Ophrys Scorpio and another monster on hand, which leads to Winda Lock, Special Darlingtonia via Ophrys, add Instant Fusion, make Cherubini, then go for Winda via Instant Fusion.  The Predaplant core itself is kinda heavy but Consistent, with 3 Ophrys and 3 Lonefire you have a Consistency ratio of around 55%, not counting the triple Predapractice.

A single Union Hangar can easily be a board with ABC + Infinity. Super cons","Both Cyber Dragon and ABC parts are light machine, with the new card Malefactors' Command, you can extend to ABC from Cyber Dragon starter while maintaining consistent summoning of Cyber Dragon Infinity. Not only that, thanks to Union Driver, now you can turn one Union Hangar into ABC + Infinity (only works in MR5, TCG will be in MR5 once we got all the cards). I will explain the Hangar route.  Activate Hangar, add A or B, normal summon A/B, equip Driver via Hangar, use Driver equip A/B (you need both A &amp; B on the field), ss the equip, link off both to Union Carrier, use B search C, use A recycle B (now you have 2 light machine in hand, B &amp; C), use Carrier equip Photon Orbital, use Orbital search Galaxy Soldier, ss Soldier using B/C as fodder, search another Soldier using previous one, ss second Soldier using B/C as fodder, now you have 2 lv5 + Carrier + ABC parts in GY just from one Hangar.  Other route is using Malefactor if you dont have Hangar but it needs more extender/fodder and also needs practice how to get the most advantage of it. In summary, your best card is Hangar followed by A/B + Malefactor. The Cyber Dragon lineup is just for contact fusing or extender/fodder.  Card to think of: Gizmek Yata (great lv 5 light machine extender, but limits you from summoning other type), Gold/Silver Gadget (great for link/rank4 play, but fragile with Impermanence/Veiler), Transmodify (good card esp with Gizmek Yata, but eats too much resource and space in the deck), Danger! (easy Union Carrier and increasing consistency, but still a gamble and the monster is not light machine for Malefactor or Soldier fodder), Pot of Avarice (great card, but dead in early turn).  Pros: Super consistent with Infinity negation and ABC disruption/recurrence with minimal resource makes it arguably tied with Salamangreat, can run multiple handtraps/removals.  Cons: Nibiru, Dark Ruler No More, Megafleet, and etc are a scary threat, Hangar combo doesnt work in MR4.  PS: Union Hangar combo thanks to <span class=""username-2b1r56 username-3gJmXY"">Nighthawk</span><span class=""discriminator-xUhQkU"">#5409 @Discord </span>"

One with the power to rival the Egyptian Gods themselves.,"<span>A friend of mine wanted to try and get back into the game and wanted to play ancient gears, so I started trying to build a list for him. This is what I have found to be the most effective 40 card deck in my time testing. This is not designed to be a competitive deck, but is rather meant to be fun at a casual level and fun to play.</span>  <span>This deck, much like other OTK decks, is designed to go second. The goal of the deck is to get out Chaos Ancient Gear Giant, or Megaton Ancient Gear Golem, as quick as possible.</span>  <span>This is the most optimal hand for going First or Second. Depending on which will change some things</span> <ul>  	<li><span>If you start with one Gadget + Anchor Drill + Wyvern</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Normal Summon Gadget (either one works) -&gt; Special Summon Anchor Drill -&gt; Special summon Wyvern -&gt; Search -&gt;</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Search Fortress -&gt; Activate Fortress -&gt; Link 2 (Anchor Drill + Wyvern) -&gt; Ballistic Shooter -&gt; Search -&gt;</span> <ul>  	<li><span> Search Geartown -&gt; Activate Gear Town -&gt; Effect of Ballistic Shooter (Your opponent must control a face up monster that can be targeted by monsters) -&gt; Pop Geartown -&gt; Special Summon from deck -&gt;</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Special Summon Reactor Dragon</span> <ul>  	<li><span>End of chain</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Special Summon Hunting Hound -&gt; Effect of Hunting Hound -&gt; Fusion Summon -&gt;</span> <ul>  	<li><span>If you went first Fusion Summon Megaton</span> <ul>  	<li><span>End of chain</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>if you went second Fusion Summon Chaos Giant</span> <ul>  	<li><span>End of Chain</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Special Summon Gear Frame -&gt; Discard 1 Card to Search -&gt;</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Search Ancient Gear Golem -&gt; Surrender because you misclicked </span></li>  	<li><span> Search Ancient Gear Fusion -&gt; Fusion Summon if you have stuff in hand</span> <ul>  	<li><span>End of Chain</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <span> </span>  <span>Why is X Card Run At X Number:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Super Express Bullet Train - He is a free summon that lets you recover one card from your graveyard at the end of your turn, which has the ability to trigger the effect of box giving you free access to one of your infinitrack monsters for graveyard set up. You can link him away for Ballistic Shooter or Platinum Gadget if you need more gears.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2 because it can brick if you have nothing to summon, or only have gadgets.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon - Big boy that can be special summoned</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 2 because the only reason to summon him is because you want to special summon a bigger fusion, or for discard fodder for Gear Frame. He tends to brick a bit so it may be better to take him down to one.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Golem - You need him for some of the fusions and if you manage to tribute summon him using (weather through Urgent Schedule or the effect of Geartown to make it one tribute) you can fusion summon from your deck using Ancient Gear Fusion.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 2 since he can be used as discard fodder for Gear Frame or if you get to summon him off the effect of Howitzer or Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Tunneller - Pot of Avarice is at one and this guy is searchable.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run two, but three could also be good if you don't want to run Trencher. He can be summoned by sending an earth machine monster you control (which is almost anything that isn't in the extra deck or a gadget) that can be sent to the graveyard as link fodder for either Ballistic Shooter or Platinum Gadget for free summons/ searches. You can then use him to recycle your graveyard full of fusion materials then draw cards which can give you that one card you need to win.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Trencher - He is another target for Box and if he is in the grave you can summon back Anchor Drill for a free summon from the hand.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 1. You only want to see him when he is needed, plus he is searchable off box or you can summon him with Urgent Schedule with Anchor Drill to conserve your normal summon.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Anchor Drill - Free summon if he is normal or special summoned.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 3. Earth machine that lets you special summon another earth machine (Of any level) which can be used for link fodder for Ballistic Shooter or Platinum Gadget. He is also searchable off of Box and can be brought out with Urgent Schedule.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Wyvern - The one that searches.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 3. While you have to put in a little work to summon him, he gives you free access to any card you could possibly want that has to do with the archetype aside from Geartown. He searches box which lets him search for anything that isn't a spell or Gadget. He also gets around monster effects to beat over Eater Of Millions. He can be summoned off of Urgent Scedule as well. You can't go wrong with this card. Just avoid using your normal summon on him if you can as there are better options for that.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Gold + Silver Gadget - Free summon of another level 4 or lower monster in your hand.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2 of each. It hurts to see any more than 2 of them at any given time. They aren't earth which prevents them from being usable with Urgent Schedule and can't be summoned off of Anchor Drill. They require your normal summon to use them at all. But they can help with starting off your plays and can be somewhat annoying to your opponent if they try to run them over, only to be walled by a never ending waterfall of gears. Be careful about timing though for their effects.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Frame - Search the brick or the fusion spell</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2, may bump down to 1. He is searchable off of Box and lets you search the fusion spell while setting up your graveyard. The problem is there isn't an easy way to get him on the board without popping Geartown or Fortress. He is also another Ancient Gear monster that can be used as fusion material. He can also search the Golem. If you are unable to afford Ancient Gear Fusion then only run 1.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Box - Searchable searcher that searches when searched</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 2 or 3. I thought he would be a brick at first, but he ended up being way better than I thought he would be. While you do need to use the effect of Wyvern or Ballistic Shooter he more than makes up for it by letting you search out Tunneller, Trencher, Anchor Drill, or Gear Frame. This gives you easy access to the Infinitrack cards whenever you need. He is also discard fodder for Gear Frame, and is a free summon for the Lv 5 Infinitrack monsters in a pinch or for the link summon of Ballistic Shooter and Platinum Gadget.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Hunting Hound - The one that lets you play around Anti-Spell Fragrance</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2, run more or less as needed. While he can be used to cowboy for game in time. What he is really great for is allowing you to get around things that would stop you from fusion summoning. Needs to be on the field to use this effect, but there are a good amount of ways to do that without normal summoning. </span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Overload Fusion - Summons the boss monster or the one that burns for 1000</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2. It's a good card that can be great in a pinch. Fusion summoning from your graveyard is always great. While this card is strong, you need to save it for the final push. If you use it too early then you could empty out your graveyard of Ancient Gear Monsters preventing you from using the effect of Tunneller. It also only lets you summon dark machine fusion monsters which limits you to only Chaos Giant and Howitzer.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Iron Draw - Pot of greed with restrictions</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. It is really situational, but it can help near the end of the turn when you get out the fusion and link monster of your choice. It can let you get more spell cards ready for next turn.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Catapult - Galaxy Cyclone but only on face up cards you control that lets you summon any Ancient gear, then lets you do the same again but summon a token instead.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. This card is great if you have the targets right away. This card can only be used if you control no monsters and requires you to destroy a face up card you control (Geartown or Fortress) then summon ANY Ancient Gear monster. Including Golem. If used on Geartown or Fortress this is two free summons. It also has a graveyard effect that lets you banish it to pop a face up card you control (Geartown or Fortress) to summon a token. If used on Geartown or Fortress it's a free summon and a token that is an earth machine. The problem is you need to have no monsters and one of those two cards already on the board. It has its benefits but is too hard to use.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Fusion - It's like Polymerization but more expensive</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Use any number you want. It's an archetype fusion spell that is searchable from Wyvern and Gear Frame. It has a neat effect if you can get out Ancient Gear Golem, but if you are confident enough to normal summon Ancient Gear Golem you won't even need to fusion summon. It without a doubt is a great inclusion, but don't worry if you can't afford it.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Terraforming - Its a 3rd Geartown that makes this essentially a 39 card deck.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 1 because that's the law. It makes Geartown even more searchable and is deck thinning.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Urgent Schedule - This card is only really usable going second. But it can save you easily.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 3 because 4 is illegal. This is a free two monster from your deck that doesn't require a normal summon. Plus if it is destroyed while face down you get to  search Super Express Bullet Train. How I would recommend to use it would be: </span> <ul>  	<li><span>For the level 4 or lower summon any of the earth monsters. It really doesn't matter which so long as you leave Box in the deck. I would most likely summon Wyvern. But be careful not to activate its effect as it is a hard once per turn</span></li>  	<li><span>For the level 5 or higher depends a lot on the current game state. If you have one card you want in your graveyard such as Box or Wyvern summon Super Express Bullet Train to return it to the had at the end of the turn he was sent there. Want to recover your extra deck or main deck, summon Tunneller for a pot of avarice in the graveyard. Want one more ancient gear for a fusion summon, use Reactor Dragon.</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Fortress - They can't Super Poly you now.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 3. It protects your Ancient Gear monsters from being targeted or destroyed by card effects. Most Ancient Gear monsters already have some sort of protection from spell and traps that is only limited to the battle phase, but this turns your Boss monsters into nearly impenetrable walls. This card can also be popped in order to summon an ancient gear from your hand or graveyard allowing you to search with Wyvern without using your normal summon.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Geartown - The field spell</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2. This card lest you summon Ancient Gear Monsters for one less tribute. This means you only need one monster to perish so you can summon the Golem. The real reason you run it is to pop it with cards like Ballistic Shooter or Ancient Gear Catapult in order to summon any Ancient Gear monster from your deck, except Golem. This allows you to get a free search off Wyvern while conserving your normal summon, or to get Gear Frame on board to get the fusion spell. While you could run more, I prefer to run deck thinning options like Terraforming in order to keep this deck to 40 cards. Plus being searchable by the the link monster makes it so I almost never need to see it in my opening hand.</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <span> </span>  <span>Extra Deck Monsters:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Barricadeborg Blocker - Retrieve your cards.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. He lets you recover Geartown or Fortress from your graveyard. Just remember he does this at the end of the turn.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Ballistic Shooter - The link that searches the field spell and more</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run at least 2. He can be summoned using any of the Ancient Gear or Infinitrack monsters. Its weird arrows also allow you to summon this to the zone a link monster points to and still have 2 extra monster zones. He also has the ability to search any Ancient Gear card or Geartown, making him already more useful than Wyvern. On top of this you can pop a face up spell /trap card you control (Geartown or Fortress) in order to make the attack and defense of one of your opponent's monsters become 0 allowing you to pierce with some of the fusions such as Chaos Giant massive damage. You can run more if you want, but I never needed him more than 2 times a game.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Platinum Gadget - Hate to leave him on board but he is nice to have.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. The Gadgets have a problem of getting stuck in my hand or on the field, and he is an easy way to solve both problems. He lets you summon a Lv 4 or lower machine monster from your hand letting you summon another Gadget for even more special summons. Him only requiring 2 machine monsters to summon means you can get rid of any gadgets stuck on your board. It also floats into more Gadgets if you hate yourself or your opponent allowing you to survive a full Valkyrie board.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Phoenix and Unicorn - If you don't use these you are in for a Knightmare.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>1 of each. Unicorn is a spin and Phoenix can get rid of spell and traps. They have generic summoning requirements letting you get rid of your gadgets.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Gear Gigant X - Rank 4 machine</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. It searches level 4 or lower machines while setting up the graveyard. This allows you to use the effect of Box. He is also an earth machine allowing you to summon Ballistic Shooter or the Lv 5 Infinitrack monsters.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Cyber Dragon Nova - The thing that you use to summon Cyber Dragon Infinity</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. It lets you summon Cyber Dragon Infinity. Plus if your opponent forgets what it does you can summon Chaos Giant for free.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Cyber Dragon Infinity - Its a machine deck that runs Lv 5 monsters</span> <ul>  	<li><span>It's a machine deck that runs Lv 5 monsters. Omni-negate + absorbing monsters is too good not to run.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Howitzer - Just burn your opponent and they won't read it.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2. It's by far the easiest of the Ancient Gear fusion monsters to summon, it burns for 1000 points, and if your opponent doesn't read it they will just crash into it allowing you to summon any Ancient Gear from your deck. This includes Golem as its effect bypasses the summoning requirement.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Megaton Ancient Gear Golem - Howitzer but for card effects.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. This has the summoning requirement of only 3 Ancient Gear monsters and has a 3300 body. If you use your two Golems it will be able to attack 2 times during the battle phase. On top of this it has the outstanding ability to summon Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem when it leaves the field because of an opponent's card effect. With its massive body most players will try to remove it using a Unicorn, or will find some way to banish it. A fun combo with this is to have a Megaton Golem on your field at the end of your turn while you have Fortress on your field and watch as your opponent spins it with Unicorn only to be surprised by a 4400 untargetable wall that is Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem staring them down.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem - Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon but for Ancient Gear Golem.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. As stated earlier you can easily summon this off the effect of Megaton. Its summoning requirement just requires that you have one Ancient Gear Golem and two other Ancient Gear monsters making it only slightly harder to get out than Megaton. It does piercing and prevents battle spells/traps. Not to mention the fact that it floats into an Ancient Gear Golem so long as it is destroyed.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Chaos Ancient Gear Giant - It's like Ultimate Conductor Tyranno but a machine</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2. He is the big daddy of the deck. His massive 4500 make most decks struggle to even touch him. He does piercing making you think twice about summoning monsters in defense mode. On top of all this, he can attack all of your opponent's monsters. While he is hard to get out you can use cards there are plenty of ways to search out Ancient Gear monsters to use as fodder for him using cards like Box and Wyvern it's not too hard to get them in hand where you can use the fusion spell or Hunting Hound to summon him. He is also dark allowing you to summon him with Overload Fusion. He even stops your opponent's monster effects during the battle phase, meaning no worrying about Shaddolls. </span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <span> </span>  <span>Cheaper Alternatives For Cards:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Fusion - You can always run polymerization instead. If you do this then you may want to take out or at least reduce the amount of Gear Frames to 1 since they will only search for a brick.</span></li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Ballistic Shooter - You can try running more copies of Gear Gigant X or Platinum Gadget, but you should still run at least one copy of him.</span></li> </ul> <span> </span>  <span>Other Fun Fun Cards To Try:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Limiter Removal - Make number bigger.</span></li>  	<li><span>True King Of All Calamities - You already have Infinitrack cards to do it, so it could be fun to try out.</span></li> </ul> <span> </span>  <span>Improvements To Make:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Add some hand traps to prevent cards like Droll or Ash from ending your turn right away.</span></li>  	<li><span>Run cards to disrupt the opponent rather than just furthering your own plays.</span></li>  	<li><span>Find more earth machine support to mess around with. I toyed with Deskbots but gave up a little quick on them.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Side deck contains some fun cards, or replacements for expensive ones."

Now with the new support it can be pretty annoying.  This deck is pretty consistent and can put down a few negates first turn and can easily OTK going second. Also lot of hand traps so you can negate stuff going second. It works better for MR2020 but in this format is also works really well.  I recommend switching Borreload for Apollousa if you have one, but I don't :("

Most of the monsters have the ability to bring themselves or other monsters back from the graveyard creating recurring nightmares for the opponent. The Spirit of the Pharoh is great for hoarding the field with Xyz material and necro fusion is great to get Sea Monster of Theseus out to make synchro summoning much easier. The deck is designed to move quickly and spread the zombie sickness until the opponent joins the hoard!

GOAT Format focuses on a slow, older style of play: using pre-errata and","Okay. This is hilariously fun. I am <em>obviously</em> not a GOAT format player - to clarify - but going back to how older yugioh was played is quite refreshing to say the least. Most turns consists of set 3 pass - and non-archetypal flipping decks were actually a valid thing. It was also really fun seeing old cards back in play - and realising how broken they truly are as well as why they are never coming back. It is definitely engaging and allows you to see how yugioh was back in the day were your whole deck was one-of's. So with me and my fangirling out the way: here's a not-so-brief layout on everything you need to know about this deck - with a few extra steps in between.  So the way GOAT works is rather different to modern day yugioh. There are two different sides to the game-style: Pre-Exarion and Post-Exarion. This literally means if a deck was made before or after the release of Exarion Universe. The deck I've created is definitely one of - if not the most - popular Pre-Exarion lists there are. Goat Control is a fun way of abusing the old banlist to its fullest and manipulating Relinquished as well as Metamorphosis in order to keep card advantage above your opponent. This is shown in the rather strange extra deck - consisting of random level targets - used in order to get more powerful monsters on board. Jinzo was a card heavily played at the time, that's why I have Last Warrior to go along with Snatch Steal. Once he hits the board its basically GG.  A good two card combo for this deck is Magician of Faith and Delinquent Duo. If you open these two cards you can quickly hand loop your opponent for 4 without using any resources. Its pretty efficient and tends to win you games straight off. This isn't to mention that you can also open Tsukuyomi to once again hand loop your opponent for another two next turn again. This combo is pretty efficient and actually quite awesome if you pull it off. Other than that the main strategy is to obviously abuse Relinquished as much as possible and keep. On. Sucking....no homo. Manju of the Ten Thousand hands is a good way of enabling this - as its fearful 1400 attack plays well with his search effect. Black Luster Soldier is also a powerhouse to play through. If you manage to drop him and you're coincidentally playing the right match-up, its simply game over from there. This deck can truly break boards like its nothing.  For today - we're completely disregarding the natural way of things. Overall: GOAT Format is a good hard 9.7/10. I've seen some shade being thrown at the community - similar to Genwunners in Pokemon - but I think the playerbase is being slightly disregarded as of late. In my opinion, they aren't as irritating as people may think and are pretty generic. They're just like regular players - but towards a less fast-paced gamemode. The format and rules themselves are both unique and refreshing, allowing you to revisit your past and play yugioh how it once was - slow. It's a cool way of relaxing, and sitting back from your usual 5 minute spyral combos as a means of relaxing your mind and doing the thing you love (obviously being ̶s̶u̶c̶k̶i̶n̶g̶  playing yugioh). While probably not anytime soon, I'll definitely revisit this format on my page and try to do something different with it. For now though, this is what I got..."

The strategy for this deck is to get the cry havoc and heart of the underdog combo, how you do this is using the spell cards I put in and cat of ill omen. one you get this combo out you can fill your side of the field with red dragon synchro monsters. You do this by drawing a normal monster which is the only type of monster in the deck, then you start constantly drawing cards until you get a spell or trap card. With cry of havoc you can banish a card to special summon a monster, when your monster is in the graveyard you can start the loop by banishing a card to summon another card then normal summon another monster after that synchro summon your first monster to special summon 2 more monsters which then you use to synchro summon another and so forth. By the time your done with your summonings you should have your boss card out which should be the strongest monster and then gg."

Interrupted Kaiju Slumber can be used to give you a strong Kaiju while giving your opponent a weaker one, while also destroying your Unchained monsters and summoning more of them from the deck.  &nbsp;  After doing the above combo, you can summon Unchained Soul of Disaster or Rage, and use their effects to get rid of the opponent's Kaiju and do a Link Summon. I just named this deck ""GODZIRRA!"" because I could not think of any better names. If anyone here has better ideas on what to name this deck, let me know in the comments."

Set up insane Orcust boards - without harp horror - and enjoy t","Is Orcust truly gone? No. Will it be meta? Probably not. With the recent-ish banlist hitting and effectively slaughtering most meta decks - people have had to adapt and change their playstyle in order to still be able to deal out powerful blows. Orcust were one of the decks that got hit pretty badly - with their main combo starter being straight up banned. However, many people have found that with the new Rank-Up-Magic spell being unbanned - you can quite simply and easily make True King of All Calamities. With a little tweaking the deck can be good as new - so that's why I present; RUM Orcust..  To start off our deck analysis: we will split the three engines so that we get a better understanding of the different combos in place. The first engine - or set of cards rather -  is obviously the Orcust package. Our main opener has now become Knightmare and World Wand meaning you want to resolve them as much as possible. I've included Gizmek Orochi and the two Dark Warriors into this category as they are there to start up your orcust cards. Next, we run a rather decent Danger! engine. You obviously want to run the classic Nessie, Jackalope and Tsuchinoko - however I also run two Mothman and one Chupacabra for consistency and bodies on board. They help out well with discarding your unwanted cards and freeing up your hand. Finally I run the Scrap and Co. engine. The reason I run it is clearly pitching - but it can also end you on a Galatea + full combo for an added disruption if you somehow can't make Calamities. Since Harp Horror has been sent to the shadow realm, you now run O-Lion and Jet Synchron as your targets for making Scrap Wyvern. You do run the extra Garnets on the side - them of course being Scrap Golem and Silent Boots - but that's why the Dangers! are there.  The main concept is getting Dingirsu and Cymbal Skeleton in grave - and making Cherubini. This is made simpler with the Danger! engine and the Scrap engine as they both have many level 3's that you could go for. Going second - you can still make VFD without really trying. Just make sure you have PK RUM in hand and just perform a standard Orcust combo after. Once you pop a card with Ding's effect - you now have a rank 8 without material on board. Simply pass - and chain the Rank-Up on activation of any spell, trap or summon. Although watch out for Super Polymerization - that can kill boards. Finally, you have the standard I:P combo alongside Unicorn and the two Topologics. You can always go into this if you're having trouble making Calamities - and it still can win you games.  To conclude: this deck is a mediocre 7/10. As much as it pains me to say - the banlist did a lot for this deck, and not in a positive way. I doubt this deck will become meta in this format - but right now we're in that state of limbo where Konami hasn't revealed which direction the Ultimate Banlist will take us. Maybe Harp will come back at 1 - maybe it will completely be unbanned. Maybe it will be left in the dust for an eternity to come - nobody knows. As of now, this is most likely the optimalest way of playing Orcust: but quite frankly,  not the strongest its been..."
