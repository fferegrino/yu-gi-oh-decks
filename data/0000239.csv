<span>I know this deck probably isn't the best version but it's how I like to play this deck. You can always change some stuff of course.</span>

<span>This is one of my favorite deck's atm and if you haven't tried it before.. you should!</span>

<span>It's also possible to make the deck more budget.</span>

</div>
</div>
Here is a bit of a simpler deck explanation as opposed to my 2000 word+ articles. I'm gonna pump out quite a bit of Common Charity guides in the near future for the sake of this young and exciting format!

Inspired by the surprisingly successful <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/machina-17/"">Trap Machina list</a> that topped PAK's LCS Tourney, Machina Train Control copies that strategy, geared for Common Charity!

Losing the resource/boardwipe loop that Machina is famous (Machina Citadel) and its primary searcher (Machina Redeployment) this deck is focused lesser on a Machina strategy but more towards trains. Control the board with Traps and Trains, and grind your opponent out in a resource war!

Designed to turbo out its nigh invincible boss monster Number 81, Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora, the strategy of this deck is a ""protect the castle"" strategy - Sit on a unaffected high attack monster while backed with trap cards. Even if Super Dora is taken out, this deck easily can make it again, especially with access to its fieldspell, Revolving Switchyard.

The traps used in this deck feature some of the most ridiculous floodgates in the game, completely shutting down opponent's plays while your plays are unhindered. Gozen Match shuts down most ""meta"" Common Charity decks like Tenyi and Lunalight. Imperial Order and Anti-Spell Fragrance prevent spell cards from being used.

Machina Overdrive turns any machine into Machina Fortress, a strong boss monster on its own right. Since this deck features many high level machine monsters, Fortress is easily summonable from the hand or GY. Gearframe and Unclaspare also give access to Fortress, since they both foolish burial Fortress to the GY. In the grindgame, Fortress almost always trades more often in your favour, due to it's effects when destroyed by battle or targeted by card effect.

In the grind game, Time Thief Redoer is KING in Common Charity, and he can be made easily with Machine Gearframe + Machine Unclaspare. Other rank 4 options are available, depending on the situation.

The trap cards Crackdown, Torrential Tribute, Judgment and Strike are chosen since they are the highest impact cards that trade positively for the player using them. Torrential Tribute can be used without destroying Super Dora since it can be chained with it's own effect to be immune to Torrential's fieldwipe.

Overall, the gameplan of this deck is to force out a grindgame with a towers monster (Super Dora) and win in a battle of attrition with Fortress. All of this is accomplished with oppressive floodgates which block your opponent's play, while methodically picking them apart with high impact trap cards.

Common Charity is a breathe of fresh air in the face of Yugioh's often stale meta, I encourage duelists to try it out! It's honestly the most fun I've had in Yugioh in a while!"

Hit with BIG NUMBER and OTK!","A deck specifically made for the ""Common Charity"" format that is officially supported by Konami. This format only uses cards that come in the <em>common</em> rarity.

Here is a bit of a simpler deck explanation as opposed to my 2000 word+ articles. I'm gonna pump out quite a bit of Common Charity guides in the near future for the sake of this young and exciting format!

This list is an almost identical list of the Duelist Bombderday who achieved a top 8 in the ""Common Charity 2"" out of 64 players.

Forced to only use common cards, Cyber Dragon loses key combo pieces like Galaxy Soldier and Cyber Herz. Not only that, Cyber Dragon loses its main boss monster, Cyber Dragon Infinity. With It's signature control card out of the format, Cyber Dragons only have one option - HIT WITH BIG NUMBER.

This deck aims to go second, opting to completely obliterate the opponent's lifepoints after breaking their board/backrow. Currently the meta in Common Charity consists of a lot of potent backrow like Solemns, Torrential Tribute, Compulse, etc. so x3 Hey! Trunade serves as this deck's backrow removal. Chimeratech Rampage Dragon also destroys backrow with it's on-summon ability. Monster board breakers in this deck consist of  Jizukiru (searcheable off of Cyber Repair Plant) and x3 Forbidden Chalice.

Combos with this deck are hand dependent, simple and straightforward, but the goal is always the same - summon lots of Cyber Dragons after breaking your opponent's board and OTK. Hands with Cyber Emergency/Cyber Dragon Core + Machine Duplication are essentially full combo.

The Extra Deck features the standard Cyber Dragon monsters, except without Infinity. The only unusual monster is Barbaroid, the Ultimate Battle Machine, which is summonable if your Cyber Dragon Nova gets sent to the GY.

This deck doesn't really do well in a grindgame, so make sure to destroy your opponent's lifepoints quickly and efficiently before they bounce back and force you in a unpleasant losing situation.

If the title wasn't enough of an indicator, if you are looking for a deck that does Zefra things, you've come to the wrong place. Currently, Zefra is in an utterly unplayable state and physically cannot win games without relying on several busted-ass crutches to accomplish anything. Konami, make Pendulums great again.

&nbsp;

<span><strong>Halqifibrax Combo:</strong></span>

The main goal of this deck is to turbo out <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Crystron Halqifibrax&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Crystron Halqifibrax</strong> </a>and go into an Auroradon combo to set up at least 3 negates, taking so much time doing the combo that your opponent would wish they'd never entered your lobby. For those that know the combo, don't even bother reading anything listed below, and for those that for some God-forsaken reason have no clue how to do the Halq combo, you'd better get comfortable, because you're about to read some real bullshit.
<ol>
 	<li>Summon the materials needed for <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax</strong>. This is done by using <strong><a data-name=""Zefraxi, Treasure of the Yang Zing"">Zefraxi, Treasure of the Yang Zing</a></strong> which has the effect that when Pend Summoned, it can turn any <strong>Zefra</strong> monster you control into a tuner. The best monster to summon alongside Zefraxi is <strong><a data-name=""Zefraniu, Secret of the Yang Zing"">Zefraniu, Secret of the Yang Zing</a></strong>, off which you will search <strong><a data-name=""Zefra War"">Zefra War</a></strong> for an additional interruption. If you're <em><strong>desperate</strong></em>, normal summoning a handtrap is a completely viable option. <strong>Do not summon more than 2 monsters onto the board as all zones will be used during this combo.</strong></li>
 	<li>Activate Halq, summoning <strong><a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a></strong></li>
 	<li>Using Halq and 001, link summon <strong><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a></strong>, and activate its effect to summon 3 tokens. Activate Deskbot 001.</li>
 	<li>Using 001 and a token, summon <strong><a data-name=""Cupid Pitch"">Cupid Pitch</a></strong>. Activate Cupid's effect and choose to gain a level.</li>
 	<li>Activate <strong>Auroradon</strong>, choosing his second effect to tribute two tokens and summon <strong><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing"">Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing</a></strong> from your deck. Activate Coltwing to summon 2 tokens alongside 001.</li>
 	<li><strong>You must do the following steps in order or you'll mess up the combo, and look like a complete idiot in front of your opponent. </strong>Using your L5 Cupid Pitch and a Token, summon <strong><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a></strong>. I've personally seen it happen, so I'll remind you right now to activate Borreload Savage Dragon and equip Halqifibrax.</li>
 	<li>Activate Cupid Pitch from the graveyard, searching <strong><a data-name=""Creation Resonator"">Creation Resonator</a>, </strong>and immediately Special Summon it from hand (Borrelsavage is a L8 DARK Dragon).</li>
 	<li>Using Creation Resonator and Coltwing, summon <strong><a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a></strong>.</li>
 	<li>Summon <strong><a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a></strong> using a token and 001.</li>
 	<li>Watch Opponent scoop, effectively having made you play solitaire.</li>
</ol>
<strong><em>Oh no! What if Halqifibrax is negated???</em></strong>

Halqifibrax is the most fucking telegraphed chokepoint in the world, and your opponent might need to get checked if they don't shotgun the Ash or Imperm on it. This is where <strong><a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> </strong>comes in. If you did not draw Crossout, remain calm and follow these steps:
<ul>
 	<li>In most scenarios, you do not expend your Normal Summon. In this case, simply normal summon a monster from your hand and summon Verte to make <strong><a data-name=""Destiny Hero - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny Hero - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a></strong>.</li>
 	<li>If you hard draw <strong><a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a></strong>, just hard activate it and make DPE.</li>
 	<li>If neither option is available to you, these following options are still open:
<ul>
 	<li>Set Zefra War and pray to God a single pop is enough to stop your opponent.</li>
 	<li>Draw enough handtraps to hopefully hamper your opponent.</li>
 	<li>Apologise to Trif for playing this abomination.</li>
 	<li>Scoop.</li>
 	<li>Just draw Fusion Destiny 5head.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<span><strong>Actual Zefra Stuff</strong></span>

If you draw a hand that physically cannot go into Halqifibrax, and you deem that Verte is not the right play, your next best card is <strong>Zefraniu, Secret of the Yang Zing</strong>. It deadass searches your entire deck upon Pend Summon or destruction (if you need a Zefra monster, add <strong><a data-name=""Zefra Providence"">Zefra Providence</a></strong> or <strong><a data-name=""Oracle of Zefra"">Oracle of Zefra</a></strong>). Generally, if you need to squeeze as many interactions out of Zefraniu as possible, add <strong>Nine Pillars of the Yang Zing</strong>, and when Zefraniu is destroyed during the next turn from Nine Pillars, you add <strong>Zefra War</strong> (this card can be used from hand if you have Zefras in both pend zones).

Whatever you do, don't actually summon <strong><a data-name=""Zefraath"">Zefraath</a> </strong>from your face-up Extra Deck. After the Great Pendulum Purge of MR4, this card has become <em><strong>dogshit useless</strong></em>. As it summons from your Extra-Deck, it must go into a Linked Zone, and the fucker tributes the <strong>entire field, </strong>leaving the only available zone the Extra Monster Zone. This means that you literally cannot use its second effect that grants a second Pendulum Summon each turn, making it little more than a fat body. The only exception is when your Opponent has a link arrow that points into one of your zones.

The remainder of the Zefra monster lineup is entirely down to personal preference. You can even replace Zefracore and Zefrathuban with other generic cards if you were insane enough.

&nbsp;

<span><strong>Mildly-to-Extremely Questionable Picks</strong></span>

<strong><a data-name=""Zefra Metaltron"">Zefra Metaltron</a></strong>: He is literally here for flavor points. There is probably a better monster to play over Metaltron for the link arrows. Hell, even Draco Master of the Tenyi is probably better...

<strong><a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a></strong>: This is a flex spot. You can literally play whatever the hell you want here. I just like Bagooska as it induces copious amounts of salt. Save some fees on salt. College has ways to make a man broke.

<strong>Knightmare Package</strong>: More flex spots. Knightmares are generically good in most situations, but you can play whatever you desire.

<strong>Accesscode</strong>: Ditto.

<strong><a data-name=""Zefra Path"">Zefra Path</a></strong>: This is strictly a Side Deck option. If you are playing against a deck that <em>does</em> get utterly cucked by this floodgate, you can side it in and search it off Zefraniu.

&nbsp;

<span><strong>Terrible Ideas to</strong> <strong>Consider:</strong></span>

Here are some (probably) absolutely awful ideas to try out if you're trying to actively make your deck worse.

<strong><a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a></strong>: You can make this off <strong><a data-name=""Shaddoll Zefranaga"">Shaddoll Zefranaga</a> </strong>and <strong><a data-name=""Zefrasaber, &lt;a data-name=&quot;Swordmaster of the Nekroz&quot;&gt;Swordmaster of the Nekroz&lt;/a&gt;"">Zefrasaber, </a><a data-name=""Swordmaster of the Nekroz"">Swordmaster of the Nekroz</a></strong>. Why anyone would do this, I couldn't quite say. In the case that you don't play Halqifibrax on turn 1, you can summon Halq, pulling an <strong><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a></strong> from your deck. From there, you summon Selene, use Selene's effect to revive the Veiler and make an Accesscode, I guess.

<strong><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong>: After being Semi-Limited, Dragoon may actually be a decent consideration over DPE. However, there is still a decent probability of hard drawing the Fusion Destiny, so it's really your call at this point.

<strong>My old Halq</strong> <strong>Combo:</strong> Replace Baronne de Fleur with <strong><a data-name=""Ravenous Crocodragon Arcethys"">Ravenous Crocodragon Arcethys</a></strong>, slot in a <strong><a data-name=""Metaphys Horus"">Metaphys Horus</a></strong> in the ED, and replace Creation Resonator with <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Hop Ear Squadron&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Hop Ear Squadron</strong></a>. My old guide covers this combo, but I'll just paste it here:
<ol>
 	<li><span>Get a monster and a tuner on board, and only those 2 monsters. Resist the urge to pendulum summon everything out of hand. If you're desperate, the handtraps are tuners.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Summon <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax</strong>, activate its trigger effect to summon <strong>Deskbot 001</strong> from deck.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Link for <strong>Mecha-Phantom Beast Auroradon</strong>, summon 3 tokens, then summon 001 from GY.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Using a token and 001, summon <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong>.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Using Auroradon's 2nd effect, tribute 2 tokens to summon <strong>Mecha-Phantom Beast Coltwing</strong>. Coltwing effect for 2 tokens, and summon 001 from GY again.</span></li>
 	<li><span>001 and token to summon <strong>Cupid Pitch</strong>, choose to <strong>increase</strong> level.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Level 5 Cupid Pitch and token for <strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong>, equip Halq. Use Cupid Pitch's effect to search <strong>Hop Ear Squadron</strong>.</span></li>
</ol>
<span>During your Opponent's turn, you can use Hop Ear in order to Synchro Summon for <strong>Metaphys Horus</strong> for an additional negate. Keep in mind that Metaphys Horus' negate is an on-summon trigger, <strong>so it will not go on the same chain.</strong></span>

<span>In the case that 001 is negated by either Ghost Belle or Skull Meister after Auroradon summons 3 tokens, <strong>you can either</strong>: use Auroradon to tribute 2 tokens and summon Coltwing, and summon the 001. From here, you make Cupid Pitch and do the standard combo to make a Borrelsavage. Then, you can use the Hop Ear you searched to summon <strong>Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys</strong> at the start of your Opponent's MP1 using Hop Ear and Coltwing.</span>

<span><strong>OR</strong>: Choose to reduce the level of Cupid Pitch, and then synchro summon Ravenous Crocodragon with 3 materials to draw 2 cards. Then use Hop Ear to make Horus during Opponent's turn.</span>

<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Nekroz of&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Unicore&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Nekroz of</strong> <strong>Unicore</strong></a>: Look, all I'm saying is that Arc Light can search a ritual, and Zefra is totally capable of playing a ritual.

<strong>More Zefras</strong>: If you prefer flavor over playability, you can totally replace DPE, Handtraps, and more with even more Zefras. The only merit is that you have more scales to draw and might be able to make halq more frequently? idk, but hey, you do you.

<strong>*<a data-name=""Tierra, Source of Destruction"">Tierra, Source of Destruction</a></strong>: For anyone who has read the Yugioh wiki, the tips page for Tierra suggests that you play her in Zefra. Unfortunately, this is outdated advice from MR3, and this is no longer viable (not that it ever was.) But I'm not your dad, if you're determined to make this work, then go ahead. Hell, I'll paypal five bucks to anyone who manages this in an actual game.

&nbsp;

Yeah, that's about it. If you want a good Pendulum deck, you're looking in the wrong places. Go watch Trif."

","A deck specifically made for the ""Common Charity"" format that is officially supported by Konami. This format only uses cards that come in the <em>common</em> rarity.

Here is a bit of a simpler deck explanation as opposed to my 2000 word+ articles. I'm gonna pump out quite a bit of Common Charity guides in the near future for the sake of this young and exciting format!

Paleozoic Volcanic controls the field with multiple fieldwipes with the Volcanic engine. This is done by dumping Blaze Accelerator Reload through Foolish Burial Goods and Paleozoic Marella. Blaze Accelerator Reload in turn dumps Volcanic Scattershot. This engine is recycled by Royal Firestorm Guards, the pyro ""Pot of Avarice."" Blaze Accelerator Reload serves as a draw engine on the field, turning a Volcanic card into another potential purple card to control the board.

Meantime, the board is simultaneously controlled with various forms of Paleozoic interruption. Dinomischus banishes, Canadia flips face down and Olenoides destroys backrow. When a trap card is activated, Paleozoic cards summon themselves from the GY as 1200ATK monsters.

While unaffected by monster effects, Paleozoic cards have low attack. That is offset with Moon Mirror Shield + Armory Call, which gives you a towers-like boss monster immune to monster effects and unkillable in battle. In Common Charity format where monster effects and beatdown are crucial, Paleozoic monsters equipped with Moon Mirror Shield are ridiculously powerful.

Since the traditional Paleozoic XYZ monsters are unavailable as common, Number 29: Mannequin Cat is the XYZ substitute, which can generate card advantage as a Monster Reborn. Paleozoic Cambroraster searches for any Paleozoic card with it's effect, and is good protection for backrow. These are the two best Extra Deck monsters used most often. The other Extra Deck monsters are just filler, which can be made in niche situations.

Common Charity is a breathe of fresh air in the face of Yugioh's often stale meta, I encourage duelists to try it out! It's honestly the most fun I've had in Yugioh in a while!"

All the trap cards, with the exception of Assault Mode Activate are simply filler and are not part of the engine.

The Psi-Reflector engine is comparable to the Invoked engine in that you can use your normal summon to make a powerful monster.  With one card, you can make almost any level 6-9 synchro monster as long as it has generic requirements. The advantages it has over Invoked is that it is searchable by Emergency Teleport and One for One, so it can be used without taking up your normal summon, which Invoked can not, but does require to run more bricks and cards in general.

The main sequence of play with this engine is to summon Psi-Reflector and search Assault Beast. You then discard Assault Beast to search Assault Mode Activate. Then, you use Psi-Reflector to revive Assault Beast through its effect by revealing Activate, increasing its level depending on the synchro monster you want to summon, and then synchro summoning the said monster.

If you synchro summon Power Tool Dragon, you can use it’s effect to grab Living Fossil and summon back Reflector, and then make Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon. This lets you play it in a wide variety of decks to gain a hard to beat over boss monster with a monster negate."

If I had the choice to ban one card it would be Toadally Awesome. It literally does everything and is way too easy to build into. I mean please at least give it some kind of actual cost for its effect since you want frogs in your graveyard. Oh, what's that? You got through the 20000 negates on board? Have some handtraps while I salt some popcorn with the salt from your tears because I feel like it!

Dogmatika because it's a good engine and helps out if you can't reach the Amazing Dragon OTK or have to play through heavy disruption on turn 2. Fluerdelis is an easy-to-summon level 8 that helps you go into your level 11 synchros.

Noh P.U.N.K. Numeral Ogre is a searcher and can be played at three if the deck isn't as consistent as you like.

Swap your Dark Rulers, Lightning Storm, and Harpie's Feather Duster for Dimensional Barrier and Artifact Sanctum if you know you're going to have to go first. Cosmic Cyclone is for Mystic Mine decks, Red Reboot if you're playing against a trap deck, Macro Cosmos for those few decks it completely shuts down.

Psychic Jumper and Chain Strike are painfully, personally situational. Feel free to swap them out for Dimensional Fissure or something else more useful.

UPDATE: To comply with the TCG January banlist: remove one copy of Nadir Servant and add one copy of Emergency Teleport. Easy as that."

Combo 4:

1. Have punk Sharakusai and a different punk card in hand.

2. Normal summon sharakusai and use its effect by fusing itself and your punk card.

3. After making the fusion card use its effect to tribute and summon Siemen and a different punk that is not level 8 of your choice.

4. Use siemen to get a level 8 and special it.

5. Synchro into Amazing Dragon and activate either of its effects.

Remember that there's a lot of room for other combos and of course your moves will be specific to your duel so you can make up other combos as you go but these are just some general ones to get out your boss monsters.

Comments:
Whenever you have the Link <a data-name=""Artemis,"">Artemis,</a> equipped you are practically guaranteed a Follow Up next turn.
Synchro <a data-name=""Vahram,"">Vahram,</a> makes any equipped monster a ""Battle Phase <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a></span> eff"" protected from Spell/Trap Destruction so you can equip it on small attack monsters and be able to take out much stronger monsters in battle. Together with <a data-name=""Ninaruru,"">Ninaruru,</a> it gets even better because you can attack monsters twice.
<a data-name=""Rilliona,"">Rilliona,</a> in Grind Game you add <a data-name=""Vritra"">Vritra</a> and do LINK-1 and activate Vritra Reborn <a data-name=""Zoroa,"">Zoroa,</a> to trigger eff <a data-name=""Artemis,"">Artemis,</a> to equip and then use Zoroa to reborn.
Equipping Fusion <a data-name=""Aiwass,"">Aiwass,</a> already guarantees you to take out several monsters in battle as well as <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> </span>by Boost 1000ATK/DEF.
F<a data-name=""orbidden Droplet"">orbidden Droplet</a> is not bad to use in this deck because you have the option to send Equip Spells to the GY as a cost.
If you can get to 2 Level4 without Normal Summoning as Vritra Reborn Rilliona and Search <a data-name=""Trismagistus"">Trismagistus</a> and use to Special Level4 Spellcaster from Hand you can make <a data-name=""Ninaruru"">Ninaruru</a> to add Zoroa back to Hand to use as your Normal Summon.
Don't Forget <a data-name=""Trismagistus"">Trismagistus</a> protects destruction from Battle. Also don't forget that in cases where it's not important to keep Artemis equipped on Endymion (pretty much whenever you're not using Invocation to Fusion) you use <a data-name=""Endymion, the Magistus"">Endymion, the Magistus</a> <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Ferrijit"">Tri-Brigade Ferrijit</a> effect to filter the top of your deck and improve your hand.
You cannot use Artemis in the Spell&amp;Trap Zone as a cost to pay <a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus"">Crowley, the Magistus</a> Special Summon effect from the hand because it is considered an Equip Spell and not a Spellcaster monster.

A really cool move to make with <a data-name=""Zoroa,"">Zoroa,</a> is to equip <a data-name=""Ninaruru"">Ninaruru</a>, and use Reborn's effect and then use Ninaruru's effect to destroy itself and an opponent's spell/trap. That way you practically have a <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a> in the engine itself to use every turn in a very simple way. I've already managed to destroy a lot of floodgate with this effect for example.

Missplays I made with the deck:
You activated <a data-name=""Impermanence"">Impermanence</a> set and equipped Artemis in the same column as Impermanence was activated so that means Artemis has her Equip Spell effect negated.
Choosing to use Xyz Rilliona's effect early in the turn and thus not being able to make Bagooska.
When you choose to play <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> and go to the battle phase and in M2 do <a data-name=""Toadally"">Toadally</a> and <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> always detach Endymion because otherwise you won't have follow up to add to the hand with Toad eff in GY."

The strat is very versatile : controlling with the s/t or trying to otk thanks to xyz 4

Some deckbuilding choices are questionnable : the extra deck, the main deck free spots, the pot (desires or prosperity ?), also the recently announced card Into the VRAINS that will protect Max, and take the spots of Xceed and Crown (maybe i'll keep Xceed for chain blocking), also the monster ratios may be modified because with this you expect 2 Musketeers. What do you think ?"

This is really a wonderful game. Drytron has been around the meta since its release, at first it did stuff and then put up an extra deck lock, now it puts up negates and locks people out of the extra deck.

<strong>Combo: </strong>I recommend going to youtube to find the combo for this deck because it is kind of long.

<strong>Budget options:</strong> IF you can not afford the destiny hero package then you can drop it and the artifact package for herald of perfection, its ritual spell and preparation of rites. If you can not afford triple tactics talents then you can cut it for forbidden chalice. IF you can not afford accesscode talker you can cut it for boorelsword/borreload dragon. IF you can not afford ash blossom you can cut it for effect veiler. IF you can not afford Zues then you can cut him for knightmare Cerberus. IF you can not afford the Diviner of herald, then you can cut it for a megaliath package, 2 phul, 1 bethor, and 1 Ophiel.  IF you can not afford drytron nova I do not recomend this deck, but you could also cut this for the megaliath package or the herald of perfection pakcage. IF you can not afford the Droll, or nibiru I suggest playing effect veiler, or kaijus."

You will see today.,"This deck is focused on sylvan as a strategy. Not plant dot deck

New Sylvan link monster--&gt; best gambling deck ever. Just excavate and see how you gain advantage. Hard to say a strategy but... Go sylvan link, undead vampire, chaos ruler, and aromaseraphy to set up board with whatever happens.

Never add anything with chaos ruler. There is not a target more fun in grave than in hand.

Apollousa is a good endboard if you have random stuff you think won't help.

Use the plant Therion as searcher for field spell by sending whatever you equip, then use as material for rank 8, plant link or synchro fodder. Field spell can find the machine therion to equip the plant therion.

Always try to summon something form grave with undead vampire effects, including opponents cards. that why its is not a plant only extra deck."

Absolutely not in fact it is one of the top 3 decks in yugioh right now. The deck got a big boost from the release of destiny hero destroy phoenix enforcer. So what does the deck do? The deck is an anti combo deck, with its typical end board being some variation of Invoked mechaba- Shaddoll Winda- and/or Destiny hero destroy phoenix enforcer. The deck is also consistant since all 3 engines only need one card to get to there boss part, Invoked only needs Aleister, magical meltdown, or terraforming. Dogmatika only needs nadir servant, ecclisia, or dogmatika maximus. And destiny hero only needs fusion destiny or access to verte.  <strong>Note:</strong> You can only summon hero monsters after you use fusion destiny, so you should use it at the end of your combo, or if you bricked.

<strong>Combo:</strong> You can normal summon aleister, search invocation. Link aliester into artemis, or almiraj, and then secure gardna, then activate invocation using aliester and a light monster""Secure gardna, Artemis"" And summon invoked mechaba. Then activate invocation in grave to add aliester to the hand and shuffle itself into the deck. For dogmatika you can use nadir servant to search, ecclisia to search maximus, summon maximus pitch shaddoll apkolone, and gravity controller. Apkollone will search the shaddoll schism, set schism, and the non your opponents turn you can use schism to summon winda. Destiny hero Activate verte send fusion destiny and the two destiny hero monsters, summon destroy phoenix enforcer.

<strong>Budget Options: </strong>If you can not afford this deck you can, cut the droll for effect veiler which will save 45 dollars. You can cut the destiny hero package which will take off 150 dollars, You can cut the dogmatika engine for just shaddoll cards, this will take off around 75 dollars off. If you cut the nibiru in the extra deck for dogmatika punishment it will save 33 dollars."

If you have not played yugioh for the last 2 years and don't know what Eldlich does, here is a quick summary. Sit behind your traps until you get access to eldlich, then summon eldlich grind a little bit, whenever your opponent is weak go in for game with Eldlich, Superdrednaughts, or accesscode talker.

<strong>Budget options:</strong>If you want to play budget this is an easy deck to do it with. You can cut the pot of extravagance for more traps which will save you around 36 dollars on a deck that is already relativity cheap, You can always cut the side deck. If you can not afford/ dont want to play Ice dragons prison then you can cut it for dimensional barrier, or drowning mirror force, this is the same with skill drain, the artifact cards, or any cards that you find to expensive. If you can not afford the accescode talker cut it for borrelsword, or the knightmare Cerberus.

<strong>Combo:</strong> Set five pass. Combo 2 normal summon ecclisia, search dogmatika punishment, set 5 pass.

<strong>Interesting tech:</strong> The artifact cards. I am playing the artifact cards, because 1 you can pop it with N'tss, 2 what are people siding in against you games 2, and 3, backrow removal so even if you draw it, they will more than likely lock themselves out of the extra deck."

If you need to end the duel faster, we also have Geomathmech Final Sigma, Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning, and Gren Maju de Eiza. If you want to make your opponent hate your very existence, we have Number 90, Number 23, Number 68, and Macro Cosmos.

However, if you want to use Macro Cosmos, make sure you already have The Chaos Creator on the field, and also preferably Chaos Zone as well. This way you can just recycle your monsters endlessly.  However, it only really works if you already have a lead and want to prevent a comeback.

Losing Colossus nearly two years ago at the start of 2020 that killed the eternal “TOSS” format, Thunder Dragons have lost their meta tier 1 status and became considerably weaker as a rogue deck. Branded Fusion changes this humble status of this former heavyweight meta champion by enabling the deck viable and powerful going first and going second options!

Summon multiple gigantic draconic boss monsters, methodically decimate your opponent’s board, maintain resource advantage through both archetype’s resource loops and when the time is right - swing for game!

<span><strong>ARCHETYPES AND RATIOS</strong></span>

The <strong>THUNDER DRAGON</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 16 cards:

<em>3 Thunder Dragons, 3 Thunder Dragondark, 2 Thunder Dragonmatrix, 1 Thunder Dragonroar, 3 Aloof Lupine, 1 Thunder Dragon Fusion,</em> <em>2 Ready Fusion and 1 Gold Sarcophagus. </em>In the Extra Deck there are <em>2 Thunder Dragon Titan</em> and <em>1 Kaminari Attack</em>. Several extra Thunder Dragon cards are cut from this decklist like an extra copy of Matrix, Roar Thunder Dragon Fusion, and Dragonhawk to make space for staples and the Albaz cards.

The <strong>BRANDED</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 13 cards:

<em>1 Aluber the Jester of Despia, 2 Fallen of Albaz, 3 Springans Kitt, 3 Incredible Ecclesia, </em>and<em> 1 Iris Swordsoul,</em> 3 Branded Fusion<em>. </em>In the Extra Deck there are <em>3 Albion, 2 Lubellion</em>, and <em>2 Mirrorjade. 1 Starving Venom </em>and <em>1 Titaniklad </em>serve as additional “superpoly” targets for Albaz.

The <strong>SHADOLL</strong> cards are a minor package in this deck, consisting only of 2 cards: <em>Winda</em> and <em>Qashaddol Keios.</em>

The <strong>STAPLE</strong> cards in this deck take up 10 slots in this deck. <em>3 Allure of Darkness</em> serve as draw power, and 6 handtraps <em>3 Impermanence </em>and<em> 3 Dimension Shifter. 1 Called By the Grave </em>provides protection from handtraps and a potential disruption for the opponent. I chose to make the staples in this decklist affordable, but they can be replaced by more potent (and expensive) cards like Lightning Storm and Forbidden Droplet.

<span><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span>

The <strong>GAMEPLAN</strong> with this deck is simple – control the board going first, and OTK going second.

If the game manages to lasts several turns, both Branded and Thunder Dragon cards recycle themselves and provide sizeable resources. At the end of every turn, Incredible Ecclesia recycles herself + Albion grabs you another Branded Fusion from deck. Thunder Dragon Fusion can also be banished the turn after you use it to allow you to search for Thunder Dragonroar, which can be discarded to recover Thunder Dragon Fusion from the banished pile. Since these two archetypes recur almost indefinitely, you should be able to outgrind your opponent in resource war.

<strong>GOING FIRST</strong>, boards that end on Thunder Dragon Titan’s destruction and Winda’s floodgate are often enough to pressure your opponent’s gameplan to a standstill.

Simply use Branded Fusion to dump to the GY the light Shadoll monster Keios to fuse into Albion, then use Albion’s effect to make Winda! Keep in mind you only have one summon to make after making Winda, so be sure to combo off properly making Thunder Dragon Titan first, then making Winda afterward.

<strong>GOING SECOND</strong>, boards are easily picked apart by Thunder Dragon’s multiple pops and Mirrorjade’s banish. Incredible Ecclesia works together with her bestie, Fallen of Albaz to “superpoly” away your opponent’s problematic monsters. All of this often accomplished without using your normal summon! After breaking an opponent’s board, this deck can easily generate enough gigantic monsters onboard to obliterate your opponent’s lifepoints in one turn.

<strong>COMBOS</strong> with this deck simple but take practice to fully master. Combos are typically hand-dependent, but end with a board full of Thunder Dragon and Branded fusion monsters. In addition to the combos featured earlier, here are some examples of additional combos:

<em>Thunder Dragon + Ready Fusion:</em> Activate Ready Fusion to summon Kaminari Attack, then special summon Thunder Dragon Titan by banishing Kaminari Attack and your Thunder Dragon in hand. It is ideal to banish Thunder Dragondark for this effect, since banishing it allows you to search for an essential Thunder Dragon combo piece like ammunition for Thunder Dragon Titan or Thunder Dragon Fusion.

<em>Albion effect  + Thunder Dragondark in GY = Search Thunder Dragon card</em>: If Thunder Dragondark is already in the GY, Albion can banish Thunder Dragondark to create Lubellion. Doing so will trigger Dragondark’s effect to search for any Thunderdragon card that you’re mission.

<em>Ready Fusion + Branded Fusion = Mirrorjade</em>: After using Ready Fusion to create Thunder Dragon Titan, a Kaminari Attack should be in the banished pile. The Branded Fusion combo line (Albion -&gt; Lubellion -&gt; Mirrorjade) can use Kaminari Attack in the banished pile as one of the materials to fuse Mirrorjade, without using up one of your Branded Dragons already on the field!

There are more situational combos that a pilot can do with this deck, but it’s largely dependent on the game state, cards in hand, and what the opponent has. That’s why it’s crucial to practice this deck so one can optimize play. I’d describe Branded Thunder Dragon as easy to play, but hard to master.

<span><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span>
<ul>
 	<li>Ideally, this deck can feature monsters like Dragoon, Blue Eyes Tyrant Dragon and Invoked Mechaba! All you have to do is use another garnet in your deck, The Light -Hex-Sealed Fusion, dumped off Branded Fusion for the summon of Albion. Albion then makes your fusion of choice, using Hex-Sealed’s fusion substitution ability!</li>
 	<li>Your hand going second will likely have ways to fuse into your Branded and Thunder Dragon monsters, but try to bait/break your opponent’s interruption first before heading into your main plays.</li>
 	<li>If you want to focus more on destroying multiple backrow, creating Thunder Dragon Titan is the ideal play, since it can pop cards on the field multiple times without targeting and can survive being destroyed multiple times (for ex. Torrential Tribute or Conquistador of the Golden Land).</li>
 	<li>Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer fits comfortably in this deck, but the inclusion of other cards in Branded Thunder Dragon reduces consistency, lessens access to boardbreakers, etc. If you can put this guy in your deck, I highly recommend it!</li>
 	<li>Since this deck lacks an inherent normal summons and doesn’t really set cards, Denko Sekka can be sidedeck option for backrow heavy games. She is also searchable off Thunder Dragon Fusion!</li>
 	<li>Chaos cards/chaos engine function wonderfully with this deck. If you’re willing to let go of staples or increase your decksize beyond 40, I recommend fitting Chaos Space, Chaos Dragon Levianeer, Chaos Creator (searchable off Thunder Dragon Fusion), Chaos Valkyria, etc.</li>
 	<li>This deck is particularly weak to backrow, floodgates and high impact handtraps. Be sure to side properly to counter your opponents!</li>
 	<li>When siding with this deck in-between games, the cards able to be switched the most are the 3 Allure of Darkness (sacrificing consistency), the 3 Dimension Shifter, and the Ecclesia cards (3 Incredible Ecclesia, 1 Iris Swordsoul). Replace these 10 cards with whatever you like going first or second!</li>
 	<li>Dimension Shifter works incredibly well with this deck. Careful of using this card since it cuts off some combo lines for both Thunder Dragon and Branded!</li>
 	<li>The Branded Albaz and Lubellion require a discard for their cost, and Thunder Dragons provide ample fodder for discards. Dragondark especially loves being in the GY, since it can potentially be banished by Albion’s effect, triggering Dragondark’s search effect.</li>
 	<li>Verte Anaconda can be used should you lack access to either Branded or Thunder Dragon fusion. Just keep in mind you can’t summon Verte the same turn you used Branded Fusion since you’re locked into fusion extra deck monsters for the rest of the turn.</li>
 	<li>Lubellion can recycle any monster cards used for its fusion effect in the GY or banished pile, including Thunder Dragon monsters. Keep this in mind if you’re running out of particular cards in your maindeck/extra deck!</li>
</ul>
<span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span>

The synergy between these decks almost seem like these two archetypes were designed to support each other! For example, Branded Fusion mills Thunder Dragons to the GY, Albion banishes Thunder Dragons in the GY to fuse while triggering their effects, Mirrorjade recycles Extra Deck monsters in the banished pile, Thunder Dragons maintain hand advantage serving as discard fodder for Branded cards… The synergies between these two are incredible!

I’ve enjoyed the simple control/beatdown strategy of Thunder Dragons for years, combining it with multiple different variants such as Chaos and Rokket to propel this deck forward. With their new bestie Albaz and friends, Thunder Dragons gains an entirely new dimension of power and playability! Who knows, maybe in the future Thunder Dragons may reclaim it’s mantle of tier 1 meta deck once more! <span>Just please don’t unleash Thunder Dragon Colossus again Konami, that card was ridiculous.</span>"

With the release of Destiny hero - Destroy Phoenix enforcer sky striker has gotten a very big boost. If you are not aware of what the card does it can Destroy one card on your field and then destroy one card on the field. Whenever it is sent to the graveyard It can revive itself during the next standby phase. While this is already a very good card on its own how does it work with virtual world enough to make them a top deck? They use artifact scythe, You can destroy the artifact scythe and a card on the opponents field which will lock them out of the extra deck. You can also destroy destroy phoenix enforcer, and link the scythe into sky striker ace zeke, getting rid of the cards in your main monster zone and 2 cards on the opponents field.

<strong>Budget options:</strong> IF you want a budget version I recommend playing a pure variant as there are not really any ways of cutting the cost, besides cutting the extra deck. If you cut destroy phoenix enforcer you are playing a deck with 8 copies of scythe and no way to pop it. If you are interested in a pure variant/Budget variant I will be making one in the near future."

It is here~

The Cyber Strike Structure deck is here and it turned out to be even more fun than I expected it to be. (Still, Rip Lightning Storm ;_;) But even without the inclusion of a reprint for Lightning Storm, we still got amazing reprints with it, which makes it absolutely worth buying a pack of 3 of this awesome SD. Cards like ""<a data-name=""Fusion Deployment"">Fusion Deployment</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a>"" and the infamous ""<a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>"". But reprints aren't everything this SD has to offer. New cards like ""<a data-name=""Cyber Eternal"">Cyber Eternal</a>"" or the Cyberdark archetypes newest Boss Monster ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark End Dragon"">Cyberdark End Dragon</a>"" are also included and give the deck a huge power boost. Anyway, I'm not going to waste more time, let's get right into the deck profile.

Be careful tho, this'll get edgy. VERY edgy. Seriously.

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/00gQISR.jpg"" alt=""image"" />

Let's start with the basics. This deck is really not depending on going 1st or going 2nd. You usually got something for both cases, altho going 2nd is a bit favored, due to the deck consisting of roughly 60% Cyberdark and 40% Cyberdragon, which is usually a going 2nd deck. Anyway, what to do if you are forced to go 1st? In this scary moment you usually wanna go straight into your biggest and strongest Beast of them all: The ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark End Dragon"">Cyberdark End Dragon</a>"". This will most of the time; depending on how your starting hand looks; cost you a good bunch of resources as well as a LP amount of 2000 and will leave you with; again depending on your starting hand; the Dragon and maybe one or two more cards in form of backrow. All you need to get the Emperor Dragon out, is at least one copy of any Trap- or Spell-Card and the new (searchable) Spell-Card ""<a data-name=""Cybernetic Horizon"">Cybernetic Horizon</a>"". The rest will be searchable in around 18 out of 20 cases if you don't already have it. What you gonna do is get at least 5 Cyberdark Monsters (No matter which ones) in your GY, your hand or on the field (not as equip spells!), one of them being on the field is the new Cyberdark Monster ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Chimera"">Cyberdark Chimera</a>"". This can be easily done by using the Cybernetic Horizon spell. Make sure to send ""<a data-name=""Cyber End Dragon"">Cyber End Dragon</a>"" from your Extra-Deck to the GY when using Horizon. Tipp: If somehow one Cyberdark monster is missing, you can also send your second Cyberdark Chimera from your deck to the graveyard to send another Cyberdark to your graveyard by using Chimeras second effect. Now use Chimeras first effect, discard the before mentioned random backrow card and search ""<a data-name=""Power Bond"">Power Bond</a>"". Use Power Bond to Fusion summon ""<a data-name=""Cyberdarkness Dragon"">Cyberdarkness Dragon</a>"" by using the 5 Cyberdarks in your hand, field or by banishing them from the graveyard, which is possible thanks to Chimeras effect. Uppon summoning Cyberdarkness Dragon, use it's effect to equip Cyber End Dragon to it and then tribute it to summon your Cyberdark End Dragon. As a second option, you can also keep your 8000 ATK Cyberdarkness Dragon. Good thing about that is, that you have an omni negate for every equip card on the field. Even if there aren't any, you can use Cyber End Dragon as well, on cost of putting Cyberdarkness' ATK down to ""just"" 4000. I however, as the going first option, mostly chose to go into the Cyberdark End Dragon, since 5000 ATK combined with being completely unaffected by any activated effects from your opponent is just too good. Just keep in mind, that it won't protect it from Kaiju-like effects as well as from permanent effects or ""passive"" effects like Skill Drain. It is however protected from Super Polymerisation since it has to be activated before actually using something as Fusion material. Another good side note is that you can revive Cyberdarkness Dragon after tributing it via ""<a data-name=""Cyber Eternal"">Cyber Eternal</a>"", getting your omni negate back; this time with ""just"" 6000 ATK but still; if you manage to have it in your hand or search it via ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a>"". It's a very good combination with the Cyberdark End Dragon by the way, since it can constantly grab 'n' equip monsters from both graveyards, giving your Cyberdarkness Dragon more negates and gives you the possibility to pull out important monsters from your opponents graveyard interupting their plays, like Doomking Balerdroch to just name one.

So that's everything for the going first part. The going second part is actually much shorter, I promise. In this section I talk about some basic and advanced combos since the going second part is literally the whole first part if you wanna sweat a bit or just everything else the deck has to offer.

The deck focuses on literally everything that makes Cyberdark for me: Effectiveness (seriously, don't play this deck against somebody who's only out for fun and casual play, this will come of as a bit unfair), Feeling (Simping for Zane/Ryo) and semi-fun/casual play. That's why I play the deck in it's in my eyes best form, combined with Cyberdragons in the best Zane-manner. You main strategies are of course using the main Cyberdark's being ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Horn"">Cyberdark Horn</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Edge"">Cyberdark Edge</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Keel"">Cyberdark Keel</a>"". Combined with the main searchers of the deck as well as main equip monsters ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Cannon"">Cyberdark Cannon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Claw"">Cyberdark Claw</a>"", they become 2400 ATK beatsticks with additional effects. Claw is your backrow searcher and Cannon is your monster searcher. Whilst equipped with to a monster, Claw that equips and battles can send a monster from the Extra-Deck to your GY which works perfectly with ""Elder Entity N'tss"" to pop a card of choice. Another good option is ""<a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>"", which then let's you search any Fusion spell. Just keep in mind, that a Cyber Monster send to the GY by this or Horizon's effect, can't be revived by Cyber Eternal. It ignores summoning conditions, but only the ones that are one the card but not the ones that are in the games basic rules which need you to summon a Fusion Monster properly first before you are able to revive it by other means. Cannon however let's you send a Cyberdark monster from your Deck to your GY. You may wanna use this to get easier Fusion summons since you mostly use monsters in your graveyard as material. This for the basic playstyle. Now to some ""advanced"" combos.

Starting with the whole selection of Cyberdragons. The Cyberdarks really go hand in hand with the original Cyberdragons (and even need them for Cybernetic Horizon) and you have a big pool to chose from. I go with the very core of the Cyberdragon engine being the normal set of 3 <a data-name=""Cyberdragon"">Cyberdragon</a>s, <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a> for the search since it can search really every Cyberdragon and Cyberdark- Spell and Trap. <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a> is a beautiful combo extender about which I will talk a bit more soon. Lastly ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a>"". Another choice which is enough as a one-of due to reasons I talk about later on. As I said before, you need the Light Machine engine to get Cybernetic Horizon to work which is a very important card and they also go very well with the ""Rush-Down-Beat-Down"" tactic (short: RDBD&#x2122;).

The first important combo is the usual ""Get-most-out-of-""-combo involving <a data-name=""Cybernetic Horizon"">Cybernetic Horizon</a>. The card requires you to send one of your Light and one of your Dark monsters to the GY. One from your hand and one from your Deck. It's important to send a Cyberdark monster from your hand to the graveyard to then send a Cyberdragon from your deck to the grave, which will be <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a>. It's effect will activate and let you take one of the original Cyber Dragons to your hand. Right after that, you can take another ""Cyber-"" monster to your hand from your deck. You can really take everything that's name is ""Cyber..."", even the <a data-name=""Malefic Cyber End Dragon"">Malefic Cyber End Dragon</a> or cards that aren't even Cyberdragon related, like <a data-name=""Cyber Kirin"">Cyber Kirin</a>. This will give you the maximum out of your Cybernetic Horizon spell.

Lets head on to the next important piece which involves <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a>. The sole purpose of this card in the deck is to add it to your hand and normal summon it to activate it's effect and make it's own Level become 5. Here again, by using Cybernetic Horizon, sending a Cyber Dragon Herz to the GY, you can add an additional default Cyber Dragon to your hand together with Cyber Dragon Drei. Summon it, then normal summon Cyber Dragon Drei to go into the Xyz-monster ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>"". Infinity is an important monster removal and a strong omni negate.

Next. A way to turn this deck into a true Suicide Bomb is via ""<a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a>"". What's nice about this, is that it basicly comes just while playing the deck normally. You got plenty possibilities to send Chimerafflesia to the GY, to activate it's effect and search for Future Fusion. Activate it and in case it stays on the field until the next turn (Easy done when already having a Cyberdarkness Dragon out or a ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Invasion"">Cyberdark Invasion</a>"" to prevent your opponent from destroying it), you can show your opponent your ""<a data-name=""Chimeratech Overdragon"">Chimeratech Overdragon</a>"", dumb all Machine type monsters in your deck and then use Cyberdark Chimera's effect to get Powerbond and summon the Overdragon with your whole deck, creating a monster just with your Main Deck that can attack your opponents monsters up to 16 times, with 12800 ATK. If you use Power Bond, you got a monster with 25600 ATK. The only drawback is that you receive 12800 damage at the end of that turn, which will definetely kill you. So, pray that your attack with an enormous 25600 will hit it's target like a well-placed Predator Rocket. Cause if that won't work, you'll be dead by the end of your turn.

...unless you use Cyber Kirin for some reason-

You can see, the target is clear. Deal huge amounts of battle damage to your opponent, until they lay in the dirt. OTK's won't be too rare. Good options if you try going for the OTK are the ""<a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a>"" and the ""<a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampagedragon"">Chimeratech Rampagedragon</a>"". Make sure to use ""<a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a>"" to tribute problematic Link monsters from your opponent. ""<a data-name=""Rebirth Judgement"">Rebirth Judgement</a>"" is not only one of Zane's cards, but a very good addition to the deck as well. You can use it to make your Cyberdark End Dragon more easy via ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Dragon"">Cyberdark Dragon</a>"". You can also reuse N'tss by equiping it again to one of your Fusion monsters to trigger the destroy effect multiple times. You can also use it to steal important monsters from your opponents graveyard in combination with ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Realm"">Cyberdark Realm</a>"", which is also another searcher of yours. The deck is highly consistent and you will most likely never draw a dead hand.

As for the Side Deck, there is quite a plethora of options you can go with. The classical ""<a data-name=""DNA Surgery"">DNA Surgery</a>"" trick to tribute away every single monster your opponent controls for your ""<a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a>"". <a data-name=""Fusion Deployment"">Fusion Deployment</a> to summon an easy <a data-name=""Cyberdragon"">Cyberdragon</a> or ""<a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a>"" for more Suicide Bomb-Action. ""<a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>"" is a beautiful option too since you can get rid of it easily by using Cyber Dragon Infinity's effect to take it back.
