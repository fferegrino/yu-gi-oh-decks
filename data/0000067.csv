It utilizes the Windwitch engine to set up negates for free - and maxes out on disruptio","As you probably already know; the focus of this deck is to abuse <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> as much as possible and fill your board up with fusion monsters. You mostly want to go into <a data-name=""Mechaba"">Mechaba</a> or <a data-name=""Raidjin"">Raidjin</a> - as their effects allow you to disrupt your opponents plays a lot more. The good thing about <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> is the fact that it recycles your Aleister's a lot more, allowing for you to abuse their effects and fill your board.

The windwitch engine also complements this deck well. It allows to synchro climb using <a data-name=""Ice Bell"">Ice Bell</a> and <a data-name=""Glass Bell"">Glass Bell</a>; which, in the end of it all, can allow you access to a free <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a>. Another reason why its so good is the fact it doesn't use up a normal summon; meaning you can go off on your Invoked combos straight after, and have a formidable board for your opponent to face. The only downside is you cannot use your Thunder Dragon monsters afterwards - due to the additional clause on <a data-name=""Windwitch - Ice Bell"">Windwitch - Ice Bell</a> locking you out of summoning any monsters that arent WIND attribute, and above the level of 5. However, you can still easily summon your <a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a> and have a good negate on board to stop your opponent.

Finally, I run the Thunder Dragon engine. This in theory is pretty simple, and the main reason its here is to block your opponent from searching during their turn - as stated on Thunder Dragon Colossus' effect. You mainly want to max out on all the DARK attribute thunder dragons, thats why I run 2 <a data-name=""Dragonroar"">Dragonroar</a>s and 2 <a data-name=""Dragondarks"">Dragondarks</a>.

To finish off - I would give this deck a very reasonable score of 6/10. The combos are pretty linear - but it does lead to some rather impressive boards. What cripples the deck most though; is the issue of the 'lock-out' clause. Turn 1 - you have to decide if you want to end on a possible board of 1-2 <a data-name=""Mechabas"">Mechabas</a> and a <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a> - or <a data-name=""Crystal Wing"">Crystal Wing</a> and a few <a data-name=""Raidjins"">Raidjins</a>. Either way, you're able to set up a decent amount of disruptions for your opponent, and it wont be a ride in the park for them to break your board; that I guarantee."

It's also got warrior monsters that Joey used in the anime. I know Pot of Greed and Monster Reborn are on the banlist, but this is more for fun and video games, not exactly winning tournaments. The side deck is full of other classic Joey cards that I just didn't have room in here for. Let me know what you think.

Very good Megalith deck with Cyber Angel Benten engine. Reinforced with a small “crystron needlefiber” – “glow up bulb” combo giving us extra Link 4.

Trickstars great archetype, of course shows its full class with 3 x ""trickstar light stage"" and with 3 x ""terraforming"". But you can still kick some butts quickly ;) but nowe you must have good hand. It could be easier to win  with Utopia Double OTK mechanic (instant fusion and double or nothing), but I wanted to keep something from original  charm of this archetype.

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/pure-trickstars-2020/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/pure-trickstars-2020/</a>

This deck prevents from using enemy monsters effects and blocks his extra deck.  Much better deck than other decks with this archetype.

One of the easiest ways to get 6 ","Sharks. Are. Broken. With the latest support announced in 'Eternity Code' - Sharks could never have been more consistent with setting up very good and incredibly powerful negates. Going first, you can almost always end on at least one <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> (that is of course if you either brick hard or your plays get disrupted). With the new, incredible way to open up with 2 level 4 water monsters using the effect of <a data-name=""Cutter Shark"">Cutter Shark</a> - you could easily overlay into so many disruptions; <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>, <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a>, etc.

A good way to get another free disruption without paying much cost is to run <a data-name=""Number F0: Utopic Future Dragon"">Number F0: Utopic Future Dragon</a>. This card is amazing at negating <em>all </em>of your opponents monster effects and has a formidable 3000 attack (which means it will be quite easy at running over your opponents boss monsters). Similar to <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>, F0 has the ability to not only negate your opponents effects, but to the take control of the monster itself (a sort of widow anchor with legs).

To summon F0, you simply have to open up with <a data-name=""Xyz Remora"">Xyz Remora</a> in hand. What it allows you to do is to detach two materials from a monster on field - and then special summon two shark monsters along with it. Overlay into Bahamut and, after using his effect, overlay him and another Xyz and make F0. Remora appears a lot in hand - due to <a data-name=""Generation Force "">Generation Force </a> allowing there to be 6 copies of it in deck.

Another great addition to the deck is the new trap card; <a data-name=""Xyz Revive Splash"">Xyz Revive Splash</a>. By activating it, you can revive a <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> from grave and set up another negate. Its second effect also allows you to rank-up into cards like <a data-name=""Valiant Shark Lancer"">Valiant Shark Lancer</a> or <a data-name=""Number C101: Silent Honor DARK"">Number C101: Silent Honor DARK</a> that rid your opponent of 1 extra monster - all by banishing it from the grave.

Overall - This deck gets a hard 8.5/10. Its good, consistent, and most importantly unique. With so many new support cards to play with and not necessarily any archetype restrictions; this deck allows you to play around with different cards and make different end boards that can pull themselves up and give your opponent a tough time. Going second, this deck still has a lot to offer. The only problem is - like any Xyz toolbox deck - so many cards chain together to summon more and more monsters, that it may be real easy to stop your plays with a single <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> if your hand is mediocre. Either way this is one of my favourite decks to be released in the 2020 format, and I'm counting the days till it becomes TCG legal."

Uses a lot of spicy and interesting techs and even utilizes the new","Here's a quick Cubic deck that I whipped up. The main focus is to abuse the very easy ability to always get <a data-name=""Vijam the Cubic Seed "">Vijam the Cubic Seed </a> out on board; and to try to turbo out as many copies of <a data-name=""Crimson Nova the Dark Cubic Lord"">Crimson Nova the Dark Cubic Lord</a> as possible. The extra deck is pretty linear based on the fact that you use <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>, which means you dont really go into it as often. Trinity is mainly there if you want to go into it - thats why It's the only extra deck card thats a three-of.

A good tech that really helps you gain lifepoint advantage over your opponent is <a data-name=""Speedburst Dragon"">Speedburst Dragon</a>. When playing Cubics, you take a lot of lifepoint damage using effects that help you gain board presence. Most of the time your opponent also takes the damage, but Speedburst allows you to get a free 2400 beatstick on board and deal extra burn damage to your opponent while also gaining half of the lifepoints you lost. Later on of course you can use it as Xyz material for <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Beyond"">Number 39: Utopia Beyond</a>, which allows you to further dish out damage to your opponent enabling that OTK.

In conclusion, this deck is a nice 6/10. Its a very rogue and casual deck, and when used right - can finish your opponent off in the blink of an eye. The only major problem/fault with Cubics is their inability to bounce back if their main combos get negated. I run extra deck cards like <a data-name=""Outer Entity Azathot"">Outer Entity Azathot</a> or <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a> to clutch out wins, but once your opponents sets up heavy barriers on your plays - you primarily scoop. I just really enjoy the originality and consistency the deck has. Give me suggestions on cards you think should be added."

I didn't include hand traps because I'm not a fan of them, however Needle-fiber can summon T.G wonder magician in you opponents turn which counts as an extra-deck trap and can destroy a spell/trap + can summon Onimaru if you have a lvl7 on the field. The yang-zing engine is mostly used with Simoon to summon Full armor master which can't be destroyed by battle. This is a 2.5 card combo, you need Simoon, Bi'an plus any black-wing. first you use Simoon's effect to set Whirlwind (which can be recovered with Zephyros' effect in other combos) then you normal summon it and search for Orochi, normal summon Bi'an and special summon Orochi et Voila you got an almost unbeatable Wall which cannot be destroyed by battle, unaffected by all effects and can steal and destroy opponent's monsters."

Replay: <a>http://tiny.cc/yam4hz</a>

Combo is you put Ib synchro on board + 2 random fodder card in hand. Ib search World Legacy Guardragon, use it ss dragon from GY, link to Barricadeborg (dont use its effect), ss World Chalice Guardragon, ss Elpy, move Elpy so it is online using continuous spell, ss Brotaur target Barricadeborg add Cyber-Stein (1st fodder used), ss Saryuja, ss Stein below extra zone, use Stein pay 5k ss D-hero Dangerous, use D-hero discard 1 (2nd fodder used) dump Malicious, ss Malicious, link D-hero Dangerous and Malicious to Isolde, use Isolde (dont use the adding effect) dump Telekinetic Charging Cell ss Renaud, use Renaud add the equip, link Isolde and Saryuja for Reprodocus top of Stein, change to psychic, equip, link Reprodocus and Renaud to Tenyi link 3 in the other extra zone, SS ALL FUSION MONSTERS.

If you play MR5, the link monster after Reprodocus aint necessary. Now i will continue to MR4 route,  ss Dragun, ss 2 Kraken, overlay 2 Kraken to Dingirsu, we will use the one free link-pointed zone for extender (like Malicious from GY, World Chalice Guardragon effect in GY, or any in ur hand), link the extender and Tenyi to Unchained Abomination in the other extra zone, ss Exterio, ss Another Planet, use Dingirsu to prevent Another Planet wipe.

End board consists of Unchained Abomination, Dragun of Red-Eyes, Dingirsu, Exterio, Another Planet, and our lil booi Stein. They set backrow? we blow it with Unchained Abomination so hopefully no counter trap can fight us. Almost invincible.

PS: I hate unfair cards, this post is just reminder so rightful action can be taken regarding these cards."

Link-Climb your way into feeling like Saitama and plowing through your opponents monsters l,"The main concept of the deck is to link climb using Crusadia monsters and eventually go into <a data-name=""Equimax"">Equimax</a> with <a data-name=""Maximus"">Maximus</a> on board. Using his effect you can deal damage and attack for game. If your opponent is playing a deck that takes advantage of the stall strategy (for example, ghostrick) you can use <a data-name=""Leonis"">Leonis</a> to do piercing damage and still OTK with ease. Going first is a challenge however, but you usually win matches 2-1. A strategy that you might want to use to clutch out wins going first is to set up disruptions during your opponents turn - (<a data-name=""Pankratops"">Pankratops</a>, <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a>, <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization)</a> - to stop your opponents plays in hopes of coming in clutch and taking it back in your next turn.

Overall; I'd give this deck a solid 7/10. I doesn't struggle with consistency - but there are many handtraps/other forms of disruption that hurt this deck a lot. Going second, this deck will make you feel like Saitama from One Punch Man , however, going first it will make you feel like Tom from Tom &amp; Jerry. You may have luck on your side, but chances of you winning are pretty slim. Still this a fun deck that could definetely get you X-2 at your locals."

Then you can add it to the hand and search <a data-name=""Eva"">Eva</a> off of her effect. The rest of the combo is very simple and flexible. The premise is to just fill up your hand with fairy monsters for more negates. <a data-name=""Eva"">Eva</a> lets you extend more by banishing 2 monsters from your grave to add 2 cards - which allows you to stack up even more negates. <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> allows you to freely summon a 2400 beatstick and add a negate; which comes in handy as attack is pretty mediocre in this deck.
Overall this deck is a good 9/10 - going first, you basically stop your opponent from playing. <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> basically resets the game so this deck is pretty flexible with going first or second."

You get pretty good draws going second mostly. Really had no bad match ups unless it was Cyberse or certain Link monsters/decks that could spam repeatedly (there was several Link decks I've beaten although). The win ratio is not bad. Very fun to play in a tournament and very unpredictable to throw them off with other combos.

Sets up constant good board with 3-4 negates, turn one or two.","The main premise of this deck is to either; a) use one of the three engines - speedroid, trickstar or sky striker - to turbo out two monsters and link away into verte anaconda, or b) hard draw red-eyes fusion and activate it. Another way to get the 2nd dragun is to use the magicalized fusion and banish the two targets that you used on either anaconda, or the actual card itself.

Some people prefer to use retro dragon over wyvern - but I find that you rarely summon it. With insight, you can pitch it to the grave then bring back red-eyes next turn. There's also a glitch on YGOPRO that allows you to use wyvern as a target for red-eyes fusion, so thats handy.

Overall, this deck is a solid 8/10. The ideal board is two-three counter traps and a dragun on board - two if you're lucky. This deck can deal out damage quick, and can go second or third. The only downside is the fact its OCG - sorry TCG players xD"

Is like  <em>Fifty</em> Shades of <em>Grey. I will show you some examples:</em>

COMBO 1 ( Black Rose Dragon+ co-linked Cerberus and other links)

We are starting from ""ib the world chalice justiciar"" combo. SS ""crystron needlefiber"" we use his effect SS ""x saber airbellum"" and we use ""ib the world chalice justiciar""effect SS ""world chalice guardragon"" on him ""guardragon elpy"". Then ""world chalice guardragon"" in GY, SS Guardragon Pisty. Nowe ""guardragon elpy"" effect SS ""omni dragon brotaur"" select  ""x saber airbellum"" and add ""rescue ferret"". We are using ""world legacy guardragon"" to change positions ""omni dragon brotaur"" and we use ""Guardragon Pisty"" we use SS ""world chalice guardragon"". We are leaving ""omni dragon brotaur"" and ""x saber airbellum"". From the rest SS ""saryuja skull dread"" we using draw effect and his SS effect to SS ""rescue ferret"". ""Rescue ferret"" effect then SS ""red rose dragon"",""synchro fusionist"",""Glow-Up Bulb"". Of the first two monsters we SS ""garden rose maiden"" and we use effects  ""garden rose maiden"" and ""red rose dragon"" and ""synchro fusionist"". We use ""Frozen rose"" on ""Glow-Up Bulb"". ""Knightmare Cerberus"" on ""omni dragon brotaur"" and ""white rose dragon"". Nowe ""brilliant fusion"" we use ""performage trick clown"" and we use his effect and ""gem knight lazuli"" effect. On ""performage trick clown"" and ""garden rose maiden"" we SS ""cross rose dragon"". We NS 1 monster from hand and we use him and ""gem knight seraphinite"" and ""x saber airbellum"" for link S ""knightmare unicorn"". ""Glow-Up Bulb"" effect in Gy.
Now we are waiting for good moment for blowe up field ;)

COMBO 2 (Exodia FTK)

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/exodia-synchro-turbo-draw-2020/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/exodia-synchro-turbo-draw-2020/</a>

COMBO 3 (Borr + F.A. + Abyss  Dweller)

Same combo start after SS ""garden rose maiden"" and SS ""white rose dragon"" we use ""Frozen rose"" on ""Glow-Up Bulb"". On ""garden rose maiden"" and ""x saber airbellum"" we SS ""borreload savage dragon"". Nowe ""brilliant fusion"" we use ""performage trick clown"" and we use his effect and ""gem knight lazuli"" effect. On ""performage trick clown"" and  ""white rose dragon"" we SS ""Abyss  Dweller"". ""Glow-Up Bulb"" effect in Gy. On ""omni dragon brotaur"", ""Glow-Up Bulb"" and ""gem knight seraphinite"" we SS F.A. Dawn Dragster.  Nowe we can use Black Garden.

COMBO  4 (Number S0: Utopic Zexal)  for this combo we will need corrections in deck and extra deck. In deck we remove ""Black Garden"" and ""Frozen rose"" and we add 1""Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force"" and 1 card you like hahaha. In Extra deck we must add 4 XYZ monsters  Number 71 + Number S0: Utopic Zexal +Number 39 + Number S39. And 2 Synchro Old Entity Cthugua + tin musical battlemech and 1 more  saryuja skull dread. Same combo start, I leave the rest for you ;)

COMBO 5,6  I leave this place for you. Share interesting ideas for these combo in the comments. The most interesting I will join here. Aroma, Calamity other synchro there are still many roads.

This deck wins by slowly gaining advantage. Just keep popping cards and negating until your opponent runs out of plays or leaves an opening for a direct attack.

Naturia Bamboo shoot is easy to tribute summon and great for control against back row heavy decks.

Vulnerable to non targeting destruction/banish.

Calling King Custennin is a good opener  for the Artorigus ones. I bought the box set recently and added some support cards to it, for a more optimal build, remove Bedwyr, Pellinore &amp; Peredur, add another Brothers, Artorigus and Gawayn as they will speed up the engine. Adding a 2nd Merlin might also be judicious. For the extra deck I mostly stacked some loose monsters I hardly had and that work with the theme."

The main card you want to use to get the link out is Soulpiercer as it lets you get a +1. The main card you want to use the links effect on is scale, as it also can let you +1 if you discarded it then special summoned it. Having Soulpiercer is a one card combo to get the link and two monster on board plus whatever other cards you might have, like trumpter to special summon Warlord. However, Superheavy Samurai are really good at swarming the board and bring out the synchros to hit the opponent hard."

Just use your normal spinny/fowl strategies to try to get a link-3 or link-4 as fast as possible on the board. I also left in a Brionac if you need to do something with dead draws like Ash and Ghost, since getting a Level 6 Synchro on the field with this deck is surprisingly easy. You can replace it with any good generic level 5-6 synchro and that would also work. Other than that, Borreload is the win condition, and if you want, OTK with the Violent Chimera, it's pretty nutty."

<p>George Gore Security</p>
George was defeated, but Soulburner offered him his hand to get up. Gore refused and walked away. Soulburner pointed out George was, to him, one of LINK VRAINS' heroes, but swore in order to regain his old self back, had to continue winning. Gore stopped Soulburner, pointing out everyone could lose a Duel, but the important thing was whether dwell on the defeat or continue fighting. He claimed the true self was revealed once someone loses, and logged out, but Flame commented Gore was a sore loser to say that. Reading news about Clarissa Turner's prison escape, Yusaku realized Varis and the Knights of Hanoi were regrouping, and were to join his list of enemies, besides Gore.

So to get that point you can search Silent Swordsman(If it's destroyed you can special summon the LV7) with ROTA, Isolde, Gaia, The Polar Knight)
Spell is bit tricky tho that's why you use Saryuja to dig through your deck but you can replace it with phantom knight protection spells that can be searched by Phantom Knight of Silent Boots(Or you search for the <span class=""name_txt selectable"">Shade Brigandine for extra monster</span>)
You can summon almost all of your monsters in hand.

Narrowly dodging effects and attacks, pulling fast ones on your opponent, swiping some of their best cards and resources, plenty to go over. This deck features predominantly Time Thief Main Deck monsters while revolving heavily around that one special Time Thief Xyz, along with his fellow counterpart that brings a whole new layer of utility. In this summary, I'll be going over each of the main components of the deck, monsters, backrow, and extra monsters, and how each correlates to the other in one fashion or another.
<h3>Main Deck Monsters</h3>
The one monster in your deck to perfectly get things started is <a data-name=""Time Thief Regulator"">Time Thief Regulator</a>. If he's the only monster you control, you get to Tribute it and Special Summon two more Time Thief monsters with different names from your deck in defense in its place. This is perfect for setting up your very first Xyz right off the bat, as well as search for powerful resources, which I'll get to in just a bit.

Your primary target for the aforementioned Regulator is <a data-name=""Time Thief Winder"">Time Thief Winder</a>. Upon Normal or Special Summon, he allows you to search your deck for any Time Thief card, other than itself. This way, you can easily amass resources for the future, either other useful Time Thieves that buff up your Xyz monsters or for the essential backrow of the deck. Alternatively, you could bring him to the field at no Normal Summon cost using his hand effect, which simply has you detach a material from an Xyz you control.

Another primary monster and target for Regulator includes <a data-name=""Time Thief Bezel Ship"">Time Thief Bezel Ship</a>. While face-up on the field, it has a Quick Effect to tribute itself and attach any card from your opponent's GY to a Time Thief Xyz you control as material. This is perfect for getting materials and effects off in a flash, not to mention leading to its GY effect, which allows you to Special Summon it back simply by detaching a material from an Xyz you control, much like Winder. Do bear in mind that if it Tributes itself again after this or is used for a Link Summon, it will become banished immediately after, so the best way to recycle it is for material of another Xyz Summon.

&nbsp;

<a data-name=""Time Thief Time Recorder"">Time Thief Time Recorder</a> may seem like an arbitrary addition to the Main Deck, but if you read into it, there's more than meets the eye. Its own Quick Effect lets it Tribute itself during your opponent's turn to make sure they take the next battle damage, not you. This is ideal for when your opponent has a big, scary high ATK monster that's about to attack directly or hit you for some seriously big points. Just keep in mind that your opponent could potentially attack with a weaker monster first so they take less damage and then attack directly or towards another weak monster using their own big bad tool. Recorder also revives itself in the grave if a Time Thief leaves the field by a card effect, including their own, making it another good choice for future Xyz material or getting its effect off again in dire situations.

The two Danger! monsters in the deck that are primarily used for additional Xyz fodder are <a data-name=""Danger! Mothman!"">Danger! Mothman!</a> and <a data-name=""Danger! Chupacabra!"">Danger! Chupacabra!</a>. Being easy to summon even after using up your Normal Summon, they can also allow you to draw additional cards or send grave-centric materials to the GY, such as Recorder, Bezel Ship, Startup or Flyback. You could also use them as the discard cost for <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>, which comes in handy if you need juuuuuuuuuust a little more quick backrow protection.

<a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a> excels as both a Level 4 DARK monster to Xyz with, as well as a way to bring out more Level 4's like Winder and Bezel Ship by discarding an unwanted Spell for the turn like a Double or Nothing! that was in your regular draw or opening hand. Not much else to say, just surprisingly useful given the archetype of deck it's in.
<h3>Spells/Traps</h3>
<a data-name=""Time Thief Startup"">Time Thief Startup</a> is a new Quick-Play Spell that allows you to instantly Special Summon any Time Thief from your hand, letting you get off Regulator and Winder's effects off perfectly. You could also use them after your regular Xyz material monsters have been used to bring out Bezel Ship or Recorder to bolster their longevity. Arguably its better effect is in the grave, where you get to banish it and target one of each Time Thief card type from your grave (Monster, Spell, and Trap) to a Time Thief Xyz you control as material. Absolutely perfect for recycling materials and getting your Xyz effects off.

<a data-name=""Time Thief Hack"">Time Thief Hack</a> not only protects your Time Thief Xyz monsters upon summon for the turn, but also powers up said monsters for every material attached to them using its targeting effect. Even better, if the Time Thief targeted with it has a material owned by your opponent (which, given Redoer and Bezel Ship is almost always a guarantee), they get to attack directly and breach all your opponent's best tools. And even if it gets sent to the grave, Startup will make sure it doesn't go to waste.

<a data-name=""Time Thief Flyback"">Time Thief Flyback</a> has two great uses in one, the primary being attaching a Time Thief card from your deck to an Xyz you control as material, typically another Flyback or even a monster or spell to get the banishing or drawing effects off. What you'll likely be mainly using it for, however, is by banishing it from the grave, even during your opponent's turn, to enact a Bezel Ship-like effect and attach any card from your opponent's grave to an Xyz. Even if your opponent destroys it while it's set, they're not safe from its grave effect for the turn.

No Time Thief deck is complete without the ever-essential <a data-name=""Time Thief Retrograde"">Time Thief Retrograde</a>, the brand-new Counter Trap. Simply by having a Time Thief Xyz on the field, you can negate an opponent's Spell/Trap and attach that card to said monster you control. That way, your opponent's only fueling Redoer's wrath and potential to make them pay for thoughtless and strong plays.

Aside from the main Time Thief backrow, <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> is used as a quick, easy way to bring out Xyz material in the form of <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a>. Not only is it Level 4 and therefore great for bringing out your Xyz monsters, but its Quick Effect can protect your DARK monsters for the turn as well.
<p class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a> is another amazing material for bringing out Redoer, being a free summon on your first turn and acting as a Trap when attached, letting you get the Monster and Trap detachment effects of Redoer off in tandem right from the get-go.</p>
<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> is used as a good, inexpensive way of warding off your opponent's powerful Special Summoned monsters, being able to recycle itself once from the grave when your opponent brings out an Extra Monster. This way, you're essentially playing four in the deck, but you're more than welcome to add in an extra and play six, essentially.

<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> is a card whose most common targets will include either Bezel Ship or Recorder, given their grave effects. You could potentially swap this or other cards out for <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>, for either Startup or Flyback's respective grave effects, if you're feeling eager.
<h3>Extra Deck</h3>
The undisputed boss monster of the deck is none other than <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a> himself. He ties the whole deck together, being able to swipe your opponent's cards every Standby Phase and use them to his advantage like it's nothing. Its Quick Effect can do all sorts of crazy stuff when your opponent least expects it. By detaching a Monster, it banishes itself until the End Phase of the current turn. This makes it perfect for escaping powerful attacks and then following up with Recorder to reflect potential damage, or dodging and negating targeting or destruction effects like Effect Veiler, Infinite Impermanence, and the like. Keep in mind that if it has a backrow card attached as well when activating this effect, it's best to detach them too to get multiple useful effects off at once. Detaching a Spell lets you draw a card, not much else to say. But its other devastating effect comes with detaching a Trap, which lets you return any face-up card your opponent controls back to the top of their deck in a jiffy, punishing them for either heavy attacks or devastating effects they thought would be wise to get off with Redoer on the field. Even better, if used on your opponent's turn, next turn you get to attach that same card you returned atop the main deck to Redoer as material, to add further insult to injury. I can't tell you how many times I'd duped people with this particular effect, it's insane.

The other essential Extra Deck monster is <a data-name=""Time Thief Perpetua"">Time Thief Perpetua</a>, commanding two amazing effects in one. By detaching a material from her, you get to revive any Time Thief from your grave, including the main deck monsters or Redoer. It's ideal to use when Redoer's been used for the material of a Link Summon or the like, mainly for <a data-name=""Gravity Controller"">Gravity Controller</a> or <a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a>. Its Quick Effect also allows you to attach a Time Thief card from your deck to Redoer for absolutely free, letting you get more effects off faster. It's an amazing support card for the deck, and I sincerely hope and pray it comes stateside real soon.

The Utopia Engine is great to use already, given the deck's emphasis on Xyz monsters. <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a> acts as an easy way to bring out far more powerful monsters while you have barely any other options, namely <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a> for attack negation or massive <a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a> -boosted attacks, or <a data-name=""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"">Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</a> for wonderful 5000 ATK destruction without fear of your opponent's cards being activated in response to its battles. You can also use any of these three monsters to get off the effects of Winder and Bezel Ship, fortunately enough. They provide great synergy with your existing timeline-jacking juveniles.

<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> is a vital monster that can be brought out just as easily as any of your other Xyz Monsters, the rationale for its utility being its Quick Effect that prevents your opponent from activating card effects in their GY for the turn. It and <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>, which acts as a walking MST, make perfect use of any Bezel Ship or Recorder that have been summoned from the grave via their respective effects so you can keep on recycling them as you please.
<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
Though Time Thieves are capable of some surprising muscle, they're not without their flaws. For one, the deck relies almost entirely on the Extra Deck for strong attacks and staying alive, the main deck monsters acting as mainly fodder for them and providing some quick utility here and there. Furthermore, when faced with high ATK monsters themselves, the deck faces issues regarding remaining LP from damage, especially after paying the Instant Fusion cost once or twice, hence the way Recorder is used in this situation. <a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a> helps mitigate this a good bit, given the 500 ATK/DEF boost it grants to all DARK monsters and the 400 ATK/DEF drop it gives to LIGHT monsters.

Common hand traps like <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> and <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> also give Redoer plenty of trouble if they're used in response to it, the former since its Quick Effect is easily negated due to including a drawing effect and the latter which straight-up destroys Redoer for activating its Quick Effect at all. For these reasons, consider substituting cards in the main or side deck for <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> if they scare you too much.

Shaddoll monsters, in general, are a problem, given how heavily they combat Special Summoned monsters. Given how heavily Redoer and other Extra Deck monsters are used in the deck, it's no surprise as far as the challenge they pose. If your fingers are crossed, a good Lost Wind will hopefully send them home packing after an activation and some sound thinking from there on out.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
At the end of the day, Time Thieves show a ton of potential given the way they run and the surprise of being on the receiving end of them. And I believe that with enough support and close planning, they could very well become a meta deck someday.
