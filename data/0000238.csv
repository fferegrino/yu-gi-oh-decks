This can be used to manipulate the field, making your opponent cautious to destroy spell/traps as it could be a monster. If they don't destroy your cards you can't have monsters, so plenty of quick-play spells that destroy your artifact cards have been included. Because every artifact card is rank 5, it is very easy to summon Xyz monsters, so plenty of powerful Xyz monsters, along with F0 utopia and F0 draco utopia have been included. ""Artifact Failnought"" can be used to place artifact cards that are in the GY into the spell zone to be destroyed, while ""Artifact Moralttach"" is used to destroy cards your opponent controls. Another pro this deck has is that the cards that summon your artifact monsters can also destroy your opponent's spells. When playing this deck you have to make sure that you are setting the artifact monsters first and then destroying them with spells during your opponents turn to activate their effects."

Despite the uniqueness of the main engine being based around the FA archetype, you might notice that Halqifibrax is the card that makes this deck truly consistent, as such you might consider this another Halqifibrax turbo deck, despite this, the FA archetype does provide some interesting utility that other decks don't.</span>  <span>I'll be breaking down the choices made in the deck-building process down below.</span>  <span><em><span>Main Deck:</span></em></span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Hang On Mach"">FA Hang On Mach</a> </strong>- This is your main FA level four monster and almost every time this is also the card that is going to start your combo along with Auto Navigator, it also offers the backup plan of a macro cosmos that is unaffected by the activated effects of your opponent's monsters, pair this with the main field spell City Grand Prix and you'll have an untargetable monster that is quite the play disruptor </span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Auto Navigator"">FA Auto Navigator</a> </strong>- This is the glue that makes the plays happen, it opens up your deck and fetches you the field spells that make your level modulation plays possible pairing this with UA hyper stadium makes the deck quite consistent, you'll almost always want to see this card</span>  <span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;FA&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Dark Dragster&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>FA</strong> <strong>Dark Dragster</strong></a> - This card is your main combo extender with the archetype, as such you'll be searching this when you already have Hang On Mach and Auto Navigator it gives you options for going into level 10 synchros and also offers a destruction effect for going second to help break boards, generally you'll go into this after making Dawn Dragster but this card can also be easily summoned with a Hang on Mach and City/Off-Road Grand Prix</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Celestial"">Destiny HERO - Celestial</a></strong> - Pretty self-explanatory, draw two from the grave</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dasher"">Destiny HERO - Dasher</a></strong> - A free special summon, also pretty self-explanatory</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> </strong>- This is the main combo maker off of Halqifribrax you'll also realize that the summon of this card is the main choke point of the deck, simply having Halqifibrax ash blossomed at this point will kill your combo, it's also one of the ""soft"" garnets in your deck as drawing this won't stop you from combing but will net you one less card in hand</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing"">Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing</a> </strong>- This is the single card in your deck that you absolutely never want to see, this deck does have a backup combo that you can try to play into in the event that this card is in your opening hand but it's not optimal, you'll summon this off of Auroradon</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Test Run"">FA Test Run</a></strong> - This is one of the best cards in the FA archetype, it's non-targeting destruction on a quickplay spell, unfortunately, it does need to change the battle position of an FA monster in order to resolve but this also doubles as a play starter since it special summons from the deck. Unfortunately, it's quite bricky in the deck so you only run one since you can search this off of any of the main FA field spells' destruction</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""UA Hyper Stadium"">UA Hyper Stadium</a></strong> - Fetches you any of your FA monsters and also allows for a second normal summon allowing you to set up the easiest way to get into Halqifibrax in the deck, normal summoning both Hang On Mach and Auto Navigator with the effect of this card</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA City Grand Prix"">FA City Grand Prix </a></strong> - The strongest level modulation and protection effect in the deck, you'll want to end on this card if possible but for the sake of the combo most of the time, unless you have a way to open the combo with Dark Dragster in which case you'd add this card and go into Baronne/Ruddy Rose</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Off-Road Grand Prix"">FA Off-Road Grand Prix </a></strong>- Another field spell that modulates level only in the main phase, you'll only really end on this card if you don't have any other options, this also lets you go into Baronne/Ruddy Rose if you have Dark Dragster but otherwise it is simply in the deck to help start the combo. It does have a delinquent duo effect upon the battle destruction of your FA monsters but you'll almost never see it occur due to the end board of this deck</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Circuit Grand Prix"">FA Circuit Grand Prix</a></strong> - This is simply used to modulate the level of Dawn Dragster at the end of the combo to get Auto Navigator out one last time to synchro summon Herald Of The Arc Light</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> </strong>- Gets you one of your field spells, usually, you'll add Hyper Stadium. This is essentially the Upstart Goblin of your deck</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Piri Reis Map"">Piri Reis Map</a></strong> - The most recent consistency booster printed in BROL, it gets you any of your mainline FA monsters sans Dark Dragster as you can't normal summon it, you'll most commonly add Auto Navigator</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Pot Of Prosperity"">Pot Of Prosperity</a></strong> - Another consistency booster that allows you to not only allows you to search for combo pieces but also gets you your side deck cards and any other back row disruption in the deck, the restriction doesn't clash at all with the FA search effects making this card an obvious inclusion, it is however not necessary to play this card at all the deck functions very well without it and you can simply slot in more play extenders instead of these.</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a> </strong>- Gets you DPE, in the deck to increase the top end power of the deck but also the grind game potential</span>  <span>The remaining cards in the deck can really be anything you want, this list runs Ash, Droplets and a few one-ofs but you have options to tune the deck according to the match-ups you think you'll have to deal with</span>  <span><em><span>Extra</span></em><span> Deck:</span></span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> </strong>- As stated in the explanation of Fusion Destiny this card is simply in the deck to increase the top end power but allows you to play the grind game against decks like Striker and the likes of</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> </strong>- This simply is your backup plan to get into DPE, this is an easy banish for Prosperity oi you feel you won't need it</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></strong> - Your main combo maker you'll want to make this almost every time, this is also your combo's main choke point try to bait out the Ash Blossom with a Piri Reis Map or Prosperity if you feel like you have the combo already</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a> </strong>- This is what you'll link into after making Halqifibrax, you can bait the Nibiru out with the summon of this card as the tokens summon regardless of whether or not the Auroradon is tributed at the very least you can make a Baronne</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a></strong> - An onmi-negate on a level 4 synchro you'll end on this along with Borrel Savage and Dawn Dragster most of the time</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Crystron Quandax"">Crystron Quandax</a></strong> - A combo piece for the main combo; a level 4 synchro tuner</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Garden Rose Flora"">Garden Rose Flora</a></strong> - A great alternative combo starter if your Halifibrax combo is offline, keep in mind you won't be able to summon DPE because of this cards restriction so this is the less preferable option most of the time</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a></strong> - Your out to Dragoon as well as other undestroyable monsters</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Dawn Dragster"">FA Dawn Dragster</a> </strong>- Your main level 7 synchro works well with the combo to get you one more omni-negate with its level modulation effect in combination with Auto Navigator, also a spell and trap negate</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a></strong> - An omni-negate that slot well into the Halqifibrax combo, also one of the beefiest bodies in the deck</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Motorhome Transport"">FA Motorhome Transport</a></strong> - A beefy body that is tuned in the grind game, pairing it with City Grand Prix makes for a monster with Dragoon level protection</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Ruddy Rose Dragon"">Ruddy Rose Dragon</a> </strong>- An alternate level 10 synchro monster to Baronne, it'll win you a lot of game against a deck like Lyrilusc Tri-Brigade that rely on the graveyard to make plays</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a></strong> - The go-to generic level 10 synchro monster, if you're playing a synchro deck that doesn't include this monster you must be crazy (or broke)</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> </strong>- An big unaffected beat stick, you can also go into this with any level 1 synchro after being Nibiru'd</span>  <span><em><span>Additional Options for the deck:</span></em></span>  <span>There are quite a lot of cards in the deck that can be fairly expensive to play, thankfully the deck is very flexible so you can play around with the cards quite a bit.</span>  <span>DPE - This can be replaced with a Rainbow Neos engine if you wanna still have an alternate boss monster in the deck otherwise, you can simply replace the entire package with more play extenders or hand traps</span>  <span>Prosperity - Again can be replaced with more play extenders</span>  <span>Baronne - Any synchro that provides utility can replace Baronne, you simply run it in the deck because it's the best level 10</span>  <span>I've talked about play extenders a lot without actually showing what they are so we'll talk about them here.</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Cockadoodledoo"">Cockadoodledoo</a></strong> - This is just a simple tuner that synergizes well with the wind attribute of this deck</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Speedroid Terrortop"">Speedroid Terrortop</a></strong> - A simple wind machine that can get you into the combo</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Speedroid Taketomborg"">Speedroid Taketomborg</a></strong> - Another simple wind machine that special summons itself</span>  <span><em>The Combo:</em></span>  <span>For those that like a video to follow along with click <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/GIqgqGpUUA8"">here.</a></span>  <span>The main combo line will start with trying to get two monsters, one being a tuner, to try and get out Halqifibrax, from here you simply summon the Deskbot 001 from the deck, link 3 into Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon get 3 tokens, summon the Deckbot 001 from the grave with its effect, synchro 4 for a Quandax, use Auroradon's effect to tribute two tokens and summon a Phantom Beast from the deck, get Coltwing, summon the two tokens, and then synchro into Dawn Dragster and Borrel Savage. At this point, there are a bunch of extenders you could try going for, but you'll likely end with a Herald of the Arclight or a Baronne de Fleur/Ruddy Rose. It may seem like a lot but it's pretty straightforward once you get a hang of it.</span>  <span>This combo is quite fragile and can be disrupted fairly easily by a lot of decks so you'll be a victim of games that feel like you lose at the coin flip but you have many options for going second. </span>  <span><strong>Keep in mind<em>, </em></strong>this isn't the only combo in the deck simply just the most straightforward and simple, I implore you to play around with the deck and find combos that also work.</span>  <span><em><span>Side Deck:</span></em></span>  <span>In this list I play just the usual sides:</span> <span>Dark Ruler helps with playing into a board for turn 2</span> <span>Nibiru helps you beat hard combo decks before they set up the board</span> <span>Droll And Lock also help you lock out decks that rely on searching</span> <span>Comic Cyclone beats mystic mine</span> <span>Anti-Spell helps you beat dark ruler after you've done your combo</span>  <span>As stated previously with 10 flexible slots in this deck and prosperity in the main deck you'll de very likely to see your side deck so consider your options as this list isn't at all concrete.</span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Now you can play the mildly interesting link wyrm deck,"You know how everyone has that one deck? The deck they default to when they want to play Yu-Gi-Oh? This is my deck. Tenyis are one of my all-time favorite archetypes and this might be the last format in a long time that you can play the deck completely unhit. Thanks to Swordsouls and their Wyrm-ness slurping up any cool Wyrm cards for their deck to abuse, Tenyis are sitting in the top tier of the current metagame. And unlike the boring token generators, they aren't new cards. So, as one final hurrah for the greatest archetype to ever grace Yu-Gi-Oh, let's take a look at Tenyi.  I'm pretty sure everyone knows how Tenyis work by now, but in case you don't I'll give a quick summary. Tenyis are a deck that supports non-effect monsters by swarming the board if you only control non-effect monsters and then gaining effects to be banished from the hand or GY to apply a powerful effect if you control a single non-effect monster. Each main deck Tenyi has a different of these second effects and they vary in power from a free special summon from deck to a simple combat trick.  Going through the main deck, the first and most important Tenyi is Ashuna. This card fucking rocks and if you open it, you can end on the best boards the deck can produce. Its effect is the best of all the main deck Tenyis and allows a special summon of a Tenyi from deck with a simple xeno-lock afterwards. Run three until they ban it on the next list for Swordsoul's sins. The next card is Vishuda, another level 7 that instead of providing advantage, it provides a targeted bounce of one card your opponent controls. Again, run three. It might not be the most amazing removal on Earth, but removal is still removal.  The next group of Tenyis are the level 4s. None of these cards have amazing effects, but a pure Tenyi deck needs as many Tenyis as you can run. Nahata is by far the worst of the Tenyis as it only provides a 1500 ATK boost to a non-effect monster. Run at least one since you need Tenyis in deck, but don't max out on it. Next is Mapura which provides a quick negate to any card that targets a non-effect monster. Pretty decent, but most effects don't target nowadays and most players would just target your effect monsters if they see this in grave. Run two or three depending on how much you want that protection. Shthana is the last level 4 and it's by far the best. It gives the deck recoverability that it desperately needs in order to maintain board presence. Run three.  The last main deck Tenyi is Adhara. It's a level 1 tuner which comes up once every 90000 games, but its effect is by far the best part about it. Since your Tenyis end up banished all the time, Adhara just lets you get them back to your hand. Now all the Tenyi effects are hard once per turns, but at least you aren't topdecking for your next turn's plays. Run three and if Konami hits this card, just cry like I will.  The Tenyi spells and traps are extremely good cards as well. Dragon Circle is your search card if dumped off of Foolish Burial Goods, or it can turn your non-effect monsters into Lonefires for Wyrms. Run three. Vessel is the deck's archetypal Foolish Burial and helps set up Tenyis in grave as well as that funky little sea horse we have yet to mention. Also run three. Flawless Perfection turns your non-effect monsters into Towers monsters and gives a Pot of Greed if your opponent special summons while you control a non-effect. Depending on how deep you want to be in the non-effect boss, run one or max out. Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi is an archetypal Solemn that I basically never use. Run a few if you know for a fact you will die without negation on board, otherwise just ignore it.  The last main deck cards are pretty self-explanatory. Avarice recycles your links and main deck Tenyis so you don't run out of resources. Foolish Burial Goods lets you use Dragon Circle's better effect. Foolish Burial Not-Goods is your fourth copy of Vessel. Handtraps are handtraps, and you can change the ratios/the actual handtraps by preference. And finally Mare Mare. It's a token generator that you can summon off of one of the Tenyi links. Three tokens to be exact. And those tokens help with link climbing to your best possible boards or even dipping into the hard-to-reach synchro portion of the Extra Deck. I only run one to avoid bricks, but you can run three without losing too much power since it can be discarded for cost of one of their links.  Onto the Extra Deck. Monk is your starter card. Without it, you have no plays. Run three and recycle them often. Next is Shaman. This is your gateway to the sea horse. It lets you revive a Wyrm as long as you discard a card for cost. Now, this Wyrm can be the discarded card. Seeing a pattern? This is the sole reason Mare Mare can be run at more than one as it can be pitched for cost and revived by the same effect. Run two or three depending on how pure you want to be. Draco Masters is a pretty solid card going second. It gives a non-targeting destruction of effect monsters as long as it's the only effect monster you control. Pretty situationally useful given how few board states sit on no effect monsters in this deck (ironic I know), so just run the one. Berserker of the Tenyi is the first of your three boss monsters. As a non-effect monster, it benefits from all of the Tenyi effects as well as Flawless Perfection, but it is just a big dude. Run one or two depending on how many techs you add to your Extra Deck. Sahasrara is the second boss monster of the deck. Gives a token that copies an opponent's monster's stats and then provides protection to your Effect Monsters. Really fucking good, but you'll only ever need one given how recursive the deck is with three Avarice. The final boss monster of the archetype is Draco Berserker of the Tenyi. It gives a quick banish when an effect monster activates its effect (doesn't negate mind you) and can get to some insanely high ATK values if it battles effect monsters. Run one since that's exactly how many synchros you will ever have on field at once in the deck.  Finally, the tech cards. This covers the rest of the Extra and Side Decks. I:P Masquerena is a really solid card in this deck since you can use Mare Mare tokens to make it. The only issue is you usually run into the xeno-locks of the deck during the turns you use that effect, so don't rely on it too much. And with every Masquerena comes an Avramax. Same basic issue as with I:P, but it's a hell of a boss monster if you can bring it out. Apollousa has the same issue, but if you can avoid too many xeno-locks and make it, you get effect negation which is something the deck natively lacks. Another great option is Accesscode. Arguably way better than any card I just mentioned and provides a really quick finisher to the deck. I just hate this card. Yazi and Baxia are cool Synchro techs that get around your xeno-locks 9 times out of 10 and they can help clear boards in some cases.  In the side deck we have a few tech cards as well as general side deck stuff, so it won't be as in-depth. Lava Golem is such a good card in Tenyi thanks to how little they use their normal summon. Just swap it with a Kaiju if you know you never go against people who leave two monsters on board. Ryu Okami is honestly a pretty bad card with how good Dogmatikas have become, but it's a weird floodgate-esque effect that can impact some decks. Just don't side it in if your opponent is on Dogmatika or any other deck that doesn't care if their Extra Deck goes to grave. Mystery Shell Dragon is one of three Wyrm normal monsters, and the only you can normal summon without tribute. I've run into some board states where the Tenyis in hand have no way to make it on board so having a main deck non-effect monster isn't too bad. It just tends to make more bricks then it's worth. Backrow removal is cool and good and Called By is still a hell of a card.  And that about covers the deck. Sorry for the wall of non-colored text, but if you've seen my other decks you should know this is pretty much my standard. This build is definitely far from perfect, so please leave suggestions on how I could improve it. Before the banlist comes out that is. Poor Ashuna. Rip in kill sweet prince.  (Now watch me be wrong and they just ban Protos instead. Please Konami, Ashuna did nothing wrong)"

I again found some cards that would make it better, and here it is! The deck contains:  Main:  3 Luster Dragon- Here only as a material for ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon""  3 Nexus- Banish 4 opponent's monsters from GY to be special summoned, destroys all ATK position extra deck monsters, AND inflicts 800 damage for each destroyed. Ideal if your opponent plays Invoked.  3 Fleurdelis- Very easy to special summon, negates effects of an extra deck monster and makes all Dogmatikas gain 500 ATK.  3 Ashyan- Easy to summon, adds a monster from the GY to the hand, and makes all Dogmatikas gain 500 ATK.  3 Theo- Easy to summon, cannot be destroyed by battle and transfers 600 ATK from an opponent's monster to itself.  3 Ecclesia- Literally does 70% of support to a whole deck.  3 Adin- Easy to summon, special summons a Dogmatika monster from the deck.  3 Shaddoll Beast- Requires 1 tribute to be set, +1 if flips, and +1 more if destroyed by effect.  3 White Knight- You cannot summon extra deck monsters, but you can destroy an extra deck monster directly from each extra deck.  3 Dogmatikalamity- Used just to summon White Knight.  1 Nation- Only one because you can add it with ""Terraforming"". All dogmatikas are immune to the extra deck monsters' effects and destroy a battling monster instead of  themself.  1 Terraforming- Limited, so only one we can have.  1 Monster Reborn- Limited, so only one we can have.  3 Greater Poly- Very good fusion card, because you can fuse ANY 3 monsters to summon ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"".  1 Encounter- Not the best, but useful.  2 Infinite Impermanence- A cheap version of ""Ash Blossom"".  3 Genesis- Returns your banished Extra deck monster and negates opponent's.  3 Quaking Mirror Force- A medusa from Greece mythology, turned into a mirror force. XD  Extra:  1 Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon- Super broken and surely the best ever fusion monster.  1 Number 39: Utopia- Not really the best, but very easy to summon.  1 Divine Arsenal AA ZEUS- Sky Thunder- Easy to summon, has at least 2 Xyz materials when summoned, and does a ""Black Hole"" effect, saves itself  from it, and all of that with a price of just 2 Xyz materials.  1 Decode Talker- Super generic and very easy to summon, it is one of the cards that can level up every weak deck.  1 Decode Talker Extended- The same as the normal ""Decode Talker"", but stronger.  1 Accesscode Talker- Very generic, and also very strong. The upgraded version of previous two Talkers.  1 Predaplant Verte Anaconda- A very good fusion support for ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"".  Side:  3 Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring- one of the best hand traps ever, screws pretty much everything.  3 Effect Veiler- Simply negates the effects of one monster.  3 Twin Twisters- Destroys two spell/traps on the field.  3 Super Poly- One of the best (if not the best) fusion cards in history.  &nbsp;  Note: You can use ''Cyber-Stein'' instead of Greater and Super polymerization, not just to save some money, but also because it's more useful."

There are other options for going first with negates and disruptions, but it mainly depends on the deck you're going against as you'll usually have a couple routes you can take with a hand. The Mekk-Knight cards can support really well with helping with rank 5 and rank 8 xyz plays, and can also be used to bait negates if you can go into your OTK plays without them."

You have some great water synchros at your disposal too like dragite and archethys. So how do you achieve this?  How you get penguins to be so good is that you have an in archtype rescue rabbut that you can use multiple times per turn. Here's the combo I came up with:  Get Great Emperor Penguin out on the field in some way  use its effect to summon penguin ninja and puny penguin  use ninja's effect to set puny, then activate squire from your hand to special summon it  use squire's effect to flip puny back up, now making puny live  use squire and puny to go into halq  use puny's effect on CL 1, the hlaq on CL2  Halq will summon Deep Sea Diva and puny will bring back Emp  use Emp again to bring out Nopenguin and polar penguin  go into penguin brave with Nope and polar, this is important because Nope will come back  Penguin brave will activate its effect to set penguin soldier, and the Nopenguin will activate its mandatory effect to special summon itself from the graveyard  then you go into Deep Sea Repititeur with Nope and diva  then go into dragite with your ninja and Repititeur  repititeur will be able to bring back Emp one final time so you can use the effect again to bring out any two penguin monsters, preferably 2 nightmare penguin to go into bahamut shark and bring out Toadally Awesome, but you can go into other stuff with maybe another level 6 synchro.  That's the strategy I came up with, you won't be able to pull it off 24/7 but it stops a lot decks. Feel free to side whatever you want like other floodgates or hand traps and adjust how you see fit."

The 6th version of my first real deck I've owned in real life. None of the,"<p><span>This is an improvement of an older version of this deck with the same name. If you're curious about that deck, you can view it here: https://ygoprodeck.com/wrath-of-the-conductor/</span></p> <span>This was the first deck I posted to YGOPRO. Since then, new cards were discovered, and new strategies were developed, so even when a deck seems finished, it isn't. Usually. This one is. I'm tired of reworking this one, and I'm finally satisfied with the way it performs. The old version relied on summoning <span>Ultimate Tyranno Conductor</span> and maintaining his field presence. This version still does that, but adds in a new gimmick revolving around the Field Spell card, <span>Lost World</span>. I'll explain <span>Lost World</span> first, and the other cards that boost it's functionality.</span>  <span>First and foremost, <span>Terraforming</span> is used for instant access to <span>Lost World</span>. What exactly does <span>Lost World</span> do? A lot. Immediately, all non-Dinosaur monsters lose 500 ATK/DEF. That's pretty busted right there, but we're not done yet. Once per turn, when a Dinosaur monster is Normal or Special Summoned (Extra Deck included), a Jurraegg Token is generated on your opponent's side of the field. While they control this token, no monsters, other than tokens, can be targeted by their card effects. Now hang on, we're still not done yet. When a Normal monster anywhere on the field would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can destroy Dinosaurs in your hand or deck instead. Quick reminder that Tokens are treated as Normal monsters. That might not seem like the best idea, but it is. Let's find out why.</span>  <span>There are 2 monsters in particular to use the destruction effect of Lost World on. These are going to be <span>Babycerasaurus</span>, and <span>Petiteranodon</span>. They have effects that trigger when they are destroyed by card effect, and it doesn't matter if they are in your hand or not. To do this, first Normal Summon a Dinosaur monster, preferably something like <span>Souleating Oviraptor</span>, or <span>Black Brachios</span>. This will generate said Token to your opponent's field. Next, while a token is present on your opponent's field, declare an attack, then activate <span>Lost World</span>. Rather than destroying one of the tokens by battle, you will destroy one of your own monsters instead. <span>Babycerasaurus</span> allows you to Special Summon a <span>Level 4</span> or lower Dinosaur monster from your deck. Your best bet here is either going to be <span>Souleating Oviraptor</span>, whose effect can still trigger from Special Summoning, <span>Scrap Raptor</span>, the decks one and only Tuner monster, or <span>Megalosmasher X</span>, who has 2000 ATK. When <span>Petiterandon</span> is chosen, you Special Summon a <span>Level 4</span> or higher monster from your deck. This is obviously the better option, and lets you immediately summon <span>Ultimate Tyranno</span>, or <span>Frostosaurus</span>. (only choose <span>Frostosaurus</span> if <span>Ultimate Tyranno</span> is elsewhere). These cards only lose their functionality if you somehow have all of your high-tier monsters in your hand or Graveyard; the monsters Special Summoned by the baby dinosaurs effects come straight from the deck. After this has been done 1 or 2 times, and your hand and/or field is set up with all the important cards you need, you can start attacking the tokens.</span>  <span>""But BallinFatty, what did all that accomplish? All the Tokens are in defense Position, and we can't inflict piercing damage"". Right you are. Allow me introduce <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span>, our solution to this ""problem"", that we purposely created. This behemoth of a T-Rex can only be Special Summoned by banishing 2 Dinosaurs from the Graveyard. Assuming you were using <span>Lost World</span> as optimally as possible, <span>Babycerasaurus</span>, and <span>Petiteranodon</span> among many others who have already activated their effects should be there by now. By this time, you should also already have this card in your hand, most of your other high level dinosaurs on the field, and several Jurraegg Tokens on your opponent's side of the field. One last thing this guy can do, if your opponent happens to control any Attack Position monsters, you can destroy 1 monster in your hand or field, which changes all your opponents monsters into face-down Defense Position. This is also a potential way to trigger <span>Babycerasaurus</span>/<span>Petiteranodon's</span> effects. Once your field is set up, and <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> is ready, enter the Battle Phase. <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> can attack all monsters your opponent controls, (which should consist mostly of Defense Position Jurraegg Tokens) instantly destroying any Defense Position monsters, removing the possibility of Flip effects activating, while inflicting 1000 points of damage in the process. It should go without saying, but during this time, you don't want to activate <span>Lost World's <span>effect</span></span>. Once the field is clear of monsters, if you have enough remaining attack power on your field, you could potentially win the game by attacking with the rest of your Dinosaurs.</span>  <span>Now that the main gimmick of the deck has been covered, let's take a brief look at the other monsters we have in the Main Deck:</span>  <span><span><em><span>Frostosaurus</span>:</em></span> A Normal monster with 2600 ATK, only requiring 1 Tribute. Can be easily summoned using <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> if it leaves the field for whatever reason. Not a bad choice for <span>Petiteranodon</span> if your Tyrannos are already present.</span> <span><span><em><span>Megalosmasher X</span></em></span>: Solid 2000 ATK, <span>Level 4</span> Normal monster. Useful for <span>Synchro</span>/<strong>XYZ</strong> summoning.</span> <span><span><em>Black Brachios</em></span>: Useful for revealing face-down monsters, or disrupting a high powered attacker.</span> <span><span><em>Miscellaneousaurus</em></span>: Can be discarded to protect your monsters from effects during the Main Phase, fulfilling one half of <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno's</span> Special Summon condition. Has a Special Summon effect that doesn't see much use unless the duel goes on for a very long time, and you have at least 4 Dinosaurs in your Graveyard.</span> <span><span><em>Scrap Raptor</em></span>: The decks only Tuner monster, and the only <span>Level 4</span> Dinosaur Tuner that exists at all, at the time of writing. It's effect only functions within the Scrap archetype, so it is ignored in this deck.</span> <span><span><em>Souleating Oviraptor</em></span>: One of the most important monsters in this deck. Can be used to add any Dinosaur from the deck to either your hand, or Graveyard. This can get you <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> early on, can provide you with your Tuner, or if <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> is set, instant access to <span>Frostosaurus</span> or <span>Ultimate Tyranno</span>.</span> <span><span><em><span>Ultimate Tyranno</span></em></span>: Similar to <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span>, but without the ability to instantly destroy Defense Position monsters. If this monster is on your field, it must attack every monster your opponent controls before your other monsters can attack. Try not to use this guy when <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> is present.</span>  <span>Now for the Spells and Traps:</span>  <span><em><span><span>Fossil Dig</span></span></em>: Used to grab any <span>Level 6</span> or lower Dinosaur from the deck, which is every monster aside from either of the Tyrannos.</span> <span><em><span><span>Call Of The Haunted</span></span></em>: Revives any fallen monster from your Graveyard. Note that <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> can be Special Summoned with this card, as long as it was Special Summoned via it's own effect first before ending up in the Graveyard.</span> <span><em><span><span>Paleozoic Canadia</span></span></em>: Changes one of your opponent's monsters to Face-down Defense Position. Useful for disrupting powerful attackers, or setting up targets for <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> to massacre. Once per chain, you can Summon this card from the Graveyard as a Normal Monster, providing yourself <span>Lost World</span> fodder, or preparation for a special <strong>XYZ</strong> monster lurking in the Extra Deck.</span> <span><em><span><span>Paleozoic Olenoides</span></span></em>: Destroys 1 Spell or Trap on the field. Once per chain, you can Summon this card from the Graveyard as a Normal Monster, providing yourself <span>Lost World</span> fodder, or preparation for a special <strong>XYZ</strong> monster lurking in the Extra Deck.</span> <span><em><span><span>Seven Tools Of The Bandit</span></span></em>: Negates Trap Cards at the cost of 1000 Life Points. </span> <span><em><span><span>Survival Of The Fittest</span></span></em>: Adds 1000 ATK to any Dinosaur. Most useful on the <span>Level 4</span> monsters, as the higher level ones already have huge attack powers and can clear the field easily. Destroying a monster with the ATK boosts allows the monster to make a second attack on monsters. Useless on both Tyrannos, as they already have access to multiple attacks per Battle Phase</span>  <span>Finally, lets take a look at the Extra Deck:</span>  <span><em><span><span>Dinowrestler Giga Spinosavate</span></span></em>: [1 Dinosaur Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters] The deck's only <span>Synchro Monster</span>. This monster is very powerful. It becomes the attack magnet while it is face-up, it can destroy a single monster once per turn, your opponent cannot activate Spells/Traps while it is attacking, and you can sacrifice another card you control if this guy would be destroyed. A great target for <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> if it somehow gets taken out. Can easily be <span>Synchro Summoned</span> using <span>Scrap Raptor</span> and almost any other Dinosaur in the deck.</span> <span><em><span><strong>Evolzar Dollka</strong></span></em>: [2 <span>Level 4</span> Dinosaur monsters] Useful for negating monster effects. Can be done twice using it's material.</span> <span><em><span><strong>Evolzar Laggia</strong></span></em>: [2 <span>Level 4</span> Dinosaur monsters] The most versatile of the 3 <strong>XYZ's</strong>, <strong>Laggia</strong> can negate a single Summon, or Spell/Trap activation.</span> <span><em><span><strong>Evolzar Solda</strong></span></em>: [2 <span>Level 6</span> Dinosaur monsters] Very rarely used, I just included with the rest of the Evolzar's so he wouldn't feel left out. If you do manage to get this guy out, he is immune to effect destruction while he has material, and can detach 1 material to destroy your opponents Special Summons.</span> <span><em><span><strong>Paleozoic Anomalocaris</strong></span></em>: Requires 3 or more <span>Level 2</span> monsters to <strong>XYZ Summon</strong>. The Paleozoic Traps fulfill this condition when they are resurrected from the Graveyard as monsters. This thing looks cool as hell, and has a decent destruction effect along with 2400 ATK. By detaching a material that was originally a Trap Card (<span>Paleozoic Canadia</span> and <span>Olenoides</span>), you can destroy one card on the field.</span> <span><em><span><span>Trackblack</span></span></em>: **DISCLAIMER: THIS CARD IS NOT RELEASED IN THE TCG**. Despite that, I have tested it out in the downloadable game ""Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dawn Of A New Era"" which has access to most every card in existence, and is constantly being updated. This monster requires 2 Effect monsters to Summon. You can target 1 monster this card points to, once per turn, when it destroys a monster, you draw 1 card. Makes an excellent combo when either <span>Ultimate Tyranno</span> or <span>Frostosaurus</span> are being looked at. This effect does not work with <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span>, as his attacks that destroy face-down monsters is considered an effect.</span> <span><em><span><span>Agave Dragon</span></span></em>: A powerful <span>Link Monster</span> with a <span>Link Rating of 4</span>, this monstrosity has many effects, dependent upon the type of monsters used to Summon it. Since this deck only has Dinosaurs, it will see a considerable boost to it's ATK power once Summoned. This card is multi-purpose and also works well in any deck containing a high number of Dragon, Dinosaurs, Sea Serpent, and Wyrms.</span>  <span>That about does it for this deck. Normally I would encourage other ideas and constructive criticism from others, but this is the 6th time I've reworked this deck, and I have no intentions of changing it again. This is the way it is now, and I'm content with that. If you enjoy Dinosaurs, and Non-archetypal decks, give this deck a try. It's very satisfying, with a unique playstyle when <span>Lost World</span> is present, and honestly, any deck that contains Dinosaurs will benefit immensely from <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span>. He is extremely powerful, incredibly easy to Summon, and if you're playing in real life, a single copy costs less than a dollar. I've seen someone run this thing in a Shaddoll deck, which was very impressive and not expected at all.</span>"

Dimension guardian will keep her destroyed but the main draw back is kiwi will be in attack for at least the turn this trap is activated. I am pretty sure once activated Kiwi can be switched to defense. Other than that Quintet is the main monster play especially with Kiwi so that he can not be targeted. A lot of other plays can be made depending on the hand you start with and draw into. Fun deck but can be very bricky.

Typically, your end boards consist of caeser (2 solemn warnings), makina with a dark contract on the field (a weird kind of hope harbinger for monsters that doesnt negate), siegfreid (hot red dragon archfiend abyss for spells and traps) and dark contract with the eternal darkness (continuous trap that locks the opponent from tributing for a tribute summon (flunderezze), fusing monsters from the field or using monsters for a synchro or xyz materials. It also provides nifty protection. It can usually do this around nib (berfomet change a dd to lvl six overlay with lil gengis and make caeser) and can play around dark ruler (hint: respond to dark ruler with eternal darkness then chain siegfried negate). It can play through a through  disruptions, but not a fully established board (in most cases). Thats why we have a side deck. It is a fun, semi-competitive, reasonably budget but pretty damn hard to play deck. The combo lines vary a lot and it can take a bit of thinking to find the ideal route. Have fun!"

Also includes a few generic budget cards to boost the overall power level of the deck.  <strong>Game Strategy</strong>: Can reliably summon an Evil HERO fusion in one turn, and all HEROs in the deck can be used as Mask Change targets. If two HEROs are on the field, can Link Summon Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer to search fusion materials from the deck while also increasing the attack of Evil HEROs it points to. A Hero Lives can summon Elemental HERO Shadow Mist to search Mask Change in a single turn. Supreme King's Castle can be used to boost the attack of an Evil HERO in battle against another monster - and can send the Evil HERO Dark Gaia in the Extra Deck to increase by 1600 ATK. Raigeki and Red Reboot are generic cards to improve power level when going second, while the three Solemn Warning are generic cards to improve power level when going first instead.  <strong>Budget Upgrades</strong>: Obvious picks would be going for Evil HERO Malicious Bane, Evil HERO Adusted Gold, and Evil HERO Sinister Necrom to boost the overall power level and consistency of the deck. E -Emergency Call can also improve the deck's consistency. Can also go for extra copies of Keeper of Dragon Magic, Elemental HERO Prisma, and Elemental HERO Shadow Mist."

Game 1 we play Mekk-Knight Orcust, pretty fun and basic Mekk-Knight stuff with some Orcust combos on the side after youv'e made your Mekk plays thanks to Girsu.  Game 2 we side out <strong>ALL</strong> the Orcust cards. This includes; World Wand, Knightmare, 2x GIrsu, Skele, Bombard, Crescendo, Return, Instant Fusion, Card Destruction, Winda, Dingirsu, Galatea. And we put in all the Crusadia cards.  Mekk-Crusadia is also pretty swell, basic Mekk-Knight stuff, with the capability to OTK thanks to the Crusadia cards.  Instant Fusion + Winda is actually very good for reasons other than Dingirsu, can use her for Link 2 material, bring her back with Succ for some bullying, but can also bring her back with Secrets as it grabs any level 5+ monster. Something very obvious but I figured it's worth mentioning anyway.  Some notes, Card Destruction is there because I needed a 15th card to side out and I thought it would be fun and dumb to include in the list, could probably find something more useful to have there like, literally any 1 off. Clara &amp; Rushika is there for if you've bricked going second with only an Orcust normal summon and Mekk-Knights in hand, can use it in MP2 to make Mekk plays, not a good card should probably run Linkuriboh for the Girsu token but Linkuriboh isn't cute girls so it didn't make the cut  Also, the deck has next to no goign first plays. Unless you open Girsu or a Crusadia monster, you have 0 going first cards.  &nbsp;"

It's a ritual combo deck that abuses the non-hard once per turn on ritual summon effects of their level-4 ritual monsters to gain advantage, and their ability to use those monsters to ritual summon more Megalith monsters or any other ritual monsters. This combined with the fact that they are rock monsters and thus could use Gallant Granite to search, the Adamancipator monsters as tuner extenders for Crystron Halqifibrax, and Block Dragon as a repeatable +3 allowed the deck to see niche high-level play during 2020. The archetype was also released on Duel Links in Chronicle of Glory in July 2020 and would see niche play there too especially after the release of Xyz monsters to that game as a deck that could repeatedly destroy 2-6 cards with Megalith Bethor, then attack for large amounts of damage using Megalith Phaleg's boost and could search cards like Cyber Angel Dakini as an out to Invoked Cocytus or make use of a toolbox of Rank-4 and Rank-8 Xyz monsters. In Common Charity then deck functions similar to the Duel Links version in some regards, the deck is built to repeatedly destroy the opponents' cards with Bethor, gaining advantage through the deck's field spell, Megalith Portal, and continuous trap, Megalith Emergence, it has access to a toolbox of Rank-4 and Rank-8 Xyz monsters like Time Thief Redoer, Tornado Dragon, or Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon and it can deal with opposing strategies through searchable cards like Cyber Angel Dakini, Amorphactor Pain, or Artifact Lancea, but it also has access to some of the most powerful set-up pieces of the archetype, Megalith Unformed, which allows you to ritual summon from the deck by tributing twice that monsters level, and Megalith Phul, a level-2 ritual monster that on ritual summon adds a ritual monster from your GY and becomes that monsters level and can ritual summon Megalith monsters from the deck by tributing monsters from hand or field during both players' main phases. Additionally, the deck plays well into some of the more common removal in the format - Kaijus. Most of the boards the deck makes lose very little to a Kaiju, you can still pop 2-4 on your opponent's main phase using Bethor's effect if you bring back Phul using Emergence, and you can use the Kaiju as ritual material, Jizikiru and Dogoran can be the entire requirement for summoning a level-8 Megalith using Phul or the level-8s, the level-4 monsters can use themselves and a Raidan in order to summon a high-level ritual monster, and Dogaran specifically can be used as the entire requirement to summon a level-4 monster off of Unformed or be overlayed with another level-8 to make one of the deck's rank-8 monsters.  2-Card Combos  This Version of Megalith is built around having multliple two-card combos that set up Phul + Portal + Emergance. There are 2 main ways the deck facilitates this Unformed and Advanced Ritual Art. Each of these two card combos can be expanded upon in different ways depending on the other cards in your hand, and most combos that don't start with a piece tend to do similar things just with a higher investment.  Unformed + Senju/Manju: <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Senju of the Thousand Hands or Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands, use their effect to add Megalith Och.</li>  	<li>Activate Megalith Unformed tributing Och in order to summon Megalith Phul. Phul adds Och back to hand becoming a level 4 in the process.</li>  	<li>Tribute the Senju/Manju in order to summon Megalith Hagith from the deck, Hagith's effect adds Megalith Portal.</li>  	<li>Activate Megalith Portal, then activate Hagith's effect in order to ritual summon Och from hand using itself as material, this proccs Portal which adds back the Hagith. You can also activate Och to draw a card, and then discard a card.</li>  	<li>Activate Och's effect to ritual summon the Hagith from hand. Activate Hagith's effect again to search Megalith Emergence. Set Emergence.</li>  	<li>You now have 2 level-4 monsters on field - Hagith and Phul, Portal and Emergence, and 1 Ritual Monster name already in the GY. You can overlay the two monsters for a rank-4 or keep them around as ritual material or allow you to play through removal on Emergence depending on the situation.</li> </ol> Advanced Ritual Art + Senju/Manju: <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Senju/Manju, use their effect to add Megalith Hagith.</li>  	<li>Activate Advanced Ritual Art to ritual summon Hagith by sending a level 4 normal monster from your deck like Dunames Dark Witch. Hagith effect adds Unformed.</li>  	<li>Activate Unformed tribute the Hagith for Phul. Phul adds back the Hagith and becomes level-4.</li>  	<li>Phul effect tribute the Senju/Manju for a Hagith from deck. Hagith adds Portal.</li>  	<li>Activate Portal. Use the Hagith to ritual summon on field to ritual summon the Hagith in hand. Hagith adds Emergence. Portal can add the Hagith in GY to hand.</li>  	<li>You're in a similar position to the first combo except you a second Hagith in rotation rather than an Och, and you've used the garnet in the deck. This can be worse in certain situations where you want to revive Och with Emergence to ritual summon a non-Megalith Ritual Monster during your opponent's main phase.</li> </ol> Hagith + Manju: <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Manju, add Advanced Ritual Art</li>  	<li>Step-2 on from combo 2.</li> </ol> Apart form the Megalith cards and cards mentioned in combos there are a bunch of cards that can be played in this deck in the main, side, or extra deck that have specific applications in this deck compared to others <ul>  	<li>Cyber Angel Benten is a level-6 ritual monster that when tributed can add a Light Fairy monster from your deck to your hand, such as Manju or Senju. This effect is not once per turn and could search itself leading it to be limited because of its interactions with Drytron monsters in advanced. It also has an on field effect that never comes up which is that it does burn when it destroys a monster by battle equal to that monsters defence.</li>  	<li>Cyber Angel Dakini is a level-8 Light Fairy ritual monster that makes the opponent send one of their monsters to the GY, this is non-destructive, non-targeting, non-effecting removal, which means it can out a boss with any protection if your opponent does not have any other monsters on field. This gives the deck a searchable out to Gouki The Powerload Ogre or Lunalight Leo Dancer among other problematic bosses. It also gives your ritual monsters piercing and can return a ritual monster from your GY to your hand during your end phase.</li>  	<li>Cyber Angel Vrash is a level-10 Light Fairy ritual monster that on summon destroys all monsters your opponent controls that were special summoned from the Extra Deck and burn for 1000 for each and attack twice that turn. It also has a Stardust Dragon effect by shuffling a ritual monster from your GY into your deck. If there were less indestructible Extra Deck monsters around I might run this. Being a level-10 changes the ritual maths a little - you can't tribute 2 level-4s, but you can tribute a level-4 and a level-6 or higher monster.</li>  	<li>Artifact Lancea is a level-5 Light Fairy non-ritual effect monster that can be tributed from hand or field during your opponent's turn to stop players from banishing cards. It is a searchable way to deal with Tenyi's follow up for a turn, which is normally long enough to turn the tide such that you can establish control of the game.</li>  	<li>Demise, Agent of Armageddon is level-4 ritual monster that is a non-targeting pop when ritual summoned and if it is sent to the GY, you can target one of your ritual monsters then while that monster is on the field your opponent can't respond to any of your ritual monsters effects - even ones in the GY.</li>  	<li>Amorphactor Pain is a level-8 ritual monster that after it is summoned your opponent skips their next Main Phase 1 (Which at time of writing is bugged on EDO Pro) and negates the effects of face-up Fusion, Synchro, or Xyz Monsters on the field. This can shut down Lunalight as their main forms of interaction are through Xyz and Fusion monsters and the effect to skip their main phase 1 also allows you to effectively Threatning Roar them on subsequent turns when you have dealt with their current field.</li>  	<li>Lord of the Red is a level-8 ritual monster that can destroy 1 target spell/trap and 1 target monster per turn each when a card or effect is activated. This is a decent Pre-Preparation of Rites target that allows you to potentially destroy 2 cards per turn, however the deck already has an in archetype way of destroying even more cards every turn.</li>  	<li>Transonic Bird is a level-4 ritual monster that can send a ritual spell from the deck during your opponent's turn to copy its effect, it's ritual spell Sonic Tracker makes the Bird's level equal the level of its material and can be banished from the GY to target a ritual monster then send a monster with the same type or attribute from the deck to the GY. This enables a 3 card way to resolve Amorphactor Pain before your opponent's next main phase and can set up additional names and target in the GY for your Megaliths, however this is pretty gimmicky, requires more bricks in the form of Earth Chant, and the other effects of Transonic Bird don't synergise with any of the other ritual monsters the deck runs.</li>  	<li>Trade In is a spell that can discard a level-8 monster in order to draw 2 cards. This deck is playing a reasonably high number of level-8 monsters already, so this card could give the deck more consistency, however it can still be dead and when it is, it's only use is to be discarded with Och. I would like to test this card out in the Future.</li> </ul>"

Go again","I was playing before invoked dogmatika dpe/shaddol and i can say Utopia Invoked is much stronger and the price is much cheaper. Utopia Invoked can keep playing even if the opponent use 2 - 3 negates thanks to Armed/Ascended sage because u can chain with utopia double the same turn. The purpose of Kaiju is as board breaker and light target for Invoked engine and Small World. This deck doesn't need Artemis or Almiraj - Gardna for invoked engine.  Magical Mallet is the replacement of pot of prosperity. The most important turn in duel is your first turn, doesn't matter if u going first or second, your first turn is important, u can draw up to 4 new cards if u going first and up to 5 cards if u going second, thanks to magical mallet, much better card for this deck than upstart goblin and pot of desire. also, if u have a brick (pegasus, double or nothing etc) in your hand u can shoufle them back in deck, same as zexal construct.  Small World can be easily used, just banish 1 light monster from your hand, reveal Effect Veiller from the deck and add 1 Aleister, Armed/Ascended sage, Astral Kuriboh or Kaiju to you hand. Basicaly u have acess to every monster in your deck except tornado and bancho, thanks to small world and Effect Veiller. Small world most of the time will be used when you have in your hand (Onomatopaira + Aleister/Meltdown), (Aleister + Aleister) , (Extender + Extender) and/or + kaiju  Always u will want in your hand 1 starter and 1 extender, in that way even if your opponent use 2-3 negates u can still keep playing. Starters (14 cards), chance to open going first 90%: onomatopaira, onomatopickup, meltdown, Aleister (+ small world) Extenders (13), chance to open going first 88%: Astral Kuriboh, Armed/Ascended sage (+ searchers Zexal construct, reinforcement, small world) Board Breakers , chance to open going second 71%: kaiju Consistency (2): Magical Mallet (thanks to it the chance to open starter is increasing to 93% , extender 91% and board breaker 74%)  bricks (2): double or nothing and pegasus (hyper rank, tornado and invocation is considered bad draw but they still can be used) solutions: -If u draw double or nothing u can go directly with Ascended sage to number 39 ,after c39 ,dragner and etc. With Armed sage instead go to number 41 in defense or go to number 39 - c39 - utopia lightning +tornado. -If u draw pegasus, use Ascended sage for utopia double - number 39 - c39 - dragner - number 22/90 and in the opponent turn u can summon number 41 in defense after u resolved all your effects. -If u draw tornado or hyper rank up magic, is not big deal because they can be used from the hand, just keep in mind to use Armed Sage for utopia double and (if the opponent use negate eff or not) then add pegasus in hand and chain with utopia double- summon dragonic and equip tornado to him, after use the eff of dragonic to equip pegasus from your hand.  the deck is good going second and first. if u play competetive, then u will see a lot of swordsoul and birds users. tips: if u going against swordsoul then go second and use more monster negate (number 90) instead omni negate (number 22), if u go against birds then go first.  This is my first day testing the budget version, it can go against any meta deck and i can go in tournament with this deck because is not expensive. Invoked dogmatika dpe/shaddol was my previous deck, it is strong, however, Invoked Utopia is much stronger and cheaper. Around 200 dolars should be the price for the whole deck including side deck.  Hand traps lovers, this deck doesn't have space for hand traps, however, hand traps is to interrupt and prevent board to be established but board breakers can destroy already established board. One deck to run hand traps there must be at least 10 - 12 free spaces for them because u can't prevent board to be established just with veiller / impermamence, u must use more than 1 hand trap to do that (except if u are lucky and draw nibiro), but for the board breakers 6-7 cards is perfectly fine because u need 1 card to destroy already established board. So don't replace kaiju for example with hand traps or dark ruler or whatever, everything in the main deck have purpose.  probably i will update the side deck and extra deck in future, but for now is ok Video with few duels from the 1st day testing:  https://youtu.be/g9jnnbiO-no"

In a turn after you then summon Five-Headed Link Dragon in the zone next to Binary using Tri-Gate and two other monsters, and bring back Trigate Wizard using Transcode's effect.

Albaz summon can lead to a quick effect banish or Winda without using Schism yet.</li> </ul> Going Second Theory: <ul>  	<li>Ecclesia acts to help break boards and bait negates before Invoked combos.</li>  	<li>Nibiru, Ecclesia, and a Shaddoll in hand is pretty much board wipe and Shaddoll combos on the following turn.</li> </ul> Otherwise play like Shaddoll Invoked."

This deck tries to play a longer game than most Tri-Brigade decks, and focuses on recurring resour","This deck is built to play a longer version of the game than most Tri-Brigade decks. This is a bit off the beaten path, and any advice or insight you might have I am open to.  The deck's main goals are two-fold: use the Tri-Brigade monsters to get out their bosses and create card advantage, and use the Melffy engine to remove opponents cards and negate their effects. I won't go over the Tri-Brigade strategy here because I believe most other Tri-Brigade deck-lists have it covered better than I could. The Melffy engine is similar to most others you will see: use Puppy to pull out Kalantosa who then pops a card. We are Tri-ing (sorry) something a bit different by including Melffy Pony and Melffy Fenny. Pony can put Kalantosa back in hand from the GY, and Fenny can summon a Kalantosa from hand (useful if we hard-draw it or recurse it with pony).  We also included the Hop Ear Squadron and Valerifawn, both of which are tuners. We can use those to make Herald of the Arc Light for a negate, or Jiujiu for staying power (it is very easy to get 2 monsters with the same type and attribute in our GY). The only other real departure for our deck from the norm is two copies of Pot of Avarice. Since we want to play a drawn out game, this card helps control our GY, returning any Melffys sent there and recursing our link monsters.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, I hope you like my deck!"
