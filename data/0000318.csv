It has my heart and soul in it and I hope you'll enjoy it!</p><p>The most important thing about the deck is seeing Kuribohs as the Glue to your deck. Get out literally any two monsters (and there's plenty of ways to do so, like with Flute of Summoning Kuriboh, the Kuribohs that summon allies to the field, or the number of self-summoners) and bring out Verte Anaconda. Aleister is fantastic at reusing spent mons in the graveyard (like when your Wandering Gryphon eventually kicks it), or Hasty Horses. Also, Destiny Dasher can also just randomly bring out a full power Parallel eXceed? Not too helpful but can work</p><p>Tbh, I kinda made like a Yugioh protag's.

You COULD use Knightmare Unicorn instead, but tbh, Berserker of the Tenji is a fat beatstick, is immune to ""target effect monster"" effects like Sky Striker, and can be used with Dracoback if you can't draw your Adventure Engine, which gives you one less brick combination in your hand</p><p>- Aleister stuff -&gt; Artemis -&gt; Invoked Mechaba</p><p>Any amount of 1 card comboing into Mechaba :3c it's just free</p><p>- Adventure Engine</p><p>It's just the Adventure Engine. it doesn't mesh extremely well with the deck, but the incredibly easy to pull out negate can add a lot of consistency to your deck, and or stall out the enemy until you get the rest of your deck online. also, you can use Illegal Knight to summon itself and maybe help bring out Verte as well</p>"

Feel free to discuss or express your opinion on the comments below</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MAIN DECK</p><p>Despia package&nbsp;</p><p>3x Aluber the Jester of Despia</p><p>Due to the new and upcoming (CYAC) support, the current deck build plays differently than the original. The endboard is no longer set Branded in Red with Ad Libitium in hand or GY, therefore, addding more despia names than necesary can led to subpar hands. Altough the Chimera play (pop 1-2 on field, draw 1-2) is strong, commiting to it forces the deck into a linear, well known, predictable play that lacks potential compared with newer combo lines. Therefore, we only play Aluber, as it&acute;s the main deck sercher and play enabler. An argument can be made to ad 1 Despia Tragedy with Ad Libitum, but I think that the deck has better combo lines as of right now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fallen of Albaz package</p><p>2x Cartesia</p><p>Engine requierement. Two are played to avoid an accidental banish by Kashtira (Diablosis the Mind Hacker). Can be cut to 1 but it can be banished more easily, disabling Granguignol and forcing the deck into subpar combo lines</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Fallen of Albaz</p><p>Engine requirement. Two is the minimun number needed to play. Can be bumped to 3 for its super poly effect when going second, but fusion deployment provides more versatility in that regard.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Mercourier</p><p>Material requirement for Rindbrumm, and in archetype handtrap (monster effect negate) when you control a fusion monster that mentions ""Fallen of Albaz"" as material. Hard drawing it, alongside a Bystial, ensures your main combo is protected against Nibiru (you need to summon Rindbrumm from Branded Fusion first).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Shrouded Dragon)</p><p>Searchable Draw power. Always send Branded Retribution to ensure recursion of your spell/traps</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bystial package</p><p>We run a reduced number of Bystial monster due to the expected reduced number of Tearlaments decks. Altough the number can be further reduced, its not recommended as the Bystial are engine requirements in this version of the deck (specially Saronir).</p><p>3x Bystial Lubellion</p><p>Bystial searcher and combo enabler. Can be reduced to two, but the stronger hands come from hard drawing this monster alongside Aluber/Branded Fusion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3x Bystial Magnamhut</p><p>End phase searcher for any dragon on the deck. Can add Bystial Baldrake or Saronir for additional interruption on your opponent turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3x Bystial Saronir</p><p>The best Bystial for this deck, the spell/trap pitch effect is extremely handy for this deck, as it allows to search any spell when used in conjunction with a Branded retribution on grave. Can be cut to 2, as Bystial Lubellion act as additional copies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Bystial Baldrake</p><p>Searchable interruption. We dont run Driuswurm as I belive is the least synergetic bystial, as we don&acute;t have a reliable way to send it to the graveyard unless you are using it as fusion material. Baldrake can banish any extra Deck monster, an interruption I believe is stronger that Driuswurm pop.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Branded Spell/Traps</p><p>3x Branded Opening/ 3x Branded Fusion&nbsp;</p><p>Standard ratios. Opening to search Branded Fusion (or Lost). Branded Fusion so that your opponent cries about how broken is fusion summoning from the deck (it isn&acute;t) when your resolve it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Branded in Red/White, 1x Branded Lost, 1x Branded Beast, 1x Branded Retibution</p><p>Only one Branded in Red as it is searchable. Branded in White is part of the new combo line. Lost allows for your fusion summons to be uninterrupted, while Branded Beast is a serchable disruption. The traps are hard bricks when drawn, so it&acute;s my recommendation to go over 40 to reduce the chances of that happening (but not by much. 45 is the maximun I would recommend for this deck).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Potential aditional spells/Traps that don&acute;t make the cut in my proposed list</p><p>Branded Regained:&nbsp; I believe it&acute;s a ""win more"" card. It doesn&acute;t give consistency to the deck when going first, it&acute;s a brick most of the times going second due to the reduced number of Bystials, and Lost and Beast are better targets to set directly from the deck by Lubellion effect.</p><p>Branded Banishment:&nbsp; Can be added as either a replacement of Red or 1x Bystial Saronir. If you don&acute;t care of going over 43, it can be added without modifying the ratios (just expect it to see it occasionally on your opening hands). I believe that right now you either run Branded in Red or Branded Banishment, not both (specially if you don&acute;t run Chimera)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Utility Cards</p><p>3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and 3x Infinite Impermanence</p><p>Handtraps of choice and Crossout Designator targets, as I believe are the most impactful handtraps for PHHY format.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3x Crossout Designator</p><p>Allows the deck to get the edge in the mirror match and avoid the Ash on Branded Fusion (This version lacks the Patchwork engine, therefore Ash Blossom acts as a hard counter). Protects Cartesia and Aluber from Infinite Impermanence. De to&nbsp; Triple Tactics Thrust, I believe Effect Veiler will see reduced usage in this format (I could be wrong).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;3x Fusion Deployment</p><p>Special summons either Cartesia or Albaz, helping when going second for Albaz Super Poly effect and summoning Cartesia whithout needing Albaz on grave.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>EXTRA DECK</p><p>Standard Branded Despia Extra Deck. New cards are Rindbrumm and Granguignol the Dusk Dragon. Rindbrumm is an extra deck monster negate that bounces a card from either field, while Ganguignol summons a Despia extra deck monster or a dogmatika main deck monster when you oponent special summons a monster by an activated monster effect (i.e., a special summon by it&acute;s own effect). I choose to not play super poly, therefore extra deck space is not as thight.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tech Choices</p><p>Despian Proskenion: Granguignol special summon effect target. Summon it when you need a big beatstick or your opponent has a useful extra deck monster on the grave. Against non-fusion decks, Despia Quaeritis is usually a better target</p><p>Garura, Wings of Resonant Life: Granguignol send target for when you don&acute;t need to send Albion the Branded Dragon</p><p>Predaplant Dragostapelia: For recycling a fusion with Lubellion the Searing Dragon</p><p>Baronne de Fleur: Personal tech choice for simplified game states (easily made by Cartesia+ 1 Bystial). Can definitively be cut for something else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>SIDE DECK</p><p>Personal choice depending on the meta where you play. Kashtira and Floowandereeze are the deck hardest matchups, so make sure your side deck helps against them</p><p>Recommended cards:&nbsp;</p><p>Kashtira: Kurikara Divincarnate, Nibiru, the Primal Being, Book of Eclipse, Sphere Mode/Lava Golem (no normal summon after use)</p><p>Floowandereeze: Super Polymerization (Garua is the main target), Zombie World, Spell/Trap destruction</p><p>Spright: Dark Ruler no More, Kurikara Divincarnate</p><p>Tearlaments: Bystials, Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion, Evenly Matched</p><p>Mirror Match: Super Polymerization, Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion (stops Branded in Red/Banishment when Lost is not on the field). Crossout Designator, Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring.&nbsp;</p><p>Triple Tactis Talent is a good card for either side or main deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>SAMPLE MOST SIMPLE COMBO</p><p>Opening Hand: Branded Fusion, 1 Bystial (Except Bystial Lubellion)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.Activate Branded Fusion, send Mercourier and Fallen of Albaz, summon Rindbrumm</p><p>2.Activate Bystial Saronir, Banish Mercourier, Summon Bystial. Mercourier search Cartesia</p><p>3.Special Summon Cartesia, fuse with Bystial or a monster in hand to summon Granguignol</p><p>Now, the combo branches depending on the cards on hand and the material used for the summon of Granguignol</p><p>4.1.If Cartesia fused with a Bystial (Saronir):</p><p>Cl1 Granguignol send Albion the Shrouded, Cl2 send Branded retribution, then, when the chain resolves, activate Albion effect on Gy and send branded in white. Then, add White to you hand with retribution effect.&nbsp;</p><p>5.1.Use Branded in white. Fuse with Albaz in grave and Granguignol on field, banishing Albaz and sending Granguignol to Gy. Summon Mirrorjade</p><p>6.1. Cl1 Activate Mirrorjade effect, send Brigrand as cost, Cl1 negate with Rindbrumm. Chain resolves, Mirrorjade is negated, allowing us to use the effect on the next turn, and Brigrand will search Mercourier on the end phase.</p><p>7.1. End Phase. Cartesia to hand, Mercourier to hand. Endboard ends on a non target Banish (Mirrorjade), 1x monster negate (Mercourier), 1x Extra deck monster negate (Rindbrumm), summon disruption (Granguignol summons Proskenion or Quaeritis to the field).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>4.2.If Cartesia fused with a dark/light monster</p><p>&nbsp;Granguignol Trigger efect sends Albion the Branded Dragon</p><p>5.2. End Phase. Cartesia to Hand, set Branded In Red (Target will be Albaz). Endboard ends on 1x extra deck monster negate (Rindbrumm), 1x summon disruption (Proskenion or Quaeritis from Granguignol), 1x Fusion disruption (Branded in Red into Lubellion-Mirrorjade, Masquerade, depending of monsters on hand)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The previous sample combo is the minimun power board you can make with only branded fusion and a bystial name. Aditional cards on hand (Aluber, Mercourier, Bystial Lubellion, Lost) allows for the combo to be extendend and end on aditional disruptions. I recommend to to try the deck irl or on a simulator in order to get familiarized with the main lines of play.&nbsp;</p>"

These three cards are your main way to interact with your opponent, as Azurune negates a summon, Apophis negates up to three or four monster effects and Anguish Pattern can pop cards on a non-once per turn. To help them, three monsters can be really useful : Qardan the great Sage help you recover your ressources and gives you the ability to play something a trap on your first turn, Pharaonic Advent gets you any trap you need and Lord of the Heavenly Prison can protect your traps and can get you anyone of them if you activate another.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, every pot is here for consistency and the other are tech cards that can be useful in some situations. For the extra Deck, its mostly a toolbox that you make to attack and put pressure, I play the rank-ups only for fun, dont be afraid of replacing them if you feel like it.&nbsp;</p><p>This Deck is more of a fun Deck (more for you than for your opponent probably) because of the general lack of good trap monsters except of your main three, but with the right hand you can probably beat lots of Decks. I hope you'll have fun playing or just learning that this Deck existed.&nbsp;</p>"

So, what about we dont do them ? Thats the whole point of this Deck. This Deck plays like Guru control except its fun ! Your main objective and way to interrupt is to flip your opponents monster with stuff like Sol and Luna or Destructive Daruma Karma Canon which help you flipping your slow Ghostrick monsters. Siren act as a wonderful searcher : if you need an interruption, take Ghostrick or treat, if you want a reborn, take Shot, you need one of your fields, take em ! Nekomosume is also a great card in this Deck, making almost every Deck twice as slow and giving you tempo.&nbsp;</p><p>But you might wonder, how do we win ? Thats where the last cards come in play. The best card in this Deck without a doubt is Ghostrick Night. This Trap card has the simple effect to prevent your oponent to flip monsters. This might seem useless, but this whole Deck is made to flip your opponents monsters, which will eventually end up in youre opponent having no space to summon anything. And then, thats where your field spells come in play. These card allow both players to attack directly if every monster their opponent controls is face-down, allowing you to slowly - but surely ! - to kill your opponent.&nbsp;</p><p>Since you dont use your Extra Deck very much, Pot of Prosperity allow you to take the piece you need to complete your hand. Finally, Terrors in the Hidden City is a nice tech card that protects your backrow and your set Ghostricks and can allow your Ghostricks to walk over big boss monsters easily.</p><p>At the end of the day, Its still a Ghostrick Deck and you cannot make magically this Deck great. But this one can work quite well against quite powerful Deck, just dont be afraid of bricking...</p><p>I hope you liked the Deck, and have a nice day / week / month / year / life !</p>"

It's standard to make Ptolemaeus with 3 materials so that Durendal has 2 Xyz Materials for 2 disruptions. It's also pretty adaptable. You can make Ptolemaeus with 2 materials to have Durendal with 1 mat if you don't want/can't invest 3 mats.

This deck allows for highly interactive boards, unfortunately its 2 card combo but you have many baits/extenders you can do. I have made it more towards Anti-Kashtira this time with cards such as chaos hunter, xyz encore, and imperial iron wall. Fenrir is one of those baits and extenders in this deck, it allows it eat an negate or a tag out target with Rookie Fur Hire into Rafale, same goes with the sprights u can tag them out for FIlo and Beat which are 2 of your best Fur hire summons outside of Rex. Donner is one of the biggest pieces to this decks combo game, instead of tributing itself if possible you save your filo's effect on field and go into linkuriboh then use Donner effect to tribute linkuriboh and summon filo first then another fur hire in hand or gy then if able you can use filo to one again summon another Fur hire in gy then you go into Folgo lines and finally spright lines. The deck is easy to pilot when you learn your combo outlines and can have a devstating board going first. <img class=""article-img-floatnone"" src=""https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789180819960233984/1073996953106514045/image.png"" alt="""" width=""907"" loading=""lazy"" /></p>"

Well I'm here to say no to that with this deck list that can stand up to the meta. This is Bystial Dogmatika.</p><p>The main focus of this deck is to outgrind your opponent, keeping their resources low while you build advantage ad infinitum. The way the deck accomplishes this is by utilizing the synergies the light Dogmatika monsters have and their ability to dump extra deck Light and Dark monsters for the bystials to utilize to summon themselves. The ritual monsters all focus on ripping cards out of the opponents extra deck, keeping them off their sure to be powerful monsters. This deck was playable before photon hypernova but 2 new cards in that set make this playstyle a lot more consitant and targeted. I will go over those cards soon, but for now lets look at the cards one by one.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nibiru</strong>: This is just my personal format handtrap call alone with called by the grave and Triple tact. Nibiru does a number on a Kashtira board, while called by and triple tact is for the miriad of handtraps creeping back into the format.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The chaos monsters:</strong> One thing this deck does very well is fill up the grave with light and dark monsters, either from the main deck or extra deck. Both chaos monsters are searchable off chaos space. Levi is an all purpose destruciton tool, while Creator is used to refill your resouces, either to the main or extra deck. Though remember you do have to be able to summon 1 of the 3 monsters you target with his effect. Both are level 8 so with Lubellion they make an easy dingirsu or other level 8 you choose to play. And when you open with them, you can just pitch them with chaos space to search lubellion and combo off from there.</p><p><strong>The Bystial Package:</strong> All the dragons(worth playing) are here. While Tear might not be around every corner anymore, these guys are still potentially walking d.d. crows and can keep you going on resources, interaction, and GY setup. Branded beast + Branded Regained is still a pretty nice setup.</p><p><strong>Ecclesia and Fleurdelis</strong>: Standard memebers of the Dogmatika package. In my experience, these are the guys you will end up summoning off of Chaos Creator.</p><p><strong>Dogmatika Alba Zoa</strong>: Ok so maybe the church was hiding a gigantic monster inside. Alba Zoa comes out with a beefy 4k ATK/DEF and makes all your dogmatika monster unaffected by the activated affects of extra deck monsters. His effect isnt as good as i wish as when you activate it, your opponent gets to choose which effect they apply to themselves. Either they send cards from their hand/ED, 1 card for every 2 cards in their ED, or they return all extra deck monsters on their field to the ED. Obviously if the opponent has no ED monsters on their field they have to pick the first effect but it can still be annoying. Mainly cause if you dont know what they are on, the opponent might just send a bunch of stuff from the extra they want in the grave, like Ntss, or tri-brigade monsters. But it still is the biggest body in the deck so worth playing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>White Knight of Dogmatika:</strong> This is the monster you want to try and end on going first. Upon resolution of an opponents card or effect, you get to send a monster of your choice from both EDs. You can send anything form ntss to destroy something, herald to search, ignister or fossil for next turn, etc while taking a monster from your oppoents.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>White Relic of Dogmatika:</strong> While pretty weak compared to the other 2 rituals, she round out the monsters by being a decent playmaker herself. She triggers the ED dump when the opponent summons somthing from the ED but I have gotten more use out of her on summon effect since she doesnt reduce the monster she targets, you can target your own Alba Zoa and make her a massive 4500atk.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dogmatikamatrix:&nbsp;</strong>This is other new Dogmatika card in PHHY, and it feels busted. It searches any Dogmatika ritual spell or ritual monster, then if your opponent controls something, you search any Dogmatika card. Just go plus 2 cause who cares. And while you control a ritual monster, you can look in either players ED and dump something. Now while you can only activate 1 Dogmatikamatrix per turn, the ED dump is not a hard once per turn. Which means if you control muliples of this card, you get to dump multiple times. Just unbelievable.</p><p><strong>Dogmatikalamity:</strong> This is the better of the 2 dogmatika ritual cards. Your sends for each monster are as follows: Alba Zoa = Five-headed dragon. White Knight = Psy-Frame Omega or Titinklad(depends on board), White Relic = Herald or Ntss (again, depends on the boardstate.)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chaos Space</strong>: This is a part of your setup as well as grind game. Depending on what you pitch, you can search either chaos monster, lubellion, or 2 of the ritual monsters. It can also recycle those monsters as well as any ED monsters that have been banished to net you another draw.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Extra Deck:</strong> while you dont go into the extra often since the dogmatika cards lock you, that doesnt mean you can still utilize it. the links can be cut for other ED dumps, as well as Digirsu. Omega actually turn into the star of the show late game, since dumping him means you can recycle your ritual spells, ntss, chaos monsters, ect.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PROS AND CONS:</strong></p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> You have a lot of individually powerful cards. Nadir, lubelion, dogmatikamatrix, chaos space, all have the potential to plus you to the moon.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Extra deck hate is good again. Kashtier and branded don't look so strong when their big boss monsters are stuck in the GY</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>You have a great grind game. With all the recycling, drawing, and searching this deck can do, you are more favored the longer the game lasts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons.</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> You are still playing a ritual deck, which means you can end up stairing at a hand of some bystials, handtraps, and ritual monster but no spell. Bricks gonna Brick</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Shockingly from my playtesting, Labyrinth is your biggest issue. They can outgrind you for days and don't care one bit for the extra deck or Ritual monsters. I would suggest focusing some side deck slots for that matchup</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Macro effects are going to be an issue. You are ok with stuff getting banished, its just you want to be the one banishing them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have suggestions or questions about this deckbuild, please let me know below, i would love to hear some feedback.</p>"

So always try to access it in combos so that this interaction is possible.</p><p>Another very important detail to note in Spright Elf is that in cases where you do Linkuriboh + I:P Masquerena you can transform both into Spright Elf and Reborn from Petiteranodon and on the opponent's turn you can Reborn from I:P Masquerena again when he summons a monster to the field then you can destroy Petiteranodon with Tyranno and bring Pankratops from the deck and with I:P Masquerena make Unicorn to bounce another card. That is, you can transform the Spright Elf in two interactions on the opponent's turn to destroy and shuffle cards back to the deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p><p>Finally, a very important detail is related to the field spell Magical Mid-Breaker Field because it manages to protect you from the target of cards and destruction in your Normal Summon or in your Ogdoadic monsters which is very good going first or second.</p><p>- The main detail about the card is that it can only be activated at the start of Main Phase 1 or Main Phase 2 just like the Pot of Extravagance card works. So remember that if you are going to use Set Rotation to set it on your side of the field you must activate Set Rotation in the Standby Phase and start your Main Phase 1 by activating it.</p><p>- Another important fact about the card is that it doesn't allow you to activate or set another Field Spell which can be an excellent interaction against Floowandereeze and anti-meta decks that use Floodgates like Necrovalley and Zombie World as a Pendulum and Crystal Beast deck for example . With Magical Mid-Breaker Field on the opponent's side, he can't activate another Field Spell until he manages to get rid of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p><p>A curiosity is that the Dinosaur deck was not made to use Extra Deck so as the Main Deck manages to turn around very well, in the past you never had good options of LINK-2 Monsters at your disposal but now with time the Scrap engine with the insane Scrap Wyvern on hand and now we have Spright Elf which is also an absurd strong card that brings several benefits including the main one of allowing you to continue to destroy Babycerasaurus every turn to generate advantage.</p><p>Among direct and indirect supports I can mention several examples: Animadorned Archosaur, Dinowrestler Pankratops, Scrap Raptor, Doodle Beast - Tyranno, Scrap Wyvern and Spright Elf.</p><p>In this way, this deck reached a point where I see that it already has so many main deck and extra deck improvements that I don't complain at all about future supports. Of course, being extremely generic for Dinosaur-type monsters will always be a problem for Konami to create cards of this type of monster without this deck taking advantage. I think the main factor behind the latest indirect supports were actually made on purpose by Konami, now all that's missing is a good Dinosaur-type Extra Deck monster since the existing ones are specific or don't help the deck itself.</p><p>/////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p>"

Invoked Elysium as a Deck Master (Also Five-Headed Dragon and Link-Dragon to an extent), as they allow you to bypass one of the bigger limitations of the format: The monsters available for you to use, as Invoked Elysium's domain is absolute- you are allowed yo use any monster on an Elysium deck.<br /><br />2. The forbidden/limited list, being as of right now, is completely empty. This means that along with DM Elysium, you are functionally playing a Highlander deck on the Traditional list, which means that there are many ways to break it.<br /><br />3. The 3-axis engine, along with the orcust/knightmare package, which are both completely legal right now due to the conditions I mentioned above.

Lock yourself into a fusion based chaos deck that summons beat stick after beat stick after beat stick. Being as it is branded gives a much needed backbone to thunder dragons as a way to start an advantage engine that can near infinite while thunder dragon provides desired typing for fusion material and wonderful targets for bystial if your opponent isn't playing a chaos typed deck.

I play Cartesia without her fusion monster for the simple reason of you can get her back indefinitely making it very difficult to always have a way into mirrorjade.

D-Shifter has been relegated back to the side deck as I expect Kashtira to be a prominent matchup, plus with Bystials being likely to feature as well, having too many darks in the deck is less ideal that in was before. In it's place I have opted for Lava Golem, as not only does it synergise with Trade-In, it also allows me to remove Arise-Heart and another monster from the Kashtira end board, plus other troublesome boards created by Bystial D-Link/Branded. Now that Barrier Statue Of The Stormwinds has been banned, I have replaced Gardarla with Gamecial. Gamecial does the same thing as Gardarla did, but with 500 less attack points, so the likes of Gizemek/Pankratops can now run over it if neccessary. Panktratops has now made a return to the main deck after a few formats away, due to destruction not being particularly effective. Ultimate Slayer has returned as my main weapon of choice going blind. It's effect allows me to remove Arise-Heart and other troublesome cards such as Apolussa, Borellend, Baronne, Masquerade/Mirrorjade e.t.c whilst also gaining additional benefits from the dumped monsters. Triple Tactics Thrust was added as it is particularly useful for adding a card such as Ultimate Slayer to hand due to Shangri-Ira activating during the standby phase, as is also effective when going 1st against opposing Handtraps/Bystial activations e.t.c. to search for floodgates post side.</p><p>The deck's function is basically the same as always. Attempt to OTK and if not end of 4 material Zeus and hope your opponent can't break through.&nbsp;</p><p>The extra deck consists mainly of Slayer targets, powerful XYZ's monsters and some generic utility link monsters. Mereologic is extremely good paired with Slayer. Not only can you remove Arise Heart, you can also negate the effects of the monster Shangri-Ira summons during the Standby (Fenrir/Unicorn).&nbsp;</p><p>The side deck features Shifter, to hurt every single graveyard reliant strategy in existence. Heat Wave basically just says ""you can't summon"", so i'll more than likely OTK you on my next turn. Twin Twisters because i expect some form of backrow to feature in most decks and the usual floodgates of Dimensional Barrier and There Can Be Only One are fairly self-explainatory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

You also nearly always need The sanctuary in the sky on the field at all times!!! I can not emphasise that enough! Without it your cloudians can still stay on the field but you will continue taking the difference in damage. So with The sanctuary in the sky on the field, you dont take damage and your cloudians ""Except poision cloud"" will never leave the field.</p><p>Another purpose is to use burn damage with Updraft, Poision Cloud and Diamond Dust. With those cards on the field your opponent will get very annoyed with you.&nbsp;</p><p>I've loved Cloudians for a while now and I feel they have soooo much potential with the right cards, the right player and the right setup. This archetipe is very awsome andI realy hope that one day it gets the love it dserves.</p><p>Editors note- If your opponent is running a water deck this deck can be extreemly lethal.</p>"

This build is aimed at protecting your gilgamesh and countering blow out cards like Nibiru by using Crossout Designator, the side deck is built to beat Kashtira,also shifter is a crossout target, you would side it in game 2 or 3 if you're going first once you know your opponent is on it. I ended up cutting Oracle King D'Arc and replaced it with Wave Oblvion King Caesar Ragnarok as an out for problematic monsters,also because its funny lol.</p>"

Statue while strong, was at times just one big target. And D-Shifter is no longer needed in the main deck as Kashtira will likely rise to be the top deck of the format. This allows the deck room to now synergize more effectively with an engine that doesn't require the extra deck, and uses it for interruption and advantage. That engine, is Dogmatika...</p><p>The loss of Statue and relegation of Shifter to the side is more than made up for by the increase in main deck interruptions you can field. Nadir is both used to add/recycle Ecclesia, and also dump extra deck monsters that can either disrupt the opponent or gain further advantage. Ultimate Slayer removes most problematic boss monsters whilst also being able to dump ED monsters like Nadir for further uses. Slayer also has the added benefits of not being able to be stopped by monster negates. Evenly is also an incredibly strong card against many decks as well.Triple Tactics Talent/Thrust are self explainatory. Scary Sea has been added because Kashtira will be hard pressed to put anything of note up without having Kashtira Birth in hand. The rest of the deck is fairly standard, but instead of the usual end board of Empen, Statue and Dreaming Town/Map, you aim to have Empen, Ecclessia, Punishment and either Dreaming Town/Scary Sea depending on the deck you are up against.</p><p>Nothing of note really needs to be said about the Extra Deck except it's tailored to make best use of Ultimate Slayer and Nadir Servant. N'Tss/Garura provide extra disruption and advantage against fusion based strategies. Wind Pegasus and Omega offer disruption or recovering assests from the grave, as well as removing troublesome Synchro monsters. Mereologic is very strong to not only remove a key XYZ's monster (Arise-Heart), as well as negating another monster effect on the field (usually Unicorn). Zeus package never used but still useful and Tri-Brigade Omen/Ferrijit to add more monsters and fix hands, as well as&nbsp; helping to remove links such as Apolussa.</p><p>For the side deck. D-Shifter is purely for decks not named Kashtira/mirrors. An extra copy of Scary Sea and Unxplored Winds for greater chance of stopping Kashtira going 1st and board breaking going second. Harpie's purely because it's generically good against backrow. Solemn and Harpie's Feather Storm for floodgating your opponent or stopping potentially crushing cards and Eclipse mainly for Kashtira but may swap with Lightning Storm for more generic scenarios.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

This evolution of the zombie deck as been just a worst branded deck, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>I took sometime finally review the state of the deck and the cards to find out a way to re use all the new zombie support and play the deck as intended, ofcourse this will not win a tier 1 deck, its not meant to be anyways, but its fun enough to be consisten, put up interuptions and play the clasic zombie endboard of vampire + synchro 10 + eldlich with a facedown. This endboard is close enough to represent what zombie combo used to do, be able to synchro, link, fusion and even if you want you can change the extra to play xyz, o put in baldrake and try to make beatriz.</p><p>The reason its mixed with eldlich is because 1 eldlich on board can let u utilize black stone as a emergency teleport for the deck, this solves the issue with being negated on the normal, not being able to extend after etc. You can try to play more handtraps, or board breakers, but for this list i rather leave it as a clean and pure build and let others use this as a template for their own flavour, the objective of the deck is to combo, not control, eldlich is a neat engine that just helps the zombie build to be better.</p><p>If you are new to the deck, i will explain a bit the idea, (but in my opinion i think you should download the file and have fun experimenting to understand it before you read this)</p><p>Main combo line is usually any starter that goes uni-zombie/ send from deck to grave Changshi or hand, summon her/ extend by sending mad mauler (fun fact immortal dragon is generic), re-summon target the Changshi, summon immortal, send banshee, zombie world. At this point you did the basic part of the combo, the rest, you achieve it by extending, either a edlich setup to summon doomking with sanguine, while you have a red-eyes zombie dragon lord, that can revive de eldlich on draw phase, to use sanguine to bring doomking. Thats the basic part of the deck. Its a zombie tool-box deck inspired by the earth machine tool-box in a certain way.</p><p>Board breakers, Felgrand, Vampire Frauline, Shiranui solitaire to recylce the immortal dragon, vampire sucke to tribute summon using your opponents ZOMBIE monster, if you kill a dragoon, you can get it back with Frauline and laugh. One gripe with the extra is that i would maybe change 1 sucker for a superdreadnaught rail cannon gustav max for doing effect damage since having level 10 on field isnt that hard for the deck.</p><p>I guess you are wandering, why do you play the eldlich fusion spell? Well you see, if you draw a hand that doesnt have normal summons, or you have plenty of graveyard extenders, that spell lets you fusion ANYTHING, as long as you use zombies from your hand or field, its not a brick anymore, so with that fact, why not play garura? well as i said before this is a template, a idea that can get better or even lower the cost of the deck, i made this list for budget players and as a generic idea. The side deck is anything you want ignore whats on it.</p><p>What is it weak against? Heavy backrow decks tend to be tedious battles put being able to put large atackers tend to help the labrynth match up a bit, Kashtira because of the banish, bystial decks already have proven to kill anyother deck that plays light/dark and branded/despia/bystial kind of screws the deck over if its just despia branded, maybe you have a chance.</p><p>What our it strengths? Recursive graveyard, if you are not dead turn after turn 2, you pretty much already have plenty of interactions ready, its strong agains other rogue decks and can make up for a very fun duel thats back and forth winning depends onm the pilot 60% of the time so learn how this deck works, some lines look like bricks, but they are not, its consistent enough to always do something that you can use, jack-o-bolan is in the deck to also solve bricks or even use it as a tribute summon if you drew chengshi.</p><p>Gold Sarcophagus is the new foolish burial, any zombie in grave, + this cards is already a way to banish changshi and summon her, its just amazing.</p><p>Ready fusion: Gozuki + this card is also already full combo, i would dare to say i like this opening more.</p><p>Why 1 shiranui and 2 uni-zombie, drawing 2 uni zombie is a brick, its not a useful thing, uni zombie is a starter AND a brick, so playing 2 copies and 1 shiranui solved the problem for me.</p><p>Why dont you play zombie reborn? You can play it, especially to recycle mezukis, but i think that if you are playing already a edlich engine, it makes zombie reborn redundant, i would love to find space for it thou.</p>"

It has the <strong>down arrows</strong> which means you can make <strong>Knightmare Cerberus</strong> and <strong>Phoenix</strong> Co-Linked.</p><p>Now in Megalith in the <strong>weakest hands</strong> of the deck where usually you can only add the field spell Portal and the trap Emergence you still manage to turn your cards into <strong>one more interaction</strong> because you join any two monsters in <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> and in the opponent's turn you manages to Reborn with <strong>Megalith Emergence</strong> of any Megalith other than Phul and make the <strong>Dyna Mondo</strong> from the deck and still use its <strong>second effect to bring Phul</strong> to the field and then <strong>Phul to bring Bethor</strong>.</p><p>In summary it basically becomes <strong>two interactions against the opponent</strong> being an essential card in Megalith.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p><p>All the combos you can learn in this deck profile: https://ygoprodeck.com/deck/megalith-master-duel-apr22-format-264045</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p><p>One thing that I noticed and learned a lot when using Megalith is the fact that the deck <strong>uses 3 engines</strong>, the main one being Megalith, but without the other two engines of <strong>Impcantation</strong> and <strong>Fairy cards</strong> Manju and Benten, the deck makes a combo with <strong>few interactions</strong> and that has no good <strong>follow ups</strong>.</p><p>That's why it's always very important that you can <strong>access the other engines</strong>, both to be able to play second and to have <strong>more versatility</strong> and follow up, especially the Impcantation engine.</p><p>For that you can use <strong>Megalith Och</strong> and <strong>Cross-Sheep</strong> to <strong>draw new cards</strong>. No wonder I use Cross-Shrep because that way through the Megalith engine you can give <strong>2 to 3 draws</strong> on the turn and improve your hand and even have more hand traps against the opponent.</p><p>Considering that this deck despite <strong>separating interactions</strong> does not do anything very impeding since via the engine you <strong>can only reach 3 interactions</strong>: <strong>Megalith Phul</strong> summons <strong>Megalith Bethor</strong>, <strong>Nibiru</strong> and a <strong>LINK-2</strong> that interacts like <strong>Herald of Mirage Lights</strong> or <strong>I: P Masquerena</strong> so what you always want to do is <strong>survive the opponent's turn</strong> to take control of the game in the <strong>excellent grind game</strong> that the deck has.</p><p>That's why <strong>every decision is crucial</strong> to win using Megalith. You must know very well the <strong>right time to use your interactions</strong>. The deck has the main weaknesses related to having to <strong>first manage to rotate the main deck engine and only then use the extra deck</strong>, different from the best Ritual deck in the game, which is <strong>Drytron</strong>, which does not restrict you at all in the extra deck because you <strong>don't need it use the Impcantation engine</strong>.</p><p>So the main message I leave about Megalith is that it has very <strong>good consistency</strong>, it manages to <strong>interact in both turns and separate interactions</strong>, the engine is even able to <strong>play on negates and cards that destroy</strong> because it is easy to set up the field again because <strong>everything recycles</strong>, is capable of using a <strong>minimum of 11 tech cards in the main deck</strong>, and has an <strong>excellent grind game</strong>. What is missing for the deck is some <strong>improvement of the main deck</strong> that, for example, <strong>replaces Manju</strong> as a Normal Summon and also <strong>facilitates the Ritual summon without restricting access to the extra deck</strong> as Impcantation does, but otherwise this deck has a lot of potential in the hands of those who train quite.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Any combination of 2 Bystial cards is enough to eliminate all Ogdoadic plays.</p><p>Even a single Bystial can ruin an Ogdoadic day and that's why I've decided that every game where I face Bystial I'm going to pull the entire 11 card engine from Ogdoadic because Bystial.</p><p>As <strong>Bystial are terrible against Dinosaur</strong> cards, I prefer to <strong>change the 11 Ogdoadic cards for new 11 Side Deck cards</strong>, because Omega can also return Miscellaneousaurus to the GY, which means that I will continue to have Follow Up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck has a lot of brick so a Deck Build recommendation is to increase the number of cards above 40 because you reduce the chance of seeing your bricks which means continuing to have consistency. <strong>Jesse Kotton</strong> made a video talking about it on his channel called: <strong>The Heart Of The Cards is a Load of Rubbish! How to Improve at Yugioh #1</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When using <strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong> you must make the <strong>right decision</strong> because this deck can very well activate <strong>Prosperity for 6 cards and you must ban cards that will not harm you according to Gamestate</strong> for example if you have not accessed the Ogdoadic engine you must keep the King of the Feral Imps.</p><p>- <strong>There is no clear card rule to banish going first</strong> but generally you can banish Linkuriboh, Omega, Phoenix, I:P Masquerena, Dweller (if you don't know you are facing Tearlaments), Bagooska and Cerberus.</p><p>- Field breaking cards like <strong>Exciton Knight, Dingirsu and AA-Zeus I always keep in the Extra Deck</strong>.</p><p>- As the engine of Ishizu Tearlaments mill your main deck cards for the GY it can happen that you mill the cards of Scrap Raptor so the Scrap Wyvern can also be a card to be banned with Prosperity but in general I keep it because it is a insane letter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the most significant change made besides adding the <strong>Dragonic Diagram + True King Lithosagym engine</strong> was card <strong>Number 23: Lancelot, Dark Knight of the Underworld</strong> in place of <strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Advantages of Number 23:</strong></p><p>- It is an <strong>omni negate every turn</strong>, that is, it <strong>plays the same role as Number 38</strong> but also deals with traps like <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>. The <strong>opponent ends up also being taken by surprise</strong> when he sees that you accessed an omni negate with Ogdoadic's cards.</p><p>- It attacks the <strong>opponent directly</strong> making it <strong>easy for you to do AA-ZEUS in Main Phase 2</strong> and clean the field by going over annoying cards like <strong>Avramax</strong> and <strong>Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</strong> and any monsters with <strong>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon protection</strong> like <strong>Borrelend Dragon</strong> to do AA-ZEUS.</p><p>- When he <strong>inflicts battle damage he destroys an opponent's monster</strong> so it's also a disruption in the battle phase.</p><p>Basically he's as <strong>good going first as Number 38: Harbinger and going second there's no comparison, it's much better</strong>.</p><p>- The only <strong>drawback I see on the card is the low ATK/DEF stat</strong>.</p><p>////////////////////////////////////////////////// ///////////</p>"

Lonefire Blossom being the deck master allows for me to tutor out any plant mosnter I would need for any situation. The deck focuses around recovery tools from the GY to summon back monsters when they get destroyed, as well as plays like Blessed winds to recycle my plants and gain LP. Of course it comes equipped with some draw cards, search cards, and blowout cards to keep me in the game, as well as some late game cleaners like Ruddy Rose. The best part about making your deck master Lonefire is that you can make any plant in your deck your boss monster. This deck uses a lot of plant strategies I love like the Rikkas, the Aromages, and the Plant Princesses.</p>"

With the toad line essentially gone in any competitive capacity, the deck can develop into something exciting and robust.&nbsp;<br /><br />Spright is no longer a single line of play ending on a double toad negate but is something that can shift and adapt its plays based on what they are playing against, with an easy iblee line (starting with gigantic summoning iblee then iblee into sprind for a bounce later on) allows the deck freedom to set up truly unhinged boards while their opponent is stuck waiting for their econ or eclipse.&nbsp;<br /><br />The deck I developed does not use the bujinki link as it requires too much investment for so little payoff. Using up all your resources for a single negate that can bring back a nimble is just not good enough. While the frogs are still powerful extenders, without ronin they really don't eccrue advantage like the deck needs without drawing another water.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the deck lost its most important grind tool in elf, I thought about ways that could replace it, at least in a phantom sense. To do this I had to look at the most valuable aspects of elf and found 2. The first was the ability to recur and maintain resources and the second is the ability to get multiple omni negates per turn. These were fairly easy to solve as there are multiple in archetype options for both these. For the first I looked towards double cross. Double cross can either be a disruption to inturupt your opponent by stealing their important combo piece from either the field or the GY, or a way to recur a card from your GY. With double cross you can still special blue then add pixies to ensure that your monsters don't get walked over as easily. Another way we solve this is with mannequin cat. Mannequin cat is a fantastic addition to the extra deck that was only used before to get out end of anubis and dother janky cards, but everyone overlooked simply summoning back a blue or jet if they summon a dark, red/carrot if your oponant summons ira, or even a ghost ogre if they summon a light.</p><p>to solve the second, we simple look at carrot, red, and the 12 hand traps (13 if you play something other than the gamma package) to dusrupt our opponent. We no longer have to cram in as many bystials as we can and can use other cards to be able to hinder our opponent's plays. While I will admit that I would prefer to have 12 hand traps and a toad negate, I still believe that the follow up allowed in mannequin cat and the much overlooked bounce that sprind has are enough.&nbsp;</p>"

Any card in your hand that isn't a power staple, floodgate, or hand-trap is undesirable, as this deck has almost flawless consistency, besides some truly god atrocious hands where you draw every single orcust/phantom knight in a deck of 60 cards.<br /><br />Player position is very important for your combo due to the link arrows, so keep that in mind when choosing where to sit on the table.<br /><br />If you want me to talk about how the deck actually functions (which you have all the right in the world to do lol, that's why there is a description), you aim to abuse the fact that <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=75732622"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/75732622.jpg"" data-card=""75732622"" data-name=""Grinder Golem"">Grinder Golem</span></a>&nbsp;as a DM is absolutely broken:<br /><br />1 - It is a DARK, so you have access to verte + dpe, all the small Bystials, the entire Orcust engine (besides the knightmares), millennium eyes as an extra copy of called by the grave, the entire PK engine, <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=86066372"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/86066372.jpg"" data-card=""86066372"" data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;as the best link-4 finisher in the game, <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=55285840"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/55285840.jpg"" data-card=""55285840"" data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</span></a> &nbsp;which is extra annoying in a free-for-all, and no one less than the <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=88581108"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/88581108.jpg"" data-card=""88581108"" data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</span></a> (which comes up when using orcusts + PK's).</p><p><br />2 - It is a Fiend, so you actually have access to all the Knightmares, which are arguably the best cards ever printed in terms of versatility and ease of use, and also especially help this deck in making any 2 monsters w/ different names FULL ORCUST + PK COMBO :))<br /><br />3 - And if all that wasn't enough, it's utility as a premium starter is made even better by the Deck Master Rules, which means that you can not only loop it by bouncing it back to your hand w/ <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=28776350"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/28776350.jpg"" data-card=""28776350"" data-name=""Akashic Magician"">Akashic Magician</span></a> and <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=99111753"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/99111753.jpg"" data-card=""99111753"" data-name=""Security Dragon"">Security Dragon</span></a>, any time Grinder Golem leaves the field, after all efects resolve and priority is passed back to you, you may opt to pay LP in incremental amounts to bring it back to the DMZ, from where you can summon him from, again and again, non-once per turn.<br /><br />So basically, make DPE, make redoer, set up a vfd on your oponent's turn and set 5.

Now, if you take aside that they come from the same lore, there is a true reason to pair these archetypes. To play the game, the Deck mainly needs its Spell and Trap cards : World Legacy Pawns gives you a way to interact with your opponent, reactivate your Flip effects and allows you to play way faster ; World Legacy in Shadow transform every of your Krawler into the best way of removal in the game and gives a Special Summon ; and World Leagcy's Mind Meld gives you a negate and a free + 2.</p><p>But to search these cards, your only option in a ""normal"" Krawler Deck is survivor, a really good card that cannot do everything. Thats where your ""Worls Legacy"" monsters. World Armor searches a Spell/trap or another monster, can Special Summon itself and in some rare cases can bounce an Extra Deck monster of your opponent. World Chalice is your main target for Dendrite Krwaler as it allows you to search a Spell/Trap the turn after it was sent to the Graveyard ; allows you to spawnkill one of your opponent's Extra Deck monster and can eventually unbrick you. World Crown is a free extender and a negate of an Extra Deck monster's effect. Finally, World Wand specials a monster from your hand when send to the Graveyard, generally via Dendrite. All of these monster anable a great extra Deck monster : Lib the World Key Blademaster. This monster gives you one of your Spell/Traps if there is a World Legacy in your grave, which you can easily have via Dendrite. It can do that in every of your Main Phases so you're not running out of steam. Its even a great removal if you use it as Link Material or is simply removed by your opponent.</p><p>For the Krawler side, Survivor and Receptor ensure that you have access to every monster you need. Soma is probably one of the best monster ever, simply special two monsters from your Deck or Graveyard, what could go wrong. Glial reborns or special from your hand to swarm. Deus is a one-sided Skill Drain if you Flip it that you can recycle pretty much infinietly. Every Krawler except the last one floats into two others if they are removed because of an opponents card effect, which even applies if they are banished or returned to the hand.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you enjoy this deck.</p>"

Thus, I run board breakers which I found to be more useful after turn 1. As you may have noticed, this is to stop banish-based decks but has some cards to get around other strategies ie. Swordsoul. I have been getting some good results at my locals with this build.</p><p>Marincess players will notice that the chokepoint for their decks are the normal summons. Prevent the normal summon with eclipse, banish or pop it and you lose. I run Vrains and Icejade Tremora to get around this particular choke point. I currently run 2 of each as they do come up and plan on testing other cards as well. Do keep in mind that Blue Slug, Anemone, Dive, and Coral Triangle are the ones that lock you to waters if you activate their effects, so you can get away with running non-waters before activating their effects. Also keep in mind that Argonaut, Marbled Rock, and Bubble Reef just require any water monster and not just Marincess. The other chokepoint is the field spell. Most opponents I face forget about hitting the field spell so I can get away with not protecting it, but that field spell does give you the attack power. Last reminder, Coral Triangle has a grave effect if you control no monsters but your opponent does, making rebuilding your board super easy by summoning the Anemone and Sea Angel back.</p><p>If they have monsters that you cant climb, link into Zealantis as you are locked to waters and your monsters come back and theirs do not.</p><p>Edit: After further testing, this build CAN OTK but requires either Link into the Vrains or Icejade in opening hand. The idea is to go Zealantis, banish all monsters, then summon back only waters (because at this point you are locked to waters if you link climbed). Then, with all the comboing you should have a marincess in hand to climb again into Bubble Reef or enough gas in the grave or already on field. Link climb into Bubble Reef, Battle Ocean attach 3 materials, making her 4600. Sleepy Maiden in grave to attach another material, makes her 5200. 7700 damage here with Zealantis at 2500 and if you have a water in hand, you can pitch to summon a banished marincess and attack for game or if you milled 2 marincess cards off Springirl. Once I get the OTK combo down through further practice I can go into further detail, but this is the gist of how the board will look like for OTK.</p>"

The deck can run with one less increase or one more A hero lives, but I think it's interesting to keep it the way it is, because a hand that theoretically would be a brick now has a high potential, but with certain costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Playing hero on turn 1 has a standard combo that, depending on the missing piece, can cause a high resource expenditure to only result in a dpe + something. The piece that we all cry when we see it in our hand is the increase, because we usually optimize it by 1 card and, therefore, the Faris -&gt; Increase -&gt; Vyon combo will be dead. This deck list tries to get around this problem by adding 3 cards to the main deck and 2 to the extra deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The added cards work like that: First, it is important to have one more hero card to be able to perform the combo, it can be any level 4, but preferably we want the stratos, to look for another card, and it could even be Increase itself (for so he is at 3 and we have 2 E-emergency calls). From that moment on, Summon Level 4 hero -&gt; Special Summon Faris (Discarding Increase) -&gt; Don't use the effect of Faris, because it will lock you into heroes -&gt; Use your 2 monsters to make Isolde, Noble knight -&gt; Effect from Isolde to look for Denier -&gt; Activate Isolde's effect again (sends White Veil to the graveyard) to summon renaud -&gt; Activate Renaud's effect (returns white veil to hand) -&gt; Uses white veil on any of the 2 -&gt; Summon Cross cruzader using the 2 as material -&gt; (and now things get weird) White veil activates the effect causing 3000 damage -&gt; Increase effect in the graveyard activates, bringing it back to the Spell/trap card area -&gt; Activates effect of Increase in Cross Crusader -&gt; Summons Vyon -&gt; Malicious in the cemetery -&gt; effect of vyon (ban Faris) for Polymerization -&gt; Use the 2 monsters to cross-Sheep -&gt; Polymerization -&gt; DPE in the Cross-sheep area -&gt; Bring back Stratos -&gt; his effect activates -&gt; dark Angel for hand -&gt; stratus + cross-sheep for artifact Dagda -&gt; Use the effect of Dpe to destroy itself and destroy Dagda-&gt; activate the effect of Dagda and bring Artifact Scythe to the zone of spell/trap card-&gt; summon dark angel on the opponent's field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Next turn the DPE comes back so use it to destroy Scythe, now your opponent can't use spell card (unless they get rid of dark Angel), and can't summon from extra deck because of Artifact's effect.</p><p>Note: Just be careful when using A hero Lives, as the white veil combo will only leave you with 1000 health.</p><p>PT-BR: Ok, esse &eacute; um experimento, mas &eacute; uma ideia de como nos livrar daquela m&atilde;o horrivel de Faris + Increase, transformando ela em DPE + Dadga + dark Angel. O deck pode rodar com um increase a menos e um A hero lives a mais, mas acho interessante manter do jeito que est&aacute;, pois uma m&atilde;o que teoricamente seria um brick agora tem um potencial alto, por&eacute;m com certos custos.</p><p>Jogar de hero no turno 1 tem um combo padr&atilde;o que, dependendo da pe&ccedil;a que faltar, pode causar um gasto de recurso alto pra resultar somente em um dpe + alguma coisa. A pe&ccedil;a que todos n&oacute;s choramos quando vemos na nossa m&atilde;o &eacute; o increase, pois normalmente otimizamos ela em 1 carta e, sendo assim, o combo de Faris -&gt; Increase -&gt; Vyon estar&aacute; morto. Essa deck list tenta contornar esse problema adicionando 3 cartas ao deck principal e 2 no extra deck.</p><p>As cartas adicionadas funcionam da seguinte maneira: Primeiro &eacute; importante ter uma carta a mais de heroi pra poder realizar o combo, pode ser qualquer nivel 4, mas preferencialmente queremos o stratos, pra procurar outra carta, podendo ser at&eacute; mesmo o pr&oacute;prio Increase(por isso ele est&aacute; em 3 e temos 2 E- emergency call). A partir desse momento, Invoca o hero Nivel 4 -&gt; Invoca&ccedil;&atilde;o especial Faris (descartando Increase) -&gt; N&atilde;o use o efeito do faris, porque isso te travar&aacute; em her&oacute;is -&gt; Use seus 2 monstros para fazer a Isolde, Noble knight -&gt; Efeito de Isolde para procurar Denier -&gt; Ativa novamente o efeito de Isolde (manda White Veil para o cimit&eacute;rio) para invocar renaud -&gt; Ativa effeito de Renaud (retorna white veil para m&atilde;o) -&gt; Usa white veil em qualquer um dos 2-&gt; Invoque Cross cruzader usando os 2 como material&nbsp; -&gt; (e agora as coisas ficam estranhas) White veil ativa o efeito causando 3000 de dano -&gt; efeito do Increase no cimit&eacute;rio ativa, trazendo-o devolta pra area de Spell/trap card -&gt; Ativa efeito do increase no Cross Crusader -&gt; Invoca Vyon -&gt; Malicios no cimit&eacute;rio-&gt; efeito do vyon (bane Faris) para Polymeriza&ccedil;&atilde;o -&gt; Use os 2 montros para fazer cross-Sheep -&gt; Polymeriza&ccedil;&atilde;o -&gt; DPE na &aacute;rea do Cross-sheep -&gt; Traga de volta Stratos -&gt; efeito dele ativa -&gt; dark Angel para m&atilde;o -&gt; stratus + cross-sheep para artifact Dagda -&gt; Use o efeito do Dpe para se destruir e destruir Dagda-&gt; ative o efeito de Dagda e traga Artifact Scythe para zone de spell/trap card-&gt; invoque dark angel no campo advers&aacute;rio.</p><p>No pr&oacute;ximo turno o DPE volta ent&atilde;o use ele para destruir o Scythe, agora seu oponente n&atilde;o pode usar spell card (a n&atilde;o ser que se livre do dark Angel), e n&atilde;o pode invocar do extra deck por causa do efeito do Artifact.</p><p>Nota: Tome somente cuidado ao usar A hero Lives, pois o combo com white veil te deixar&aacute; somente com 1000 de vida.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

This is all the information it gives for this deck:</p><p>This deck focuses on the D/D archetype's ability to summon a variety of powerful boss monsters, with a focus on using Dark Contracts to search for or summon the necessary pieces. The Extra Deck includes a mix of Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link monsters to provide versatility in different situations. Of course, this is just one possible way to construct a D/D deck, and the exact composition may depend on individual player preference and playstyle.</p><p>This side deck includes a mix of cards to help the deck adapt to various matchups and situations. The three monsters in the side deck are all versatile options that can help in different scenarios. Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion can disrupt your opponent's graveyard plays, Artifact Lancea can help shut down decks that rely on banishing, and Dinowrestler Pankratops can help with removal and be a decent body on the field.</p><p>The spells in the side deck are focused on helping to clear problematic cards from your opponent's side of the field. Twin Twisters and Cosmic Cyclone can help with backrow removal, while Dark Ruler No More can help bypass opposing monster effects for a turn. Instant Fusion can help with Extra Deck plays or can be used for Link Summoning.</p><p>The traps in the side deck provide a mix of defensive and offensive options. Evenly Matched can help you come back from a losing position by clearing your opponent's field, Red Reboot can help get around opposing traps, and Solemn Judgment can provide a powerful counter to any plays that your opponent makes.The main card in a D/D deck is typically considered to be D/D Savant Kepler. Kepler is a key piece in the deck's engine, as it allows you to search out your Dark Contract spells, which are crucial for summoning your D/D boss monsters and generating advantage. Kepler is also a level 1 Tuner monster, which can be useful for Synchro Summoning or Link Summoning.</p><p>That being said, the D/D archetype as a whole is designed to work cohesively as a team, with many of the cards supporting each other to create powerful combos and field presence. The deck can generate a lot of advantage and summon a variety of different boss monsters, so it's difficult to pinpoint a single ""main card"" in the traditional sense. Rather, the strength of a D/D deck comes from its ability to adapt to different situations and playstyles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Already having surprising tops and even running the money at the most Recent YCS as of recording the gameplay (in Lyon, France). There is a lot of potential for many hybrid Kashtira builds, so I decided to make a (subtle, yet surprisingly not so terrible attempt) at using the smol birb engine (not Floowandereeze) to add a stack on this other LV7 birb that can negate anything during either players turn by returning itself to the hand (*cough* Mist Valley Apex Avian *cough*). And out the ten matches I played, I was able to get the big omni birb at least 7 times; but doesn't mean ""Simorgh, Bird of perfection"" went to waste however. As it was a perfect XYZ material piece for ""Time Thief - Redoer"" alongside ""Kashtira Riseheart"" (who is also LV4 btw).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Not to mention that Simorgh was helped that the odds of getting Simorgh increased tenfold with the unintentional Zeus fodder ""Raidraptor - Arsenal Falcon"": who simply can detach one material to SS any LV4 Winged-Beast (which means it can SS Simorgh, bird of Perfection); or can be triggered to SS from the hand on Arsenal Falcon's XYZ summon. All of this to search out ""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh"": which helps making summoning Apex Avian easier in case ""Kashtira Birth"" was not present on the field, all for then to summon an additional Winged-Beast Monster.</p>"

It has about 3-4 different ways it can kill you, and I'll go down the list here:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. [OPTIONAL] Crush them with ""Obelisk the Tormentor"".<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a relativly easy task if you're experienced enough with the deck. For those of you who live under a bridge (or new players who were just introdcued to the franchise), summoning Obelisk requires three sacrifices. However, cards such as ""Soul Crossing"" make this much easier, as it allows you to sacrifice three or less of your opponent's monsters instead, however, if your opponent only has let's say two monsters, then you'll need tyo sacrifice your own monsters to summon him. Using his abilities will not be difficult, as the field spell ""Lair of Darkness"" allows you to sacrfice one of your opponent's monsters along with one of yours to destroy all monsters he/she controls.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Burning them with ""Bad Reaction to Simochi"".<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This card is one of my favourites, as it negates any Lifepoints that your opponent would gain, and drains that many Lifepoints instead. It's great for giving your opponent the middle finger with. Now, the cool part about this, is that some cards would initially let you do certain things at the price of healing your opponent, however, with ""Bad Reaction to Simochi"", you essentially get to do these things for free, as well as damage your opponent. While there aren't really cards that do this in this deck, however, you'll notice that there are three ""Gift Card""s in this deck, a card that just gives your opponent three-thousand Lifepoints. Or at least it would if it weren't for Simochi turning it into damage.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Butcher them with ""Litmus Doom Swordsman"".<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ""Litmus Doom Swordsman"" is the most powerful Ritual Monster I own, and honestly the most powerful Ritual Monster I've ever seen (then again I haven't seen enough other Ritual monsters to really know if there's others more powerful than him). Litmus is a monster that functions around Traps, something this deck has plenty of. He comes to the battlefield completely immune to trap effects and cannot be destroyed by battle, and, while there is a trap on the field, he has three-thousand attack points. Now, there is another card in this deck called ""Djinn Demolisher of Rituals"". If you can get this card in your graveyard, you can banish him from there in addition to your Ritual sacrifice to make Litmus immune to your opponent's card effects, on top of all of his other immunities. So you baiscally have an invincible monster on your side of the field. Definently not broken, right?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Miscellanious<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have grouped all of the other ways this deck can kill into one group, since it's basically just ""oh yeah just kill him with 'Doomcaliber Knight'"", or ""just burn them to death with 'Lava Golem' or 'Ectoplasmer' comboed with 'Malice Doll of Demise'"". This catagory is just every other one-or-two-card combo in this deck that can kill.</p><p>I hope you guys like my deck! :)</p>"

Also both normal summon without tribute and banish FACE DOWN effect are incredible.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dracosacc + cherubini is a must now that all 3 main deck names are limited. Alternatively beatrice with diviner and mikanko, but that means your main combo requires a normal summon, a discard, play bricks in main deck, not flexible at all.&nbsp;<br /><br />Belle is debatable and can be replaced but she does protect your tearlaments from banish effects. Edit: Replaced with contact ""c"", nibiru isn't bad but half of the deck is kashtira, and both won't stop hard make ariseheart anyway. Edit#2: Replaced contact ""C"" with lancea, lancea almost never feels bad in hand and almost always soften opponent turn enough for you to break board on your turn. Imperm is good but because of chimera the monster count must always stay at a certain level. Another idea is to main 1 pank and 2 lancea.</p><p>No foolish burial of burial goods because i personally don't find them to do enough. Edit: I still don't find them doing enough in important match up. Edit#2: yeah those 2 are definitely out.<br /><br />Borreload and garura are also replacable depends on how meta will shape. Edit, moved borrel and 1 copy of zeus out in favor for linguriboh and donner. Edit#2: Move dharc out for link 3 black luster. You can absolutely play without him but he is like the ""simplify match up against trap decks"" button this format.<br /><br />Sphere mode is a bit risky, but at least it doesn't lose to iblee or just about any random anti special summon board from rogue.<br /><br />Edit: Removed thrust, it is a spell and is a bit too conditional, good in every other deck but this deck prefer to lead with cards on board and randomly milling target for thurst is very bad.</p><p>Edit#2: Move last copy of talent out for 3rd DRNM.<br /><br />Denko is godly against trap decks.&nbsp;</p>"

I won't always update each previous deck for each format as they won't always be meta relevant but I think this one is really good.

","<p>The deck uses powerful, cheap trap cards to control the game and eventually win the game through a slow grind. The main way the deck works is, by using Bearblocker to protect all of our set traps and Dark Eye Nightmare to refuel the hand during the later game. When the deck runs into a hard-to-remove monster Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer can spin it back to the deck. Sometimes if the deck is working you may find yourself without a way to close out the game, Wave-Motion Cannon hopes to solve that problem.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, the deck works well for being so and can sometimes hold its own against higher-costing decks. One last comment I have to add is, this deck works well for newer players to the game since it's so cheap and has such a simple game plan.</p>"

Honest.,"<p>Blue-Eyes White Dragon is the cornerstone of this deck, everything revolves around it. Alternative gets itself out for free if you have one in your hand, and Jet does the same with just one kill. White Stone is a free summon of a BEWD, Jet, Dragon Spirit, or Solid. The Eyes of Blue Spellcasters can either go into your Synchros or just help to cycle more beatsticks. As for your Spells... Cards of Consonance, Trade-In, and Melody can cycle out your bricks for immediate advantage, especially since a lot of cards here which are bricks in the hand are much better in the Graveyard, where they're legitimate targets for Return of the Dragon Lords, Silvers Cry, or even Ultimate Fusion. Bingo is just a card-neutral trade-in for whatever Blue-Eyes card you need right at that moment. Imperm and Effect Veiler are just your good hand traps if you're struggling with Monster Effects.</p><p>Your Extra Deck is pretty self-explanatory. Fusion Monsters all work with Ultimate Fusion, and can be brought out pretty easily if you can cycle enough Blue-Eyes into hand, deck, or GY (with the bonus of resetting Alternative if you're forced to dump it, since it can't be resurrected without originally being brought out legitimately). Synchros help you get another strong monster on the board, with the available Tuners - particularly White Stone - giving you opportunities to resurrect used materials. All XYZs are Rank 8, and you can just bring out whichever one you need depending on what interests you the most at a given moment - Harbinger for anti-Spell, Heliopolis for board wipe potential, and Galaxy-Eyes for a strong beatstick with once-per-turn targeted removal. As for Links, Borrelsword is just your incredible beatdown, and Hieratic Seal is a Speed 2 Bounce that can also bring out another Dragon when no longer needed.</p><p>Your Side Deck is your basic counterpicks. Ash Blossom is here for when you're struggling with an opponent who heavily deck summons, Twin Twisters have backrow removal, and the Solemns are for if you really need Summon negation. There's also an extra copy each of Consonance, Trade-In, and Silver's Cry, if you feel like your opponent is lacking the ability to block your draw engine or restrict your Graveyard Special Summons, and you want to push that advantage further. Dictator of D is also here for that same reason, in addition to the attack control it offers.</p><p>This is honestly made to be a fairly straightforward pure Blue-Eyes deck - obviously, I could've added a different engine to it, but I wanted to use as few other archetypes as possible in the main deck. I've tried to design it to be as beginner-friendly as possible, to the point where a lot of the deck plays itself if you know the abilities of the cards involved. Might not be perfect, probably has a few flaws that I'm not immediately noticing, but I'm liking how it looks. Hopefully works as a decent Rogue deck.</p>"
