Exosister is probably our easiest matchup since we can avoid using the gy and easily OTK them or leave them on very low LP so they can't use any spell/traps they also lose to TCBOO. Heros lose hard to kaiju on DPE, just gotta play around spoly. Branded can screw us over with ra disciple but if they do the typical line with BiR we can steal MJ or bounce with alpha which puts them in a really bad position. Swordsoul can be tough if they have imperm/veiler to stop the OTK but if you leave a kaiju on their field they cant summon any tenyis to out zeus without commiting to a normal summon, also kaiju on baronne/sinister+stealing chixiao (lvl8) screws them over really hard.</p><p>I have found the best way to beat spright in games 2/3 is to go first and try to end on at least 2 floodgates, don't be afraid to blindly use the dangers for draw power, otherwise they will always be able to OTK you on turn 2. Ogre is a decent going 2nd card for floo and spright but it is rarely enough also spright plays around it with red. I don't run imperm/veiler because kaijus should be enough to deal with monsters, drawing a kaiju + imperm is usually not as good as drawing 2 kaijus and imperm can conflict with gizmek and it is 1 less lvl 8 for trade-in. Also CoH/mind con behave similar to imperm but gives us a body for a rank 8/zombie vampire.</p><p>Final Sigma is really hard for floo to out (they need to make underworld goddess), which is why I run ecclesia and it also nice to side in place of maju when I side in skill drain. 5 normal summons is too many for this deck since we have so much draw power (3 trade-in is effectively 6 upstarts), I ran 2 maju for a long time and would always brick.</p><p>Ash is good against every rogue deck and it can be used under shifter. Belle and called by are in the main because there are simply too many bystials in the format right now and 3 shifter is not enough, you only see it 1 in 3 games. Even if you only draw belle against tear, you could stop elf from bringing back diviner for baronne or merrli on your turn. Also being able to protect gizmek from the ishizu/bystials can be really good. Belle+shifter is insane because you negate called by and often times they use the bystial to dodge lethal and it forces them to wait an extra turn to out zeus with druis. Most decks rely on a monster reborn like effect as an interuption (BiR, expulsion, revolt, elf etc.). Called by is probably the best card against spright because you kaiju toad and when they go elf you use called by on either carrot or toad then safely resolve slumber, also called by on havnis can be really hard for tear to handle if you out cryme first. Any deck with elf I side out CoH, Mind con, and Alpha. Called by+shifter does usually suck going 2nd, but I think I still prefer it over adding another alpha/kaiju. Everyone is playing 6+ bystials so 5 GY hate is necessary. I have had games where I opened 2 shifter and the tear player bystial my gy to avoid lethal or out zeus just so I could shifter again next turn.</p><p>An argument could be made for necrovalley in place of summon limit, but I find 3shifter+calledby+belle+3dimfis is enough GY hate and summon limit is much better going first since it isn't telegraphed and works better with gizmek summon from GY. Also summon limit prevents zeus from hitting the field, so it is really good in combination with dimfis or TCBOO. Could also sub dimfis for necro but dimfis benefits us way more. I don't like macro cosmos because it is too slow, whereas dimfis/necro are still playable going 2nd into tear.</p><p>Kaijus/slumber/Alpha/mind con are all amazing against kashtira though, so I only see this deck getting better once kashtira becomes meta, only problem will be barrier statue which we out with bigfoot/gadarla/LS.</p>"

IMO deep sea diva is still better across matchups since it more easily OTKs but this deck has some advantages when facing tear and spright exclusively. You could tech in spoly/albaz but it just isn't that great in this meta. The biggest synergy with 8-axis is we can search schwarzschild off magna instead of lubellion which is decent if we happen to also have ecclesia because we can make baronne and a rank 8 pretty easily. Sauge+druis is pretty nuts, 1 banish+ 1 pop+1 send and we get a lvl 8 out of it. Ecclesia + Sauge + Magna gets us 3 lvl 8s (schwarz, iris, sauge) and magna or 2 lvl 8s and baronne. Magna search druis with a bunch of lvl 8s in hand makes it pretty easy to setup a rank 6 with draglubion for 15k numeron dragon, or just wipe their field with pain gainer and atk with 4k seven sins + 5k from the bystials. TCBOO can hurt since we have so many dragons and ecclesia cant summon iris under TCBOO without albaz in deck.</p><p>Just updated for ne banlist and kashtira, lava golem is insane against kash as are change of heart/mind con. Schwarzschild and alpha are great into fenrir since they do not trigger. Might consider ogre in main deck as fodder for bystial and counter adventure engine. Zeroboros I threw in last minute for scenarios I am forced to CoH a link monster and need a good payoff also summoning it against kash as alternative to a zeus wipe.</p>"

Not only did they bring an already powerful deck to Tear 0 status, but as an engine, they manage to improve many other Graveyard-reliant decks. Fossils, Zombie World, Naturia, Burning Abyss, you name it. So it should be no surprise that these cards and Lightsworns go together like The Rick and Kevin Hart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck is pretty decent whether you're going first or second, but the ideal is going first. You have some control options like Baronne or Bagooska. But its win condition against many decks is special summoning Archlord Kristya, which prevents both players from special summoning.Otherwise, your goal is to deck your opponent out or reduce their LP to 0. In addition, the deck uses both Exchange of the Spirit and Gravekeeper's Trap to potentially cripple your opponent's Graveyard.</p>"

A competent rank 4 toolbox revolving around level 4 dark monsters. Time thief alone is not very strong and prone to bricking. The deck incorporates raidraptors, rockets, and phantom knights as extenders. The phantom knights engine gives us strong back row negates with fog blade but is mostly useful for rank up magic spells and bardiche (4+1 engine super small).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I reccomend watching the youtube video included to learn the combos more indepthly but I will loosley describe the 1 card combo.</p><p>Regulator-&gt;adjuster(1)+winder(2)-&gt;winder grabs retrograde,adjuster sends bezel ship-&gt;xyz raidraptor force strix-&gt;bezel ship gy effect to special summon self, force strix effect grabs singing lanius, special summon singing lanius-&gt;link into wise strix, wise strix effect ss raider's wing-&gt;xyz summon 2nd force strix and use effect discarding specifically raiders wing to grab strangle lanius-&gt; wise strix procs to set and activate shave force by using the force strix in the gy to rankup into cyber dragon infinity (omni negate)-&gt; use raider's wing in gy effect to detach material and ss self-&gt; link force strix and wise strix into bardiche-&gt; bardiche effect sends phantom knights silent boots to set rank up magic phantom knights-&gt; gy effect silent boots to grab shade brigandine trap-&gt; ss strangle lanius locking yourself into dark monsters-&gt; stangle lanius field effects procs because cyber dragon infinty has an xyz card as material, ss singing lanius from grave-&gt; xyz summon dark rebellion dragon into a place where bardiche points specifically using raiders wing so that it cannot be targetted (this will become the main boss beatstick), you can proc the pop effect if nessessary-&gt; activate shade brigandine because you control no traps and then xyz summon time thief redoer-&gt; set retrograde then pass turn.</p><p>An immaculate first turn 1 card combo although it is susceptible to negates (especially niburu). We run the rockets quick launch for this reasson in order to be an extender. The end board includes a cyber dragon infinity omni-negate as well as the effect to attack a face up attack monster as material on your turn (useful for bystials). a retrograde trap card that negates back row and attaches to redoer as material (trap only works with redoer ont the field). Redoer which can steal the top card of your opponents deck every standby phase, non-target spin an opponents card to the top of thier deck using the trap effect facilitated by shade brigadine, and banish self using monster as self portection so that you can survive the turn with the card at the vary least; these are quick effects btw, drawing power if you manage to steal spell card (trap is the best effect). as soon as possible use the rank up magic and banish your wise strix to go rank up dark rebellion dragon into dark requiem dragon triggering bardiche's pop effect if you ss into a pointed location. Dark requiem dragon has 3k attack and can negate monster effects upto 3x and this is not once per turn (stops board, grave yard, and hand effects/hand traps). dark requiem needs dark rebellion as material in order to use effects so discard that last. Raiders wing offers targetting protection so discard that 2nd last (situational if you rather avoid targeting over having effects. You should detach the other level 4 monster you used as material for dark rebelion first whether that is singing lanius or strangle lanius. On your turn you can use dark requiems effect to target the opponents monster bring its attack down to 0 while adding what was taken to requiems already high 3k damage, and this attack stays indefinetly. Dark reqium is your strongest and most important card. As much as i want to say redoer is the boss hes more like a support side piece compared to the reqium beatstick.</p><p>rokkets are the best extenders to play through ash blossoms or other negates. all 3 monsters are targets for quick launch. caliber can ss if you have wise strix or bardiche. recharger has good defence/ self protection and can also be a monster reborn in hand. tracer is my goto for my first quick launch use because the others have other effects in hand when you don't have a normal summon. Tracer is great for outing problem cards your opponent special summons to your field like the dinos token and resolving that quick effect gets you a free ss from deck to go into a dark rank 4 xyz. It is also great for outing the fog blade when you wantt it gone, or fly hack and salaman almiraj. Salaman great almiraj is an important extender and potential protection for the deck. Alot of the cards in the deck are chosen to be able to go into almiraj specifically all the hand traps, silent boots, radiers wing, singing lanius, caliber, recharger, regulator, and bezel ship. ***instead of 2 bezel ships, it was suppose to be 1 chronocorder too but the deck builder doesnt have it in inventory. bezel ship is a very important combo peice but is weak if it is in your hand. chronocorder is great in graveyard for followup and it can be a magic cylinder if your oppenent tries to focus attack with one large boss monster. they may be forced to skip battle phase. Salaman great alimirag can link off these monsters because their normal summon is a 1000 or less. The extender combo is having any of these listed cards in hand as well as a paralell exceed. You normal summon 1 of the viable cards, link into almiraj to proc exceeds and it will special summon itslef as a level 4 and ss another copy of itself onto the field also level 4 so that you can summon a rank 4. it is important not to clog the middle position or the right most position&nbsp; because the first paralel exceeds needs almirajs arrow. An OTK package is included with raiders knights. if the opponents has alot of monsters on the field or you do and just need within 3000 to OTK you can use this option. xyz into rank 4 raiders knights with any 2 level 4 dark monsters. detach material to rankup into arc rebellion dragon. lasts 4 turns. it will gain bare damage for OTK. i prefer bagooska to stall with a brick hand, evilswarm knight is a great not once per turn book of moon to stop your opponent from linking. zeus is a great last resort for a sending black hole. Time thief is able to amass cards for to allow for the incredible zues double detach reuiring 4 matierials allowng zeus to play through a negate. If you have raiders wing as material you can make zeus untargetable. Flyback trap is great to get a specific material onto redoer or to disrupt your opponents GY, but is mostly useless its a perputua target (just scare your opponent into thinking it is mirror force lol). I think skull meister is way better than ghost belle and not once per turn but ghost belle is a target for almiraj. Instead of time thief hack I was suppose to run a 3rd ash blossom which is probably smarter but just to see more time thief cards I included it. It is a target for winder and its cool effect is to protect your xyz monsters from destruction the turn they are summoned. If you know your opponents has a monster destruction on hand you can use hack to protect and also it gives time thief redoer 300 attack for each material and allows it to attack directly. I think perpetua and double barrel are trash for the most part tbh better to put situational rank 4s. The 1 card combo can also rank up into ultimate falcon if you need to lets say your opponent destroys your board everything barring redoer and the rank up magic then you can rankup into falcon or arc rebellion using time thief when it comes back from banishment. play around with the hand traps maybe use allure of darkness for draw power, maybe you can get rid of the veillers and ghost belles for a radion dark kaiju package which can help alot with outing problem cards. Radion can be ss when even after you lock yourself into dark due to tracer or strangle lanius. Its 2800 attack so its not too crazy but it can also be something you use to up your opponents board attack so that you can increase your arc rebllion by 2800 or even open up the battle phase field w/ an attack positon monster. Be careful when locking yourself into dark becasue bagooska, exciton knight, and abyss dweller is no longer an option. Sadly, the paralell exceeds combo cannot give you the raiders knight OTK becasue it needs to dark monsters.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways lol if you actually read all this. This was just an adhd splurge but you'll probably know everything about this deck. pro tip if you do not have regulator but you do have winder and adjuster in hand you can normal winder search for start up and then use start up on adjuster to dumb bezel ship and still go full combo. This is the main reason we run that trash that is time thief start up. so regulator or winder+adjuster in hand can go full combo if not negated. Cool facts the archetype is based on a manga called chronos ruler. The time thiefs are pitted against the s-force archetype. Also all the girls in the art work (adjuster,startup,flyback,hack,perpetua) are all perpetua at different ages becasue the whole lore is about her creating a team to send to the past to save herself because is being targeted by other time travellers (kinda like the movie 'looper'). Anyways GG thank you for reading.&nbsp;</p>"

This deck is what I've come ended up with that has the best consistency and has been allowing me to build a board if needed.</p><p>You will brick, DW bricks. It happens, this isn't a competitive deck but it can build boards if you want too (you either FTK or build a board, usually)</p><p>Here, I focus more on the Lvl8 to try extend the combo to use Coach King Giantrainer as I found with his build I couldn't quite get there. I'd always run out of momentum after using Number 15.</p><p>Fabled raven is handy, but it doesn't come up enough. It can't be searched through Snoww, so I took it out. I also don't run 3 Zalamanders as they can only be used once, so I find 2 is enough. 2 Lucent is also enough as you only need 2 for Number 6. Genta I play 2 of, instead of 3 as it's only got a single use. Blackwing - Zephyros can bounce an active copy of Gates back to your hand allowing it to be used again, plus brings a Lvl 4 onto the field. Because of this you could technically cut the 3rd copy of gates. But it doesn't hurt to open 1 or 2 copies as you usually will have enough resources in your starting hand for them.</p><p>One pin point is adding Ceruli to the hand from the GY. If you could accomplish this, it would add a little more consistency with Lucent to bring out Number 6. But I haven't found anything (or know of anything, please do let me know if you know something that would work, I would love to test it)</p><h3>The combo &amp; materials required to complete it, step by step</h3><p><em><span>note: This is a general step by step, generally you should start with Number 60, but sometimes it doesn't work out that way, think ahead and try reach the correct materials. You have to ensure Number 60 is in the gy BEFORE Number 6 is summoned, or you'll miss the timing on the burn effect as it's an on summon effect. Most of the time, you should get the opponent down to 1400 LP. The final 1400 is the trickiest as you usually run out of momentum. But with enough luck and planning, you should be able to get there.

He just isn't at full potential because he doesn't have <strong>Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</strong> anymore because the card was banned (we hope it comes back soon).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The idea behind this deck comes from the problem that the Dinosaur deck has after the <strong>Miscellaneousaurus</strong> limitation in the TCG: The deck manages to make the standard <strong>Dinosaur plays but doesn't have any good follow ups</strong> unless it uses weird cards that return Miscellaneousaurus to the GY, Deck or Hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With the addition of the <strong>Scrap Raptor engine</strong>, the deck continued to <strong>play with the same characteristic</strong> of having excellent starters that generate advantage through Babycerasaurus, which is the thematic card behind the archetype, but with a <strong>much larger and more versatile play ceiling</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Scrap engine allows you to <strong>improve access to extra deck monsters</strong> because it generates many more summons in addition to working very well as a starter also with <strong>Lost World</strong> or <strong>Miscellaneosaurus</strong>. And you only need to use 2 <strong>Scrap Raptor</strong> + 1 <strong>Scrap Chimera</strong> + <strong>Scrap Wyvern</strong> besides being able to make a full combo using only 1 Scrap Raptor so if you draw 1 of them it is still possible to play without problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To exemplify <strong>Scrap Dinosaur's combos</strong>, this deck profile of mine shows all the possible moves to use these engines efficiently: <strong>Scrap Dinosaur Jul21 Format</strong></p><p>https://ygoprodeck.com/deck/scrap-dinosaur-jul21-format-190121</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the same way, I believe that using the <strong>Ogdoadic brings a new dynamic</strong> where you <strong>no longer lose to a hand trap in the Normal Summon</strong>, increases the options of plays in the first turn and even <strong>returns the follow up Miscellaneousaurus to the GY</strong> along with the Ogdoadic themselves which are follow up in the GY.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And I learned very early that when <strong>playing Dinosaur it's no use trying to make beautiful passing</strong> moves with Synchro <strong>Borreload Savage</strong> monsters + Link-4 <strong>Apollousa</strong> + <strong>Abyss Dweller</strong> etc that are combos that <strong>lose for all hand traps</strong> and many don't even have follow up which means that if the opponent uses a Dark Ruler No More and cleans your field you lose. So the intention is to do the basics of the deck which is to <strong>access XYZ monsters plus Follow Ups and some LINK-2</strong> like <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> or <strong>Spright Elf</strong> already guarantee an excellent end board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the most creative deck I've ever made in the game and it's not a competitive deck because it has <strong>several problems when it goes first or second</strong>, whether it's not being able to open the best <strong>combinations of cards</strong> or the fact that there's no room for <strong>tech cards</strong>. Especially because easy to use cards that automatically give you an advantage are the best cards in the game. This is the safest way to play a game like Yugioh, it's much better to make a simpler move, weaker but much more efficient than a much more powerful move that has several weaknesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now I'm going straight to the subject of hand tests that I did in this version that I already make it clear that they are not done in a didactic way because many plays I return or change the extra deck card that I do among other details but that by themselves manage to convey the idea base behind the deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even in the previous version of the deck that I had already made a while ago, I have almost 30 combos that are still valid in this version (apart from the parts involving Chaos Ruler): <strong>Scrap Dino Ogdoadic Dec21 Format</strong></p><p>https://ygoprodeck.com/deck/scrap-dino-ogdoadic-dec21-format-232240</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So after seeing this other deck profile you can continue with Test Hands with the excellent <strong>Spright Elf</strong> but without the absurd Chaos Ruler:</p><p><strong>Test hand 1</strong> - https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-45442028</p><p>Fossil Dig(Oviraptor) + Miscellaneousaurus + Giant Rex + Nauya + Aron</p><p><strong>End Board: Tyranno + Dolkka + Number 38: Harbinger + Spright Elf + Babycerasaurus</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 2</strong> - https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-45438981</p><p>Miscellaneosaurus + Babycerasaurus Standard Combo</p><p><strong>End Board: Tyranno + Dolkka + Number 38: Harbinger + Spright Elf + Babycerasaurus</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 3</strong> - https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-45438783</p><p>Combo example of Lost World + Dino Wrestling since you tried to play with the <strong>Ogdoadic and ended up taking Bystial and the opponent has more monsters than you</strong>.</p><p>In this example I did with the person being smart to ban Keurse. I:P Masquerena was also able to do it but I <strong>put Tyranno in the wrong monster zone which means you have to pay close attention to spamming monsters</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 4</strong> - https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-45438473</p><p>Combo Lost World + Scrap Raptor: Could have waited to use Miscellaneousaurus eff only after using Oviraptor's second eff and making Evolzar Dolkka to throw around D.D. Crow.</p><p>Do I:P Masquerena since you can't do any RANK-4 in this example if you choose to play safe by doing Dolkka.</p><p><strong>End Board: Tyranno + Dolkka + I:P Masquerena + Spright Elf + Babycerasaurus</strong></p><p>(Note: Wyvern is summoned because the opponent controls monsters)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 5</strong> - https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-45438396</p><p>Combo: (Snake Rain + Discard) + (Archosaur + Tyranno)</p><p>End Board: (Tyranno + Linkuriboh) + (I:P Masquerena + Keurse)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 6</strong> - https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-45438037</p><p>FULL DECK COMBO: (Oviraptor + Babycerasaurus) + (Snake Rain + Discard)</p><p>As you already have both engines able to play independently so you can simply <strong>Abyss Dweller</strong> instead of Feral Imps and then activate Double Evolution Pill and make Spright Elf and bring Babycerasaurus that will be Keurse's tribute to play Ogdoadic.</p><p><strong>End Board: Tyranno + Dolkka + Dweller + Number 38: Harbinger + Spright Elf + Babycerasaurus</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 7</strong> - https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-45598284</p><p>Combo: (Scrap Raptor + Miscellaneousaurus) + Nauya</p><p><strong>End Board: Tyranno + I:P Masquerena + Iron</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 8</strong> - https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-45598064</p><p>Combo: (Nunu + Oviraptor + Oviraptor) = Combo Throw Around Hand Traps</p><p><strong>End Board: Tyranno + Linkuriboh + I:P Masquerena + Iron</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Points to pay attention to</strong>:</p><p>The amount of <strong>monster zones available</strong> because there are some combinations of cards that <strong>generate 2 monsters in the main monster zone</strong> so always be aware of this so as not to lose summons for nothing. Another very important point about these card combinations is that they <strong>always keep the deck's advantage as making XYZ Monsters and LINK Monsters has become very good because the cost is always replaced with other card combinations</strong>.</p><p><strong>Combination 1</strong> = Double Evolution Pill + Giant Rex = Tyranno + Giant Rex /</p><p><strong>Combination 2</strong> = Scrap Raptor plus any other monster on the field by itself is a 2 Link for free while interacting with the opponent among other really cool synergies.</p><p><strong>Combination 3</strong> = Keurse tribute Feral Imps = Keurse + Nauya with the possibility of Water Lily summoning happening.</p><p>Not counting when there was <strong>Chaos Ruler which also means more summons for free every turn</strong> making it possible to do <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>.</p><p>Pay attention to when you want to do <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> too because the <strong>Spright Elf</strong>'s arrows might be all busy. And also pay attention in case you manage to leave a <strong>Scrap Raptor in the deck if you can play using only 1 of it</strong>, because since there are already few Dinosaur monsters in the deck, keeping that second Scrap Raptor is not bad most of the time and in the worst case you can <strong>add it with Oviraptor to be the Knightmare Unicorn discard</strong> made with I:P Masquerena.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Synergies:</strong></p><p>Always be aware when using <strong>Aleirtt</strong> because you have to make sure you <strong>have Reptile banned and you have the options of Nauya and Nunu</strong> who are banned when they are special by Keurse or by themselves in the case of Nunu. You also have the option to banish a Reptile with the <strong>Double Evolution Pill and also in that same thinking you can use Bystial</strong> for that too.</p><p>Excellent synergy is between <strong>Scrap Wyvern</strong> and <strong>Spright Elf</strong> because before you went from <strong>Wyvern + Giant Rex</strong> and now you do it and that way you can reborn <strong>Babycerasaurus</strong> on your turn which becomes an excellent follow up on the opponent's turn to be <strong>destroyed with Tyranno</strong> and bring <strong>Oviraptor</strong> that adds <strong>another Tyranno to the hand</strong> and in this process he <strong>protects Tyranno and Dolkka</strong> from being <strong>targeted by the opponent's cards</strong> making them much better boss monsters which is something that previously needed the Lost World field to achieve.</p><p>And on the opponent's turn, the <strong>Spright Elf simply reborns the Scrap Wyvern again</strong>, which means that if he survives on your next turn, you can easily use his effect and <strong>reborn the Scrap Raptor and do the Borreload Savage</strong>, guaranteeing your victory. That is, this <strong>insane Link-2 is perfect in the deck</strong> working as a <strong>follow up, protection</strong> both by it and by triggering Lost World every turn and interaction with the opponent. Only you should remember that Spright Elf cannot be used as a link material the turn it is summoned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What I noticed in the duels:</strong></p><p>Crucial error: <strong>Follow Up</strong> to add to the hand at the end of combos or during the <strong>opponent's turn with Oviraptor will always be Tyranno</strong>, even because it is the main win condition of the deck and the card that has the <strong>most power to take control of the match</strong> for you by clearing the field so the <strong>opponent will do everything to take him out</strong>. And I noticed that Spright only takes him out using <strong>Spright Smasher and Bystial Druiswurm</strong> is another option, so <strong>always add another Tyranno to your hand whenever possible</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Bystial cards are not good against my Dinosaur deck but they are excellent against the Ogdoadic cards</strong> so you will find it very difficult to play this part of the deck in many games.</p><p><strong>Without Mystic Mine many matches don't need to worry about backrow</strong> but the more backrow hate you have available on the side deck the better it will be.</p><p>The two engines are <strong>very good at complementing each other to avoid one being stopped</strong> and you end up with nothing, but against the best decks released in recent times which are <strong>Spright and Tearlaments along with Kashtira and Bystial cards the deck has proven itself suffer a lot from power creep</strong> mainly since it no longer has access to one of the best extra deck cards which is <strong>Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Disregard the side deck</strong> because they are just examples of cards you can use in the extra deck or main deck. The first main deck cards I would consider <strong>pulling out are World Dino Wrestling and Set Rotation</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p>"

This is where <strong>Number 39: Utopia Rising shines to help you to have more control of the game</strong> when you lose your established field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Finally, other changes I made to my Utopia deck:</strong></span></p><p>Using <span><strong>ZW - Lightning Blade</strong></span> instead of <strong><span>ZW - Tornado Bringer</span></strong> proved to be much better because <strong><span>Ultimate Leo Utopia Ray</span></strong> does not interact with the opponent if it is <strong>not equipped with a ZW monster</strong> and if the opponent uses a <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> for example you practically lose two negates of monsters including the one from <strong><span>ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber</span></strong>. So this destruction protection proved to be better during games than target protection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another main change was using <span><strong>Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon</strong></span> instead of <strong><span>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</span></strong> since even though it is excellent to negate spells on the opponent's turn, Number 92 is able to be used by surprise in the End Phase to <strong>banish all opponent's set cards</strong> which means winning games against trap decks.</p><p>And since decks that use a lot of spells are usually combo decks that need to resolve a lot of monster effects and the deck alone <strong>already ends the combo with at least 2 more monster negates</strong> so I see it being a great choice to opt for Number 92 instead of Number 38.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And another excellent use of <span>Number 99: Utopia Dragonar</span> on the opponent's turn besides bringing Number 92 is using it to bring <span><strong>Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</strong></span> which becomes a <strong>great floodgate against several decks</strong> that will hurt the turn a lot of them and that even making your monsters also cannot activate effects you will still have the <span><strong>ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber</strong></span> to negate monster effects and the <span><strong>Numbers Protection</strong></span> or any hand trap to stop any other move he tries to make.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now between the synergy of <span><strong>Number 99: Utopia Dragonar</strong></span> with <strong><span>Number 39: Utopia Rising</span></strong> is that you can use Utopia Dragonar to bring Rising that will reborn another Number XYZ from GY like <strong><span>Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</span></strong> among others and even later it may bring Number 39 back. So, there is an <strong>excellent option of cards to give Reborn and recover his win condition again to the field</strong> since in addition to giving Reborn he transfers his own xyz materials.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's why this <strong>small change in the Utopia deck greatly improves the grind game</strong> and makes it possible to easily establish your field to take control of the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Disregard the side deck</strong>, they are just card options that you can test.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

While Pure Branded maintains hand advantage and easily generates giant beatsticks, Predaplant takes that a step further. Predaplant makes bigger boards that are more difficult to break, and it trades Banishment/Destruction interruption for straight up monster/omni negates. A multi-negate Predaplant board is created through a non-linear combo which can somewhat play through interruption. (Ash on Branded Fusion still stops you cold however!)</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0 FluidPluginCopy ContentPasted2 elementToProof""><span>Generally, no matter what hand, most Predaplant Branded combo starts with the following steps:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0 FluidPluginCopy ContentPasted2 elementToProof"">&nbsp;</p><ol><li class=""elementToProof"">Gain access to Branded Fusion. (Predaplant can search the card from deck by Orphys Scorpio, normal summoned or summoned from deck by Ambulomelides).</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Activate Branded Fusion for Albion, sending Albaz + Staysailor.&nbsp;</li><li class=""elementToProof"">CL1 Staysailor to send Byblisp from deck, CL2 Albion to fuse for Lubellion, banishing a dark monster and Albaz from field/GY.&nbsp;</li><li class=""elementToProof"">CL1 Byblisp to search for either&nbsp;<span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted2 FluidPluginCopy ContentPasted3"">Orphys Scorpio (If you can't normal summoned yet) or Bufolicula (additional fusion summon), CL2 Lubellion to fuse for either Mirrorjade (interruption) or Ambulomelides (more resources).&nbsp;</span></li><li class=""elementToProof ContentPasted4 ContentPasted9"">Depending on your hand, the monsters on your field and GY set-up, you fuse the rest of the monsters in your field and hand to summon Predaplant boss monsters. The end result field varies by situation/hand, but its usually any combination of Mirrorjade,&nbsp;Dragostapelia, Triphyoverutum,&nbsp;<span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted2 FluidPluginCopy ContentPasted8"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon and a set Spell/Trap Fusion interruption like Super Poly, Branded in Red and Branded Banishment.</span></li></ol><ul><li class=""elementToProof ContentPasted4"">If you already have Bufolicula in your hand, it is ideal to search Triantis with Ambulomelides.

Try to bait out the Ash/Interruption as much as possible - then use Branded Fusion.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>In order for Starving Venom Predapower Fusion Dragon's omni-negate to be live, it needs a monster on field with a predator counter. Predator counters are distributed by using Triantis as fusion material. Or even better, use Dragostapelia to give your opponent's monster a predator counter, then tribute it as cost!</span></li><li><span>There are 8 flex spots in this deck where staples are used. My preferred strategy in Masterduel's Bo1 format is using board breakers so I can play the game. These 8 flex spots can be filled with any card you like however, like handtraps such as Maxx ""C"" or draw cards like Allure of Darkness.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>If you are going first and have access to Instant Fusion (Remember, Orphys Scorpio and Darlington Cobra searches any fusion card) + Branded Opening, you can summon Winda and effectively bypass Instant Fusion's self-destruct effect by having your spent Branded Opening in the GY!</span></li><li><span class=""elementToProof""><span>This deck has many routes to the same endboard result. One combo guide cannot do the complexity of this deck justice. I highly recommend practicing for yourself how this deck works and you'll see what I mean!</span></span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal FluidPluginCopy""><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted2"">CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal FluidPluginCopy elementToProof"">Has your Branded deck become a bit stale with overuse the past couple months? Has the consistency hits from the banlist lower the power level for your Branded deck? If you wanna spice up your Branded deck with a cool set of ferocious eldritch mutated plants, Predaplant is the deck for you!<br /><br />Trading power and resources for negates and board presence, Predaplant offers its own unique flavour of fusion summoning with Branded cards.

Following that, having Labrynth on field guarantees that Sanguine will summon Eldlich. Labrynth will prevent Ash, and even if it is somehow is negated or Feather Dustered, Labrynth can set it back on the field during your turn. Overall, using Eldlich and Labrynth's respective gameplans of floodgates and card destruction makes for an extremely satisfying control deck suited for only the most heinous of sadists.</p><p>Ask any Master Duel player, if you play a broken deck that everyone hates, you're a garbage human being, but add an archetype that's less than stellar and it is immediately based.

Zombie Synchro is not only heightened by the P.U.N.K. engine; it also is the coolest duel-archetype aesthtic in the game. The idea of cyber punk zombies is enough to realese endorphines upon the thought alone. The deck itself is brilliant. It imparts a variety to the game that is rarely seen in the average Master Duel match. This is because Zombie Synchro boasts a nonlinear combo game that is adaptable to a variety of situations your opponent can throw at you, making the deck have a high skill ceiling that requires the user to not only have a knowledge of each of their card's effects, but also a knowledge of the your opponent's cards as well. The challenge the deck provides will always lead to a feeling of superiority after besting your opponent in any Gold IV game.</p><p>Something that my deck listing delivers that other decks don't is a good selection of hand traps that makes this ""Going First"" deck have an easier time when you inevitably lose the coin flip. It also keeps the card count as close to 40 as possible while ensuring no part of either the Zombie or P.U.N.K. engine is weakend to save space. Most other Zombie decks (especially on MD Meta) will instead go for a 60 card deck and try to high roll with <em>That Grass Looks Greener</em> as a less than dependable strategy. This deck strives for consistency in the opening hand and is really what I want to preface most of all, because while it is a wonderful feeling when your deck gives you a godly hand that can lead to setting a <em>Baronne</em>, <em>Balerdroch</em> and a <em>Zombie Dragon Lord </em>on turn one, that feeling is muffled when you brick five games in a row before getting it. So 3 <em>Banshees</em>, 3&nbsp;<em>Zombie Worlds</em>, and 3 <em>Ze Amins</em>. This will allow even your most abyssmal of hands to set up&nbsp;<em>Zombie World</em> and a tuner, the minimum you will want to do. From there, have fun, experiment, and learn the ins and outs of the deck because it is a maze of combinations and plays that is second only to D/D.</p><p>The most important thing I can say is learn when you are locked into Zombies because there are a fair amount of times where I could have gone for a great end board but I simply triggered my effects in the wrong order. Other than that, I can only reiterate that the deck provides a challenge that will put your skills as a duelist to the test and I sincerely hope you give the deck a try because it is the first deck to truly make me feel like I'm playing Yu-Gi-Oh.</p><p>As a P.S. to this literal essay (bless you if you've actually read this far) some youtube channels that can help you with your journey are TheAfroCain, MasterDuelCentral, and my personal favorite Redzero03. The deck really gave me something to feel proud about when playing the game because I always wanted to craft a combo deck that wasn't linear but actually required you to think about your next play. Which, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with simple decks, I for one play Salamangreat all the time. But it gets boring. You don't have to use my listing, but I hope you give Zombie Synchro a try and that the deck gives you that same feeling of excitement it gave me.</p>"

Based on playtesting, the deck RARELY bricks but that is not a 100% guarentee it will never happen. So continue switching handtraps as you see to your liking, this will serve just as a BASE deck build<br /><br />FAQ<br />1. Why not put call by the grave in the main deck?<br />This is dependent on your area if they're playing Maxx C or Effect Veiler (Effect Veiler is the greatest threat, as its not once per turn), I do recommened you put them in cause if either one triggers, you're in for an out of hand situation unless you OTK or have a full negate board while pendulum summoning. Take note this deck CORE principle is to pendulum swarm and link as much as you can with or without the 2 negates<br /><br />2. Have you considered Kurikara Divinecarnate?<br />Yes, if you thought of not letting monster effects run free during your turn<br /><br />3. Is it necessary for that Antihuman Meta Me Psy A to be in the deck?<br />Scale of 0 with banish anything that goes into the GY except monsters when used as a scale, you can bully those magic spammy decks or trap deck with it<br /><br />3. Why no XYZ like Odd Eyes Absolute Dragon?<br />I did consider it but if you were to use that, then might as well add on Odd Eyes Pendulumgraph for maximum usage.<br /><br />4. Why not using Odd Eyes Pendulumgraph, it has a good negate magic effect when u have an empty scale?</p><p>It's underutilizing pendulumgraph without the other odd eyes dragons, as you do get a bonus Odd Eyes summon with it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Also has many negates and you cant bait summon for days and still get a nice board out at the end.</p><p>Its very good and can beat many opponents but if they have really meta decks with countless negates and board wipes then at some point you will just loose. Main weakness i noticed is Red Eyes Dark Dragon which can be beaten if you get Malicious Bane out, put him in DEF position and spam its abillity if they have other monsters and then wait for Dark Ruler No More (idr if it works?)</p><p>Theres hardly any brick chances, like 95% of times you wont brick or even more.</p><p>And some cards are optional like Neos which i dont need to use, its just for fun surprises, you can remove or exchange Woodsman for Blazeman (idk really which one is better or if they are even needed + their use is situational), Dark Ruler No More is also optional and situation based, Dian is there for rare situations with only Solid Soldier or i guess now Woodsman on the board with Mask Change, Adoration almost never used, as there are always better options, its only here to fill out the ED and maybe a last reserve and it could be replaced with other card you prefer like Escuriado, Divine Wind is there for fun for card draw but i never use it as there are better options but it can be used for variety plays and it replaced Blast which was kinda used for backrow, kinda same with Acid. You could maybe add/exchange Parallel World Fusion, Monster Rebord or add one Polymerization and Miracle Fusion</p>"

As we are waiting for one of the best cards in this deck to be released in the TCG, ""Big Welcome Labrynth,"" we can substitute this for some Ice Dragon's Prison, an extra Torrential Tribute, or make Ghastly Glitch a 3 of. You can also cut the furnitures to add some additional traps but they help with getting Back Jack to the grave (Don't be afraid to discard mosters if you have Labrynth Labrinth up. We can Summon them back) as well as being a set for Welcome Labrynth and can bait negates like everyone's favorite card ASH BLOSSOM!!! Don't forget that you can use the field spell + Compulsory Evacuation Device to do massive damage on your Battle Phase by sending a monster that has already battled back to the hand and re-summoning it from the had for a double attack.

On my decklist you can switch the hand traps and use what you prefer the most. Now on extra deck stuff get serious because space is limited. So from my experience I can say that these cards are the most usefull to be played as main or you can pick some from the side deck.</p><p>-</p><p>How to play this deck:</p><p>You begin with an<strong> adamancipator</strong>( you can use <strong>doki doki</strong> or <strong>cartorhyn</strong> to help with hand traps or get an adamancipator on board) and want to special summon <strong>Flint Crager</strong> on board so that you can send from the extra deck to GY <strong>Skullgar</strong> in order to get fossil fusion at hand. By filling the board with monsters with adamancipator effects probably you will be at a state where you can summon <strong>Naturia beast + Raptite + 2 monsters</strong> to link summon <strong>Cross-sheep</strong>. Then use fossil fusion to summon the other fossil by banishing <strong>Rock band Xenoguitar</strong> which can send to the grave(and after this to special summon <strong>Revival Golem</strong>).

Who you gonna call? EXOSISTERS!!! ,"<p>Exosister is a deck specifically designed to counter a graveyard meta. Today (as with most meta over the course of Yugioh history), the meta is dominated by the Graveyard with all the Tearlaments, Ishizu, Runick, Bystial and Spright cards running around! With literally almost every deck dependent on GY interaction, it is now time for the beautiful combat nuns to exorcise the evils in the graveyard - The EXOSISTERS!<br /><br />The Exosister gimmick is to transform their singular maindeck monster cards that are on the field into their power-up XYZ Extra Deck forms with various on-summon effects that lock out the graveyard for the turn. Their effects range from ""neither player can activate effects in the GY"" (Asophiel), ""neither player can summon from the GY this turn"" (Kaspitell), ""monster negate"" (Gibrine) and ""banish"" (Mikailis). To top it all off, a powerful board breaker and OTK enabler (almost like Accesscode) joined the Exosister Extra Deck lin-up in Dimension Force - Magnifica! Magnifica can non-target banish a card on the field and attack TWICE! That means she is 5600 damage on-board, or 7200 damage with Gibrine's attack increase effect - meaning that OTK can happen very quickly with this deck once an ideal boardstate is achieved. </p><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</em></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br />Not only is this deck beautiful and fun - it is relatively simple to use! There is minimal complex combos or resource management. All you do is slap down some staple foodgates/boardbreakers, summon powerful monsters and OTK! <br /><br />Watch the opposing Tearlament player's face contort in pain as you chain Dimension Shifter or activate Necrovalley! Laugh as you slap down one of your many blind second field wipes on your opponent's established board that they've worked so hard to create! Missing a card? You can dig into your deck with Pot of Prosperity for 6 since you don't really need most of your Extra Deck!</p><p>Going first or second, this is the simple common combo this deck uses:</p><p>1. Get two Exosisters on field to summon Kaspitell.</p><p>2. Activate Kaspitell effect to search for another maindeck Exosister monster to facilitate the summon of Mikaelis. (Usually its Martha. If you already used Martha to summon Kaspitell, grab an extender to normal summon + special summon -&gt; Mikaelis).</p><p>3. Use your two Exosister monsters on-field to summon Mikaelis. Banish a card on-field as needed.</p><p>4. Activate Mikaelis' effect to search for an Exorsister spell/trap. (Going first, you'd generally you'd want to search Returnia to banish 1-2 cards on your opponent turn. If you already have it, get Vadis instead. Going second, you may want to search for Pax to summon another Exosister on field to push for game.)</p><p>5. Overlay Kaspitell + Mikaelis to summon Magnifica. Banish a card on-field as needed.</p><p>Going first, this combo from 1-2 Exorsister cards in-hand results in 4 banishes on your opponent's turn as well as a beefy hard-to-kill 2800 ATK monster!</p><p>Going second, this combo banishes 2 cards and can play through interruption especially if you've already simplified the game-state with your staple floodgates/boardbreakers to push for game!</p><p>In an ideal gamestate and empty opponent board, OTK is achieved through Magnifica + Jibrine. If you've saved your Magnifica from turn one, all you have to do is summon Jibrine to push for an OTK. Jibrine + Magnifica on an empty board is 9400 damage to your opponent's life points!</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</em></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">GENERAL TIPS</strong></p><ul><li class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">While this deck is specifically tailored to hard-counter GY strategies, other decks that don't rely on graveyard is this deck's worst enemy - mainly Floowandereeze. Be sure to side in your Zombieworlds when facing them!</span></li><li class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">When going second against a Floowandereeze player and they have a set ""Dreaming Town"" on their field while you have Dark Ruler No More, you can play a funny mind game with them. Bluff the Evenly Matched in your hand by attempting to go to battle phase. This will force your opponent to activate Dreaming Town, since they can only activate it in the main phase. They will summon Apex Avian, so they can negate evenly matched. Now that you baited out their Apex Avian, you can now negate their entire board with Dark Ruler No More! (Trust me, this bluff works every single time, it's hilarious!)</span></li><li class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">When you opponent activates a card that moves a card out of the GY, like Bystial Magnumut or Kitkallos, chain Exorsister Vadis to give yourself two free monsters + powerful lingering floodgate effects/interruption that lock the GY or clear the field! </span></li><li class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">You can side out Called By the Grave alot of the time in this deck, since many cards in your arsenal render the GY useless/inaccessible anyways. </span></li><li class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">If you're going first, side in all your going first floodgates that often insta-win you the game. (Thanks for the free wins Anti-Spell and Gozen Match).</span></li><li class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">The cards in the Extra Deck commonly banished with Pot of Prosperity are: 1 copy of Mikaelis, 1 Zeus, 1 Bagooska, 1 Cowboy, 1 copy of Artemis, and 1 Tornado Dragon. </span></li><li class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">If you have plenty of extenders available for your mainline combo, try to save your normal summon for Sophia for an extra draw. Sophia can also be summoned from deck with Pax if Irene is somehow in your GY. <br /></span><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</em></p></li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The graveyard is dominating the metagame... Who you gonna call? EXOSISTERS!!! <br /><br />Seriously though, I got tired of the mind-numbing graveyard chains that go 7+ at Locals. I go to Locals after work, and I'm too tired to do something that complex and intensive. So I started bringing Exosister to Locals, and my experience became so much more enjoyable! Sure, I may lose to that Floowandereeze guy, but hooooo BOY is it fun to floodgate out GY decks (SUCK IT TEARLAMENT ISHIZU) and win! <br /><br />It's also really cool to wreck your opponents with cute combat nuns, every duel is like an episode of <em>A Certain Scientic Railgun</em> or <em>Lycoris Recoil</em>. Now I get to live out my ""cute girls destroy bad guys"" fantasy in Yugioh matches! :D<br /><br />Hope you folks have as much fun as I do EXORCISING the graveyard!</p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">GLHF Duelists!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>"

Yoinking your opponents banished cards for your own plays, such as a free 4 for Draco Beserker or returning to deck for a free monster negate, or recur your own cards to destroy the monster activating an effect instead!</p><p>The real janky sauce comes with the new Chaos Angel. Being able to be summoned through and Swordsoul token + Cyberse White Hat to create a monster which lets all your Synchro cards unaffected by monster's activated effects! plus a free banish on summon too. Using the Bystials and a token to create it too, but with a less valuable effect of making your monsters unable to be destroyed by battle. This is still useful though, if your opponent can't pop your whole board, you can keep your Monk of the Tenyi on the field, despite its pathetic attack stat.</p><p>I hope people enjoy this deck and continue labbing swordsoul with this new and very broken looking Chaos card!</p>"

This deck allows you to go into a cool neat endboard using only Field + Springans name. The Crystal Beast engine gives the deck another way to perform combo by nsing pegasus, pegasus equip crystal beast rainbow dragon, and crystal beast rainbow dragon summoning another pegasus. The deck also uses Rainbow bridge, which adds a crystal beast and golgonda to your hand, so you're basically playing 3 terraformings along with springans watch and springans booty, it's crazy!<br /><br />Your endboard can vary, field + name ends up in Champ Sargas, regular Sargas, and either an xyz or I:P for unicorn, either way the deck is pretty versatile when it comes to either going first or second. The endboard not be as strong as Tearlament and Kashtira, but it does work! Try it out!</p>"

If you go first with this deck you will die before your second turn. If you go second, you have to board clear omni negates, spells, traps, and hand-traps.

Lady Labrynth is untargetable and indestructible, and it can even Summon itself from your hand, so you can just search her rather than Summon her off of a Welcome Labrynth Trap. She also sets Traps from Deck contrary to Lovely Labrynth who sets Trap from GY.&nbsp;Lovely Labrynth is what you are usually Summoning off of your Welcome Labrynth Traps and the Field Spell and it helps recur Traps and acts as hand destruction. 3 <strong>Lilith, Lady of Lament</strong> who is a Quick Effect to Tribute a DARK monster and has your opponent randomly set 1 of 3 Traps of your choice from Deck. 3 <strong>Alice, Lady of Lament</strong> who can Summon back a Lady of Lament monster from GY on Normal Summon and when she is Tributed, she can add 1 Fiend whose ATK and DEF equal 2000 in total. This can add any Lady of Lament or even <strong>Labrynth Stovie Torbie</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Labrynth Chandraglier</strong> which acts as a Level 3 DARK Fiend for&nbsp;<strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong>, but it does have the Labrynth effect of setting a Labrynth Spell/Trap from Deck and it adds itself back. 1&nbsp;<strong>Tour Guide</strong> as another Level 3 Dark Fiend for Ties, but she can Summon your 1&nbsp;<strong>Doomdog Octhros</strong> which searchs any Level 8 Fiend from Deck when it is sent from field to GY. This gets Lady Labrynth who can just Summon herself from hand. 2&nbsp;<strong>Labrynth Stovie Torbie</strong> which has the Labrynth effect of setting a Labrynth Spell/Trap from Deck and recurring itself, and it can be searched off of Alice.</span></p><p><span>3&nbsp;<strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong> which usually is used to Summon Lilith, Alice, and/or Doomdog Octhros to fuel Lilith's effect to search Traps, search Lady Labrynth, and search another Lady of Lament of&nbsp;Stovie Torbie. 1&nbsp;<strong>Labrynth Labyrinth</strong> which can be searched off of your small Labrynth monsters and it acts as removal and it recurs Fiends. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Extravagance</strong> for draws. 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>, 3<strong> Torrential Tribute</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Trap Trick</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Big Welcome Labrynth</strong>, 3<strong> Welcome Labrynth</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Compulsory Evacuation Device</strong>, and 2&nbsp;<strong>Archfiend's Ghastly Glitch</strong>. Imperm is negation. Compulse, Torrential, and Glitch are removal which trigger all of your Labrynth effects. Welcome Labrynth and Big Welcome Labrynth are 6 extra copies of Lady Labrynth and Lovely Labrynth. You always want those in rotation which is why we are maxing out on the Welcome Labrynths that Summon them.</span></p><p><span>Extra Deck is nothing much.&nbsp;<strong>Garura</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>N'tss</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Aggregator</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Trouble Sunny</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Cambroraster</strong> are&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong>/<strong>Dogmatika Punishment</strong> Targets with added effects. Garura draws a card, N'tss destroys a card, Aggregator negates a face-up card, Trouble Sunny sends a card, and Cambroraster protects set cards. Then we just have&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong>, <strong>Dharc the Dark Charmer Gloomy</strong>, and <strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong>.

That's why it mains 3 droplets, 2 DRNM and some extender spells like Vendread Charge (it runs only zombies in the main deck), One for One (give access to 3 monsters) and foolish burial.</p><p>The goal of this deck is ending on a Vendread Ritual boosted by Houndhorde+Revenants effects, an Extra Deck monster with negate or removal, and the Vendread Trap.&nbsp;</p><p>The best endboard possible would be Revendread Slayer+Chengying/Baronne/Dawn Dragster+Vendread Reorigin ft. Scar in the GY. Here you can banish 2 cards (1 S/T+1 monster) form your opponent's field (Quick Effect), banish 2 more cards without targeting with Chengying as a consequence (or a negate if Dragster/Baronne), and you still have a non-destruction removal with Reorigin which can trigger Scar effect. Therefore your opponent lost 5 cards while you got 2 more monsters on field (Scar+Token) with 2 more potential floating effect (Scar+Slayer). Baronne is a safer choice than Chengying because once it is summoned you can avoid a potential nibiru and an omninegate is still better overall to stop devastating cards like Evenly Matched. As I said it is the ideal endboard, Often you'll have to choose between the Trap and the Synchro though the double boosted Ritual is always guaranteed. Synchro option is obviously scarcer because you need to hard draw a tuner.</p><p>Example with Synchro+Ritual:</p><p>-Normal Uni-Zombie, send Mazera to GY</p><p>-Ritual Slayer with Origin by banishing Mazera, Special Summon Mazera by its effect</p><p>-Synchro Chengying/Baronne ( Uni-Zombie+Slayer), Slayer effect, add Ravenous, send Scar.</p><p>-Add 1 Vendread Charge by Scar effect, Use Charge on Mazera to Summon Houndhorde from Deck</p><p>-Ritual Summon Slayer from GY with Ravenous by using Houndhorde on field and Revenants from Deck.</p><p>3 card-combo, 2 quick effect banish+ 1 omninegate. But it dies to a single Droplet/DRNM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A weaker but easier endboard:</p><p>-Ritual Slayer with Evolution by sending Scar, Add Reorigin by scar effect</p><p>-Norm any Zombie from hand, Link it away with Slayer to Summon Vampire Sucker, add 1 Ravenous and send Hounhorde with Slayer effect.</p><p>-Discard 1 Vendread card to summon Houndhorde from GY, Vampire Sucker draws 1 card, Ritual Slayer from GY with Ravenous by using Houndhorde+Revenants from Deck</p><p>-Because you tributed a monster on field, you can revive Scar by banishing a zombie from GY, Link Summon Scar+Sucker to get Savior</p><p>-Add Ravenous from GY to hand with Savior, Set the Trap.</p><p>Therefore you have 2 quick banish, 1 free foolish burial in battle and 1 non-destruction removal which brings you 2 free bodies. You can still play even if you get kaiju-ed or DRNM/Droplet-ed. With a slightly better hand you can end on Yuki-Onna the Link-4 Mayakashi which is really annoying against decks which use a lot their GY and decks based on banished monster's effects like Weather Painter/Thunder Dragons/ Metaphys.</p><p>But then, what about Shiranui cards? Though they aren't that interesting on your first turn, Shiranui can be devastating on your second turn or later in the game when Vendread burnt all their ressources. If you manage to set the Shiranui Trap alongside the previous or just a boosted Slayer, you can destroy 2 cards on their field+1 additionnal face-up card if you banished the Spiritmaster, in addition, because you tributed Slayer, it will float and trigger Scar effect makes you a free body+another float in case your opponent get rid of it. Sad this Trap can't be searched easily.. You can also banish Squire from Deck instead of Spiritmaster&nbsp; to just have more draw power and GY set-up. Shiranui Spectralsword is very interesting once in GY to summon Samuraisaga which can reach more than 5000 ATK and bypass big bodies. If destroyed, you can have Spectralsword back in your GY, to summon Sunsaga next turn #grind-game. Vendreads synergize well with Shiranui because they continuously banish Zombies from GY (Origin, Slayer, Scar, Core..) which trigger easily their effects. Furthermore, Solitaire is a good Normal Summon which can bring you Uni-Zombie or Glow-bulb following your gameplan, such as Squire=Immortal Dragon guaranteed=foolish burial.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miscellaneous:</p><p>-Battelord is a really underrated card which can save you from nibiru or many annoying effect monsters. Your opponent has to get rid of this card, otherwise you call Spell vs Runick or Trap vs Labrynth and their turn is over. Very good bait card.</p><p>-The Link-3 Mayakashi can negate the effects of a monster on field and be used to summon back Felgrand, which banish 1 monster on field/GY and also negate 1 monster effect on field.</p><p>-Vampire Fascinator is really good in case you get Ash-ed or Belle-ed during your turn: If Link Summoned you can revive your opponent's Ash/Belle to your field, and use it as an extender. Its second effect steals your opponent's monster and trigger Scar's revive, your oppoent lose 1 monster and you get 2.</p><p>-Avramax is easier to make in this deck than Borrelsword, it is a good go first endboard option and a good out to untargetable/unnaffected annoying beatsticks.</p><p>-Underworld Goddess is a must-have because this deck can easily bring 4 monsters on board+it's another out to annoying towers.</p><p>-Charge sends to GY as cost, so if your opponent doesn't chain immediately, you can protect Uni-Zombie/Battelord/Squire from Imperm. It's also an ""out"" to Skill Drain, if you have a Vendread with Houndhorde effect, you can target Skill Drain to banish it then you chain Charge to it, ez.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Strenghts:</p><p>-Withstand very well against destruction removal</p><p>-Has a lot of removal options, good board breaker</p><p>-Quite consistent</p><p>-Good grind-game</p><p>-Has good extenders</p><p>-Reacts well against DRNM/Kaiju</p><p>-Can play through Nibiru</p><p>-Can OTK</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>-Weak against any removal not destruction-related (banish, bounce..)</p><p>-Burn quickly its ressources if it can't access the Shiranui/tuner engine.</p><p>-As any zombie deck, Not resilient, cannot play through 2+ hantraps</p><p>-Cannot play through Shifter/D-Fissure or any card like that.</p><p>-No Draw power</p><p>-Dies from Evenly Matched if no Baronne</p><p>-No in-archetype boss monster, too reliant on the Extra Deck</p><p>-Need too many cards to start a combo (3-card combos in most cases)</p>"

From here on is where one of my first decks of Shaddoll - Tellarknights came to be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;How the tangence of ""El Shaddoll Construct"" and the Tellarknights came to be is from the usual Shaddoll business of doing what they do best. Meanwhile, the Tellarknights are the backbone by providing monsters like ""StellarKnight Constellar Diamond"" and ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"" through what I will call ""the Ptolemaeus method"" (a method that XYZ summons Tellarknight Ptolemaeus using a collective of LV4 monsters to rank up into crucial Rank 5 monsters, excluding ""Numbers""). I would call it one of the tankiest combinations for deck-making for even mAhstA RhULe tR33 standards. To this day though, I don't honestly know what to say considering that MR🌳 was filled with nothing but the chaos that our corporate overlords sealed in a plastic container in an old company fridge for at least 10 years.&nbsp;</p>"

Power of the Guardians has become a stable in my decks now due to the PURE hatred it causes, I have had players surrender at the very sight of this card. I added Card Destruction because with Necrovalley it potentially ruins all plays (think Blue-Eyes decks). I removed Mystic Mine for The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode as honestly, I think it's more annoying to deal with &amp; removes all the cards the field support cards, I had in my past decks. Dark Hole is an interesting addition, as it could be used (and negated) with Starlight Road for Stardust Dragon. Vision HERO Witch Raider was a really fun card addition with all the traps &amp; her effects are incredibly strong. Before I shelved this deck, I was experimenting with Utopia as it was solid idea to having stronger characters with decent effects.&nbsp; <br /><br />The main goal is completely stall your opponent by having Jinzo (No Traps), Vanity's Fiend (No Special Summons), Majesty's Fiend (No activated monster effects) &amp; Spell Canceller (No Spells) on the field at the same time while annoying them the entire time.</p>"

Isolde turbo right?.... Yes but there's more then just her. What if I tell you this Deck successfully implements every Noble Knight from the King Arthur Lore into one Deck. Noble Knights look a bit flat on the outside but it's a Combo Deck in it's core so let's start going into Detail:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Starters</strong></p><p>In such a type of Deck it's important to see who the Starters for your Combo are. Noble Knight Medraut is by far the number one Combo Starter. Like many Noble Knights he's treated as a normal Monster until you equip a Noble Arms Equip to him. Then he gains 1 Level changes to Dark attribute and can special one Noble Knight from Deck in defense (If he's the only Monster you control). Also he destroys the Noble Arms Equip after.&nbsp;</p><p>But that's were the Noble Arms equips start working. Once per turn if they are destroyed they can reequip to one Noble Knight on the field for example the one you just special summoned triggering it's effect in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>Many cards get you to this Starting Point. Merlin and Heritage of the Chalice being the best ones for that. Other Starting Combinations with Noble Knight Brothers and such are there too but less efficient. They become Plan B and you will see the rest for yourself should you decide to pick up this Deck.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What comes next?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>With Medraut the World lies in front of you. Every Noble Knight you can Special has a specific role and that's why I will shortly list up what for everyone is there from top to bottom:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Laundsallyn</strong></p><p>Gives access to a Rank 5 XYZ summon without a second Noble Arms Equip. He can also search for another Noble Arms Card by offering a tribute.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eachtar</strong></p><p>Gives access to a Rank 5 XYZ summon without a second Noble Arms Equip and makes the Summon and on summon effect unchainable for the opponent. Together with Laundsallyn they are recurring Threats from the GY every turn for a little cost.</p><p><strong>Pellinore&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Enables a Monster Destruction with a Draw 1 on top of it. The lost Noble Arms Equip can then be retrieved with the Rank 4 Artorigus XYZ summon.</p><p><strong>Gawayn</strong></p><p>He's pretty much just a Name and is better of in your Hand to use it's special summon effect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Peredur</strong></p><p>Very useful to go into Isolde because the lost Noble Arms Equip can be returned to the Hand through his effect and open more options after Isolde special summoned one Noble Knight onto the field.</p><p><strong>Drystan</strong></p><p>Protects other Noble Knights with less then 1800 ATK from attacks and targeting and thanks to Medraut he destroys one face up card on summon if you reequip the Noble Arms to him.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Iyvanne</strong></p><p>Can summon one token for free which enables a easy Isolde summon without loosing the Noble Arms Equip on field and furthermore sets up a Rank 4 XYZ summon with the Help of Isolde. A 500 ATK Boost for all Noble Knights is the Cherry on top.</p><p><strong>Borz&nbsp;</strong></p><p>He can search 3 Noble Arms Cards from deck, get one to Hand and mill the other two randomly. Choosing the Trap Until Noble Arms are Needed Once Again sets up 3 Quick effect special summons from Deck at any time as well as a free draw and changes the order of the top cards of your Deck.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bedwyr</strong></p><p>Mills one Noble Arms Equip from Deck to GY and as Quick Effect is able to reequip a Equip to another Monster once while he's on field. Good to use in Combination with Drystan as interruption when the setup is already there.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gwalchavad</strong></p><p>Can recycle one Noble Knight from the GY back to your Hand and destroys one Noble Arms equip after that. When the Setup with Bedwyr, Brothers, Isolde and Drystan is there you can create a nice little Ressource and Destruction Loop with build in Targeting and attack protection thanks to Drystan.</p><p><strong>Brothers</strong></p><p>He has 2400 DFF as a Level 4. He can Recycle 3 Noble Arms/Knight Cards back into the Deck to Draw 1 Card and on Normal summon only he can special up to 2 more Noble Knights from Hand enabling a 3 Material King Custennin to Bounce up to 3 Cards from the opponent and potentially Rank Up into a Artorigus.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Custennin</strong></p><p>If he's used for a Extra Deck summon you gain an additional normal summon. Very useful if one of the Noble Knights you wanted to special summon from Deck is already in your Hand.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Artorigus</strong></p><p>Just a Vanilla 1800 Beatstick but it's good to get him into grave early to setup Lady of the Lake or Avalon. He's the easiest way to access your Level 5 Synchro Monster with Lady of the Lake combined.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>That's nice and all but what's the payoff?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The big payoff in this Deck is the Rank 5 XYZ Monster Sacred Noble Knight of King Artorigus or in similar fashion the Rank 4 XYZ Artorigus, King of the Noble Knights. Both can equip themselves with up to 3 Noble Arms Equip spells from the GY when they are summoned. Thanks to Isolde you will be able to freely choose which ones you want.&nbsp;</p><p>The Rank 4 can destroy Spell and Traps on the Field up to the Number of Noble Arms Equips you control. The Rank 5 one can destroy one Monster on the field and if he's send to the GY he specials another Noble Knight back from the GY.</p><p>The easy to achieve Dream is a 4k Beater with Targeting protection and the ability to prevent destruction twicr per turn. You can add a Destroy 1 Set Card from the opponent by sacrificing 500 ATK and Direct attacking by paying 500 LP depending on which Noble Arms you choose on top of that.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the Noble Arms can reequip themselves once destroyed, be recycled with Peredur and the Artorigus bosses you can repeat every effect easily 4 times every turn. So how does: Gain 2000 LP and Destroy 4 set Cards from the opponent sound?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Just a little more Spice</strong></p><p>You might notice there are a few Monsters which are not Noble Knights. Merlin earlier mentioned summons any Noble Knight from Deck but he can also at quick effect speed no matter when XYZ or Synchro summon using Monsters on field. He turns up the OTK potential of this deck to 11.</p><p>Morgan is a handtrap which acts as Omni Negate which is strong but needs a little setup to work.</p><p>Gwenhwyfar is a Noble Arms Equip disguised as Monster and can recycle itself every turn back onto a monster as equip Spell. She gives a one time destruction protection for Light attribute and win every Battle before Damage Step ability for Dark Attribute. Also a little 300 ATK are for both Attributes.</p><p>Lady of the Lake like earlier mentioned is there to get the Synchro 5 onto the field. He is the only card which can search any Noble Knight/Noble Arms card including the 3 Noble Knight Spells.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Problems</strong></p><p>Wow this Deck sounds like a meta contender for sure.... yeah no it's not all good here too. If the opponent removes every Noble Knight from the field, you can't reequip the Noble Arms cards and loose important advantage. Loosing Artorigus with 5 Equips through a Kaiju hurts a lot too and often leaves you open for a lethal strike.&nbsp;</p><p>If the opponent understands the importance of Medraut and gets rid of him or negates him you can only use your weaker Plan B starters which can't build up a formidable Board that fast. A good Medraut Starter Hand mills half your Deck turn one. Brothers, Gawayn and Custennin can't get to that position alone sadly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final Words</strong></p><p>It looks like I wrote way to much but really I just scrapped the bottom of the Barrel. When I picked this Deck up I didn't think there's so much hidden Combos and Potential within this Archetype. If you are a player who likes more Complex/Deep strategies this Deck is made for you.&nbsp;</p><p>Just recently at time of writing this Deck profile I reached Diamond V league in Master Duel using only Noble Knights. Not many know about this Deck at all and it wins against many unprepared opponents.</p><p>Overall Rating: ★★★☆☆☆</p>"

Ahhh it's on of these Hidden Arsenal trash piles that do nothing right? NO! Unlike some strange subjects that came out of Hidden Arsenal Fabled is one of the Archetypes that is very much functional.</p><p>But beware playing Fabled takes a lot of practice since there's always at least 10 different ways to go within this Deck and one play can set you onto a path which you can't change after you decided to walk it.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me explain more in Detail what this Deck is all about:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Starting Point </strong></p><p>Almost every card is a Starter in this Deck which makes it difficult to pinpoint down one specific one. Your Goal is to summon multiple copies of Fabled Ragin while emptying your Hand to get to a wide lineup of Fabled Synchros or alternatively Cosmic Blazar Dragon and or Red Supernova Dragon. Almost every Fabled Monster is missing a once per turn Condition making big Combo setups very easy.&nbsp;</p><p>To facilitate advantage onto the field cards like Fabled Krus and The Fabled Cerburrel exist which special themselves or another Monster onto the field when discarded. Monsters like Fabled Raven or Fabled Marchosia enable the discarding to trigger these effects. Every maindeck Fabled follows one of these 2 patterns. Helping to discard or wanting to be discarded.&nbsp;</p><p>Here it's important to remember that Discarding is not Sending. Fabled Soulkius sends 2 cards to the GY so he won't trigger the Fabled effects, which you sometimes actually want.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Special Subject&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Fabled Unicore has to get it's own paragraph here. It's one of only 2 Monsters existing the other being Cyber Blader which has the ability to negate everything if certain Conditions are met. And with everything I mean EVERYTHING! Since the effect acts as a permanent effect like Skill Drain for example it can negate Counter Traps, Super Polymerization and everything normally unrespondable and destroy these cards.&nbsp;</p><p>To have this effect active both you and your opponent have to have the same amount of cards in their Hand. Thanks to the nature of Fabled Monsters it's best used as a agressive tool to go for game without being interrupted. Cards like Dianaira, Ragin, Andwraith, Leviathan and the Trap Treason can give this ability a nice twist and surprise the opponent during his turn too with correct setup.</p><p>Certainly a card to look out for but only if the Situation allows. Pro Tip: Summoning Unicore first turn and passing is not good within this Deck!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The other Stuff to look out for</strong></p><p>Dianaira changes the effect of the first Normal Spell activated from the opponent each turn to you discarding one card instead. Gallabas can Destroy Monsters by discarding cards without a Once per Turn. Cat Sith mandatory destroys one Face Up card if she's discarded. De-Synchro is mainly to loop Fabled Ragin more often but you can also De Synch an opponents Synchro Monster with it if you are desperate.&nbsp;</p><p>Fabled Treason can also destroy your own face up cards or an opponents one, discard one of your cards and revive one Monster all written to be able to destroy your own Leviathan to Recycle any 3 Fabled Monsters back to Hand. Your big 3k LV10 Boss Monster Leviathan sadly misses timing sometimes if the opponent deals with him.</p><p>Andwraith Draws 2 and discards one but the opponent can discard one card to negate this effect. If he discards a Monster you can summon it to your side. Since Andwraith triggers on special summon he's a nice target to be brought back with Treason to force the opponents Hand and potentially unlock the perfect Unicore Lockdown.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final Words</strong></p><p>Fabled struggles to set up a strong Wall but can easily overwhelm the opponent in one turn through massive Special summoning. But winning with this Deck takes practice since there's a lot that can go wrong if you choose the wrong Monsters to bring to your field at the wrong time. It's almost like Math.&nbsp;</p><p>Practicing this kind of Deck will reward you greatly with one easy to understand but very hard to master Deck. Give it a try if you feel up to take this challenge of a Deck.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall Rating: ★★☆☆☆☆</p>"

Embora Vennominom e Vennominaga possam banir um monstro r&eacute;ptil e reviver, ele voltam cada vez mais fracos, sendo vulner&aacute;veis a monstros com 2 ataques ou mais, ent&atilde;o mudan&ccedil;a de pele ser&aacute; muito importante, mas em caso de emerg&ecirc;ncia, tamb&eacute;m pode ser usado salvar um alien.</p><p><strong>Ajudantes do deck extra</strong></p><p>Os aliens do deck principal ainda s&atilde;o monstros pequenos, o deck adcional expandir&aacute; suas opc&otilde;es, e te dar&aacute; monstros grandes. J&aacute; que o arqu&eacute;tipo alien tem um monstro sincro, usaremos tanto monstros sincro e xyz. Scrap archfiend e dark rebellion dragon s&atilde;o invoca&ccedil;&atilde;o mais gen&eacute;ricas, se voc&ecirc; quer apenas um monstro forte, ou um simples number 39 utopia. Cosmic fortress Gol'gar vai limpar a zona de cartas m&aacute;gicas e armadilhas do seu oponente, mas cuidado, vai limpar a sua tamb&eacute;m. Dragon Vermillion pode banir um monstro turner do cemit&eacute;rio e destruir um card no campo, mas esse efeito pode custar muito caro por banir um regulador, que voc&ecirc; poderia recicla-lo com limite reverso ou monster reborn para fazer mais uma invoca&ccedil;&atilde;o sincro, voc&ecirc; s&oacute; vai poder recuperar o monstro regulador banido quando Dragon Vermillion for enviado ao cemit&eacute;rio por efeito de card. Coral Dragon &eacute; uma op&ccedil;&atilde;o mais vi&aacute;vel, j&aacute; que voc&ecirc; apenas descarta um card para dar alvo em uma carta no campo do oponente e destru&iacute;-la, (&eacute; uma &oacute;tima op&ccedil;&atilde;o de viagem de Vennominom ao cemit&eacute;rio caso ele esteja na sua m&atilde;o e voc&ecirc; n&atilde;o esteja conseguindo invoca-lo por invoca&ccedil;&atilde;o tributo). E King Of The Feral Imps ser&aacute; &oacute;timo para buscar mais dois r&eacute;pteis, por exemplo um Alien Ammonite para invoca&ccedil;&atilde;o sincro.

A chave &eacute; Vennominaga, cuja invoca&ccedil;&atilde;o da carta armadilha pode ser cancelada por uma tonelada de monstros, e Vennominom n&atilde;o poder ser invocado especialmente por efeito de monstros &eacute; apenas um prego no caix&atilde;o, limita a sua&nbsp; invoca&ccedil;&atilde;o a especial apenas do cemit&eacute;rio e tributo. Vennominom pode reviver banindo um monstro r&eacute;ptil, mas volta mais fraco, se voc&ecirc; n&atilde;o tiver meios ac&eacute;ssiveis de mandar r&eacute;pteis para o cemit&eacute;rio que n&atilde;o dependa de chuva de cobra, ele voltar&aacute; apenas para morrer. Eu recriaria Vennominom para poder ser invocado especialmente por invoca&ccedil;&atilde;o de monstro (claro, o arqu&eacute;tipo precisaria de uma monstro que invoque especialmente r&eacute;pteis com um ataque baixo), Vennominom poderia ter um efeito r&aacute;pido ou n&atilde;o de mandar um monstro r&eacute;ptil da sua m&atilde;o e/ou deck para o cemit&eacute;rio. E como Vennomionm e Vennominaga precisam do cemit&eacute;rio alimentado de r&eacute;pteis, nada mais l&oacute;gico do que o arqu&eacute;tipo precisar de monstros pe&ccedil;onhetos com efeitos variados no cemit&eacute;rio, como: invoca&ccedil;&atilde;o especial (para acesso r&aacute;pido a Vennominom), buscador de cartas Venom, destruir monstros envenenados como faz o alien Stealthbuster, talvez monstros que tenham efeitos ao serem banidos&nbsp; e monstros que enviem outros ao cemit&eacute;rio, j&aacute; que o cemit&eacute;rio &eacute; a chave do deck, e claro, todos com efeitos de porem marcadores de veneno, que &eacute; a marca registrada do arqu&eacute;tipo, tamb&eacute;m, de condi&ccedil;&otilde;es diferentes de colocaram marcadores de veneno, o arqu&eacute;tipo Venom tem muito a aprender com o arqu&eacute;tipo alien, que &eacute; um deck Venom moderno.</p><p><strong>fraquezas</strong></p><p>Seja o arqu&eacute;tipo Venom atual ou o meu imagin&aacute;rio, ele ainda teria fraquezas incontorn&aacute;veis a serem exploradas, como qualquer deck.
