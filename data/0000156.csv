•More Destructive.

•More Ash Blossom.

•Bigger focus on both the Dogmatika and Evil Twin Destruction Engines.

•Included a Combo with ""Unchained Abomination"" and Evil Twin that gives a +1 for the player and a -1 to the opponent every turn, -2 when you have ""GG EZ"" on the field.

•Endymion and ""Mythical Beast Jackal King"" are still present but only just as they are easy to summon huge negates, similar case with Master Cerberus. Plus they are some of my favourite monsters in the game. Servant is still in simply because they are.

•Magistus Dropped entirely from the Main Deck. Only serving as a Link-1 for aiding in the Special Summoning of Dogmatika monsters and a way to recover key Spellcasters from the GY for when they almost inevitably end up there (Same as with ""Dwimmered Path"").

•Largely, this deck's most severe weakness is to GY disruption and, as with most decks, is only weak to search disruption on turn 1."

This is my competitive deck, the deck I actually play, and it works.

First turn follow the combo lines to get out a Fog Blade, Requiem dragon, IP, Verte with Dragoon, and any other advantage you can to have mass negates. Go into underworld Goddess or App on their turn.

If going second grind through their negates and go for the big swing with an Arc Dragon.

It  went from 53 to a much more manageable  40  cards. i had  to cut  cards  like Torrential tribute and Trap Trick, but i feel that it was necessary. you can however replace the hand traps and  traps for  whichever you'd like. I just like using  Skull Meister and Nibiru because they not only stall my opponent, but are also targets of Construct and Winda. The Dogmatika cards add consistency and give you extra pops, but you have to be careful because after you use them you can't special summon from the extra deck."

Nephyts mainly destroys their own cards for it's combos, and at the end of the combo lines it summons either large rituals or can link into the archetypal link monsters. To make this a bit more interesting, I included Simorgh and the wind barrier statue, so you can do the barrier statue lock on your turn if you manage to get out enough materials , which hopefully you should. I also included 9 handtraps, so this is incredibly control focused and really obnoxious. You're lucky I didn't include Dragoon.  We need a Bird Up tag."

Lots of Fire monsters and fun combos. Easy to learn for new players and does,"Good for both going 1st and 2nd

The goal is to set up an OTK with Rekindling summoning 5 monsters from the GY including Totem Five which will wipe the opponent board and inflict tons of damage. Then you can direct attack the opponent for the kill.

Other fun combos :
<ul>
 	<li>Norm Red Resonator, use its effect to spe Firebrand Hymnist, fill up your GY and summon Horse Prince + another monster from the deck (that's the ideal T1 scenario)</li>
 	<li>You have many cards to send to GY cards from your deck (Flamvell Lady, Kirin, Foolish...) your main target is Totem to set up the combo, but if you already have it go for a tuner (Red Resonator or Ashe) instead to have the target for Rekindled Rebirth</li>
 	<li>After using Extravagance you can use Rebirth to summon Sunsaga (Red Resonator + Hazy Flame Cerberus) and destroy cards your opponent controls with its effect (theoretically up to 9 cards but I never managed to get more than 4)</li>
 	<li>Circle of the Fire Kings can trigger the Fire King effects (no s*** Sherlock)</li>
 	<li>If you can't OTK with Rekindling combo, you can still try to summon Crimson Blader to block your opponent's next turn using Rekindling monsters as material</li>
</ul>
Changes that can be made :
<ul>
 	<li>3x Hand Destruction can be too much if your opponent doesn't have 2 or more cards in their hand often</li>
 	<li>Royal Decree can be included against certain decks</li>
 	<li>Any other suggestion you may have, I built this deck for fun in less than an hour and I wasn't familiar with the archetypes so it probably has a lot of room for improvement ! :)</li>
</ul>
Strenghts : Versatility (OTK, Burn and some defensive options), Stability (there is no real main combo so you're always able to set up an OTK in like 3 turns) and a lot of draw power

Weaknesses : Too many to list! This is a fun deck after all

Hope you enjoy playing with this deck! :)"

(Note: All of my decks are labeled ""Meh"" in to help with the understanding that these are not by any means competitive decks. Secondly, all of these decks upon initial completion are untested and purely made by using other decks as reference along with a basic understanding of the archetypes core ideal. Thirdly, All of these decks upon completion are made to be around or below 60$ including shipping, and yes i do use these decks hence why sometimes they are updated to make them better as they get playtested. Fourthly, these decks are generally not a mix of archetypes as its what i prefer. Lastly due to the nature of these decks being non-competitive they do not hold up well to more powerful and expensive cards such as handtraps and cards such as Forbidden Droplet, Evenly Matched, Etc.)"

It's an aggressive combo deck designed to swarm the field with graveyard special summons in order to combo off into the boss monsters and create interruptions. If you're going second, the side deck is covered with ways to out the more common boss monsters that have destruction protection, and also a way to turbo into Kali Yuga, one of the best ""going second"" boss monsters you can land on imo.

Like any other D/D/D deck, consistency issues can appear once in a while, but in play testing against even the grindiest control decks, I've found ways to survive and end on strong boards."

The Fire Kings suck. Arvata is the only decent one because every other fire king either has a ridiculously handcuffed effect that wont make an immediate impact. This is mostly due to the fact that you have to wait until the next standby phase. Now onslaught is also bad because it has far too many restrictions and is actually a genuinely well balanced card. Circle of the Fire Kings could be good as it can cycle stuff with Kitt, but that's really unnecessary and overall almost never going to be impactful enough to warrant the slot.

&nbsp;

Now. The synergy is actually pretty good. Arvata destroying Kitt and giving the ability to negate handtraps is very cool and good. Rendezvous and Garunix are awesome for being able to establish tempo and make pushes for lethal. Wolfbark is very cool and good and never a bad card to see in your hand.

You can ABSOLUTELY play the Simorgh + Stormwinds combo because setting up:
Simorgh + Statue + Arvata + Rendezvous in grave, is very easy and very strong.

I just wanted to show off something different in my video

you want to synchro summon ""Accel Synchron"" then you should use its effect to reduce or increase the Rank of him
and maybe special summon a monster from your hand through its own effect if you can.

Then look for the best control option like
""Moonlight Rose Dragon"" or ""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon""

This Deck wants to start with ""Revealer"" and ""Speaker of the Ice Barrier""
(""Medallion of Ice Barrier"" for Search these Cards &amp;/or ""Winds over the Ice Barrier"" to special summon)
to go into ""Bahamut Shark"" use its effect and special summon ""Toadally Awesome"" for free.
Maybe you can special summon ""Swap Frog"" and ""Prior of the Ice Barrier"" instead to go for ""Toadally Awesome""
but it would be better if you can do a Synchro summon in the same turn.

If you go 2nd
you hopefully can go for trishula (wich one you can reach) to break the opponents field.
""Trishula Zero Dragon of the Ice Barrier"" would be better cause he can directly banish 3 Cards on the field and he specials the original Trishula if he dies.

Most people hate to get a monster stolen by Number 101
have fun with this deck ;-)

PS: Fury of Kairyu-Shin is inspired by <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/deathtoyourgoose/"">DeathToYourGoose</a>

if you want another a little more professional I will upload my others versions of @ignister deck but today I just wanna show this pure lovely deck because I am happy right now.

Fire kings work very well with this because both are decks centered around destroying cards, and Tri-brigade is useful for making big link pushes and also getting out the simorgh link to get stormwinds during the end phase. Impcantations help with searching for the parts of the nephthys engine and then can be tributed as to get around their extra deck lock. I chose ghost ogre as a good handtrap because not only can you trigger some fire king effects off of it, but you can also use e-tele to get more link material on board, and gamma is an all around good handtrap. Wicked eraser is in the side deck because it could be cool, but I couldn't make the space for it.

A few new additions
<ul>
 	<li>Speedriod Taketomburg: I needed a new extender to help turbo out verte without breaking my board</li>
 	<li>Droll and Lock Bird: This deck is arguably a control deck so to help stop your opponents from making a strong board this card definitely helps</li>
 	<li>Ancient Leaf: Basically a Pot of Greed if you resolve Dropsies</li>
 	<li>Fusion Sage/Polymerization: Crucial for making combos or rebuilding your board</li>
 	<li>Triple Tactics Talent: Your Response to Handtraps on Prank-Kids</li>
</ul>
Now a few things before I dive into the combos, the first is it is now possible to rebuild your board with the help of Poly. You see you can either skip your normal summon by fusion summoning or wait till your board breaks and then fusion summon. Also if you summon doodle you almost always want to search place unless you activated place before. Finally, be patient with exceed this deck takes a different turn if your opponent has hand traps or not.
<blockquote><div>Combos</div></blockquote>
Bricks
<ul>
 	<li>Psy-Frame Driver</li>
 	<li>Plague Spreader</li>
 	<li>Fusion Sage if you have Poly</li>
</ul>
Nothing major just a minus 1

&nbsp;

Combo Strongest needs 2 non-Rocksies Pr-K plus Poly

Ends on Verte, Roaster, Butler, Toad, and 2 Counter Borreload

Fusion Summon Rocket using Pr-K 1 and 2 and Poly, Float 3 and 4 then tribute Rocket to summon 1 and 2, link into Doodle float place and Pr-K 5/6. Link into Roaster float 3 Rocksies and Dropsies.  Xyz into Gallant and add plus summon Researcher, Link into halq summon plaugespreader sync into charge warrior, link halq and doodle into verte, summon plague from the grave and sync into borreload savage, use borreload's effect on Doodle, activate place and add Dropsies 2 summon it, XYZ into Toadally, Finally use verte to summon Butler using thunder dragon fusion."

I included a Danger! engine, as they get bodies on board to summon the Wicked gods and also dig through the deck in order to obtain the wicked gods. I also included a small Darkwurm package to get an extra body on board, as every body matters.  The extra deck is mainly just various generic Links and a few XYZ to use with the Dangers! in specific situations.
The deck is pretty bricky and not great at OTKing even though it's supposed to OTK, so. Have fun...?"

I love maid uniform. I F-c-ing LOVE Maid Uniform!

&nbsp;

The deck idea is not original. I look up at Dragonmaid decks from a lot of people then build this one.

Anaconda Dark Dragoon can be trade-off for 3 more handtraps or going second tech cards.

&nbsp;

I like to play Dragon-link but they are not cute... so I play Dragonmaid. That's it. That's the reason.

&nbsp;

WAIFU RULEEEEE!!!

The strategy for this deck is as basic as it gets: special summon E-Hero Sunrise as fast as you can.

Sunrise can fetch a Miracle Fusion from your deck to your hand,gives all your monster 200 Atk for each attribute you control and, once per turn, you can destroy a card on the field when another Hero monster you control declare an attack. From Sunrise you can then fuse the Omni Hero you need in that situation.

Blazeman can get you a Poli when summoned,Dark Mist a Mask Change (only when special summoned), Solid Soldier can special summon another hero when it's normal summoned (and special summons a Hero from the graveyard when sent there from the field by a spell card) and Liquid can let you draw 2 cards then discard 1 when used for a fusion (also special summons a Hero from the grave when norma summoned).

The Hand Trapa can be varied.

concerning the Extra Deck:

-I recommend at least 1 copy of each Omni Hero so that you can use Super Poli on whatever your opponent may summon

-Dark Law can be a pain in the ass by distrupting grave setup and destroyng a card in the hand when the opponent add a card from the deck and Acid destroys the backrow when brought out (so I like to use it with Zero since he destroys all opponents monster when sent from the field to the grave)

-Predaplant Anaconda is there for when you don't draw any fusion card.

Well,I think that's all; remember it's a deck I made for fun because it's my favourite archetype but if you have suggestions on how to make it competitive please let me know. Have Fun!"

The main Idea of the deck is to make some normal drytron plays and then to search buster whelp with <a data-name=""where arf thou"">where arf thou</a> to then link it off into something to then set prologue to make the buster lock on your opponent's turn along with a herald of ultimatness.

Are you tired to see your opponents plays the game? Your prayers were heard!!

Today I come with one of the most disgusting  list: Zoodiac Kaiju, The infamous  KAZOO!! This is a totally control build that prevents you opponent to build his own board.

Zoodiac is a formidable engine because it is  a lair of one card combos, vary recursive and a small (but strong) engine. Zoodiac  Trident can pop up any card on the field, also becoming a good card to going first (disrupt any plays in the opponents turn), or a going second card  to get in the Vespenato. This engine is so amazing that if you want to go in more agressive way, you can also use Megaclops to deal a massive damage.

Kaiju are notorius to disrupted big boards ( Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess, Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and similars) and with a help of  Interrupted Kaiju Slumber , our job  become incredibly easy.

Ah... and here we have a lot , A LOT  of hand traps  to deals with draws ( Droll &amp; Lock Bird), effect of the field (Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit), or GY in general ( Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion and Skull Meister). The main engine is effective and small , so handtraps can fit perfectely in this control build.

&nbsp;

For the final words, I know that Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder will be perfect and logical to add in this deck  but... I don't have it =/ however , if you have, feel free to use it and be happy with it. I hope you like it my crazy idea."

This is the new utopia deck for the new banlist! try this deck and leave a comment!","The strategy is very simple:

search for gagaga magician and use cards like onomatopoeia to just summon it and with some other cards, like onomatopickup, you can make all the levels on the field like gagaga magician's so you can summon photon strike bounzer, then zoodiac chakanine and then zoodiac drident. Then, if you can, just summon utopia double and utopia kaiser. This is the strategy."
