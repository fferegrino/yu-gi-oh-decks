So this here is my brand new HERO deck, using one of the two support cards Destiny HEROs got in Burst of Destiny. As for the name, I named this deck after the movie ""My Hero Academia: World Heroes' Mission.""

I didn't watch it yet, but I plan on doing that soon.

This deck uses Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer to pop the opponents' cards and one of your own, before you go beyond Plus Ultra and revive him on the next turn. In addition, Destiny HERO - Denier can put a banished Malicious on top of your deck so you can summon it from the deck and make more plays.

This deck is good going first or second. Go first? Set up a board of Destroy Phoenix Enforcer and any other disruptions or negates you can think of. Go second? Break your opponents' field apart with your HEROs' effects before OTKing them.

If you play this deck, make sure to channel your inner Deku or All Might and go beyond...PLUS ULTRA!!"

Also no dragoon.,"This deck focuses on Archfiend Black Skull Dragon and Red-Eyes Alternative Black Dragon.

----------
Main
----------

Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit are self-explanatory. Ash can stop your opponent from searching, and Ghost Ogre can destroy their face up card's effect.

Red-eyes Alternative Dragon can be special summoned from your hand by tributing a red-eyes monster from your hand or field. If he gets destroyed by battle or card effect, you could special summon 1 red-eyes monster from your GY to your field, but if it's a red-eyes black dragon normal monster, then it's attack is doubled. So you could play around this if you wanted to.

Red-eyes Black Dragon is fodder for Red-Eyes alternative Black Dragon, or mostly just fusion material for Archfiend Black Skull Dragon and Meteor Black Comet Dragon. Also used for Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon.

Summoned Skull is also mainly fusion material for Archfiend Black Skull Dragon and material for Archfiend's Ascent,

Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon is self explanatory. You can special summon any summon-able dragon from your hand or GY once each turn.

Meteor Dragon Red-eyes Impact is used for fusion summon of Meteor Black Comet Dragon or just to re-summon for his effect. He is a Gemini monster though, so just using him for fusion material is viable.

Red-eyes Archfiend of Lightning is the same as meteor dragon red-eyes, mainly for fusion material but if you want, you could summon him. He's also a Gemini.

Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon is the same as meteor dragon and archfiend of lightning, mainly for use for other cards, not really needed to win. He's also a Gemini.

Red-Eyes Retro Dragon can return your field from destruction if timed correctly, and pretty good overall.

Red-Eyes Fusion is one of the best fusion cards besides the fact you can't summon at all after using it, and you have to use it first before any form of summoning. You can set monsters though.

Red-Eyes Insight lets you search red-eyes fusion easily by sending 1 red-eyes monster from your hand or deck to the GY, which is really more a benefit than a cost.

Monster Reborn is self explanatory.

Infinite Impermanence is a hand-trap, literally, you can activate it from your hand if you do not control no cards during yours or your opponent's turn. It also negates your opponents monster's effects and if it was set before use, you can negate any spell or trap card effects that would be in the same column as this set card.

Evenly matched lets you banish your opponents monster non-targeting, until they have the same number of cards on their field as yours. This can only be activated after the battle phase, both player's. If you control no cards, you could also activate this straight from your hand.

Return of the Red-eyes is like eternal soul but only for normal monsters in your GY when you control a red-eyes monster. So you could special summon 1 normal monster during either players turn once per turn if you control a red-eyes monster.

----------
Extra
----------

Archfiend Skull can prevent your opponent from using card effects when he declares a attack, so your opponent can't use anything when he battles unless they have a card that responds before hand. After he battles, he can shuffle a red-eyes black dragon from your GY into your deck to inflict burn damage equal to the monster's atk.

Meteor Black dragon is a good beatstick and can summon any red-eyes monster when destroyed. He also sends a red-eyes monster from your deck to the GY and deals half their ATK as burn dmg to your opponent.

Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon inflicts 500 burn damage each time your opponent uses a card effect. You can also detach one material to special summon a red-eyes normal monster from your GY.

Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack can detach a material to special summon 2 phantom tokens, then you can tribute any Mecha phantom monsters or tokens to destroy 1 card on the field.

Number 11: Big Eye lets you detach one material to target and take control of one monster your opponent controls, so you could take a boss monster they have that doesn't have target immunity.

Photon Strike Bounzer lets you negate a monster effect on the field then inflict 1000 burn damage.

Archfiend Ascent can deny summoned skull destruction, and if he is destroyed, you can special summon a summoned skull from your hand deck or GY, his name also becomes summoned skull on the field.

Knightmare cards are self explanatory. Phoenix to destroy one spell or trap card your opponent controls, Cerberus to destroy one monster they control in their main monster zone, and unicorn to shuffle one monster they control back into their deck at the cost of discarding 1 card.

Linkuriboh is self-explanatory. You can send black stone of legend to the GY and use it's recycling effect to shuffle a red-eyes from your GY back into your deck and add the stone back to your hand.

----------
Side Deck
----------

Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion is self explanatory. Ghost Belle can stop them from moving cards from the GY.

Framegear Gamma and Frame Driver is self-explanatory, if you had an empty field and your opponent used a monster effect, you could negate and destroy it, special summoning Gamma and Frame Driver to the field, Gamma has to be in your hand, and Frame Driver could be anywhere in the game except from removed from play. They are great at stopping opponent hand traps, so if you find yourself dueling against someone with a million hand traps, they can literally save you.

Nibiru is great if you find yourself against someone with a spam special summoning medical condition, he's able to wipe out their field via tribute, so most cards, almost none, have immunity to Nibiru. They do get a beefy token though, the good news being that the token is a dumb dead card, non-effect, and no protection whatsoever.

Harpie's feather is self-explanatory and raigeki.

Dark ruler no more negates all your opponent's face-up monster effects for the rest of this turn."

Summon Tokens to your opponents side and Attach with Chaos Max for","So the Goal is to get out Chaos Max, and attack once for Game. Depending on your opening hand, you can get fully set up but most cases you will have to get stuff set up and win the following turn.

Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon is Key, but to get its effect off you need to make sure you have a Blue-Eyes on the Field or even easier in the GY.

So your objective is to get the Blue-Eyes to the GY, either from Foolish Burial, or dragon shrine. Dragon shrine is clutch because you can get one in the GY, then send an additional dragon since you sent a normal monster first, and you send Stone of Ancients which will help you special summon Abyss at the end phase. So i will usually get out a linkuriboh and chill. Depending on your hand you can go into xyz or even Alt Ultimate Dragon, but most cases you will end with a linkuriboh and possibly a Imperm Set.

Then in the end phase, your Stone of Ancients will activate, special summon the Abyss dragon (I usually do in defense), which in turn will activates abyss effect which you search your Advanced Ritual Art, and the Chaos Max dragon. Now if you have either of those in hand or its more ideal to get a poly then go for it, but in this example you don't have either card.

So next turn you will have an empty board, most likely they killed off your linkuriboh. So you activate Advanced Ritual Art sending the Dragon Core Hexer to the GY, Summoning the Chaos Max Dragon. Now you should have more then enough Monsters in the GY by now, and in the case of this example you have searched or had Chaos Dragon Levianeer in hand already. So what you do is banish 3 light monsters, don't banish the Dragon Core Hexer we need that, summon out your Chaos Dragon Levianeer, activate its effect special summoning the Dragon Core Hexer in defense. Now you can synchro the Chaos Levianeer and the Dragon Core Hexer to make the Phantasmal Lord Ultimitl Bishbaalkin.

Now when that monster gets summoned, you can activates its effect to summon out tokens (o atk, 0 def) to your side of the field, and your opponents side of the field, the amount of tokens depends on how many monster zones are open. Its fills the remaining zones. So now your opponent has atleast 1 token, attack with Chaos Max and game over (8000 Damage).

This isnt some meta beating deck, buts a hell of alot of fun to play. I forget who i saw this strategy from but i changed it up some.

Any way to make it better feel free to comment or message, im no expert and don't know everything so give me some new ideas."

Arlekino provides one extra disruption to the boards regular musketeer decks can provide. He is also a good beat stick and can be used as a material for things like accesscode and apollousa when he is no longer needed. Musketeers in general are a very good control deck because they can search each and every form of negation under the sun, using cards like max and caspar. Your usual win condition is just getting a caspar out and then searching multiple negations off of max, which are later used in caspar's column in order to trigger his effect to search another disruption. After a turn or two your opponent should have burned through their field and hand so they won't be able to do much. Then you will be able to go into either utopia double or accesscode to go for game.

Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon is Insane.","This is a fun Blue-Eyes deck that i made when i saw the potential of Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon.

Now if you run Abyss Dragon, you can run with Poly or you can run a variant where you use a Advanced Ritual Art and Chaos Max Dragon because you special summon Abyss and can grab both cards necessary for the Ritual (For Next Turn).

Ok so this Deck though, you want to get Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon onto the field, but you want to make sure you at least use (1 Blue Eyes Alt Dragon), so the Alternative Ultimate Dragon has its full effect. It can pop 3 Cards every turn, not just monsters, 3 cards in general. He Also cannot be targeted or destroyed by card effects. So he can still die to battle but he's got 4500 Attack, not the easiest to do in 1 turn.

I put in the Numeron #100 (OTK Package), because its extremely easy to use with Draglubion #97, honestly to good not to use.

I also put in a Nebula to easily get out a Rank 8 xyz.

This isn't a meta deck what so ever but I've had a ton of fun using it.

Worst comes to worst and you go first, you summon out as many big beaters as you can, and you use Skill Drain and play big 3K Beatstick.

Hey Can someone let me know about this, if i have Blue-Eyes Alt Ultimate, and my opponent has Cyber Dragon Infinity, can Infinity use his Effect to suck up the Dragon? I have been running cyber a bunch lately and was curious about this."

<span><em><strong>Strategy:</strong></em></span>

The main win condition of the deck is that your opponent should have a high atk monster on their side of the field and be able to summon daigusto sphreez alongside a gusto monster and make your opponent take battle damage attacking with your low atk gusto monsters, although with this deck the main wincon is to summon your big synchro monsters and attack for game.

Your windwitch engine will make sure that your plays go through or bait opponent's negations so you can OTK your opponent, not only you can make crystal wing synchro dragon with them but also you can summon <a data-name=""Baroness de Fleur"">Baroness de Fleur</a> in the same turn with your gusto monsters thanks to <a data-name=""windwitch glass bell"">windwitch glass bell</a> being a level 4 tuner, you can summon her with <a data-name=""pilica, descendant of gusto"">pilica, descendant of gusto</a>'s effect from the gy.

The side deck has changed quite a lot ever since a couple of cards got released, like <a data-name=""Maple Maiden"">Maple Maiden which is pretty easy to summon and has a deadly combo with </a><a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match , you just declare wind with maple maiden, flip gozen match and now your opponent can only summon 1 monster unless they're playing a wind deck.</a>

The same is for secret village of spellcasters, you just summon your windwitch synchro monsters, play secret village and hope that works against the opponent.

This is more of an experiment than a legitimate deck, but it can be fun to test out yourself. Super vulnerable to interruption b/c scrap engine but fairly reliable otherwise.

Main combo requires scrap raptor and either recycler or factory. You essentially need to dump four cards to the grave (rosenix, world wand, Taniguku, Uka), so you'll need to summon two golems unless you hard draw foolish burial/succession/reborn. Factory relies on terraforming, but recycler can be searched off of small world if you have one of the gizmeks in hand (banish gizmek from hand, banish scrap raptor from deck, add recycler to hand). There are a few ways to patch up bad hands, you'll most likely just end with less link material on the field in the end.

The combo -
<ol>
 	<li>Summon raptor, target and destroy itself. Add recycler or factory.</li>
 	<li>Activate factory</li>
 	<li>Summon recycler, send rosenix</li>
 	<li>Banish rosenix for token, link into scrap wyvern</li>
 	<li>Wyvern summon recycler &amp; destroy recycler
<ol>
 	<li>chain link 1 wyvern, chain link 2 factory</li>
 	<li>factory summon golem A from deck, wyvern summon golem B from deck and destroy factory</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Golem A summon recycler, recycler mill world wand</li>
 	<li>Golem A and recycler link into Lib, Lib adds succession</li>
 	<li>succession summons golem A</li>
 	<li>Golem A summon recycler, recycler mill Taniguku</li>
 	<li>recycler and scrap wyvern link reprodocus</li>
 	<li>Golem B summons recycler, recycler mill Uka</li>
 	<li>recycler and Lib link codebreaker virus, virus summon zero day to opponents field</li>
 	<li>reprodocus make zero day your desired attribute</li>
 	<li>Link/do other plays (Avramax is a decent option using reprodocus and virus to direct attacks away from the barrier statue)</li>
 	<li>banish Taniguku from grave to summon Uka, Uka target zero day to summon barrier statue of desired type.</li>
 	<li>???</li>
 	<li>Profit?</li>
</ol>
If you don't summon Avramax and have a good hand you'll end with two golems and two link 2s on the field before the barrier statue (maybe an Uka if you drew one since it's a free summon during the combo), so you could also make a 4 material Apollousa, or whatever other link plays you want. The provided extra deck only has the bare minimum plus a couple recommended cards. Avramax can draw attacks away from the barrier statue, Apollousa is Apollousa.

If you don't want to use zero day or Uka, Reprodocus can make something a winged beast to summon simorgh, who summons the wind barrier in the end phase. If you can't finish the combo, golem can also summon scrap recycler to your opponents field as well, so if you can summon Uka from the hand/graveyard you can put up the earth barrier statue. You can sub in whatever barrier statue you think is most effective, the ones in the main deck are just the most reliable to get out. And if Reprodocus makes zero day the divine attribute, you can summon Obelisk from the deck (Big Meme).

This is Nurse Burn, and as such, you want to get Nurse on board as soon as you can. To achieve this, we're running four draw cards and six searchers for Nurse. If Nurse or Simochi is not active on your opponent's turn, you lose the game. It's that simple.

The burn cards are as follows: Upstart Goblin, Gift Card, Tri and Guess, Dark Cure, and The Paths of Destiny. The extra deck that I included is specifically for use with Ghost Reaper as this deck dies to a single interaction. If you want Tri and Guess to almost never fail, run an extra deck of fifteen of the cheapest link monsters you have. The Psychic Eraser Laser in the side deck is also a solid burn card, but you need your opponent to play the game first.

Other options for the deck include Mystic Mine as Nurse is unaffected by its restrictions, Soul Taker as a really bad removal option, The Eye of Truth if you want to pretend hand knowledge was worth it in a deck that just spams burn damage, Pot of Extravagance if you can't afford Prosperity, and Forbidden Chalice if you can't afford Forbidden Droplets"

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 striker dragon explained later</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So the reason I said explained later so much is because this deck has a 2 card and discard combo with MULTIPLE ways to open. Here’s the multiple combinations</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Stardust synchron or tuning plus arriving miracle, stardust illumination, or dragon ravine which requires an additional discard</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Stardust trail plus stardust illumination or dragon ravine (requiring another discard) works as well</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Synchron and trail also works</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Neither way of dragon ravine can be because of remus sadly</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Here’s how to start:</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you opened the Synchron path with ravine or illumination use synchron to search arriving miracle, have ravine or illumination dump stardust trail and then link Synchron for striker and search boot sector launch, then tribute boot striker dragon to summon synchron and trail will summon itself too, activate arriving miracle and put conversing wills on top of your deck</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you opened the syncron path with arriving miracle search illumination and then follow the steps above</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you opened the trail path summon trail, link for striker, search boot sector, dump synchron with illumination or ravine, tribute striker to summon synchron, search arriving miracle and summon trail, activate arriving miracle, put conversing wills on top of your deck</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If synchron and trail is opened, summon synchron, search arriving miracle, link for striker, search boot sector launch, tribute striker for synchron and trail, arriving miracle place conversing wills on top of your deck</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">(You must always activate arriving miracle last)</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">After this proceed with the following steps:</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Tune synchron and trail for stardust dragon (summoning a token with trail is not optional, summon it) </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">arriving miracle draws you a card so draw conversing wills and summon it with its effect, then have it summon brotar from your deck</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Brotar target stardust dragon to search remus, discard boot sector launch</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Tune your stardust, token, and brotar with conversing wills to summon shooting majestic star dragon</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Activate remus from your hand to search dragon ravine</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Activate dragon ravine and use its effect to search legatus</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Legatus can summon itself from your hand because you own dragon ravine</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Because you own a dragunity remus can summon itself from your graveyard</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Remus tunes legatus for gae dreg</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Gae dreg searches baby roc and discards baby roc</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Baby roc summons itself</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Tune gae dreg with baby roc for crystal wing</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Combo done! You now have shooting majestic star dragon and crystal wing synchro dragon! </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Strong points: </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Very consistent with multiple ways to summon your boss monsters</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Lots of cool combos and really fun to play</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Weaknesses:</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Pretty underwhelming</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Forced to run bricks</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Overall I’d say this deck would be good at a locals level depending on your locals, it’s more of a casual deck but it’s fun to play, if I had to rate the archetype out of ten I’d give it a six</span></p>"

&nbsp;

That's about it. It's really funny.

&nbsp;

<span>UPDATE 1:</span>

So, since i originally released this deck, i tried to work a bit more of a burn strategy into it as well since Sunny's Snitch is already a burn spell on top of a searcher. Hopefully this should be a more optimal build. Its still obviously non-meta, but its better than what i had before i think.

&nbsp;

Zeus is also in here for buffer room and additional aggro if necessary. Plus, its really funny watching people rage over Zeus when he comes onto board. The side deck is also just full wombo combo shenanigans with Crossout Designator because ""y'know.""

&nbsp;

ALSO, if you want to prioritize getting Zeus out, run something like Gachi Gachi Gantetsu instead of the single copy of Splash Mage (or you could take out one of the Knightmares instead).

&nbsp;

<span>UPDATE 2:</span>

I've abandoned the burn shenanigans. Its much more consistent now, and incredibly aids as well. lol"
