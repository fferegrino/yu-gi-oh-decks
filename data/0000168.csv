The only difference being the side deck; the OCG player went with: 3x Maxx ""C"" 3x Chicken Game 3x Upstart Goblin 3x Self-Destruct Button 3x Wall of Revealing Light  Obviously very banned side deck here in the TCG, the side deck that I've provided is very flexible and just what I thought would be nice. The list also plays a single copy of <strong>Booby Game</strong> in the main deck, an OCG card that acts similarly to Waking the Dragon but has an actual on-field effect as well. It can be replaced a third copy of Magic Cylinder or Waking the Dragon. The extra deck also has <strong>Borrelend Dragon</strong>, another OCG card, as a target for Waking the Dragon. It's a very strong card and the closest TCG alternatives may be Borrelsword Dragon or Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops.  The Windwitch engine allows the deck very easy access to a powerful negate in the form of <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong>, as well as giving a bit of burn damage along the way in the form of Windwitch - Ice Bell and Windwitch - Winter Bell.  The small Sky Striker engine allows access to <strong>Sky Striker Ace - Hayate</strong> who can attack directly for an easy 1500 damage—rather underwhelming in any other deck but infinitely more valuable in a burn deck.  Lava Golem is a very strong card in the format, and this particular decklist can take full advantage of it because its combo starter (Windwitch - Ice Bell) Special Summons itself from the hand so the loss of a Normal Summon from Lava Golem is no problem.  <strong>Gravedigger's Trap Hole</strong> is a very strong trap card that not only does a hefty amount of burn damage but also negates monster effects that activate in the hand, GY, or banished zone meaning your Pot of Desires is much safer against Ash Blossom. Just a very strong card that will be live against every meta deck.  <strong>Ceasefire</strong> is a surprisingly good card in the format, punishing combo decks for having too many monsters on the field. Note that it does not require face-down monsters to activate, but if there are face-down monsters flipping them face-up is only a bonus as Ceasefire will not trigger their flip effects."

I'm Omega, and i'm just a kid trying to play Yugioh without spending a fortune on cards. I'm not amazingly experienced with this deck, but i love the pendulum mechanic, and it just so happens that you can assemble this entire deck for a super low price! I didn't intend on getting to this point in writing this, but i love it when people write stuff here so I can learn more about the deck, and the person playing it!</span></strong></p>  <h2><span><strong>What I Can Do</strong></span></h2> <p><strong><span>I haven't experimented with the deck to the fullest, but i can usually get to an Apollousa with one of my disruption XYZ monsters, which are Infinity or Dweller. Getting to Vortex Dragon is also a line that i haven't quite gotten down, considering we only really have 6 level 7s in the deck to get to it, making it hard unless you open up a hand that works for that. Alkahest is also a disruption, but i can never get to it alongside Apollousa, unless my hand is like, extremely lucky. So usually I end on something like 4 disruptions, up to 5 in testing, and i'm not sure if you can get a 6th one on board, but i run out of fusion spells for another Alkahest or Azortless, I can never get Vanisher into the extra deck for a Mithrilium, and overall i just run out of steam before i can get to 6, even 5 disruptions. Super Poly is a option i added if you have copies lying around as i believe it is a deck that can make it work really well, but i can't see a reason to main deck it since you need your full hand to combo. Aside from that, the side deck is barren because i'm still a massive noob who hasn't figured out how to side deck well, plus many of the cards in the side can get pretty pricy.</span></strong></p>  <h2><strong><span><span>Some stuff i was looking to find for the deck:</span></span></strong></h2> <p><strong><span>A link 3 </span></strong></p> <p><strong><span>A different rank 4</span></strong></p>  <h2><strong><span><span>Deck Edits:</span></span></strong></h2> <p><strong><span>Removed Abductor, i don't think it fits that great in the deck </span></strong></p> <p><strong><span>Replaced Chronograph package for Box Of Friends + Counter for more normal summon</span></strong></p> <p><span><b>Put Borrelsword back, Orichalc does not otk unless there was a defense position monster there.</b></span></p> <p><strong><span>Removed Emergen</span><span>cy Teleport, deck is a bit cheaper, and brings it to 40 cards.</span></strong></p> <p><strong><span>Put Super Poly in, I realized that generally you can find a way to keep at least one card in hand, and sometimes it works well when you get vanisher in hand, use mithrilium as material, and then mithrilium's GY effect summons out vanisher, leading to big boy interruptions.</span></strong></p> <p></p>"

Deck not so ""explosive"" that plays control with a wide range of options as well as being fun and calm, in addition to sometimes surprising in matches.  <strong>Kings of fire</strong>  <strong>High Avatar Garunix: </strong>Boss Monster of the archetype, can clear fields and you will always want to rotate 2 of them.  <strong>Arvata: </strong>Best monster on the Deck by 1. Denial 2. Revive 3. 200 DEF.  <strong>Yaksha: </strong>You can destroy cards and it's not a bad name.  <strong>Barong: </strong>Searcher.  <strong>Onslaught of the Fire Kings: </strong>Very good card to search for the necessary bodies of the Fire King.  <strong>Circle of the Fire Kings: </strong>Revive and destroy the opponent on your turn.  <strong>Fire King Island: </strong>The best card in the Deck, since it activates destructions like Diagram, in addition to searching.Extra Cards.  <strong>Horny boys</strong>  <strong>Earthbound Immortal Ccarayhua:</strong> NUKE  <strong>True King Agnimazud:</strong> Destroy FIRE to summon and banish.  <strong>Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</strong>: Heavy Storm.  <strong>Nine-Tailed Fox:</strong> Token Generator.  <strong>Ash Blossom:</strong> You know...  <strong>Spell/Trap(s)</strong>  <strong>Terraforming: </strong>Search Field.  <strong>Rekindling: </strong>Spam and OTK.  <strong>Monster Reborn: </strong>To good.  <strong>Fire Formation - Tenki: </strong>Search Fire Kings.  <strong>Generation Shift: </strong>Good Tech.  <strong>Torrential Tribute: </strong>Really good trap, early unnexpected.  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  <strong>Zoodiac-ZEUS: </strong>Chakanine generic, to Boarbow direct attack and the Zeus, is just too good (Not necessary).  <strong>Hope Harbinger: </strong>Rank 8.  <strong>Utopia: </strong>Lightning is really good, you can replace with Double.  <strong>Tiger King: </strong>Is always good for Beast-Warriors.  <strong>Bagooska: </strong>To Stall.  <strong>Accesscode &amp; Knightmare: </strong>Best generic links.  <strong>Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze: </strong>Fire Link.  <strong>Duelittle Chimera: </strong>Original Fire Link.  <strong>Other Options</strong>  <strong>Tri-Brigade: </strong>This can fit in any Beast, Beast-Warrior, Winged-Beast.  <strong>Yubel: </strong>It's an interesting version.  <strong>Generic: </strong>Hazy Flame Griffin is a + Body, Coach Soldier Wolfbark is a insta XYZ or Link (Especially Duelittle), Fire Formation - Tensu is another normal.  <strong>Handtraps: </strong>The deck can carry some good handtraps, although I prefer Ash Blossom for being FIRE.  <strong>Another XYZs: </strong>Any Rank 4 is good.  <strong>Thing you should Know</strong>  Barong and Yaksha have a special Summon effect that is sometimes forgotten.  Rekindling can carry three, but this Deck is not focused on excessive spam.  You can change various generic cards such as Handtraps, Spell / Traps, Xyzs and Links.  It can be a bit difficult to decide whether to go first or second with the Deck, so you have to think about it, I usually prefer to go first.  <strong>Upcoming decks?</strong>  <strong>Remakes:</strong> Remakes for various deck like Albaz, Fusion Toolbox, Infernity Xyz.  <strong>Shiranui World: </strong>Maybe is too normal.  <strong>True Draco Crystal:</strong> HI.  If you would like to see one of this deck, dont forget to comment and share"

If not, try to make Winda to go with Hamon.  If they have hand traps, Dark Beckoning and Ceremony should bait out hand traps to at least do something with Shaddolls.  Going second: Same idea, bait with Sacred Beasts and lock down with Shaddoll.  From my observation: <ul>  	<li>Good against: Dragon Link and generally anything Pure Shaddoll is good against.</li>  	<li>Weak against: Trap heavy decks, Dragoon (if you couldn't get Winda out), probably others too</li> </ul> Modifications: Could replace Rilliona and Magistus spells with mini Invoked engine but that kinda defeats the purpose for me."

Dark Contract with the witch is included in case you already have full combo in hand. If you end up with Siegfried on field and opponent activates Dark Ruler no more, you can chain Dark Contract with the witch and then chain Siegfried to negate Dark Ruler no More.  Standard Combo:  Try to get D/D Lamia, D/D Swirl Slime, D/D Servant Kepler and D/D Necroslime in your hand.  Activate Swirl Slime to fusion summon D/D/D Flame King Genghis Normal Summon D/D Servant Kepler, search Dark Contract with the witch, if you have all combo pieces. Otherwise search Dark Contract with the Gate and get a missing piece with Gate. Banish Swirl Slime from GY to special summon D/D Lamia This activates Genghis' effect to special summon Necroslime from GY  (You should now have Genghis, Kepler, Lamia and Necroslime on field)  Synchro Summon D/D/D Gust King Alexander with Lamia and Genghis Link Summon Cross-Sheep with Necroslime and Kepler Activate Necroslime in GY to fusion summon D/D/D High Flame King Genghis (using Necroslime + D/D/D Flame King Genghis) - Important: Summon to cross-sheep Zone! This triggers Gust King Alexanders effect to special summon Lamia back from GY. Don't use Cross-Sheep yet! Use Lamia and Gust King Alexander to Synchro Summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon. Important: To Cross-Sheep Zone! Trigger Cross Sheep, to get Lamia back on field. That triggers D/D/D High Flame King Genghis to special summon Alexander back from GY Use Cross Sheep and Lamia to Link Summon Halqifibrax and special summon another Lamia with its effect. Use Alexander and Lamia to either special summon Borreload Savage Dragon or Siegfried. Then use Lamias effect to special itself from GY by sending a dark contract to GY (e.g. Gate) Use Lamia and High Flame King Genghis to Synchro Summon Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen.  Thats usually my endboard. When a negate has been used, you can use Halqifibrax' effect to special summon Formula Synchron from Extra Deck and activates its effects to draw a card and Synchro Summon Sattelite Warrior with either Siegfried/Borreload or Crystal Wing. This allows you to destroy up to 3 cards (3 Synchros in GY) and gives him 1k Attack boost per destroyed card.  &nbsp;  In case you bricked and can't get to all combo pieces:  e.g. Start hand is swirl slime, necro slime and 3 bricks: Use Swirl Slime effect to fusion summon Flame King Genghis. Then Necroslimes effect to fusion summon the second Genghis.  Overlay them for Highwave King Caesar. He allows you to negate 2 effects that special summon monsters. This is not once per turn!  &nbsp;  Learning this deck takes a while and I still am not able to get 100% of the potential out of it."

Souls on Cybern allows you to instantly revive Cyberdarkness t1 plus it refills your hand with 2 precious cards. But you lose a significant margin of flexibility  *Going 2nd you should simply go for the Chimeratech Rampage (or Overdragon or CED) OTK. Just pray you top Droplets  &nbsp;"

I will not change my mind.,"This deck strongly focuses on keeping a steady supply of Dinomist Monsters on the field and in the hand, as well as keeping some layer of support on the field to keep the deck's momentum going.  The end-goal is to Pendulum Summon into the Extra Deck monsters that control the board, with <em>Adreus </em>as targeted destruction, <em>Digvorzhak</em> as a strong mill, field control, and beatstick, and <em>Utopia the Lightning</em> and <em>Dragon Ogre</em> as self-buffing beatsticks to bash over high-attack Monsters your opponent may have on the field.  With each Dinomist Monster serving as its own breed of protection, half of them from Battle and the other half for Card Effects, the other support included are <em>Dinomic Powerload </em>to simultaneously beef Dinomists and nerf the opponent's field, <em>Dinomist Charge</em> to keep Dinomist monsters cycled from your extra deck into your hand, and the various traps provided in the archetype to either summon, set scales, or retaliate against destroyed Monsters.  Outside of the archetype, <em>Moray of Greed</em> is a great card to reset a rough hand to get better Dinomists to set scales, <em>Ash </em>and <em>Nashipachi</em> as Tuners to go into the powerful Synchros of the deck, and other miscellaneous support to control the field such as <em>Feather Duster </em>and <em>Solemn Strike. </em>In regard of the Extra Deck, beyond what was mentioned, it also features generic Machine support through <em>Karakurei Shogun</em> and <em>Samurai Destroyer</em>, and better Link support to keep Dinomists cycled and easy to Pendulum Summon, using <em>Eria the Water Charmer </em>and <em>Mistar</em>."

The ideal play is to use Summoner Monk to go into  Treasure Panda, then summon the Limbs of Exodia. After which we link summon Saryuja Skull Dread to get the limbs in the GY (then draw 4 &amp; return 3). Then with our draw spells keep drawing until we get get the Head of Exodia &amp; 2 copies of Dark Factory of Mass Production.  We play 1x Royal Magical Library to be special summoned by Saryuja Skull Dread for its effect to draw 1 card, plus its a spellcaster which we can use with Wonder Wand &amp; Spellbook of Knowledge.  We play 2 hand traps 1x Ash Blossom &amp; 1x Ghost Belle. Ash doesn't need to be explained &amp; we play 1 Ghost Belle to prevent the opponent from banishing our limbs from the GY, if we lose those limbs we'll likely lose.  Our other spells we play:  2x Tri-Wright to bring back our Exodia Limbs for link plays &amp; to sack for Wonder Wand &amp; Spellbook of Knowledge to keep drawing two cards.  1x Dark Eruption just in case we lose the Head of Exodia so we can use this to get it back, it also can be used to get a limb if we need to.  1x Instant Fusion for Thousand-Eyes Restrict to remove something from the field if we need it gone, plus its a spellcaster we can sack for 2 cards.  1x The Grand Spellbook Tower to recycle our Spellbooks (and draw 1 card), its a target for Spellbook of Knowledge to destroy &amp; because we needed a 3rd different spellbook to use Crowley the First Propheseer search effect.  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  Most of the Extra Deck is for removal like Thousand-Eyes Restrict, Relinquished Anima or Akashic Magican our main extra deck monster is Saryuja Skull Dread. With how easy this deck swarms the field getting Saryuja Skull Dread draw 4 &amp; return 3 effect is really easy. Crowley the First Propheseer allows use to get 1 spellbook from our deck (granted our opponent choices, but think of it as a draw 1 card). We also use some rank 4s like Daigusto Emeral since we can get level 4s on the field quite easy &amp; a single rank 1 Slacker Magician which can buy you a turn if you need it.  <strong>Strengths</strong> <ul>  	<li>Great at drawing through the deck</li>  	<li>Exodia on turn 1 is very possible with this deck</li>  	<li>Can survive a turn or 2 to get to Exodia</li>  	<li>Swarms the field pretty quickly</li> </ul> <strong>Weaknesses</strong> <ul>  	<li>Banishing cards is basically a auto lose</li>  	<li>Skill Drain is a nightmare for this deck to play against</li>  	<li>Imperial Order shuts this deck down</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Tell me what you think &amp; how to improve the deck, I'm not the best at deck building so feel free to alter the list yourself"

And one of the new cards we got is a broken Level 10 Synchro monster: Baroness De Fleur!  &nbsp;  Anyways, here is my rather clumsy attempt to build a pure De Fleur deck that uses the new cards. It's built to go second, so I call it ""Berserker De Fleur."" Your strategy if going first is simple: Summon Baroness De Fleur and hope you drew at least one hand trap. If going second, your goal is to pop the eff off and try to OTK your opponent.  As for why Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend is in this deck, that's in case Necro Fleur and Fleur Synchron are both in your hand. So if you summon Scarlight with Fleur Synchron, you can use Fleur Synchron's floating effect to summon Necro Fleur from your hand. Then use Scarlight's effect to pop it and any other monsters. Then you can use Necro Fleur's effect to summon Sorciere De Fleur from the deck and steal a monster from the opponent's Graveyard for further plays.  &nbsp;  Chaos Ruler the Chaotic Magical Dragon is just there to help OTK. Its first effect can potentially get some Spells in the Graveyard. Then if you can link summon Selene, use her second effect to summon a Spellcaster from your hand or Graveyard, and use them to make a 5300-ATK Accesscode Talker. After that, you can use Chaos Dragon's second effect to revive it, and inflict 8300 damage to your opponent!"

Though, I'm not afraid of banishing cards for example either- as past iterations even used cards like necro fusion! That said: Let's get into the strategy.  The pendulum package: Sky iris- It can protect Odd-eyes, performapal, and magician pendulums in the scales- It can also search odd-eyes cards like: odd-eyes pendulum, arc pendulum, gravity dragon, and soul pendulum! soul pendulum and advent I use to utilize the pendulums in the ways they do since mr4 and 5. Endymion- this card and I go way back starting with my first ever structure deck, Spellcaster's command! and In this build I am using cards from Order of the Spellcasters. Endymion, reflection, servant, magister, and lab. Lab essentially counts as the endymion citadel in this deck, and in a pinch at the cost of six spell counters can special summon a level 7 spellcaster from hand or deck! coupled with cards like Magical something, gravity dragon, u go golem, time and stargazer, xiangsheng, and nobledragon magician; gravity dragon makes the opponent pay life points to activate card effects, nobledragon gives way to meteorburst which stops effects during battle! Magical something gets back quick play spells from the grave, stargazer and time gazer protect pendulum monsters, dragonox can bring warriors or spellcasters with 2000 or less atk back from the grave, xiangsheng can ""copy"" the atk of one other monster you control which means free beatstick, and u go golem simply just another way to fusion dragon knight out but with odd-eyes and dark magician in this case.  The deck cycler engine: main cards A feather of the phoenix, Jar of avarice, and hidden spellbook- but I also use boogie trap! Dealer's choice, crystal seer, reload, recovery, and card trader are the draw power coupled with feather, spellbook, and boogie it cycles- and if need be I have cards like deep grave, and monster reborn to bring back monsters! this segways into the defensive cards: counter counter, cash back, broken line (which I might sub out for red reboot), providence, and negate attack are my spell speed 3s mst is self explanatory, sphere kuriboh stops a monster's attack; adapter, mirror force, Punch-in-the-box, and cylinder are for if i am in a bad situation.  Lastly we have the meet and bones of the deck: the DM buster blader package.  eternal soul, circle, and expanded all work with dark magician- and by extension dragon knight! which more than makes up for dark magician's lack of effects. super poly is a free fusion summon w/o opponent interfering at the discard of a card, dsf for the buster blader fusions; then we get to chaos max which can also be summoned via advent- if need be I can use felgrand or creation with them. If i discard cerburrel for Apprentice illusion magician's effect it get's both aim, and cerburrel on the field making it a free scarlight synchro summon if need be! AIM can also buff dark spellcasters so DM, lord of d, or dark paladin are the obvious targets there. lord of d protects keeper, valkyria protects lord of d, double coston, keeper, and kaiser are all for tribute summons of their respective natures! light for Kaiser, dark for Coston, and dragon for keeper. the side deck are optional cards I personally chose that I thought would also benefit the deck and Selene tho I don't have her physically- I can't really use electrumite beyond casual since it's on the forbidden list- and she is a card i want. she and daybreaker also use spell counters, amd since pendulums need links it's a win-win! saryuja is a no-brainer who wouldn't want his effects? i also use heavenly spheres as well as decode! my goal by posting both this version and 15 is to try to find a optimal list to go about bringing to reality the next iteration of my deck. I mentioned before that this whole deck idea started with mainly spellcasters back in 2016, and evolved with the coming of dark paladin, buster blader, and buster blader's fusion- and when I battled against my friends over the years I sought to incorporate pendulums, and so it was a question of: ""how do I use fusion, synchro, xyz, and rituals in a deck?"" seeing the potential in it i experimented and explored- tho mr4 and 4.5(unofficially mr5) complicated the strategy with needing link monsters to pendulum summon from the extra deck. Additionally I've considered the likes of the palladium oracles, chaos max magician, as well as cards from dragon link and red eyes dragoon! at first i sought to have 10 tuners in the deck- ten chances to synchro summon, but the problem there is i only go into 3 synchros in this iteration and it wasn't necessary the main issues is likely card optimization, and efficient consistency- but I feel this deck idea definitely has potential- to find the best iteration i'd have to leave no road untraveled in designing/building."

If you think that you can't find enough Fire Formation cards I would recommend adding either one Liang peak or a Terraforming. You can only activate Ingen and Domei once per turn and you need to use Domei for your Eland (searched with Elephant), Liang peak is better than Ingen as it is still very useful even if not fully stacked. (You can still add 1 Ingen if you believe Liang+Terraforming is not enough).  P(Kerass≥1)= 85% success. This success rate includes Tenki as a Tri-Brigade card for obvious reasons searching Fraktall. If you fear God you can increase the rate of Nervall in the deck but I'd like to keep bricks to a minimum (already being Domei and Buffalo whereas Nervall, Sinto, Thoroughblade, Zhuge Kong and Eland being somewhat okay bit not great if drawn). Kerass overall success rate depends on a higher density of monsters not only to be discarded, but also for the banishing effect, meaning that useful extender spells such as monster reborn and Fire Kings cards were dissmissed in favour of less explosivity but a more competent deck. This is also in line with a Zoodiac combo I was playing around with using Ratpier and Barage as starters and an extender but they were inconsistent and didn't have a consistent starting combo.  The Zoodiac units in the Extra are to give Drident multiple materials for pops but if you aren't using her, to send Tiger King to the grave, she only needs one material, therefore you can make more room in the Extra. I wouldn't recommend reducing the number of Thoroughblade unless you do get rid of Chakanine and Tiger Mortar as you cannot access that part of the extra deck without a free Zoodiac summoned off of Tiger King, requiring a higher Zoodiac density.  If I was to change anything maybe I'd add some beast-warrior extenders like Tengu but not much else, for consideration Boar -&gt; Lavalval Exlord or Borreload Savage. Could add more cards for going second such as Bear, Gorilla, Called By The Grave. Maybe you could abuse Saryuja I don't think it's neccessary though. Tri-Brigade Rendezvous for OTK potential.  *I am completely unsure about Heraklinos I haven't tested him whatsoever I just recently put in Daigusto Emeral and with that you can cycle more allowing for a few more summons which I think could enable his addition*  &nbsp;"

Summons a Beast from hand on summon.  2x Gladiator Beast Attorix-Flexible Name, you dump any Glad Beast and Attorix becomes that name and level,flexible use depending on situations.  2xGladiator Beast Bestiari- Usually a send off of Attorix,or hard summoned for Gyzarus,can cut one if you prefer a different name  1x Gladiator Beast Darius- Name for recoverability,summons another from grave  2xGladiator Beast Vespasius-A free summon and name for Domitianus,usually sent off Attorix or summoned from hand,whatever the situation calls for.  3xPSY-Framegear Gamma- makes sure your rescue cat(and to some extent the battle shuffling effects) resolves.  1x PSY-Frame Driver- needed for Gamma  3xTest Tiger-Free summon,you can choose to activate the effect,but not really reccommended  Spells:  1xCalled By the Grave- Insulates you from some handtraps  3xGladiator Proving Ground-The deck's themed ROTA(not once per turn btw)  2xGladiator's Beast's Respite-Fixes your hand. Can be replaced for a better draw spell.  3xGladiator Beast's Comeback-The deck's themed reborn(wow broken no opt as well)  3xUnexpected Dai- Free summon. Enough said.  Traps:  3xGladiator Beast War Chariot-Free negate,also not opt,can be replace for more generic stuff.  Extra Deck:  2x Test Panther-Main ED starter,usually summons Augustus,also searches any Glad Beast card,not just monsters on summon.(broken)  2x Editor-Main Fusion Summon of the deck. Summons the big bosses  2xDomitianus-Monster Negate. Decent Stats. Enough Said.  1xHeraklinos-Spell/Trap Negate. Also good stats. Usually only used against backrow decks.  2xGyzarus-Free double pop. Not really reccomended in 2021,but if the situation calls for it,go ahead.  1x Dragases- You can take this out. Won't really make a difference.  1xLambda-Did you know it's generic? And did you know none of the Glad Beast monsters lock you into anything? Well now you do. Can link with Editor or Panther with Driver for an endphase gamma search.(Assuming you used gamma this turn)  1xOmega-Decent synchro I guess.Good against Dogmatika.  1xFerrijit-Decent Link extender,can fix hand,also good against Dogmatika.  1xAndabata-just a worse Editor,can be taken out if so wished.  1x Link Spider-For when you draw Andal.Also good against Lost World.  Side Deck is completely arbitrary,you can place anything you so wanted.  Combo:  Make any 2 into Panther,panther summon Augustus, make editor, and go from there.  That's about it. Hope you like the deck. Feedback always appreciated.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

It eats you.,"If you get too many pieces or tuners in your hand, don't be afraid to use your normal summon to link spider to special summon another piece or tuner from the hand, than go into your ye ol' kuriboyo there to bust out your secure olive gardna. Obliterate is your best friend for compulsory evac here. You know what to do if you see panda and toon table. Express it all to the graveyard and gather up as much resource material as you can to go straight into saryuja skull fawk and draw with his effect. If you get a summoner monk, boom. Use him to throw out another panda and hit yourself a number 60 duggies and use his effect to draw the 3. Don't get scared on me. This is just the beginning. There's so many plays here if you got the right hand the left hand the legs and the brain of it all. (See what I did there? Me neither)  The side deck is just for extra fun and sparkles if you want to mix it up a bit. Please go for the quintet because I'll love you forever. It's ok to banish up to 3 pieces because that's what acquisitiveness is there for. Bro I just wanna see you shine. If you pull out of the beast of the pharaoh while the librarian is on the mat, may god card have mercy on your opponents chances."

It has a unique playstyle which requires you to plan several turns ahead. Like other control decks, it's weak to back row removal. Like other decks playing a large amount of high level monsters, it has some consistency problems.  The best card in the deck may be Metaphys Dimension. Use it to banish one of your opponent's cards every turn (each of yours and your opponent's). Combining Dimension with Trap Trick, Metaphys Ascension, and using Dimension itself to summon Ragnarok when your opponent Special Summons, you can interrupt your opponent's combos.  <strong>Explaining the ratios:</strong>  You play 3 copies of Ragnarok, Asymmetaphys, Dimension, and Ascension because these form your core Metaphys engine. Your goal should be to use all of these as often as you possibly can. It can be bricky but playing 3 copes of Daedalus and Nephthys is important (notice that these are not once per turn effects!) as banishing them with Asymmetaphys or Ragnarok is always good. Tyrant dragon isn't as good as Daedalus or Nephthys so I only play 2 copies. Because he's bad to draw, I sometimes wish I could only play 1 copy but it's sometimes important to summon a Tyrant off of another Tyrant. I have never missed the third.  Metaphys Factor and Decoy Dragon are both useful but the are searchable and only good in niche scenarios, so you don't need to play more than one copy of either.  You can only play 2 copies of Necroface if you want. That would reduce the probability of bricking but decrease the power ceiling. Also, using Aloof Lupine to banish double Necroface is hilarious.  I play Lost Wind because it's my favorite second normal trap target for Trap Trick. I've also tried Impermanence, Ice Dragon's Prison, and Different Dimension Ground as alternatives. It could be that some other trap is better here, but I like the value that Lost Wind provides, especially since you can use it in the damage step when someone is trying to attack over Ragnorak.  <strong>The Extra Deck:</strong>  You only seldom will summon anything from the Extra Deck. (But note that Pot of Extravagence or Prosperity aren't that good because it's important to be able to use Asymmetaphys as often as possible).  All the monsters in the extra deck are here for very specific scenarios. I'll just share the couple that are most important but may seem strange on first inspection: <ol>  	<li>Almiraj is for the very specific scenario where you draw Necroface, Asymmetaphys, and either Dimension Shifter or Dimensional Fissure, and some other Metaphys card to banish with Asymmetaphys. Then you can summon the necroface and reduce its attack with Asymmetaphys to be able to link it away for Almiraj, thus banishing the Necroface to trigger its effect.</li>  	<li>Geomathmech is there because in Main Phase 2, if you Summoned Tyrant or Nephthys with Ragnarok's effect and didn't win that Battle Phase, it's a little better to sit on Geomathmech than a pair of Metaphys monsters with no protection.</li>  	<li>Red-Eyes Flare Metal: If in your own Standby Phase you summon Daedalus and clear your opponent's board, then summon Ragnarok. Attacking directly with these two and using Ragnarok's effect to Summon another Daedalus from the deck is a total of 6700 to 7600 damage (depending on how many Metaphys cards Ragnarok banished). This will leave your opponent to play there turn under Flare Metal's effect with somewhere between 1300 and 400 LP.</li> </ol>"

Main goal is to pump out <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Dragoon"">Dragoon</a> and other extra deck threats by using grave effects to summon a bunch of high level monsters.  Opener I've been most comfortable w/ has been ecplipse wyvern along w/ Dragon Ravine &amp; one small &amp; one large dragon ruler to help get heavy hitters with little to no effort. Starting off by using the small dragon ruler to pull a higher form and send eclipse to the grave, banishing Darkness Metal with its effect, then summoning your other dragon ruler by banishing eclipse &amp; the other one. Summoning Darkness Metal by banishing one of the dragon rulers to pull Dragonic Knight or either of the Mythic Dragons (Dragonic if your board is slightly lacking, Mythic if you have the other in hand). Finally, using Dragon Ravine to send your last card in hand to grave to send arkbrave or felgrand to grave, with Felgrand being monster removal, and Arkbrave acting as a Harpie's Feather Duster+ on a stick. Use the summoned monster and your remaining Dragon Ruler to summon Verte, then pull out Dragoon. If you somehow found the Mythic Dragons in your hand by the end of this, normal summon the earth one and special the water, then XYZ (Cipher to Dark Matter if going 2nd, Hope Harbinger if 1st)  The Mythic dragons are used primarily to pull out Galaxy-Eyes Cipher into Dark Matter Dragon, and alternatively Hope Harbinger if you want to delay your opponent's setup. Dragonic Knight is some extra protection for your big monsters like Darkness Metal &amp; your XYZ's  Pot, Upstart, &amp; Terraforming are all used to help boost consistency. Blue Eyes are in there to help give better targets for the effect blue-eyes cards and just generally solid beatsticks to summon with REDM. Ash Blossom's only a one of b/c of a deal w/ the friends I've been playing with, but others are in the side deck (dunno what to take out for em anyways). Monster Reborn should be pocketed for resummoning REDM, as its effect can make or break the deck would only recommend using otherwise if it would close out the game.  Hope this writeup is sufficient for my first deck &amp; that y'all enjoy."

Envoy of Chaos should either remain in hand or in the grave, in order to buff any BLS Monster.

I felt the Trickstars were by far the cutest, so that's who I'm going with, lol. My strat for this deck is all burn, with the heart being Candina and its soul being Lycoris with MAJOR help from Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and Droll &amp; Lock Bird. For my backfield I'm using the standard supports to get Links on the field asap with Dark Room, T Reincarnation, and Infinite Impertanance to help beef the burn and fill the gaps. My extra is all Trickstars with the notable ones being Bloom x3 and Divardis, Foxglove, and Holly Angel all being x2. I even threw in a Band Sween Guitar just for laughs (it's so pointless). This deck has a lot of flaws, especially in the power area, but I feel that the decks ability to constantly get needed cards on the field makes it very formidable. I feel this would also be a good tutorial deck for Link summoning and for countering burn decks."

This is where Norleras comes in and changes the game.  basic two-card Norleras combo goes like this:  You need a Tour Guide and a Burning Abyss monster card in hand  normal summon Tour Guide, special summon Doomdog  Link summon Cherubini, this will trigger Doomdog, search Norleras  Now you need Cir on the field, if you have one in hand, use Cherubini to send Libic to the GY to special summon Cir. Otherwise send Graff and special summon Cir from the deck.  next you special summon the Burning Abyss card you have in hand  Use Cir and your extra BA Monster to xyz summon Angineer (light fairy needed for Norleras)  Use Angineer and Cherubini to link summon Tenyi Berserker, this will trigger Cir, summon Cherubini back from the GY  Use Cherubini and Tenyi Berserker to summon Doublebyte Dragon, it'll have 3000 attack  Now special summon Norleras, banish Angineer, Tour Guide, Doomdog and a BA monster  Use Norleras effect, Doublebyte stays on the field since it's only affected by monster effects from other Link monsters"
