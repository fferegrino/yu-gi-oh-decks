Its mostly played against Rogue and in Casual Play. I try may best to make the Deck as good as possible. Work,"Hey Guys,  this is my attempt to create a solid Deckprofile for casual play. I might say that im not used to play with a side Deck so I tried this Deck as versatile is i could. E.g. I run book of moon, cause it can work going first and going second. I run 6 going second cards, which also work against many Decks. I dont play against Drytron or VW. Its mostly rogue.  The Deck is really consistent as it is. Ofc if you draw 5 Live Twins you brick, but the numbers are all pretty well chosen. I tried many ratios and i like this the most. You could run 3 Nadirs cause it is broken, but I dont have a third copy IRL.  Atm I run Zeus in the Extra, because I dont think the Evil Twins are that good going second. The only Problem is you need to get your normal summon out. The Spell doesnt help there sadly.  For the people that like playing 40 cards straight, you may cut Pankratops, cause he is just a brick going first. Or cut the Secret Password or one Book of Moon  Maybe I should talk about my choice of the Black Eldlixir. I have chosen it, cause it helps me to get consistent hands. White Eldlixir often feels like a brick if drawn, else it just helps the grind game. I see that the Black Eldlixir is dead if both copies of Eldlich are in the grave, but i try too utilies my Eldlich in the grave the most, to play around Ice Dragons Prison.  About Combos, there isnt much in this Deck, you play the hand as you get it. Remember to use the Dogmatika cards at the end. Also there are very many cards that lock you in Types or Archetypes, watch out for them to play in the right order.  A good two card Combo is a Live Twin and Eldland in hand. Sadly you dont get the drawcause you pop your Eldland, but you have the Evil Twins and Conquistador/Haquero live.  As discard you mostly like to use the golden Lord, or an Eldlich spell/trap.  Link Spider and Almiraj are there to fix really bad hands and to get a monster from the Extra Deck out for Ecclesia. They both can be cut for Knightmare Gryphon and Omega for example. I also thought to cut the Unchained link 4 for Knightmare Gryphon, but the Abomination enables Otks with the Dogmatika cards.  Thats all I got at the moment, i will add sth, when I played again some time with this version."

It means any Halq is Colossus+Arc Light that is SPLASHABLE IN EVERY DECK CONSISTENT,"https://youtu.be/2j2p3b3hv8Y  All you need is <strong>1 Halqifibrax</strong> to have Colossus+Herald of the Arc Light, it means a 1 card combo (2 with Jet Synchron discard). Watch the video for combo tutorial. Colossus is banned on TCG tho, so sad. If you wanna splash it to another deck, just use that Halq lineup + Dragondark, Dragonhawk, and Colossus, you'll end up with the same board.  If you're new to the Thunder Dragon playstyle, the aim is to summon Colossus/Titan and gotta max out the ratio for Dragonhawk, Dragonroar, Dragondark, and regular Thunder Dragon, don't forget to play the Thunder Dragon Fusion spell too. Then you can play the rest of Thunder Dragon cards at 1 or 2 copies. The support usually used is Allure of Darkness, Gold Sarcophagus, Batteryman Solar/Aloof Lupine, Chaos Space (and its target like Wyverbuster/Collapserpent), and lastly Verte Anaconda/Cross-Sheep.  Pros: New fun approach of Thunder Dragon and splashable.  Cons: Weaker than the Chaos version, Colossus is banned in TCG."

First of all it was ahead of its time with a brillant  remover, a non-targeting  and non-destruction  remover. Second of all it’s a OTK machine that was getting better and better along these years, and was a shame to not get a structure deck in the 2019 poll (losing to Shaddol, Sacred beast and now infamous  Charmer deck). I personally find it a little difficult to play with this deck, ‘cause it has so many lines to play that I got confused (although i’m not a very smart girl). But here we are with a lot of new supports, infinite lines to play and a deck so sweet that might cause diabetes to your opponents.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Disclaimers</i></b></span>  <span>When I try to build a deck I like to use cards that I already have</span><i><span>,</span></i><span>thus I rarely have the new staples for exemple. So the majority of cards that you’ll see can be considered a budget option for certain cards, in other words no Access code talker. However  I hope you like my choices for certain cards and if you have any questions or tips, please message me.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Starters</i></b></span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a>: </b><span>this cute girl can tribute herself to summon any madolche monster from the deck, preferable </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a> </b><span> to start her combo because she was a special summon or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a> </b><span> to extend your plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a>: </b><span> a newcomer where the new broken combo resides. This little girl can special summon herself from your hand with you having no monster in your GY and, in top of that, summon another madolche from your deck but this monster will have 1 level less than the original . The way that she can trigger her second  effect by any special summon is insane, so if she was summon  by  </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a> </b><span> or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a> </b><span>  you also would summon another Madolche monster , like </span><span> </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess"">Madolche Puddingcess</a> </b><span> for instance to proceed to XYZ plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Mewfeuille"">Madolche Mewfeuille</a>: </b><span>A great helper to “debrick” your hand, especially if you have another madolche in hand or you have </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Salon"">Madolche Salon</a> </b><span>to capitalize on that.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x</b> <b><a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a>:  </b><span>The primary function of this owl is to summon </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Messengelato"">Madolche Messengelato</a> </b><span> to start your combos  and put some protection , but it can  maybe summon </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a> </b><span> or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a> </b><span>to use some different line of plays. Additionally it can clean you Gy from non-madolche monsters like hand traps or similar</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Extenders</i></b></span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Salon"">Madolche Salon</a>: </b><span> sometimes I read this card over and over and I Can’t believe this card was printed. This is an amazing recovery and with an additionally normal summon can put some underdogs back on the track like </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Magileine"">Madolche Magileine</a> </b><span> or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Mewfeuille"">Madolche Mewfeuille</a> </b><span> that can generate an advantage of this fact. Furthermore when a madolche card is shuffled back in the deck you can set a madolche spell/trap card from your deck, and this will happen a lot. It is everything we ever wanted.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Magileine"">Madolche Magileine</a>: </b><span>add any madolche monster to your hand and it’s a non hard once per turn effect , so in conjunction with </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Salon"">Madolche Salon</a> </b><span> this card can show its true potential.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Madolche Messengelato"">Madolche Messengelato</a>: </b><span>This dude has the insane non hard once per turn effect in all archetype.  Summon most of the time by the effect of </span><b> <a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a>, </b><span> the ability to add any madolche spell/trap card for a simple special summon it’s amazing. You can bring </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Salon"">Madolche Salon</a> </b><span>, </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Chateau"">Madolche Chateau</a> </b><span> to trigger  the effect of </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Salon"">Madolche Salon</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Ticket"">Madolche Ticket</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode"">Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode</a></b><b>, </b><b><a data-name=""Madolche Teacher Glassouffle"">Madolche Teacher Glassouffle</a></b><span> if they are already in the field or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Ticket"">Madolche Ticket</a>… </b><span>so many lines…</span>  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Madolche Chateau"">Madolche Chateau</a>: </b><span>explained above, furthermore boost your monster with  500ATK.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Madolche Ticket"">Madolche Ticket</a>: </b><span>this deck will shuffle cards into the deck  a lot and that will trigger this card so easily, so in perspective , you always will have a madolche monster in hand or, if you control a madolche fairy monster, you could summon that card. </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Messengelato"">Madolche Messengelato</a> </b><span>(if have a beast monster) and</span><b> <a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a> </b><span>will trigger with this card.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess"">Madolche Puddingcess</a>: </b><span> a combo piece that can be brought by the effect of </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a> </b><span>, that later can be used  to make all of the XYZ line up, additionally can be an excellent monster remover.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Beaters</i></b></span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode"">Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode</a>: </b><span> can put another body in the field, can hit really hard and one of the otk enablements of this deck. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops"">Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</a>: </b><span>A dad for XYZ deck based.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Hand Traps</i></b></span>  <b>3x </b><b><a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a>: </b><span>One of the best hand traps right now. This little Oni can counter somany cards like the Zoo monsters, Zeus and even True King or All Calamities, thus this to me it’s an absolute staple.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a>: </b><span>with so many in GY plays like </span><b><a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a>,</b> <b><a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a>, </b><span> Dragon link or even Virtual world… this adorable ghost girl will be one of your best friends in this format.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>: </b><span>my choice for this card is kind of interesting. A lot of  prominent rogue decks (Heroes,Orcust or  Chaos variants) use some banishing mechanic  and this card can be a pain to deal with, but man… decks like Dinosaur, Virtual World, Drytron  will stop right away when you drop this card.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a>: </b><span>a lot of madolche monsters are fairy-type monsters, thus becoming an amazing tech to use that can  block even other monsters to activate their effect in the hand. On top of all that, it can put some monsters in the  GY to help some madolche monsters to do  their plays (like  </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a> </b><span>or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"">Madolche Queen Tiaramisu</a>,</b><span> for example).</span>  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a>: </b><span>an amazing tech that can put your opponent in bad shape, literally. This “pocket” </span><b><a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos</a> </b><span>it’s a torment to deal with , making sometimes  your adversary skip an entire turn  because of that. It’s a shame that the condition to activate this  card is so insane.</span>  <span> </span> <h1><b>Controls /Defenders</b></h1> &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Madolche Nights"">Madolche Nights</a>: </b><span> a great control card and a good negation, however the condition that specifically says “ no monster in Gy” is kind of hard, furthermore this card it’s not really good in the late or mid game.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Madolche Promenade"">Madolche Promenade</a>: </b><span>an</span> <span>awesome  monster negation and a xyz material for the next turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Teacher Glassouffle"">Madolche Teacher Glassouffle</a></b><span>: This newcomer from  Dark Neos Storm can look apparently a weak monster, nevertheless  in this format she is a powerhouse. The first effect says: you  can </span><span>detach a card from her to protect a madolche from effects.</span><span>The second effect says that if a madolche hit the  Gy she can shuffle 2 card in any Gy, so the  two effect  can work together to disturrupet  your opponent GY setup  or to continue your madolche play.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3X <a data-name=""Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"">Madolche Queen Tiaramisu</a>: </b><span>a non-target and a non-destruction remover, man… i can't believe this card was printed back in 2012.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Madolche Fresh Sistart"">Madolche Fresh Sistart</a>:</b><span> a decent protection for you madolche spell cards furthermore  a good way to shuffle a madolche monster in you GY in case of destruction.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>: </b><span>another way to stop any GY play.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>: </b><span> to summon  </span><b><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> </b><span> in the opponent’s turn.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>1x <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>: </b><span>backrow remover.</span>  &nbsp; <h1><b>Side deck</b></h1> &nbsp;  <span>Every card it’s self explanatory.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Conclusion</i></b></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Who would have thought that a so sweet and cute deck could be so deadly and agro , with so many recursing and so many lines of plays, this deck can be so strong and consistent that it will always be a formidable foe.

The intention of this deck as you may have guessed is to summon Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode. However, this deck has more potential than that. In addition to being able to summon Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode, the deck can also take advantage of the Dark Magician Archetype. If done correctly the deck can bring out Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode and if that's not bad enough for your opponents because the deck runs a lot of spellcasters you can also abuse Secret Village of the Spellcasters. But, do keep in mind although the deck is powerful much of its power can only be taken advantage of if going first. So if you're in a match make sure to include things like Kaijus and Dark Ruler No More in the sideboard to ensure you have a way of getting past your opponent's negates. Furthermore, don't be afraid of discarding Assault Mode Activate for Magicians' Souls' effect there are three in the deck for a reason. Lastly, be careful with Assault Sentinal make sure you've summoned whatever non-synchro monsters from the extra deck that you need before his ability to maximize your strategies and optimization. Other than that I hope you enjoy the deck and if possible do help with any advice you have on how the deck may be improved."

Viabi,"This is a currently experimental build of an idea I saw someone talking about Rikka as potentially quality deck with some of the plant support.  There was a note that it would likely be better once the Sunvine and Sunavalon cards come, but I had restricted myself to just TCG legal cards to see how the deck performs as of this moment to see where problems lay.  Overall this is a general rundown as to what is possible, but it is still a quite early stage of experimentation and further work is likely able to be done in order to be able to refine them.  As an example, this did start as a more pure Rikka deck and had the Aroma aspects slightly splashed in and another direction may find better strength. <p><span>The Good Stuff</span></p> 1 - Lonefire Blossom, Evil Thorn, and Aromaseraphy Jasmine all have their effects cost in the form of tributing.  This allows for all of these to be used for the from hand special summon of Primula the Rikka Fairy, from graveyard special summon of Erica the Rikka Fairy, and, while not requiring tributes, the from hand special summon of Rose Girl.  Evil Thorn in turn has first turn synergy with Aroma Laurel with its overall minor 300 damage effect dropping your opponent's life points down and thereby allowing the special summon requirements of Laurel to be fired off, and as it is a One for One target you can set up for the Erica play by sending that card to the grave for cost.  The boards set up through this method are able to go into a wide variety of levels, as if you end up with an optimum board from a one for one where you can have 5 materials on board without an expended normal summon.  With two expended for an Aromaseraphy Jasmine who in turn uses its own tributing effect, you can special summon a Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy that is able to level manipulate your whole board into multiple Ranks of near your choice.  2 - Rikka Petal can allow for a once per turn for up to 3 turns Rank 8 plant monster when combined with Rose Girl.  It achieves this through using its effect to be special summoned from grave on your opponent's end phase, using Rose Girl's return to hand effect along with normal summoning it, using Rikka Petal's search effect to get Mudan the Rikka Fairy, using Petal as material for Mudan's special summon, searching Rikka Glamour using Mudan's effect, tributing either Mudan or Rose Girl for Rikka Glamour's double search, searching Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy and Hellebore the Rikka Fairy, then using the other for Snowdrop's special summon of itself and another plant monster.  Notably, this line can stop even before Mudan for Rank-2, or 2 rank increase, Link plays.  Aromaseraphy Angelica and Erica the Rikka Fairy can both be added into this once to replace Rose Girl so it is not needed to expend your normal summon for the play.  3 - Rose Bell of Revelation allows for the searching of both the Attack Increase effect of Erica the Rikka Fairy, and the limited Effect Veiler-style effect of Hellebore the Rikka Fairy, along with setup for a special summon on the next turn.  4 - Their rank 8 that is quite easy to make with the deck thanks to Snowdrop makes use of tributing removal in a quick effect form thanks to the requirements for turning it into a quick effect being the usage of plant-type monsters as material.  5 - Any effect that is non-destruction negation upon your monsters can be pushed through decently as it will leave behind a plant-type that is able to be used as material for further plays either from tributing for a special summon or for extra deck plays. <p><span>Issues</span></p> 1 - For a lot of the deck's plays, you effectively need to expend your entire starting hand and this can leave you with very limited options if your board is broken.  Aromage Jasmine and Aromaseraphy Jasmine both grant effects to draw you cards in soft once per turn fashion, the former blind draws and the latter searching plant monsters, but life point gain may not always be available.  2 - Second turn plays can be a bit of an issue as this deck calls for tribute fodder for its effects to go off, and at times you can be stuck with lines that leave you with very few monsters on board that mean you might only be able to end off with just 1 extra deck monster on board.  This especially becomes the case if you don't have Rose Girl, Primula, or a Erica in grave, or a way in hand to be able to tribute a card off the field to get off their effects, and further becomes a problem if you've gone through the Evil Thorns.  3 - A lot of effects restrict you to plant-type summons, which poses a problem when it comes to the extra deck as there are not too many good plant type options at the moment.  One of the big ones is that there are no instant fusion targets, as Neo-Spacian Twinkle Moss is the only level 5 or lower plant and it has a requirement of needing NEX to summon, that makes the Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio into Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra quite a shaky point beyond its addition to the issues it has with the prior mentioned hand issues.  Super Polymerization will not solve this either as much of the deck is composed of water attribute plants which would not be able to go into the Predaplant fusions using what you have.  Sunavalon may help with allowing for this to solved, but that needs testing.  The list below maintains a list of the current good extra deck monsters that work with the set main deck.  4 - If you want multi-turn recovery, deck space is extremely tight and this only becomes worse when trying to get hand traps into the mix.  This is why the list below has a 60 card main deck.  5 - This can fight through some hand traps, but it is a bit card dependent and while Nibiru does spawn a token, it is not a plant-type that several of the special summon effects require in order to be able to go off."

Once you summon Blue-Eyes Chaos Max, IA is unable to do anything against it. Also, if you don't manage to get the resources to turbo Chaos Max, the deck can still pull through by using a primitive Dragon Link-type strategy.  Ritual engine consists of exactly 15 cards, which could be replaced by the side deck to turn this deck a more pure Blue-Eyes Dragon Link build.  Any suggestions are welcome."

Well, let's get on the topic at hand shall we? , this is my modified Ancient Gear deck that has a lot of control potential(as far as Ancient Machinery with Tony Stark's girl version goes) and can otk easily as well, it just depends on your grip, here is the introduction to the deck's strategy and cards that are included in it:  &nbsp;  Main Deck  Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon: He is a target for both Ancient Gear Catapult and Geartown, can control the field against control decks by popping off their spells and traps one by one, has a big attack power and can defend your field as well, plus it is a Earth Machine monster and it will come to importance later.  Ancient Gear Golem: The old school Ancient Gear, brings memories doesn't?, it is the primary target for both Ancient Gear Catapult and for Ancient Gear Fusion as the first lets you summon it from deck ignoring his conditions and the latter gets stronger by it being on the field, it is self explanatory though, it can punch, can pierce and can help you otk, it is one of my favorites(not because i have one Ultimate First Ed of it...ok, maybe a little because of that).  Ancient Gear Wyvern: It is one of the best cards you can normal summon, it can search a lot of good cards, is an earth machine, can search Ancient Gear Box and is summonable via Geartown, just be careful with it as for the rest of the turn you search with it you cannot set cards so set them beforehand.  Ancient Gear Frame: It is there just because it can be searched via box and has a nice search effect that can get Ancient Gear Fusion directly from the deck for you, it is a nice option but far from perfect, it is also a earth machine.  Sky Striker Ace - Raye: She is almost perfect as access any of her armors which can set up strategies, protects you and she is a Loli, one of the best normal summons of the deck.  Ancient Gear Box: Well, it can search Ancient Gear Frame and serve as fusion material, it is a nice inclusion but don't run too many, one is enough as it can(and will) be searched by Ancient Gear Wyvern.  Ancient Gear Hunting Hound: Can be a niche normal summon as it can deal burn damage and allow an easy Ancient Gear Howitzer, can be searched by Ancient Gear Wyvern as aforementioned.  Ash Blossom: Do i really need to explain?, She is a hand trap slot(can be switched by any other relevant HT of the format).  Overload Fusion: Predaplant Verte Anaconda's favorite target, easily allows for a second Chaos Ancient Gear Giant.  Sky Striker Maneuver - Jamming Waves: This can pop both your opponent's spell and trap cards and can be used to pop your Geartown(300 IQ) and depending on the situation, a monster your opponent controls, this is what i would call synergy.  Ancient Gear Catapult: Can enable any Ancient Gear from deck(even Ancient Gear Golem) and can pop both Geartown and Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero to summon a Sky Striker Ace - Raye that can help you set up more, also remember the GY effect as it will help you set up plays.  Ancient Gear Fusion: Will summon your extra deck options which include Chaos Ancient Gear Giant and Ancient Gear Megaton Golem.  Pot of Avarice: Will reset your Sky Strikers, draw 2 and get back some resources into the deck.  Terraforming: A fourth copy of Geartown and a third copy of Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero.  Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones: Can summon a ""Raye"" to the field that is never a bad this, specially for no normal summon at all and can even protect you from an otk while you're setting up yours.  Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor: It is obviously a great card as it can help you both in the control aspects of the deck as it can help you steal and/or negate anything on the field, with so many V.F.Ds running around this is a great addition to this deck.  Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole: It can further improve this deck's control aspects and can protect your Sky Striker cards, can also send cards to the GY like the Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero.  Ancient Gear Fortress: A one of, why?, it limits what you can summon when it activates her effect, she can protect your Ancient Gears and also can revive an Ancient Gear like Wyvern from the GY, a good card, not great, not bad, just good.  Geartown: A card to destroy whenever you have the chance, she is basically an enabler ""for free"", can net almost any Ancient Gear from deck with the exception of Ancient Gear Golem.  Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero: Can possibly search any Sky Striker Card but also be sent to the GY via this deck's various ways to do this to summon a Raye from deck to make Kaina as she is an Earth Machine, combo potential basically.  Infinite Impermanence: A hand trap slot but also works as a pseudo Widow Anchor, nifty isn't it?  &nbsp;  Extra Deck  Chaos Ancient Gear Giant: The main boss monster of this deck as it is a powerhouse, can attack a lot of times, easily access an otk via himself and has spell and trap protection, you must run this card and he is the main objective and wincon.  Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem: A good option, a powerhouse as well, can be dangerous for your opponent but he will probably be summoned mostly via Ancient Gear Megaton Golem's effect.  Ancient Gear Megaton Golem: Speaking of the devil, it is just a second option if you can't make enought resources for Chaos Ancient Gear Giant, and can also summon Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem just incase.  Ancient Gear Howitzer: A surprisingly good card as it can help you defend yourself from your opponent as he is unaffected to card effects and can summon ANY Ancient Gear from the deck, even Golem, can also help you win in time just like Hunting Hound.  Ancient Gear Ballista: Combo enabler, remember that i mentioned a lot of times earth machines?, well here is the purpose of it, it can be summoned to combo off, enable otks, search cards, it is a really solid card and is part of the many combos that involve Raye as Kaina herself is also an earth machine.  Sky Striker Ace - Zeke: Just a name really, she can help you send things to the GY but that's it, you won't be going too much into her except in the case you want to Avarice, ok she can banish threats away but...your main wincon is hitting monsters your opponent controls with your powerhouses, a bit self countering isn't it?.  Predaplant Verte Anaconda: My precious plant will enable the double otk with two Chaos Ancient Gear Giants.  Sky Striker Ace - Hayate: Basic Sky Striker playstyle stuff, can send any Sky Striker card to the GY, be it Raye for protection, be Widow Anchor to grab with Kagari, it's really up to you and situation dependant, can also help you win on time(Yay?).  Sky Striker Ace - Kaina: She is really good in this deck as she is both an earth machine and can hold your opponent's monsters from an attack.  Sky Striker Ace - Kagari: Can recover any Sky Striker spell from your GY, can basically search alongside Hayate's effect, good card and the only extra deck monster besides the AG link and boss at 2.  Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku: Can search stuff, weakens opponent's monsters, help protect the field, another good Sky Striker card.  &nbsp;  Side Deck's Obligatory Card:  Run 3x copies of Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburner as it is exchangeable with Jamming Waves, basically does the same thing but is match dependant.  Strategy: It aims to control the gamestate with the Sky Striker half while setting up the Ancient Gear half for an easy and fast otk your opponent won't be prepared, the surprise factor is important here as you can change the playstyle on the fly.  -END OF THE LIST-  &nbsp;  Well this is it, the end of my deck profile and if you want to ask something, just go and do it, i will answer it when i get the chance to."

Plus, this card acts as a substitute to summon the almighty ""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"", so if you only have two ""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"" cards in your hand, you do not have to wait to summon the fusion monsters. The deck also uses ""Dragon's Mirror"" in order to save resources, by using monsters in your GY to summon. ""Gravekeeper's Spy"", ""Magical Merchant"" and ""Morphing Jar"" will speed up the summoning process. They'll allow you to slim the deck down and gain field control very easily. After you summon your dragons, ""My Body as a Shield"" protects you from your opponent, as it stops their attempts to destroy your monsters. Once you get ""Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon"" out, you should have control of the game. For one, the card has potentially more than 3,000 attack points, and any effect that targets him is negated. Save ""My Body as a Shield"" for unique situations in which you may be in a sticky situation.  If you don't have all the cards in your deck, its easy to substitute some of the cards. ""Luster Dragon"" and ""Skilled Dark Magician"" are good trades for ""D.D. Assailant"" and ""D.D. Warrior Lady"". The key to winning with this deck is to outplay your opponent by maintaining field control. Powerful monsters will help you achieve this. Have fun dueling!"

Top in remote duel invite.,"To be honest this deck was mainly made to counter drytron. You want to go first with this deck but the zoo part of it does help when going second. When going first you want to try to set up a board playing under nib. What I always tried for was a 1 material drident + Smiorgh+ barrier statue + back row or hand trap. The one material drident is killer if they do not have some sort of negate because you can pop their normal summon when they go to attack the barrier. Simorgh protecting against targeting was way more important then I thought it would be and it caused ALOT of problems for people. I played book of moon and crackdown for a similar reason as the drident, mess up their normal summon during the battle phase or main phase if need be. If this goes as planned it is normally decently easy to otk on turn 3. In the end phase if simorgh is still on the field you can search nervall because he is a wing beast. When it comes back to your turn you should have a board set up in way where you should be able to get out doom eagle with no monsters in your opponents gy so it will have 4800 atk. With this you should have at least 4800+2400+1000 from the statue or a final attack from another monster. This deck did great against everything except virtual world but that was expected since they have wind special summons. I would probably take out the megaclopis for another zeus in this format. Also, harpie conductor is VERY important. She allows you to go into simorgh with kerras is need be. Overall very happy with how this deck played but I think the pure harpie version (with harpies feather storm) will end up being better. I am giong to try to keep a small zoo package in if I have room."

The strategy is simple, but requires to be aware of the levels of the monsters, as UMI reduces every water monster level by 1, so the timing and the calculation of levels to summon XYZ/Synchro is essential.  The idea is a control Deck based on summoning Legendary Fisherman 3 alongside with UMI and Sea Stealth Attack. Also playing with Bahamut Shark/Toadally Awesome and some Synchro summons according to the cards you get.  Once you get UMI, LF3, Sea Stealth Attack and Tornado Wall you can attack your opponent endlessly and making your LF3 remove that turn so your cards can't be destroyed and can't lose points because of Tornado Wall. Only weakness to this strat are returning to the hand effects.  Some example combo:  -Going second: Set Sea Stealth Attack, use UMI, then summon Codarus along Silent Angler/Tin Goldfish, activate Codarus effect to send 2 opponent's cards to the graveyard and UMI. Next Summon Bahamut Shark/ Toadally Awesome. Finally on your opponent's turn activate Sea Stealth Attack to get back UMI to the field.  -Marincess Coral Anemone: If you have UMI and Sea Stealth Attack, you can activate the effect of MCA to get back one water monster from your graveyard. Then in your opponent's turn use the effect of SSA to remove MCA, and then when she appears again, put her in a different monster zone where she can summon another monster according to her link.  -With Bahamut Shark you can summon Toadally Awesome to have a negate, Tri-Edge Levia if you want to remove a destroyed monster, or Full Armored Black Ray Lancer if you want to destroy a Magic/Trap card after destroying a monster. After that you can use Bahamut as Link material, because it can't attack the turn you used its effect to summon. Bahamut Shark is the main card of the deck, and you will always want to summon it."

","First there are several combos with this deck but you need to know the basics.  All the trap cards (except karma cut) are meant to be destroyed by Serziels effect or another and the true best field is Link 4 Abomination and Serziel equipped with either evil eye equip spell (use Gorgone is Life Points are lower than opponent) with a few xyz monsters just in case.  Combo 1: Evil eye domain/Serziel + Any unchained Spell/Trap= Use domain to get Serziel, Summon her and search for Evil Eye Selene( if lp lower than opponent use Gorgone) and equip. Set unchained Spell/Trap and if opponent has special summoned monster destroy. During standby phase destroy set spell/trap and summon Unchained soul to the field----Easy 3k damage monster that can destroy any card on field(effect) and way to destroy special summons.  Combo 2: Tour guide = One card combo here, summon tour guide and now you have a choice, either summon Basilius, link summon Gorgon and equip Evil Eye spell/ summon Basilius the same but xyz summon to get pure power 3k damage dealier/ or summon any unchained monster and link summon Soul of rage and next turn use opponents monster to link summon Soul of Anguish.  The extra link and xyz monsters add extra versatility in case you need to switch up and good hands to draw. Feel free to add you own twists to the deck, if you want to cheapen the cost the knightmare cards aren't needed and you can sub karma cut for any hand trap you feel is good.

The main Endboards are:  Seal + Dragoon + Savage  Apollousa ( 2-3) + Dragoon + Savage  This Deck is focused to compete in Meta gameplay, so I prefered a build that plays 40 cards, I ended on 41 though. You can cut 1 Noctovision Dragon if you really want to play 40 cards. Only Handtrap is Gamma, and I am playing Forbidden Droplet in the Main Deck as another go 2nd card. Feel free to switch those cards for the ones you prefer.  I really wanted to play some more going 2nd cards, but could just not find the space, so for no I'll go with these.  Saryuja can be a pretty nice extender, if you're sure your opponent does not have a handtrap. It is really nice, if you use your second search with Black Metal dragon to get the Vanilla Red-Eyes and just put it back with Saryuja later on.  &nbsp;"

I will tell you why I choose all these cards:  <strong>Main deck (40):</strong>  <strong>Monsters(17):</strong>  3x - <strong>Gren Maju Da Eiza:</strong> The main start of this deck, you get him out as a huge beatstick after Banishing your entire deck, it doesn't matter if your cards are face-down or face-up while Banish. It gets 400 x any cards banished, whether or not is your cards or your opponent's. It is a 3 star so it is easy to normal summon but it lacks protection.  3x - <strong>Necroface: Necroface:</strong> is a perfect target for <strong>Allure of Darkness </strong>and <strong>Gold Sarcophagus</strong>. Why? Because if it is banished, you and your opponent have to banish the top 5 cards from their deck. Also since you are going to be banishing a lot of cards and in order to recycle your whole deck, you can normal summon it and it turns into a huge beatstick based on how many cards being shuffled back into the deck x 100.  3x - <strong>Eater of Millions: </strong>you special summon this by banishing cards from your extra deck, or from hand/field face down and it gains x 100 for each card's banished face-down. It is also a good floodgate control to banish your opponent's problematic monsters by banishing them facedown, and the only true way for your opponent to really get rid of it is by non-target removal/effect removal, attacking it twice (losing 1 monster while they are at it), negate its effects/summoning.  3x - <strong>D.D. Scout Plane:</strong> you get this little guy banished face-up, he is basically your T<strong>reeborn Frog</strong> that comes around during the End Phase, the downside it will come back in attack position but it helps you get some short of field presence when need it and a good target to banish with <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong>.  3x - <strong>Battle Fader:</strong> you aren't playing many monsters and you might banish your key cards. It is also a good stall option that banishes itself or used as link plays if it lives.  2x - <strong>Gizmek Orochi</strong>: you can special summon this on your opponent's turn by banishing 8 cards and it banishes 1 card they control face down by banishing 3 cards from your extra deck. It can also special summon itself from the grave which is also useful.  <strong>Spells(16)</strong><strong>:</strong>  3x - <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong>: you are running a lot of dark monsters, and you don't really mind banish them. Helps with the consistency of your deck.  3x - <strong>Pot of Desires: </strong>Same reason as <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong>, it adds consistency, and your monsters benefit from cards being banished faced-down.  1x - <strong>Pot of Extravagance:</strong> Same reason as <strong>Pot of Desires </strong>but I only suggest one of, because it hinders your other draw power cards.  3x - <strong>Pot of Duality:</strong> You aren't going to be special summon that much in this deck, but getting out key cards faster is important.  1x - <strong>Upstart Goblin:</strong> makes you have a 39 card deck, and the downside isn't minimal when you can drop 8000 atk or higher <strong>Gren Maju</strong>.  1x - <strong>One Day of Peace:</strong> It is a good stall card, though it gives your opponent a +1, it is more for consistency.  1x - <strong>Called By The Grave:</strong> just get rid of Hand Traps or banishing a card from your opponent's deck.  1x - <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster:</strong> you don't have much protection from backrow, there are few decks that do run backrow so is better safe than sorry.  1x - <strong>Gold Sarcophagus</strong>: Banish your <strong>Necroface </strong>and watch your opponent cry, it is your <strong>Foolish Burial</strong>.  1x - <strong>Dimensional Fissure: </strong>This deck needs cards to be Banished and it is a perfect anti-meta card, sadly you can only run 1.  <strong>Traps (7):</strong>  1x <strong>Macro Cosmos: </strong>Same reason as <strong>Dimensional Fissure.</strong>  3x <strong>Evenly Matched: </strong>""At the end of the Battle Phase, if your opponent controls more cards than you do: You can make your opponent banish cards from their field face-down so they control the same number of cards as you do. If you control no cards, you can activate this card from your hand."" You need this for your deck, sadly if you are trying to build this deck, it is more pricy at the time writing this, it is around $23. But it might get a reprint soon. You can look up alternatives for this card, and you don't 100% need it. It is nice to have.  3x <strong>Solemn Judgment:</strong> Getting rid of problematic cards.  <strong>Extra Deck (15):</strong>  Your extra deck is pretty much filler, The only cards that are worth running for my take are <strong>Linkuriboh, Relinquished Anima, Knightmares. </strong>I have <strong>Staving Venom Fusion Dragon</strong> because I side deck <strong>Super Polymerization</strong> and <strong>Radian.</strong>  <strong>Side Deck (15):</strong>  I am still experimenting what to side so it is up to you."

Key cards: Nekroz of Areadbahair(For monster effect negation, either tribute itself, or if there's monsters in hand, use those to keep it on board), Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir(preferably summoned with 5 mats so even after summoning the 2 rituals, it still has a s/t neg), Drytron Gamma Eltanin(Main Xyz enabler, helps to set up board), Zeta aldibah and alpah thuban to search out the ritual monsters/spells, delta altais for additional draw power(beta rastaban is really for recovery purposes after the usage of one of the drytron ritual monsters, so not as important). 1 of of both drytron rituals(draconids is better for first turn, and beta rastaban can recycle the cards used by draconids back to the graveyard while getting a body on board, but as quadrantids is perfectly serviceable, as it floats into 2 of the main deck, non ritual drytons in gy upon destruction, or into mu-beta fafnir, as it's also a 2k drytron monster).  I'm using 3 of the ritual spells due to their recursion+searchability(via aldibah and the field spell). So naturally, I'm running 3 copies of drytron fafnir due to its search capability+(minor) disruption ability(level reduction), 3 copies of nova(once-per turn deck summon of a main deck, non ritual drytron monster) and 3 copies of meteor shower.  Staple cards:  Metaverse/Terraforming to search out fafnir  3 Where arf thou?/ 3 Cyber emergency to search out the main deck/non ritual drytrons(cyber can search rituals as well, but preferably use it to search the non rituals)  3 Infinite Impermiance(potential omni neg/ useful 2nd turn card)  1 called by the grave(In 2021 ocg its semi limited, so put 2 if possible)  1 Monster reborn(no need for explanations here)  (I didn't put ash, but use it if necessary).  Extra deck  3 copies of mu-beta fafnir(enables easier ritual summons/provides st neg)  3 copies of sylvan princesssprout(search+dump)  2 copies of anima and linkuriboh(monster removal+recursing attack interceptor)  1 of Knightmare pheonix,unicorn and cerberus(feel free to use other generic links)  1 copy of assembled nightingale(use as possible alternate wincon+a sticky body)  1 copy of Borrelsword Dragon(I put it in there, but feel free to use other link bosses like appolusa, saros, borreload, etc.)(I've tried Nephthys, the Sacred Flame, and while it was decent, It's actually better to leave the ritual mons on board, so use it at your own discretion.)  Overall, this deck is fairly consistent, as long as you have at least 1-2 copies of the key cards, you can easily go into fafnir with a st neg, and one of the dryton rituals(this is the worst case scenario). Weak against nibiru, as you need to spam ur main deck drytrons, and of course, ash and other handtraps, but due to the stickiness of the drytron monsters you can easily build back your board as long as you have a ritual monster in hand(or a drytron monster).  &nbsp;"

Make use of your ability to swarm the field and shut down the effects of your opponent's ace monsters when you can, and just try and have fun with it - you definitely aren't taking War Rocks anywhere competitive!
