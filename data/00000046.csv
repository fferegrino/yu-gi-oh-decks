Plus, Draw Hand can actually be used for targets for destruction such as DPE + Just a quick favorite contact material just in case if you want to save your GY material for Wake Up + Gas for card advantage.</p><p>Another thing I've changed about this deck is I've put in a couple mini combos into the deck unlike Sinon such as Evil Hero Package for Board Destruction. Another mini combo you might have noticed is Elemental Hero Gaia being the deck, this is because this is an appilicable target for Infernal Rage to target for a special summon and this can also make dealing with big boss monsters somewhat easier which is good and by taking advantage of the infernal rage effect, infernal rage wouldn't be such a waste on the field considering the fact that Favorite Contact targets in the GY/Banished as well!</p><p>Last things I've changed is removing 1 Hero Lives for 1 E call instead. This is because in my opinion, it doesn't seem very nessecary to run 3 Hero Lives since you would be putting your life points are a very low 1000 Life Points which makes you very suspectable to things like small burn damage or small battle damage. At least, when you have 2000 life points, something like Sword Soul Strategist isn't gonna end the game for you. Another reason why I put 1 E call is mainly because of bait, this can be used as bait for things like ash blossom and E call isn't a once per turn either which prob doesn't matter due to having only 1 E call in the deck anyway. Sometimes, having heros in the hand can be better than having them on the field because of things like shadow mist being an appilcable target for discard effects like Faris or Forbidden Droplet.</p><p>Overall, this is a somewhat unique take on the HERO Archtype, but this works suprisingly well in Master Duel and although the deck is slightly different in the TCG, I have no doubts that this will work just as good, or even better than the digital counterpart. Also the reason why I made this deck is because I used to be a HERO player before SinonSAO took over the Hero Archtype, so I just wanted to have this as a take. Anyway, if I ever were to restore my HERO Deck, this would be a likely profile for the reconstruction of something so great that I have lost.</p><p>Thanks for hearing me yap, watch out SinonSAO, HEROS can come back for me, maybe not today, but some day it will.</p><p>-Kingsameri</p>"

Tenpai in the OCG has strong matchups with Fire Kings, Snake-Eyes, Tear, Kashtira, and Voiceless, but it can struggle against certain tier 2 strategies, namely Labrynth, Melodius, and (especially) Runick. As far as control goes; this build is slightly less strong (due to no Lightning Storm) against Raika Traptrix but that deck is relatively untested and uncommon.&nbsp;</p><p>You can replace some of the handtraps with more engine if that is a concern. Including Golden Sarc + Blaster is another one-card starter and it can technically make going first or second simpler. I strongly dislike having to run garnets in my main deck, but Blaster himself can sometimes be an extender for the link-climb going first combo. If you want more starters, cut the Effect Veilers and run Sarc + Blaster + 1 more copy of Thrust. You can also run Santa Claws in the Veiler slots, if Kaiju are more your speed for board breaking. The interesting thing with Santa Claws is that it isn't HOTP, so you can break basically a whole board with multiple copies in hand. It's a bit of a meta call, but the Kaiju path is valid as well.</p><p>Fadora is much more important in this build of the deck; it is the core extender that allows the going 1st combos to function, but it is also a huge breakpoint for Imperm or other monster negation. It is very searchable and is a brick on its own, so we are still only running 1. There is an argument to run 2 for more consistency, but 3 copies is too many.</p><hr /><p>An issue with choosing to go first as classic Tenpai is that the deck can struggle to get rolling without Zhongdora's effect to special summon from deck. The strength of this build's extra deck is not that we will be choosing to go first in game 1, but that we can strongly go first in games 2 and 3. OTK decks like Tenpai will always have an advantage in game 1, so we just need to shore up the weakness to the side deck that classically harms going second strategies.</p><p>N.s = Normal summon</p><p>S.s = Special Summon</p><p>Unfortunately, our going first strategies are pretty limited to two card combos. Fortunately, any combination of two engine names is full combo. As many of the two card AFD lines become similar I won't list every two card combo, but there is some variance depending on your extenders.

With the pack ""Return of the King"", Red Dragon Archfiend's competitive power-ups have finally reached Masterduel! Red Dragon Archfiend has 12 one card combos, and many additional ways to two-card combo, making the deck extremely consistent - on par with other synchro strategies like Swordsoul and Mannadium. This allows the strategy to fit in A TON of non-engine cards and still be playable! As a result, this deck can confidently play through minor handtraps like Ash Blossom and Impermanence. High impact handtraps such as Nibiru and Droll can be shrugged off as well!</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/a-king-s-guide-to-red-dragon-archfiend-october-2023-366382"">If you want a more detailed guide on how to pilot this deck, please check out my earlier article on Red Dragon Archfiend from last year.&nbsp;</a></div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">GLHF Duelists!</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

When I was a kid my best friend would summon out the original BLS like he were in Duelist Kingdom, and since I couldn't read and didn't know how to really play I thought he was the coolest mf around. When I got into Duel Links a few years back I lucked into that same card + Black Luster Ritual and saw it as a sign from god.

It's still very limited but for those who enjoy playing this archetype want to see how far it can get competitively here is a decent list. You can fill this deck with more hand traps over consistency cards but I prefer the latter. I think HT are a bad mechanic in ygo but feel free to do whatever this is just how I think would be the most fun and competitive list out there. there obviously are some HT because you have to run them rn but i think inf imperm is the best one for the main deck</p>

(It’s kinda competent this time tho),"<p>I've been waiting for good Ghostrick support since the decks conception, and Konami has continued to disappoint every single time. So, I took matters into my own hands, and made this abomination. Ghostrick surprisingly has a decent bit of really powerful spells and traps, and this list takes full advantage of that by playing a crap ton of them. You only really need the 4 Ghostrick monsters, as if you know how to maneuver your cards right, (and you get hella lucky) you can sometimes just straight up run out of space on the board. One thing that could be capitalized off of is obviously the ability to make UFD, which would require you to play a level 3 engine, but I wanted to keep this as pure as possible. S:p is actually kind of a bad card in this deck, just because it clogs up your emz, but if you get it to resolve it doesn't really matter. I am very open to suggestions as to how to make this better, as I probably don't have the best ratios for this deck.</p><p>Ghostrick shot is actually crazy in this deck, as it gets you Ghostrick monsters on the board without having to waste your set, and shot late game (if you ever get there) actually gives you a way to loop allucard, which provided your board stays in tact, allows you to have an infinite Amount of searches. This leads to basically having every Ghostrick power spell/trap always at your disposal, but this is hard to do if your opponent has, you know, INTERACTION. Alot of the things you do will be on your turn, but just because of the nature of flip monsters you do a lot of your setup on the opponents turn. I highly advise just trying the deck out, you'll see how much potential it really has, and I hope people actually try and innovate on it. That's all from me, but anyway...

I have yet to go through all the support branded has gotten so some ratios/cards may change. This can be mostly built with the albaz structure deck plus a dragonmaid core (Chamber is the most expensive) and some staples. Best starting hand would be chamber + a level 8 or higher dragon and branded fusion. The normal summons of these archetypes may conflict but it has great grind game when it gets going, i'd prioritize the branded side but sometimes passing on spheres or sheou is good enough.</p>"

Example: I will be buying the new Ice Barriers when they release because Gorgeous George makes Revealer a level 10 synchro summon; I will not be buying the new Trickstars because they have no negates, and no deck can stand without negates. That's why I combo'd them with Generaiders, who have negates, and so your opponent actually gets punished for all those cards you give them. It even lets us use otherwise unused Generaiders Naglfar, to protect Lycoris, and Frodi, so your opponent can decide to draw and burn or let their monsters die unavenged. The ideal is to get Holly Angel on the field to protect Lycoris before you commit her, which is why I've maxed on Corobane and Lilybell is at 2. You need that Crimson Heart. I was just barely able to make it and draw a second lvl 9 Generaider for Vala on my last game, which saved me. The other interactions are very well-known or covered in my other Generaider deck.</p><p>I wanted to post this here so it's available for people to toy with, but mostly so I don't have to keep digging for an old screenshot of it. Have fun, and in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.</p>"

A lot of rank 4 in the game are generic, meaning that you can use ANY level 4 monster to summon them. Considering that the deck can summon a lot of Level 4 monster even without the normal summon, so, as long as an XYZ monster has a search effect, this allows the deck to make a lot of combos with various engines, like: Exosisters, Utopia, Time Thief, Centurion, Snake-Eyes, Etc...&nbsp;</li><li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Flex Spots</strong><br />Considering that the deck plays like 20/25 cards (Based on the ratio that you use), you can put anything in the deck having a low risk of bricking (Handtrap, Going Second cards, Extenders, Etc...). Obviously, if you play other engines, the flex spots will change.</li><li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>FTK</strong><br />The deck is literally made for this kind of stuff. As long as there's an Xyz monster that searches, the deck can do basically anything, like putting insane boards or even locking the opponent. The risk is the consistency of the deck, obviously reduced by the number of combo pieces in the deck, but you know the drill: High Risk, High Rewards.&nbsp;</li><li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Engine in other decks</strong><br />As I alredy mentioned when talking about <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=11132674"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/11132674.jpg"" data-card=""11132674"" data-name=""Gigantic"">Gigantic ""Champion"" Sargas</span></a>, every deck that can put 2 level 4 monster on board can play this card, but if you want, you can even play a little Springans engine in the deck, that basically make 2 level 4 monster you control becomes 2 level 4 monster AND 2 Xyz monster (Both not Number, so they can be used not only for link plays, but for F0 too). For example, a deck that use this engine is Crystal Beast.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 24pt;"">Negative Points</span></strong></p><ol><li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Handtraps</strong><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Unless you're playing a lot of extenders or ways to dodge Handtraps, like <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=65681983"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/65681983.jpg"" data-card=""65681983"" data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</span></a>, the deck is very weak against Handtraps.

This card does everything. Firstly, it's a searcher that doesn't need any setup (I'm looking at you, <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=83203672"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/83203672.jpg"" data-card=""83203672"" data-name=""Springans Branga"">Springans Branga</span></a>), that can search not only Springans, but Therion too, making <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=10604644"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/10604644.jpg"" data-card=""10604644"" data-name=""Therion"">Therion ""King"" Regulus</span></a> easier to search without using cards like <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=22423493"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/22423493.jpg"" data-card=""22423493"" data-name=""Qliphort Genius"">Qliphort Genius</span></a>.

Third, It's a way to add more material to Zeus, a card that's not only very strong, but that in Springans is much stronger, considering that you can setup an 8 materials Zeus without using 100 steps combo or some strange ways. The only reason why we don't play 3x, is because the deck doesn't need it. Trust me, if a game is so pushed that you need the third copy, it's better giving up than playing that game (Experience talk).</li><li><a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=1906812"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/1906812.jpg"" data-card=""1906812"" data-name=""Sprind the Irondash Dragon"">Sprind the Irondash Dragon</span></a>: 1x<br />I mean, you only need it to activate <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=29948294"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/29948294.jpg"" data-card=""29948294"" data-name=""Branded in High Spirits"">Branded in High Spirits</span></a> and to summmon <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=29601381"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/29601381.jpg"" data-card=""29601381"" data-name=""Springans Captain Sargas"">Springans Captain Sargas</span></a> from the deck during the End Phase.

For the supports, I think Konami said stop with the Albaz lore or, if they print something new, it will be just for Branded or some useless lore card. Never stop believing tho.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 24pt;"">Ending</span></strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">&nbsp;I hope you will try the deck and start loving it, just like me.

The deck functions as a control combo deck that generates lots of resources while also whittling down your opponent's with many interruptions. When ahead, this deck can finish off your opponent very quickly as it clears the boards with multiple destruction effects, linking away your opponent's monsters and swarming the field with several high attack monsters.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>Going first</strong>, you generally set up a 4-6 interruption board. When it is your turn again in turn 3, you can OTK with the board presence, monster removal and the many resources you have amassed.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>Going second</strong>, you weaken your opponent with handtraps and boardbreakers so you can turn the gamestate into one where you can OTK your opponent. To clear your opponent's board, you have Unchained Soul of Disaster and Anguish's linking away your opponent's board. If you have extra link material, Unchained Abomination can also destroy cards multiple times. If you cannot OTK your opponent from that position, you go for a control centered playstyle where you set up your interruption-based board and out-resource your opponent.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Here are the combos for Unchained:</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">1 CARD COMBO 6+ INTERRUPTIONS - <strong>Tour Guide of the Underworld</strong>&nbsp;=&nbsp; Unchained Soul of Rage (Link away opponent's special summoned monster -&gt; Knightmare Unicorn Shuffle) + Rakea (Destroy card to summon from deck Abominable Unchained Soul to destroy 1 card) + Escape of the Unchained (Destroy 1 Unchained and 1 card opponent controls) + D/D/D Wave High King Caesar (2 summon effect negate/destroy, detaching Sharvara sets from deck Unchained S/T)</div><ol start=""1"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_926""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Normal summon Tour Guide.

This deck has no natural answer to it, so you'll have to play around it or play safe if you think it is in your opponent's hand. However, if your opponent neglects your D/D/D Wave High King Caesar, he can negate/destroy it.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you somehow draw into Fiendish Rhino Warrior, when you summon Tourguide summon from deck Rakea instead.

Sharvara sets an Unchained S/T from deck. Use that freshly set S/T as Rakea's destroy target. This preserves your other Unchained traps like Escape and Chamber for use!</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you get Evenly Matched, you can dodge the effects easily if your standard board is set up!

After Rakea and Rage has been destroyed, banish everything leaving only D/D/D Wave High King Caesar on the field. CL1 Rakea to summon an Unchained from deck and CL2 Rage to recover from GY an Unchained card.

I would describe the Unchained strategy as a combination of Sky Striker's link-centred grindgame, Dragonlink's resillient combo, and inherent boardbreaking ability of Exosisters! The compact and consistent deck core allows for a gazillion staple cards (kind of mandatory in Masterduel), a deck style that I've enjoyed since building Spright and Live Twins.&nbsp;</div><div style=""background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Overall, Unchained is now a solid meta contender that is consistent and powerful deck that is able to carve out it's own niche in the meta due to being a combo deck that doesn't insta-lose to the likes of Droll &amp; Lockbird.&nbsp;<br /><br />Destroy, destroy and destroy all the way to the top of Masterduel's leaderboards with the Unchained dogs of war!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Master Duel 2024. The deck excels at clogging your opponent's board by locking their monsters in Face-down defence position and then attacking direction via the effect of Meizan the Battle Ninja. Yes, Ninjas do struggle against backrow decks, but with Labrynth players taking a break due to Fire Format you're less likely to run into them. Even if you do, reply 2 showcases how you can handle them even when going second. On my last point, most of the cards needed from this deck can be obtained by the structure deck meaning that you won't need to spend on any pack opening. Just get 3 structure decks and you're mostly set to jump in Master Rank and start having fun!</p>"

More tests are needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have ""Fusion Deployment"":</p><p>Be carefull because this card retrict you on fusion monsters summon from the extra deck the turn this card is activated. But even with the restriction, this card is magic in this deck cause it allows you to get quickly a ""Gate Guardian"" fusion monster on your board. if you already have your ""Labyrith Wall"" or a ""Labyrith Heavy Tank"" on the field, you have instantly a fusion monster available.

This deck doesn't really have just one specific game sequance. You can pretty much come up with your own sequence on the spot and 9 times out of 10, it is going to work out.

Masterduel's single game format renders this FTK particularly potent, since it's main weakness ""siding"" isn't possible with a best-of-1 format.

Sangan effect grab a piece of Exodia. Your opponent won't allow either Fountain or King's sarcophagus to stay on the field long so use Happi's effect to grab 2 cards and add them back to your hand. Dumatef could be at 2 vs Hapi but he allows you to draw after your opponent knocks a card out of your field. Upstart Goblin back to 3 and you can run em all at once if you have it. Imsety in hand? Pitch him &amp; 1 more, get a sarcophagus &amp; draw one. Use your Runick cards to cause a headache and then fountain to draw up to 3. All to get the 5 pieces of the Legendary Forbidden One.

The potential of this archetype is simply limitless. I have made a really consistent pure deskbot deck but this archetype works perfectly with Cyber dragons, Gizmek, Machine focused decks, Machina, and so many more. Personally I like making decks that stay true to the main archetype, but I put some cards in the side deck for anyone who wants to experiment pairing this archetype up with any other archetype (suggested: desks focused around machine type monsters). Have fun testing out this deck, because it is really fun to play and really easy to learn even over the board (and it is really cheap too so have fun everyone).</p>"

Master Duel 2024. Is that creativity dead, especially when it comes to deck building? Many Master Duel Decks have been optimised to perform best with a set list of cards and this makes the game seem a little boring. However, Decks like Cyberdark Dinomorphia Exosister still exist and showcase how efficiently decks can function when exposed to a little of that creative juice. Now, I can't take credit for this deck, but I am happy to show it to you guys nonetheless.</p>"

Pois bem, desde a vers&atilde;o anterior do deck muita coisa mudou, joguei muito com algumas caryas novas e consegui alcan&ccedil;ar algum dom&iacute;nio sobre essas cartas, e a agora voc&ecirc; deve estar dizendo ""Mas ei! Quase nenhuma carta do deck mudou, n&atilde;o tem motivo para essa lista nova!!"" &eacute; a&iacute; que tudo come&ccedil;a kkkkkkk.</p><p>Pois bem, quem vos escreve sou eu... O seu JadenBR da shopee, e vim solucionar ou piorar seus problemas com esse arqu&eacute;tipo (vulgo o melhor do mundo, apenas aceitem!), ent&atilde;o vamos ao que realmente interessa, o deck!</p><p>E j&aacute; come&ccedil;amos assim kkkkkkk cara, uma carta, literalmente uma carta fez as Solfachords pularem de um deck que talvez surpreenda, para um deck que definitivamente vai surpreender uma galera (obviamente falando de pessoas que n&atilde;o est&atilde;o jogando com o absoluto meta), e a carta que estou falando &eacute; a Materialization (todos os nomes das cartas estar&atilde;o em ingl&ecirc;s para facilitar pra voc&ecirc;s acharem elas por a&iacute;) essa carta &eacute; simplesmente absurda para as Solfachords, pois todo o plano de jogo do deck gira em torno de uma quantidade X de monstros em campo para iniciar qualquer um dos combos do deck, desde os mais b&aacute;sicos at&eacute; os mais complexos.</p><p>Mas porque Materialization &eacute; t&atilde;o forte para as garotas? Bem, essa carta faz realmente tudo o que o deck quer fazer, que &eacute; special summon f&aacute;cil e praticamente de gra&ccedil;a. Por conta do deck ser focado em penduluns, &eacute; normal iniciar com pelo menos dois penduluns na m&atilde;o, e unindo essa informa&ccedil;&atilde;o com essa carta voc&ecirc; consegue fazer normal summon de um pendulum e special summon do outro usando a Materialization. Por essa special summon extremamente simples, voc&ecirc; deve (sim, deve!!) rodar 2-3 Materializations, a carta literalmente pega todo o deck e o cola juntinho, por isso nunca use menos de 2 c&oacute;pias dela, 3 eu entendo que pode sim dar um brickzinho, mas por favor menos de 2 c&oacute;pias n&atilde;o, a carta ta baratinha, veio comum.</p><p>Outra mudan&ccedil;a importante, sa&iacute;da de um Riseheart e agora rodando 3 Fenrir, por que? N&atilde;o adianta tentar bater de frente com os decks de fogo, ent&atilde;o &eacute; melhor ir pela consist&ecirc;ncia do que pela diferen&ccedil;a, mas a Gradielle continua por que ela &eacute; boa, simples assim kkkkkkk tamb&eacute;m por que n&atilde;o tem tantas op&ccedil;&otilde;es de xyz level 7 realmente incr&iacute;veis, e xyz level 7 &eacute; o mais f&aacute;cil de fazer nesse deck, e sobre o Fenrir, na pior das ocasi&otilde;es ele &eacute; uma intera&ccedil;&atilde;o com o campo do oponente.</p><p>Outra altera&ccedil;&atilde;o importante, mais handtraps e menos traps. Por causa da Materialization facilitando o special summon dos pendulum as handtraps acabam por se tornam pe&ccedil;as de combo al&eacute;m de intera&ccedil;&otilde;es contra o oponente.</p><p>Sa&iacute;da do Avramax para a entrada da Apollousa, bem, essa mudan&ccedil;a &eacute; uma quest&atilde;o puramente de gosto, eu particularmente prefiro ter mais op&ccedil;&otilde;es defensivas do que ofensivas, e a Apollousa se encaixa muito bem nisso, al&eacute;m de ser muito boa contra decka focados em criaturas.</p><p>De mudan&ccedil;as grandes na estrutura do deck foi isso, parece pouco mas o deck passou a rodar de forma quase que totalmente diferente&nbsp; ap&oacute;s essas mudan&ccedil;as, se tornando muito mais confi&aacute;vel e consistente. O deck passou de 5-6 bricks a cada 10 m&atilde;os para 1-2 bricks a cada 10 m&atilde;os, isso sendo azarado (E olha que eu gosto de rodar deck com 45 cartas kkkkkkk ali&aacute;s, mudem isso no de voc&ecirc;s, tirem algumas handtraps e deixem o mais pr&oacute;ximo poss&iacute;vel de 40 cartas, eu rodo 45 porque sou doido mesmo kkkkkk) (Sobre brick, minha concep&ccedil;&atilde;o de brick &eacute; bem extrema, para mim brickar &eacute; n&atilde;o fazer nada, baixar tudo e passar, uma intera&ccedil;&atilde;o que seja para mim j&aacute; n&atilde;o &eacute; mais brick).</p><p>Agora vamos a algumas op&ccedil;&otilde;es para baratear k deck na medida do poss&iacute;vel (essas op&ccedil;&otilde;es v&atilde;o seguir os pre&ccedil;os dispostos no marketplace da LigaYuGiOh) come&ccedil;ando pelo Crystal Wing, o Clear Wing Synchro Dragon faz um papel bem parecido e &eacute; bem mais barato (esse tamb&eacute;m sendo op&ccedil;&atilde;o para fazer na m&atilde;o usando a Harmonizing ao inv&eacute;s do efeito da trap do Z-ARC). A parte de monstros link pode se tirar a S:P Little Knight e colocar o Knightmare Unicorn sem nenhum problema,&nbsp; a Underworld Goddess pode ser uma op&ccedil;&atilde;o excelente para a Apollousa, Borrelsword Dragon &eacute; um finisher que as pessoas esqueceram sobre mas ainda faz o trabalho dele.</p><p>Sobre os extenders como os Kashtiras, &eacute; v&aacute;lido usar a engine de Darkwurm e os gates, mas com aten&ccedil;&atilde;o para n&atilde;o travar suas zonas pendulum, pois a Gran Coolia usa um solfachord de scale &iacute;mpar para ativar seu omni negate, fiquem espertos. Sobre a Baronne e o Savage, d&aacute; para mudar eles por literalmente qualquer synchro, mas se atente a mudar tamb&eacute;m o alvo da Harmonizing para ela puxar o n&iacute;vel correto para fazer a synchro summon.

While elysium is surrounded by the ""isn't it just busted"" meme in domain format this deck is actually a culmination of alot of my time with the game. Being main comprised of shaddolls and invoked as well as some random engines I just enjoy. This deck very much encompasses me as a player.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is nice that while alot of the bosses are fusions the extra deck isn't actually that necessary for the deck to function. I am a fan of tool boxy midrange decks and generally I can lean into that. with solid engines and some really cool 1 of cards that people generally just aren't ready for (ie: ordeal of the traveler)<br /><br />Unlike wombo elysium decks this deck doesn't have the wild build a boards but it does regularly have play on each other players turns. and also unlike other elysium decks I do actually get to use the deck master even though it isn't every game.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you ever want to catch a game go check out the<a> discord!&nbsp;</a></p>"

Link climbing is insanely easy with this deck and its survivability is also great. I believe this deck list is better than one with Accesscode because its more of a pure fire list, which is necessary with the fire locks that Miragestallio and Princess put you into. Promethean Princess gets you easy access to Swarmship and Pyro, Swarmship being your going first link 4 summon for its summoning and graveyard effects that synergizes with Princess and then Pyro being your follow up for the OTK combo. Pyro's effect is also just a board wipe which is great if you can pull it off, but it can ruin the OTK if it destroys all opponents monsters as you want to attack into one to double Violet chimeras attack so it's a good thing that it is optional.</span></p>"

Enjoy!","<p>So in March 2024, the duelist pack Duelists of Brilliance came out, giving Trickstars and Tachyon some much-needed support! This Duelist Pack is meant to provide legacy support for LIGHT-based archetypes that appeared in any of the ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" anime. And you know what archetype is full of LIGHT monsters? One of YugiNoNo's favorite archetypes, Cyber Dragons!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragons basically have old man strength. They're a tad outdated nowadays and rely on other archetypes (Branded, Horus, Cyberdark, etc) and techs (Carnot the Eternal Machine, Kashtira Fenrir, Clockwork Night, etc) to do their best. Despite that, the archetype has enough offensive options to deal a lot of damage.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One engine that can help out Cyber Dragons is Superheavy Samurai. 3 Motorbike, 3 Wakaushi, 1 Big Benkei, and 1 ""Superheavy Samurai Soul"" monster, depending on the deck you're splashing it in. Cyber Dragon Core, Herz, and Nachster are all Level 4 or lower Machine monsters, so this deck uses 1 Superheavy Samurai Soulgaia Booster. With this engine, Cyber Dragons can summon Gear Gigant X and search Core, Herz, or Nachster all without using your Normal Summon yet. As an added benefit, it's easy to summon Accel Synchro Stardust Dragon and Baronne De Fleur, giving this deck another out to Nibiru.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So with that in mind, this deck uses the Superheavy Samurai archetype to either search Core/Herz/Nachster, or summon an omni-negate. On top of that, the deck has 9 hand traps, and 2 copies of Power Bond, so if you have to go 2nd, you're still capable of going on the offensive. And as for the Side Deck, you can smokescreen your opponent and turn the deck into Clockwork Cyber Dragons.&nbsp;</p>"

The usual ""Maxx C Minigame"" package is included along with the Psy-Frame package allowing for maximum chance to win the annoying but mandatory cockroach interactions. Thankfully, this deck plays really well into Maxx C and Nibiru, since it doesn't have to summon a lot per turn - it can simply activate either Boss Stage or Fountain and pass. Nibiru and Imperm are included as Crossout targets.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">43 cards are included in the deck since everything important (like Boss Stage and Fountain) is highly searchable and to reduce the chances of drawing into garnets like Psy-Frame Driver or Generaider Harr/Utgarda. Even&nbsp;if you draw into these garnets, they can be used as discard cost from hand when searching Fountain with Hugin.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">The strategy of Generaider Runick is to control/banish your opponent's resources until they surrender or deck-out. In certain situations, you can also enter the battle phase and OTK your opponent with your army of Generaider bosses/R9NK 9s when your opponent is helpless enough and they haven't surrendered yet. The ridiculous resource advantage and control options each archetype gives the duelist should win them the duel in most circumstances.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Generaiders function as a control strategy, negating and interrupting your opponent until your giant beatsticks can attack for game. Generaider combos are simple since the strategy is so straightforward and with Runick cards, you have an easily accessible level 9 body since every Runick quick-play spell is like an ""instant fusion!"" These combos may be simple, but they end on an omni-negate, ""XYZ superpoly,"" and possibly even handloops!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Here are the combo lines for Generaider:</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Vala, Seidhr of the Generaider Bosses + Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light = Boss Stage and Laevatein</div><ol style=""text-align: left;"" start=""1"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_1288""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Activate Vala's effect to summon herself by sending Mardel to the GY.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">On summon, activate Vala's on-field effect to summon a Mardel from your GY/hand.</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Mardel searches Boss Stage.

Firstly, the common scareclaw line has a point right before you make Tri-Heart where you may have two level 3s on field, you can use these to go into the biker side of the deck, or go straight to the armored xyz. Goblins can get more 3s to possibly make the armored xyz. That is the general idea of the deck, go from scareclaw to goblin biker (instantly giving your oponent a stroke), then going into the armored xyz portion and passing.&nbsp;</p><p>For non-engine I am running some bassic cards like Imperm and Ash, though I think the Ghost Belle may be a better fit than some cards. Forbidden is a nice board breaker, but evenly is very good. The only issue is that going second, you want to OTK with Tri-Heart so having to skip and do everything in main-phase 2 is a little rough. Also, if you're Light-heart is hit by Imperm, you can Droplet it to dodge.</p><p>Tech picks, rank 3 xyz monsters are good if you're tri-heart blows up somehow helps remedy your board and at least you can end on a No. 75. Fortune Tune can be a time win con? Spider is to help recover from Nib which an oponent may side into. Dharc is great because he can activate your eXceed, you can easily access him with the Light-Heart or Reichheart. Heres hoping they add a dark Goblin rider, I would be increadibly happy if the Merciless was a dark instead of a water, but o-well. You can side into the Twinsaw in heavily link heavy decks and it does not impose on the Armor Xyz trap effect. The Dogmatika Punishment, plus Rank 6 Goblin Biker is if you want to go heavier into the Goblin side of things, in whichcase you can dump the eXceeds for punishments to send the Rank 6 then use its effect to come back. If biulding the deck this way I would maybe add some of the Armored Xyz spell to capitalize off of Punishment, or maybe cut Punishment and run the Grand Bash instead since you can search it off of Big Gabonga.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a ton of small synergies in this deck so I'll list a few of them:</p><p>1) Tri-Heart has a down pointing arrow and can co-link with Pheonix to net a draw. Notably, this is not the case for Unicorn, but I am running it anyways as a card you can go into for the bounce alone.&nbsp;</p><p>2) Xyz Armor Torpedo detaches for a draw, which if you detach the scareclaw 3s may come back with an arrival.</p><p>3) You can use Sploder as a target for Visas and then go into Astraloud if you have Reichheart, which you should always try to. Sploder has a grave effet to come back too.&nbsp;</p><p>4) You can discard a Visas for Forbidden droplet and go into an Astraloud that way.&nbsp;</p><p>5) D-Barrier can only target one of these, if Xyz, just play a brickier Scareclaw and maybe Astraloud, if Link, get two threes, make a xyz and go into the armored xyz line and maybe Astraloud. Always maybe go into Astraloud, even if you don't get hit by D-barrier.</p><p>6) When special summoning the Goblins from the graveyard, if you do it in defense you can get three cards in defense real fast for your Reichheart which can get you a draw. Though this may not come up as often as generally Reichheart will be in play before the goblins.&nbsp;</p><p>7) The Full Armored attach effect can allow you to detach for a goblin's summon effect later. Though thats not the most useful, it is just another line you can use.&nbsp;</p><p>Cons:</p><p>The deck is a little more bricky than any of these pure, the Visas, armor xyz trap, multiple bikers, and multiple eXceeds can really suck to draw into. I am only running Visas cause I love Astraloud.&nbsp;</p><p>The deck falls to Nibiru, which is why we play a Link Spider, but it can still really suck even with the Link Spider.</p><p>You need multiple of the Scareclaw links so extra deck space is a little tight. I am running multiple of them for the clap back.&nbsp;</p><p>You may run out of main monster space, in general you need to be conscious about your zones, which I am not.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>End board is real elastic, peak is Tri-heart in extra monster-zone, Gabonga, Astraloud, Xyz Armor Fortress, two of the scareclaws (preferably Astra and Belone) with a Sclash or Twinsaw and a Full-Armored Xyz set. This is a deck that I will be playing more of in the future and updating. Any feedback is well appreciated.</p>"

Master Duel 2024. There are so many different deck profiles, each as fun and competent as the next. In today's video, we're trying a combination of a few of them by playing them together with Hero Kid, Melffys and Live Twins. I feel as though each of them has a place in this deck and helps it do what it does best, spamming Lv2s to the field baby! The Hero Kids allow you to make multiple Rank 2s. The Live Twins are 1-card starters. The Melffy's provide you with a negate and pseudo-grave lock. What's better is that this deck can run both Dimension Shifter and Herald of the Arc Light meaning that it also functions as a makeshift Anti-Meta deck. What's to to love?</p>"
