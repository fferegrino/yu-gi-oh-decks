Plus, Draw Hand can actually be used for targets for destruction such as DPE + Just a quick favorite contact material just in case if you want to save your GY material for Wake Up + Gas for card advantage.</p><p>Another thing I've changed about this deck is I've put in a couple mini combos into the deck unlike Sinon such as Evil Hero Package for Board Destruction. Another mini combo you might have noticed is Elemental Hero Gaia being the deck, this is because this is an appilicable target for Infernal Rage to target for a special summon and this can also make dealing with big boss monsters somewhat easier which is good and by taking advantage of the infernal rage effect, infernal rage wouldn't be such a waste on the field considering the fact that Favorite Contact targets in the GY/Banished as well!</p><p>Last things I've changed is removing 1 Hero Lives for 1 E call instead. This is because in my opinion, it doesn't seem very nessecary to run 3 Hero Lives since you would be putting your life points are a very low 1000 Life Points which makes you very suspectable to things like small burn damage or small battle damage. At least, when you have 2000 life points, something like Sword Soul Strategist isn't gonna end the game for you. Another reason why I put 1 E call is mainly because of bait, this can be used as bait for things like ash blossom and E call isn't a once per turn either which prob doesn't matter due to having only 1 E call in the deck anyway. Sometimes, having heros in the hand can be better than having them on the field because of things like shadow mist being an appilcable target for discard effects like Faris or Forbidden Droplet.</p><p>Overall, this is a somewhat unique take on the HERO Archtype, but this works suprisingly well in Master Duel and although the deck is slightly different in the TCG, I have no doubts that this will work just as good, or even better than the digital counterpart. Also the reason why I made this deck is because I used to be a HERO player before SinonSAO took over the Hero Archtype, so I just wanted to have this as a take. Anyway, if I ever were to restore my HERO Deck, this would be a likely profile for the reconstruction of something so great that I have lost.</p><p>Thanks for hearing me yap, watch out SinonSAO, HEROS can come back for me, maybe not today, but some day it will.</p><p>-Kingsameri</p>"

Tenpai in the OCG has strong matchups with Fire Kings, Snake-Eyes, Tear, Kashtira, and Voiceless, but it can struggle against certain tier 2 strategies, namely Labrynth, Melodius, and (especially) Runick. As far as control goes; this build is slightly less strong (due to no Lightning Storm) against Raika Traptrix but that deck is relatively untested and uncommon.&nbsp;</p><p>You can replace some of the handtraps with more engine if that is a concern. Including Golden Sarc + Blaster is another one-card starter and it can technically make going first or second simpler. I strongly dislike having to run garnets in my main deck, but Blaster himself can sometimes be an extender for the link-climb going first combo. If you want more starters, cut the Effect Veilers and run Sarc + Blaster + 1 more copy of Thrust. You can also run Santa Claws in the Veiler slots, if Kaiju are more your speed for board breaking. The interesting thing with Santa Claws is that it isn't HOTP, so you can break basically a whole board with multiple copies in hand. It's a bit of a meta call, but the Kaiju path is valid as well.</p><p>Fadora is much more important in this build of the deck; it is the core extender that allows the going 1st combos to function, but it is also a huge breakpoint for Imperm or other monster negation. It is very searchable and is a brick on its own, so we are still only running 1. There is an argument to run 2 for more consistency, but 3 copies is too many.</p><hr /><p>An issue with choosing to go first as classic Tenpai is that the deck can struggle to get rolling without Zhongdora's effect to special summon from deck. The strength of this build's extra deck is not that we will be choosing to go first in game 1, but that we can strongly go first in games 2 and 3. OTK decks like Tenpai will always have an advantage in game 1, so we just need to shore up the weakness to the side deck that classically harms going second strategies.</p><p>N.s = Normal summon</p><p>S.s = Special Summon</p><p>Unfortunately, our going first strategies are pretty limited to two card combos. Fortunately, any combination of two engine names is full combo. As many of the two card AFD lines become similar I won't list every two card combo, but there is some variance depending on your extenders.

With the pack ""Return of the King"", Red Dragon Archfiend's competitive power-ups have finally reached Masterduel! Red Dragon Archfiend has 12 one card combos, and many additional ways to two-card combo, making the deck extremely consistent - on par with other synchro strategies like Swordsoul and Mannadium. This allows the strategy to fit in A TON of non-engine cards and still be playable! As a result, this deck can confidently play through minor handtraps like Ash Blossom and Impermanence. High impact handtraps such as Nibiru and Droll can be shrugged off as well!</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/a-king-s-guide-to-red-dragon-archfiend-october-2023-366382"">If you want a more detailed guide on how to pilot this deck, please check out my earlier article on Red Dragon Archfiend from last year.&nbsp;</a></div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">GLHF Duelists!</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

When I was a kid my best friend would summon out the original BLS like he were in Duelist Kingdom, and since I couldn't read and didn't know how to really play I thought he was the coolest mf around. When I got into Duel Links a few years back I lucked into that same card + Black Luster Ritual and saw it as a sign from god.

It's still very limited but for those who enjoy playing this archetype want to see how far it can get competitively here is a decent list. You can fill this deck with more hand traps over consistency cards but I prefer the latter. I think HT are a bad mechanic in ygo but feel free to do whatever this is just how I think would be the most fun and competitive list out there. there obviously are some HT because you have to run them rn but i think inf imperm is the best one for the main deck</p>

(It’s kinda competent this time tho),"<p>I've been waiting for good Ghostrick support since the decks conception, and Konami has continued to disappoint every single time. So, I took matters into my own hands, and made this abomination. Ghostrick surprisingly has a decent bit of really powerful spells and traps, and this list takes full advantage of that by playing a crap ton of them. You only really need the 4 Ghostrick monsters, as if you know how to maneuver your cards right, (and you get hella lucky) you can sometimes just straight up run out of space on the board. One thing that could be capitalized off of is obviously the ability to make UFD, which would require you to play a level 3 engine, but I wanted to keep this as pure as possible. S:p is actually kind of a bad card in this deck, just because it clogs up your emz, but if you get it to resolve it doesn't really matter. I am very open to suggestions as to how to make this better, as I probably don't have the best ratios for this deck.</p><p>Ghostrick shot is actually crazy in this deck, as it gets you Ghostrick monsters on the board without having to waste your set, and shot late game (if you ever get there) actually gives you a way to loop allucard, which provided your board stays in tact, allows you to have an infinite Amount of searches. This leads to basically having every Ghostrick power spell/trap always at your disposal, but this is hard to do if your opponent has, you know, INTERACTION. Alot of the things you do will be on your turn, but just because of the nature of flip monsters you do a lot of your setup on the opponents turn. I highly advise just trying the deck out, you'll see how much potential it really has, and I hope people actually try and innovate on it. That's all from me, but anyway...

I have yet to go through all the support branded has gotten so some ratios/cards may change. This can be mostly built with the albaz structure deck plus a dragonmaid core (Chamber is the most expensive) and some staples. Best starting hand would be chamber + a level 8 or higher dragon and branded fusion. The normal summons of these archetypes may conflict but it has great grind game when it gets going, i'd prioritize the branded side but sometimes passing on spheres or sheou is good enough.</p>"

Example: I will be buying the new Ice Barriers when they release because Gorgeous George makes Revealer a level 10 synchro summon; I will not be buying the new Trickstars because they have no negates, and no deck can stand without negates. That's why I combo'd them with Generaiders, who have negates, and so your opponent actually gets punished for all those cards you give them. It even lets us use otherwise unused Generaiders Naglfar, to protect Lycoris, and Frodi, so your opponent can decide to draw and burn or let their monsters die unavenged. The ideal is to get Holly Angel on the field to protect Lycoris before you commit her, which is why I've maxed on Corobane and Lilybell is at 2. You need that Crimson Heart. I was just barely able to make it and draw a second lvl 9 Generaider for Vala on my last game, which saved me. The other interactions are very well-known or covered in my other Generaider deck.</p><p>I wanted to post this here so it's available for people to toy with, but mostly so I don't have to keep digging for an old screenshot of it. Have fun, and in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.</p>"

A lot of rank 4 in the game are generic, meaning that you can use ANY level 4 monster to summon them. Considering that the deck can summon a lot of Level 4 monster even without the normal summon, so, as long as an XYZ monster has a search effect, this allows the deck to make a lot of combos with various engines, like: Exosisters, Utopia, Time Thief, Centurion, Snake-Eyes, Etc...&nbsp;</li><li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Flex Spots</strong><br />Considering that the deck plays like 20/25 cards (Based on the ratio that you use), you can put anything in the deck having a low risk of bricking (Handtrap, Going Second cards, Extenders, Etc...). Obviously, if you play other engines, the flex spots will change.</li><li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>FTK</strong><br />The deck is literally made for this kind of stuff. As long as there's an Xyz monster that searches, the deck can do basically anything, like putting insane boards or even locking the opponent. The risk is the consistency of the deck, obviously reduced by the number of combo pieces in the deck, but you know the drill: High Risk, High Rewards.&nbsp;</li><li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Engine in other decks</strong><br />As I alredy mentioned when talking about <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=11132674"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/11132674.jpg"" data-card=""11132674"" data-name=""Gigantic"">Gigantic ""Champion"" Sargas</span></a>, every deck that can put 2 level 4 monster on board can play this card, but if you want, you can even play a little Springans engine in the deck, that basically make 2 level 4 monster you control becomes 2 level 4 monster AND 2 Xyz monster (Both not Number, so they can be used not only for link plays, but for F0 too). For example, a deck that use this engine is Crystal Beast.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 24pt;"">Negative Points</span></strong></p><ol><li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Handtraps</strong><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Unless you're playing a lot of extenders or ways to dodge Handtraps, like <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=65681983"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/65681983.jpg"" data-card=""65681983"" data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</span></a>, the deck is very weak against Handtraps.

This card does everything. Firstly, it's a searcher that doesn't need any setup (I'm looking at you, <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=83203672"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/83203672.jpg"" data-card=""83203672"" data-name=""Springans Branga"">Springans Branga</span></a>), that can search not only Springans, but Therion too, making <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=10604644"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/10604644.jpg"" data-card=""10604644"" data-name=""Therion"">Therion ""King"" Regulus</span></a> easier to search without using cards like <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=22423493"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/22423493.jpg"" data-card=""22423493"" data-name=""Qliphort Genius"">Qliphort Genius</span></a>.

Third, It's a way to add more material to Zeus, a card that's not only very strong, but that in Springans is much stronger, considering that you can setup an 8 materials Zeus without using 100 steps combo or some strange ways. The only reason why we don't play 3x, is because the deck doesn't need it. Trust me, if a game is so pushed that you need the third copy, it's better giving up than playing that game (Experience talk).</li><li><a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=1906812"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/1906812.jpg"" data-card=""1906812"" data-name=""Sprind the Irondash Dragon"">Sprind the Irondash Dragon</span></a>: 1x<br />I mean, you only need it to activate <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=29948294"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/29948294.jpg"" data-card=""29948294"" data-name=""Branded in High Spirits"">Branded in High Spirits</span></a> and to summmon <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=29601381"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/29601381.jpg"" data-card=""29601381"" data-name=""Springans Captain Sargas"">Springans Captain Sargas</span></a> from the deck during the End Phase.

For the supports, I think Konami said stop with the Albaz lore or, if they print something new, it will be just for Branded or some useless lore card. Never stop believing tho.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 24pt;"">Ending</span></strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">&nbsp;I hope you will try the deck and start loving it, just like me.

The deck functions as a control combo deck that generates lots of resources while also whittling down your opponent's with many interruptions. When ahead, this deck can finish off your opponent very quickly as it clears the boards with multiple destruction effects, linking away your opponent's monsters and swarming the field with several high attack monsters.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>Going first</strong>, you generally set up a 4-6 interruption board. When it is your turn again in turn 3, you can OTK with the board presence, monster removal and the many resources you have amassed.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>Going second</strong>, you weaken your opponent with handtraps and boardbreakers so you can turn the gamestate into one where you can OTK your opponent. To clear your opponent's board, you have Unchained Soul of Disaster and Anguish's linking away your opponent's board. If you have extra link material, Unchained Abomination can also destroy cards multiple times. If you cannot OTK your opponent from that position, you go for a control centered playstyle where you set up your interruption-based board and out-resource your opponent.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Here are the combos for Unchained:</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">1 CARD COMBO 6+ INTERRUPTIONS - <strong>Tour Guide of the Underworld</strong>&nbsp;=&nbsp; Unchained Soul of Rage (Link away opponent's special summoned monster -&gt; Knightmare Unicorn Shuffle) + Rakea (Destroy card to summon from deck Abominable Unchained Soul to destroy 1 card) + Escape of the Unchained (Destroy 1 Unchained and 1 card opponent controls) + D/D/D Wave High King Caesar (2 summon effect negate/destroy, detaching Sharvara sets from deck Unchained S/T)</div><ol start=""1"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_926""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Normal summon Tour Guide.

This deck has no natural answer to it, so you'll have to play around it or play safe if you think it is in your opponent's hand. However, if your opponent neglects your D/D/D Wave High King Caesar, he can negate/destroy it.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you somehow draw into Fiendish Rhino Warrior, when you summon Tourguide summon from deck Rakea instead.

Sharvara sets an Unchained S/T from deck. Use that freshly set S/T as Rakea's destroy target. This preserves your other Unchained traps like Escape and Chamber for use!</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you get Evenly Matched, you can dodge the effects easily if your standard board is set up!

After Rakea and Rage has been destroyed, banish everything leaving only D/D/D Wave High King Caesar on the field. CL1 Rakea to summon an Unchained from deck and CL2 Rage to recover from GY an Unchained card.

I would describe the Unchained strategy as a combination of Sky Striker's link-centred grindgame, Dragonlink's resillient combo, and inherent boardbreaking ability of Exosisters! The compact and consistent deck core allows for a gazillion staple cards (kind of mandatory in Masterduel), a deck style that I've enjoyed since building Spright and Live Twins.&nbsp;</div><div style=""background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Overall, Unchained is now a solid meta contender that is consistent and powerful deck that is able to carve out it's own niche in the meta due to being a combo deck that doesn't insta-lose to the likes of Droll &amp; Lockbird.&nbsp;<br /><br />Destroy, destroy and destroy all the way to the top of Masterduel's leaderboards with the Unchained dogs of war!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Master Duel 2024. The deck excels at clogging your opponent's board by locking their monsters in Face-down defence position and then attacking direction via the effect of Meizan the Battle Ninja. Yes, Ninjas do struggle against backrow decks, but with Labrynth players taking a break due to Fire Format you're less likely to run into them. Even if you do, reply 2 showcases how you can handle them even when going second. On my last point, most of the cards needed from this deck can be obtained by the structure deck meaning that you won't need to spend on any pack opening. Just get 3 structure decks and you're mostly set to jump in Master Rank and start having fun!</p>"
