Plus, Draw Hand can actually be used for targets for destruction such as DPE + Just a quick favorite contact material just in case if you want to save your GY material for Wake Up + Gas for card advantage.</p><p>Another thing I've changed about this deck is I've put in a couple mini combos into the deck unlike Sinon such as Evil Hero Package for Board Destruction. Another mini combo you might have noticed is Elemental Hero Gaia being the deck, this is because this is an appilicable target for Infernal Rage to target for a special summon and this can also make dealing with big boss monsters somewhat easier which is good and by taking advantage of the infernal rage effect, infernal rage wouldn't be such a waste on the field considering the fact that Favorite Contact targets in the GY/Banished as well!</p><p>Last things I've changed is removing 1 Hero Lives for 1 E call instead. This is because in my opinion, it doesn't seem very nessecary to run 3 Hero Lives since you would be putting your life points are a very low 1000 Life Points which makes you very suspectable to things like small burn damage or small battle damage. At least, when you have 2000 life points, something like Sword Soul Strategist isn't gonna end the game for you. Another reason why I put 1 E call is mainly because of bait, this can be used as bait for things like ash blossom and E call isn't a once per turn either which prob doesn't matter due to having only 1 E call in the deck anyway. Sometimes, having heros in the hand can be better than having them on the field because of things like shadow mist being an appilcable target for discard effects like Faris or Forbidden Droplet.</p><p>Overall, this is a somewhat unique take on the HERO Archtype, but this works suprisingly well in Master Duel and although the deck is slightly different in the TCG, I have no doubts that this will work just as good, or even better than the digital counterpart. Also the reason why I made this deck is because I used to be a HERO player before SinonSAO took over the Hero Archtype, so I just wanted to have this as a take. Anyway, if I ever were to restore my HERO Deck, this would be a likely profile for the reconstruction of something so great that I have lost.</p><p>Thanks for hearing me yap, watch out SinonSAO, HEROS can come back for me, maybe not today, but some day it will.</p><p>-Kingsameri</p>"
