<ol>
 	<li>Setting up the Field Spell <strong>Mystic Mine</strong> use it as your advantage and disadvantage against spammy meta opponents.(always maintain the number of your monster to gain control destroy this field spell at the right time.)</li>
 	<li>Don't just recklessly send Dragonmaid cards in the graveyard think carefully (specially the Fusion Card <strong>Dragonmaid Changeover</strong>.)</li>
 	<li>During Start and End of Battle Phase use the Dragonmaid Transformation mode(return to the hand effect) as a hand advantage it helps you a lot if you need Dragonmaid to discard or fuse.</li>
 	<li>Fusion Summon <strong>House Dragonmaid</strong> and synergize its effect by transforming or returning a Dragonmaid monster from your hand as it destroy one opponent monster on the field.</li>
 	<li>Use <strong>Dragon's Mirror</strong> Wisely to Fusion Summon <strong>Five-Headed Dragon</strong> also you can use it to summon House Dragonmaid using dragon monsters in the graveyard (<strong>BTW: </strong>You can also use the Fusion Card<strong> Dragonmaid Changeover </strong>to summon <strong>Five-Headed Dragon</strong> using dragon monster from your hand and field<strong>.</strong>WOW!)</li>
 	<li>If your feeling lucky Link Summon<strong> Link God Dragon</strong> using the 5 Elements to utilized its full effect. (you'll need it! and don't ask me where is the Dark type dragons Its already include in the deck.)</li>
 	<li>Finally don't forget to check the Side Deck it consist of cards that has synergy with the Dragonmaids and it might come in handy (I put one copy each just to give you ideas, but its up to you how much copy you needed in the Main deck.)</li>

It featured a going 1st deck with different earth-engines to stun the opponent.

I thought about some more cards, that could fit into this deck and ended up on a going 2nd strategie with some changes to the original deckbuild.
Ofc this is no competetive deck, but for Rogue matchups it works pretty well.
Here is a description of the engins and support cards:

<strong>Rock-Engine:</strong>
One good winning condition is the <strong>Block Dragon</strong>, that searches us two lvl-4 rock-monsters to go into <strong>Utopia Double</strong>. As targets i choose 3 <strong>Gigantes</strong> and one <strong>The Rock Spirit</strong>, because they can be specialed easily. <strong>Lapis</strong> is the target for <strong>Brillant Fusion</strong> and for <strong>Rescue Rabit</strong>.

<strong>Insect-Engine:</strong>
The main reason for this is <strong>Gokipole</strong>, that can search and special a normal insect monster and remove one Monster from the field without targeting or destroying. To trigger its effect, we got mill cards, i.e. <strong>Resonance Insect</strong>, wich can also search <strong>Kaijus</strong> or <strong>Doom Dozer</strong>. So we got one more removal and XYZ/Link-Material.

<strong>Combo Starter/Extender:</strong>
<strong>Mathmatician</strong> and <strong>Rescue Rabit</strong> are good normal summons that start our combos. We can enable the Insect-engine by milling <strong>Gokipole</strong>, get extenders like <strong>Dotscaper</strong> or <strong>Glow-up Bulb</strong> into the graveyard or just go into a Rank 4. <strong>Gallis</strong> is a free potential special summon and can mill more combo pieces.

Going-2nd-cards:
<strong>Pankratops</strong> and <strong>Kaijus</strong> to remove opponents monsters.

<strong>Spells:</strong>
These are combo starter/extender. <strong>Kaiju Slumber</strong> ofc is a removal and search tool and <strong>Double or Nothing</strong> is needed for winning with <strong>Utopia Double</strong>.

<strong>Extra Deck:</strong>
Can be chanced depending on the opponent or meta.
<strong>Curious</strong> is an important combo piece to mill specific cards. <strong>Saryuja</strong> can be used to draw more cards while using weak monsters for the link summon. <strong>Bagooska</strong> is a nice Going-1st card and <strong>Granite</strong> can search our Block Dragon.
You can add any Link-4 monster you want, Borrelsword works perfectly in this, but its a bit more expensive."

The card itself isn't bad, you can destroy up to two of your opponents cards in either players turn. The problem was, that playing rituals wasn't that consistent and you were out of resources if your board got broken.

With all the support that Rituals got (Pre-prep, Impcantations) it's possible, to get to your Ritual pieces easier.
Now the Lord of Red enters the field nearly every turn.

What Ritual decks usually don't use, is the <strong>Extra Deck. </strong>I thought that was a waste of potential.
Sure, the <strong>Invoked</strong>-Engine is nothing very innovative, but so we got an easy way to use our Extra Deck, just by normal summoning Aleister the Invoker.
With Aleister and the Impcantations we got the Fusion materials for Mechaba and Caliga, Lord of Red and Ash Blossom are perfect for Purgatrio.
At some time you may have to decide, whether to normal Aleister or Manju. Both cards can get one engine going on their own, so i wouldnt cut any of these.

Another Extra Deck option is the Super Polymerisation, primary to get rid of your opponents monsters. Superpoly-targets depend on the meta.

Diabolos is a nice tech card. It can be specialed when we tribute the Impcantations for the Ritual summon of Lord of Red. If an Aleister is on field, we can also use Diabolos effect to make our opponent lose one card in his hand.

In the end I got a searchheavy and consistent fun deck, that is nice for going first, as well going second.

Ratios for Impcantations and handtraps can be chanced for personal preferences. For going second BLS is a good option, because the Impcantations are Light and Dark attribute monsters.

Called by the grave secures our searchpower. Even if Aleister or the Impcantations get stopped by a handtrap, Pre-preparation or Rites is a one-card Ritual summon. Pot of Desires should be activated AFTER searching the combo pieces.

Hornet Drones gives us a one-card Link summon of Aleister the Invoker of Madness or another generic Link monster.

&nbsp;

If you got an idea how to make this deck better, please leave it down in the comments.

The goal is to force your opponent to triggert the float-effects of your Krawlers to consistently generate advantage and swarm the field with Insect-Monsters.

All your lvl-2-Krawlers let you special summon 2 other Krawlers from your Deck if they leave the field by an opponents card effect. The Link-Monsters also float by reviving two Krawlers from your Graveyard when they leave the field by nearly any reason.

Duels with Krawlers can take a long time, but if you „survive“ the first wave of your opponents card effect, you have decent chances to win the match.

The Deck is absolutely not meta relevant, but against other Fun/Rogue Decks it can be pretty solid. Many Decks struggle against float-heavy strategies and don’t have an out for it. BTW I have a high win rate against Pendulum Decks, I don’t really know why, but it works.

Best counters to this Deck are backrow-removal-cards (Twin Twister, Cosmic Cyclone,…) and graveyard-blocking (Abyss Dweller, Necrovalley,…). Also Utopia The Lightning is perfect, because he stops Krawlers activating their effects while its attack.

Here I’ll show you my Main Deck choices and give a short description. The variant shown is a pure Deck, that is not ment to be an Anti-Strategy. If you prefer palying flootgates, Superpolymerisation or anything else you can go for these cards too.

&nbsp;

3x <strong>Krawler Spine, Receptor and Glial:</strong>

These are imo the most important Krawlers. They destroy monsters, search new Krawlers and special them from your hand or graveyard. I wouldnt play less than 3 each.

&nbsp;

2x <strong>Krawler Axon, Dentrite and Deus Ex:</strong>

They are used to destroy spells/traps, mill monsters (not only Krawler!) and shut down your opponents monster effects. Deus doesn’s have the swarm effect, but is a walking skill drain for your opponents monster effects and a winning condition on its own. These three are situational, so i prefer playing only 2.

&nbsp;

1x <strong>Krawler Ranvier:</strong>

Can be good in grind game, because he let’s you recycle dead Krawlers. You don‘t want to draw him turn one, so 1 is enough

&nbsp;

2x <strong>Block Spider</strong>:

One more swarming tool. One spider specials another spider when specialed. These two could brick if you draw both or banish one with pot of desires, but imo thats fine. Usually this is a two-card Link-option. Can be sided or cut if necessary.

&nbsp;

1x <strong>Glow up Bulb:</strong>

You want to mill it with Dentrite. Swarming tool and gives you the option for Naturia Beast.

&nbsp;

<strong>Spells:</strong>

3x <strong>World Legacy in Shadow:</strong>

Let’s you swarm more insects (also enables the Block Spider) and removals your opponents attacking monsters without targeting or destroying. You don’t necessarily need terraforming, cause it’s already searchable. If you play against krawlers, try to out this card before you go into battle phase!

&nbsp;

3x <strong>World Legacy Survivor:</strong>

Basically the best card of your Deck. You reveal the Top 5 cards of your deck, add one („Krawler-“ or „World Legacy“-Card) and mill the rest. Perfect for setup your graveyard.

&nbsp;

3x <strong>Worm Bait and Scapegoat:</strong>

Token-generate-cards that can both be used for Link summoning. I prefer playing as much as possible, because they are not searchable and could be milled by Survivor or banished with Pot of Desires.

&nbsp;

1x <strong>One for one:</strong>

Enables the Block Spiders/Glow up Bulb. Could be sides/cut.

&nbsp;

2x <strong>Pot of Desires:</strong>

We play enough Krawlers and don’t have „That“ key card we could accidently banish, so it’s a free plus 1.

&nbsp;

<strong>Traps:</strong>

3x <strong>World Legacy Pawns:</strong>

You want to see this card first turn! Let’s you flip your Krawlers face up/down to activate their flip effects. You can also bait your opponent if he activates cards with removal effects. Just flip one random Krawler face up and his swarm effect will be triggered.

&nbsp;

3x <strong>World Legacy‘s Mind Melt:</strong>

Forces your opponent to removal your face-up Krawler and triggert he swarm effect. Also specials a Krawler from your Deck into a zone a Link-Monster points to.

&nbsp;

3x <strong>Lost Wind:</strong>

Effect negation, ATK-manipulator and can be recycled if you mill it with survivor.

&nbsp;

<strong>Crusadia Krawler</strong> and <strong>World Legacy - World Armor</strong> work perfectly with this deck, but they are situational and can brick. So I decided to cut them from the deck. They are still a good option, maybe instead of the block spiders.

&nbsp;

One thing to the <strong>X-Krawler Link-Monsters</strong>:

I prefer playing only one <strong>Qualiark</strong>. Its „good“ effects can nearly never be used and I like to have more space for Extra Deck options.

First turn it’s fine to go into <strong>Synapsis</strong> or <strong>Neurogos</strong>, even if they don’t point down to any Monster Zone. Important is the swarming effect, and all X-Krawler share the same. Usually you won’t be able to special more Extra deck Monsters (Linkuriboh + Synapsis is a „solid“ first turn opening) and your opponent will destroy your X-Krawler anyway.

The rest of the Extra Deck is personal preference, you can play whatever you want. Same for the Side Deck, here I show just some thoughts."

Fun and","Thunder dragon deck is one of the best deck in current format. Its pure version is specialized in fusion summoning while spewing out some generic link monster. This deck will take the pure version with different approach while maintaining the real deck consistency. While MR5 format boosts this deck playstyle, the new banlist hurts this deck consistency, so I have to put this in non-meta category.

For starter we need to get chain material (the most important, lets u fusion summon using main deck as material) and necro fusion (generic fusion trap). Chain material bypasses the ""..banish the material from gy face down.."" on necro fusion, so any material will be monster from main deck, hand, and/or gy banished face-up. It means any thunder dragon banished effect (3 monster effects if u fusion titan) will trigger during ur opponent's turn, maximizing the card advantage for thunder dragon. To do this, cards like lilith (searches both chain material and necro fusion) and trap trick (searches both, but shouldnt be used to search chain material cus it limits u to only use one trap after trap trick resolved).

The remaining main deck cards are just basic thunder dragon package cards (including aloof lupine, batteryman solar, allure of darkness, and gold sarc). Support cards like impermanence (handtrap, another trap trick target) and ash blossom (handtrap) are great to boost this deck.

Extra deck: thunder dragons, clotheep (gives free below lv4 monster after u ss fusion monster), predap anaconda (lets u use thunder dragon fusion from deck while dumping the card to gy), and linkuriboh (opens up extra zone using thunder dragonmatrix) are essential. The rest are just good generic link monster."

before we start with the written combo tutorial, if you like a visual combo demonstration you can find it at the Youtube channel "" VCY [Vendread-Combo-Ygopro]"" under the name ""3 cards combo demonstration [vendread-impcantaion-zombie]"", so without any further ado lets start with the tutorial.

So basically how the deck works is you have to ritual summon Revendread Slayer and Vendread Battlelord asap and use battlelord's effect to shutdown the hand traps and proceed to make the 4 solid interruptions, and after that ... you know what! that will take a lot of boring writings so it would be better if i show you in a video, i put it at the Youtube channel "" VCY [Vendread-Combo-Ygopro]"" under the name ""3 cards combo demonstration [vendread-impcantaion-zombie]"" as well, also if you'd LIKE  to see the deck in action vs meta, you can find it at the same Youtube channel under the name ""【YGOPRO】VENDREAD VS META + DECK LIST 2020 FT. IMPCANTATION/ZOMBIE/ヴェンデット [TCG]""

The deck is pretty consistent because it has many search effects included.

Some monsters can be summoned easier, if there is already a “Photon/Galaxy”-Monster on your side of the field. So its important to get any monster on board without using your normal summon.

For the extra Deck you can play nearly all Rank 4/8 XYZ, as well as a variety of Link Monsters. In this profile I only show my selection.

The Side Deck can be filled with backrow removal, floodgates, handtraps and other “Galaxy“-cards

Here a short description for the Main Deck cards:

Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon:

Important for Rank 8. Summoning/Effect-Condition for some other cards, especially because he got the „Photon“ and „Galaxy“ in its name. The own effect is nearly irrelevant.

&nbsp;

Galaxy Knight:

Most important normal summon and a one-card-Rank 8. Can be searched, so i advise to play only 2 copies to avoid bricky hands, playing 3 is also possible (especially when also playing Pot of Desires)

&nbsp;

Galaxy Brave:

Free special summon, requires a „Photon“-Monster in hand. Material for Rank 8 or Rank 4, also can be a good beatstick. Hard once per turn, so I only play 2.

&nbsp;

Galaxy Soldier:

Searches all „Galaxy“-Monsters. Discard the Photon Dragon for the effect of Galaxy Knight. Soldier is also an easy way to Cyber Dragon Infinity.

&nbsp;

Galaxy Wizard:

Also a normal summon. Searches any „Galaxy“-Card. Great combo extender, but normal summoning him may conflict with the Knight. You can also play 1 or 3 copies if you want to.

&nbsp;

Galaxy Cleric:

Good card for turn 2/3. Recycles cards and lets you draw 2. Can be sided out if necessary (or cut completely).

&nbsp;

Photon Vanisher:

Free Special Summon when you control any „Photon/Galaxy“-Monster. Searches the Photon Dragon and is perfect material for a Rank 4 or Link.

&nbsp;

Photon Advancer:

Also a free special summon for a rank 4 or Link, but needs a „Photon“-Monster on field. I prefer him instead of Photon Thrasher, because Trasher usually bricks after turn 1. Playing Thrasher is still an option you may consider in your build.

&nbsp;

Photon Orbital:

Most important searcher in the deck. Can search any „Galaxy/Photon“-Monster. Is also an equip for ATK boost and battle protection.

&nbsp;

Spells:

Photon Sanctuary

2 Photon-Tokens, free Solflare Dragon, no once per turn…nothing more to say

&nbsp;

Galaxy Expedition:

Summons one high-lvl Monster from your deck. Great combo extender. I advise definitely playing a playset.

&nbsp;

Galaxy Trance:

Also a great combo extender or comeback card, but needs graveyard setup and blocks you from summoning Cyber Dragon Infinity. Playing a playset is possible, but not necessary imo.

&nbsp;

Galaxy Zero:

Searchable Monster Reborn.

&nbsp;

Reinforcement of the army:

For searching Vanisher and Advancer.

&nbsp;

Monster Reborn:

Monster Reborn  ;)

&nbsp;

Called by the grave:

We got many searches and combos, so we have to protect us from handtraps. Can also be an interruption in your opponents turn.

&nbsp;

Trade In:

Draw power. We play many lvl 8. We can easy discard the Photon Dragon for Knight’s effect.

&nbsp;

Tachyon transmigration

One more negation for all your opponents effects in one chain. Needs a Galaxy-Eye Monster on our field to be activated. Can also be sided out or bumped to 3."

At locals I did just kinda okay with it, but for the Regional I wanted a much better list.

So I went ahead and bought more structure decks: This time I got cards from Order of the Spellcasters and Rokket Revolt and built this list for the upcoming regional. My final result of that regional was 69th place (out of 105-ish players) with 2 wins, 2 losses and 3 draws.

So if you're looking for a super budget Zombie Deck to build, the entire main deck can be purchased for roughly $40 and the Extra Deck only really needs Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon which you can get from the Structure Deck also.
My regional list did use a Side Deck and much larger Extra deck with the cards that I had at the time, but I barely used anything from my Extra Deck and the Side Deck is completely up to you if you want to construct one."

Today's deck features the Harpie Ladies combined with the Simorghs, both whom are Winged Beasts. The overall goal of this deck is that by the end of your turn, you'll have a field with a high-level Winged Beast such as <a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm</a><a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">, or will have </a><a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Kings"">Simorgh, Bird of Kings</a><a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Kings""> ready. Harpies play an assisting role in getting everything set up, and the Simorghs play the result.</a>

<b>COMBOS</b><strong>:</strong>

""Harpie Channeler"" + ""Harpie Perfumer"" + ""Elegant Egotist"": Summon Harpie Channeler first. Then use her effect to Special Summon Perfumer. From there, use Perfumer's effect to add Elegant Egotist (if not in your hand). Finally, use Elegant Egotist to Special Summon a Harpie Lady or Sisters (most likely Sisters). From there, you can Link Summon into Simorgh, Bird of Kings or any other Link Monster (or Utopia).

""Simorgh, Bird of Calamity"" + ""Simorgh, Bird of Bringing"" + ""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh"": (can only be done if your opponent's S&amp;T Zone is empty) Activate Elborz. Summon Calamity, then use the effect to send Bringing to the Graveyard. Activate Bringing's effect to SS itself from the Graveyard. Elborz's effect will allow you to summon another Winged Beast while you control a Winged Beast. Tribute the two to Summon Simorgh Storm or Apex.

""Wynn the Wind Medium"" + ""Simorgh, Bird of Calamity"" + ""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh""+ ""Mist Valley Apex Avian"" + ""Simorgh of Darkness"": Activate Wynn's effect from the hand and discard any WIND monster to search for Calamity. Normal Summon Calamity and use its effect to send Darkness to the Graveyard. Activate Elborz and use its 1st effect and reveal Apex. Then, use 2nd effect to tribute Calamity for Apex. Darkness's effect will trigger and will allow you to SS itself.

""Divine Wind of Mist Valley"" + ""Harpie Dancer"" + ""Harpie Perfumer"": Activate Divine Wind first. Then, Normal Summon Dancer. Use Dancer's effect to return herself to the hand and summon herself again (or another WIND Monster). Then use Divine Wind's trigger effect to SS Perfumer. Activate Perfumer to add Elegant Egotist and use it to SS Sisters. From there, you can Link Summon into Simorgh, Bird of Kings.

(more combos exist, but that is up to you to find out :)

<strong>NOTE: </strong>

To be able to thoroughly use Simorghs effectively, it is best to make sure your opponent has no Spells or Traps in their S&amp;T Zone. This can be done with Repulsion or Trunade.

Borreload Savage Dragon and Hop Ear Squadron are included in the Side Deck in case you'd like to throw a Synchro into the Deck.

I placed a 2nd Harpie Lady Sisters in the Side because of space and to avoid bricks. It can be switched with any card in the deck if you think it works best when runned on two.

If your planning on summoning the Simorgh Link Monster, its best you go first. Otherwise going first or second is fine.

One of the combos above allows you to go to Utopia (probably already mentioned). That is also up to you.

&nbsp;

Any comments or suggestions are appreciated. Thanks and Enjoy the Deck :)

&nbsp;

Monsters:

illusion apprentice nothing special, does what she does.

dark magician and rod and beat cop have a very important combo with mystic mine(need eternal soul and circle)

the goal of this deck is to go threw it as much as you can and prepare you board to 1 shot. this deck really good on first game but the other 2 will be harder since ther will side a lot of  back row counters, so you might want to side extra negates or protection.

basically at every end phase of opponent you activate soul to bring a dark magician, banish 1 of his cards idealy back rows since you need to keep his monsters on the field. then activate rods gravyard effect and target you dark magician so he sent to grave and you get rod back to search for more stuff and empty deck,

on your turn you play rod to get something  then summon the DM and banish something again if possible if not don't kill thre monsters, then link summon the 2 to make beat cop, use her effect on soul or circle, now your back to 0 monsters, rince and repeat. can do the same on your turn with navigation,  just instead use wee witch first then beat cop.

&nbsp;

i had 3 navigation but i don't use the grave effect that much since i never have DM on the field in most case.

on opponent end phase when your ready to 1 shot the guy while he has no back rown and idealy 1 moster leave your DM on the field to destroy the mystic mine with your soul. then use 1 navigation and eternal soul on your turn and banish his last monster and boom 1 shot

or lower the guys health by a lot and put red eyes and maybe place mystic mine again, his effects will go threw so any time effect is used they lose 500. black luster not that great but still usefull in some situation. since eternal soul will destroy him.

number 28 is a fun new thing i tried and seem to work well but haven't tested it much. same for ebon high,

so if i where to remove side deck cards it would be those 3 and possibly clara if you really needed something else, the rest is pretty core.

i use defense zone to remove the mystic mine on my turn and it adds a little more cover, space typhoone works too but might as well use something that helps for the same effect.

came up with this idea since at my casual most people use decks that supper poly aint that good agaist, mystic mine works agaist most."

Slow progress, with big potential.","This deck is basically made to counter annoying cards like <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Chaos%20Ancient%20Gear%20Giant"">Chaos Ancient Gear Giant</a> , <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blue-Eyes%20Chaos%20MAX%20Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a> , <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Evil%20HERO%20Malicious%20Bane"">Evil HERO Malicious Bane</a> . This deck has a actually slow proegress, you have to survive 3-8 turns, depending on your starting hand, to actually get into the fun part.

You have like 2 different main strategy stages. But before that, you actually have to get your key cards on the field or at least into the graveyard. Through cards like Armageddon Knight, Foolish Burial or especially Dark Grepher you can fill your GY with Yubel (1st form) and Diabolos, Lord of the Lair.

<strong>First stage/strategy:</strong>

You have Yubel and Lair of Darkness on your field. Your opponent can't attack you, better said shouldn't. You can crosstribute once a turn through effects of Ahrima, the wicked Warden, Diabolos or Yubel with the effect of Lair of Darkness. The effects of Lair also apply for Hand of Nephthys and you can also get rid of annoying monsters with Super Polymerisation because as long as Lair is on the field every face-up monster becomes Dark.

<strong>Caution! </strong>In your end phase you can decide in what order you can activate the effect of Yubel, Yubel - Terrorincarnation and Lair of Darkness. Done right you shouldn't worry about potential threads of the tokens (piercing damage) or a thin wall of indestructable monsters.

<strong>Second stage/strategy:</strong>

If you have Yubel - Terrorincarnation on your field, and the most annoying monster of the enemy are tributed or used as fusion materials, your next goal should be to summon at least 1 Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys. This whole loop should be self explaining and already known. Just read the effects of those 2 monsters.

<strong>Useful information:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>You should be cautios about the effect chaining, because occasionally, because of the ruling, there won't be an opportunity, to special summon the next form of Yubel. Quick example: Your opponent plays a Thunder Dragon deck. Yubel's effect activates, your opponent chains an Quick Effect discarding a monster from the hand (Thunder Dragondark) and chains the effect of <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Thunder%20Dragon%20Titan"">Thunder Dragon Titan</a>. Yubel is destroyed but that wasn't the last action in the chain - there won't be an opportunity to special summon Yubel - Terrorinc.</li>
 	<li>The hand traps should be adjusted to the enemy's deck - if you know what he is playing.</li>
 	<li>You should always have a really good and fast start if you play with customized rules (fun duels) - e.g. 6 cards in starting hand/2 per draw.</li>
 	<li>Deep Dark Trap Hole can't be used if a XYZ is summoned, because they don't have a common rank/level (it's an XYZ level).</li>
 	<li>If you have the chance or want to expand the deck with banned cards I'd recommend at least 3x Pot of Greed and Noble Charity.</li>
 	<li>This deck has currently no possibility to negate effects of face-up monsters and cards.</li>
 	<li>You can use Last Turn (banned) as a last resort, if you have one of the Yubels on the field, because as soon as the opponent attacks, Yubel is inflicting effect damage and not battle damage. Just be aware of the fact that without Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare it will most of the time and in a draw, if the opponent's life points won't hit 0. The rulings of Last Turn are long and complicated: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Last%20Turn"">Rulings of Last Turn.</a></li>

The Deck mostly revolves around stalling with Subterror Cards until you can OTK with <a data-name=""Gren Maju Da Eiza"">Gren Maju Da Eiza</a> or <a data-name=""Golden Homunculus"">Golden Homunculus</a>.

I deliberately put 48 cards in since it seems to work well as a ratio when running 3 <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>.

The <a data-name=""Golden Castle of Stromberg"">Golden Castle of Stromberg</a> Engine I run has 4 Entry Points (<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>, <a data-name=""Glife The Phantom Bird"">Glife The Phantom Bird</a>, 2x Golden Castle) and for the Cost of your Normal Summon gives you a 2800 Body and a crush in Form of <a data-name=""Hexe Trude"">Hexe Trude</a> from the Deck.

The <a data-name=""Subterror Guru"">Subterror Guru</a> Engine is reduced, but does a very good job of Stalling and can single-handedly win you the Game in a good Matchup.

I play 3 Gren Maju and additionally 2 Golden Homunculus to draw them consistently even though I banish most of my Cards. Additionally I can search Gren Maju with Gold Sarcophagus. Golden Homunculus is a good addition to Gren Maju in my oppinion. It does take one Tribute to be summoned but being almost exactly as good at OTKing as Gren Maju makes it worth it (Gren Maju reaches (8000 ATK at 20 banished Cards, Golden Homunculus reaches 8100 ATK at 22 banished Cards).

<a data-name=""Eater of Millions"">Eater of Millions</a> and <a data-name=""Gizmek Oroshi"">Gizmek Oroshi</a> consistently banish lots of cards and remove enemy monsters.

<a data-name=""Necroface"">Necroface</a> can come in clutch and win you the game with your back against the wall. I am still thinking about cutting it.

<a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> is the perfect draw spell to run in a Gren Maju Deck, nuff said.

<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> is at one because I need a lot of my Extra Deck, still the Tradeoff (Extra Deck Strength -&gt; Momentum) is often very much worth it.

<a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> is amazing at removing Enemy Monsters so I dedicated most of my Extra Deck to it for maximum removal coverage.

An effectively resolved <a data-name=""Ghost Reaper"">Ghost Reaper</a> is going to win you the Game in a lot of cases that's why i put it in.

<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> is a turbo for <a data-name=""Gizmek Orochi"">Gizmek Orochi</a>.

Have fun driving your friends up the wall. Don't be a dick."

This is achieved by having, in terms of monsters, your final board: 3 Majespecter monsters, Borrelsword Dragon, and Unchained Abomination. 90% of the time, these will be direct attacks due to the power of your Majespecter Spell/Trap cards keeping your opponent's monsters at bay. This is usually reached by turn 2 or early turn 3, but turn 1 your board will most likely be partially full of aggressive backrow.

<strong>Majespecter</strong> <strong>Supercell </strong>is your key card. It recycles 5 of your Majespecter cards from your GY into the Deck, then draws a card for you. It also protects any Majespecter cards activated on your field from being negated, this also grants protection against cards like <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> and <strong>Skill Drain</strong>, even <strong>Destiny HERO Plasma</strong>. It can also trick your opponent into using one of their negations, essentially wasting it since this card is active. The trick to using this card, <strong>chain it with a Majespecter Spell/Trap card</strong>. Your opponent will negate the first card, then the effect of Supercell will cancel it and therefore baiting out a free negate. Supercell 95% of the time will become a destruction target, though, so be careful.

<strong>Ties of the Brethren </strong>is an excellent card, as it can basically special summon 2 Majespecter monsters from your Deck. White Wing Magician is also a card target, since all of them are WIND Spellcaster-type monsters that are level 4 (except for Nekomata and Raccoon). The best way to use this is by targeting a Yata, Kybui, or Ogama.

<strong>Majesty's Pegasus is a 1 or 2 turn useful Field</strong> <strong>Spell. </strong>Most of the time, you will need to use it to special summon Bunbuku from the Deck to add another Majespecter monster. DO THIS, as you can search either a low scale or high scale monster you need to make your scale set.  Once you have at least 2 or 3 Majespecter monsters, you can easily replace this with <strong>Secret Village of the Spellcasters </strong>to lock your opponent out of using Spell cards.

<strong>All Majespecter monsters have target and destruction immunity from your opponent. </strong>Use this to your advantage! You'll NEVER have to worry about cards such as Cyber Dragon Infinity, Kozmo Dark Destroyer, etc any monster that has an effect that allows them to target or destroy your Majespecter monsters. Additionally, monsters that can negate card effects are also a careless factor, as long as you have <strong>Majespecter Supercell</strong> active!

<strong>Unchained Abomination is your boss monster.</strong> ALWAYS go into this card with <strong>I:P Maquerena</strong> and give it destruction immunity. This can be done easily by using 2 monsters to summon her, then her plus 2 others to summon Unchained Abomination. You can also even do this BEFORE pendulum summoning, as usually your opponent own't have any monsters *cough* Tornado... *cough* Tempest.. *cough* that can beat over yours. (Masquerena can also Link summon during your opponent's Main Phase, consider this if you want)

<strong>Majespecter Tempest is your searchable Solemn Strike.</strong> Use Kyubi and Ogama's effects to search/set this card to your field. This card is your FREE Solemn Strike that can be searched up to 3 times per turn (+ Nekomata's effect). Turn 1, you want at least 1 or 2 copies of this card in your backrow, which is highly possible. (If you use Ties of the Brethren on Yata or White Wing Magician, summon both Kyubi and Ogama to get these cards easily).

<strong>Be very careful of anything that changes monster type and/or attributes on the field. </strong>Majespecters HEAVILY rely on them being themselves, as all their Spell/Trap cards require a WIND Spellcaster-type monster to be tributed in order to activate. This means cards such as <strong>Zombie World, Buster Dragon, both DNA Trap cards, Lair of Darkness,</strong> etc can instantly shut down your offense. Try to use Solemn Judgement very wisely, and don't forget to use Phoenix or Unicorn from the Extra Deck to rid any problems cards should they show up.

<strong>Grave of the Super Ancient Organism </strong>is pretty much self-explanatory. It stops all level 6 or higher special summoned monsters on the field from attacking or using their effects. This card stuns many popular monsters such as <strong>Rainbow Neos, Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon, D/D/D Abyss King Ragnarok, </strong>etc. Even fully stunning decks such as <strong>Odd-Eyes, Blue-Eyes, Red-Eyes, HEROES. </strong>All Majespecter monsters are levels 4 and 3, plus your big monsters are Link monsters. Use this card once its absolutely necessary, as you still have the potential to summon <strong>Quintet Magician</strong> and wipe your opponent's board before you activate it, as it effects ALL monsters, not just your opponent's.

<strong>By turn 2 or turn 3, your board will consist of the following, and this is your IDEAL winning board:</strong>

Secret Village of the Spellcasters - 3 Majespecter monsters, Unchained Abomination, Borrelsword Dragon - Majespecter Supercell(active), 2 Majespecter Tempest, Majespecter Tornado, Majespecter Cyclone.

Your attack will be using Borrelsword Dragon's effect on a Majespecter monster, switching it to Defense position and gaining itself a second attack. For a total of 6000, finish your opponent with Unchained Abomination for the final 3000 blow.

Capable of making multi negations like Dragun of Red-Eyes or Toada","Basic combo is to summon saryuja, aim for 2 lv4s to make bahamut shark, use bahamut to summon rebarian shark, overlay rebarian shark for armored black ray lancer, summon f0 future slash, overlay it to utopic future dragon. Any extender can be used to summon predap anaconda for dragun of red-eyes and frog extenders for toadally awesome. If u didnt have extender for predap/toadally, it means ur deck is still stacked with rank-up 7th on the top thanks to rebarian shark, therefore you can summon c101 directly next turn (SHARK INTENSIFIES). With MR5 coming, the bahamut shark spam version is better than this mermail variant, so I have to put this in non-meta category.

Most of the cards are just to summon saryuja while being water and lv4.

Complimentary cards: dark magician (fusion material), vanilla red-eyes (fusion material, following the new archetype fusion ruling), red-eyes fusion (predap target), moray and salvage (for the plus), called by the grave (negates monster handtrap), abyss-scale mizuchi (negates spell, esp super poly if it's the first spell used).

Extra deck: basic combo cards. dracossak and linkuriboh are used just in case u have monster with the same name (lv7s or lv1s) so u can summon saryuja."

Very interesting and  short link combo starting from one card, with an overwhelming end result. Thanks to the fact that we only need one card we have more cards to counteract the opponent's cards.

Lucky coin deck but not only that. A decent hybrid deck made up from burn cards , floodgates and of course random effects. Joey Wheeler would be proud.

Very good Megalith deck with Cyber Angel Benten engine. Reinforced with a small “crystron needlefiber” – “glow up bulb” combo giving us extra Link 4.

Do you like Gren Maju, banish cards gain a lot LP and ATK. But you think in these times with this deck I won't win with anyone. Nothing more wrong, with a good idea you can do a lot. And this is the most beautiful in YGO new life old cards.

Be advised this deck has only 1 play if made to go first but you should NEVER GO FIRST. Only go second. If you go first summon 2 of your math mechs and go into link devotee and link disciple. Make I:P and pass, using her to make unicorn on your opponent's turn.

&nbsp;

Going Second your basic combo is to use Nabla to special summon Multiply. Then use any of your 3 free summons (Additions, Subtraction, or Sigma) and use Multiply effect on itself or Sigma. Remember Nabla and Sigma are your tuners so you need one of them and Multiply. Now synchro into Final Sigma, triggering Multiply's effect in the GY. Target Final Sigma to make it 6k and go attack. Your opponent can activate any trap or monster effect, but it won't matter because Final Sigma is unaffected. You should be able to deal over 8k damage this way. This deck uses Nibiru &amp; Kaijus to get rid of big boards and pesky monsters like bagooska or apollousa.

&nbsp;

A word of caution, this deck is VERY weak to Called by the Grave. This is why we run Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion. Ghost belle will negate Called by so Sigma can special itself, Division can resolve, and Multiply can make you win. You should be able to make the Final Sigma OTK by summon 4 or 5 so you're safe from Nibiru. Be cognizant of your normal summon; you should only be normal summoning Nabla and Multiply but try to keep either Nabla or Sigma since they're your only Tuners."

Rules: use ONLY cards from the archetypes of the cards you get. NO banned cards, if you get one you cant use it or substitute something for it. all cards MUST be able to be used (Example: if you get ""Utopia Double"" you must use ""Double or Nothing!"" and have 2 summon able level 4 monsters). you MUST have 3 of each card you get. if a card you get doesn't have an archetype you still use it. keep the deck close to 40 card.

Some cards on this list - such as Skull Meister - Don't see much play, but I think that they're just underplayed.

There's also a lot of other things you can to with this deck as example you can use </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">gemini</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> ablation to bring your </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">gemini</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> monsters faster without even using your normal summon, you can use the effect of your catalyst field to disrupt your opponent field or even burn your opponent life points out using the Red-eyes Black Flare Dragon, Archfiend Black Skull Dragon(that is why you have the Summoned skull on the deck) and Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon. There are also some cards focused on recycling your red-eyes monster from your graveyard such as Return of the red-eyes, Red-eyes spirit and some monsters like </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">TheBlak</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> Stone of Legends and the Previously mentioned Archfiend Black Skull Dragon.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}""> </span>

<span data-contrast=""auto"">Another really useful cards are the Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon and Red-Eyes Archfiend of </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Lightining</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">. The first one helps you to special summon your </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">gemini</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> monsters from your hand or graveyard while still being able to normal summon then. The later one helps you to mass destruct your opponent monsters even if they have high defense if you equip it with bBlack Metal Dragon or Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword, that can be brought to the field using The Claw of </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Hermos</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> and any other monster on the deck.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}""> </span>

Beyound all that you still have Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon that is a great card for this deck and the only reason you want to have Dark Magician on this deck to be able to summon it using your Red-Eyes Fusion."

Jack A' Booran and Yuki-musume help tie the Zombie World stuff and the Mayakashi stuff together so that it all works out better than you'd expect. Uni-Zombies provide an alternative normal summon to Hajun when you brick as it can potentially help you get a Mayakashi ladder going depending on your opening, or it can allow you to rush for Balerdroch. Thanks to the new Mayakashi link-4 the deck has solid control properties that combined with Balerdroch and Gravity Collapse make for a strong going-first deck (when you don't brick) that can also easily go second and do some unga bunga zombie caveman beatdown. The deck gets absolutely eaten alive by handtraps and disruption in general, so 3 Called By the Grave are mandatory. I opted to include 4 revival traps as they play nicely with the Mayakashi synchros to use their revival effects as quick-effects, but the Buddy Forces are only my personal preference and could very easily be replaced with Ash Blossoms or something else if so desired. Return of the Zombies also makes for solid removal with Zombie World up, and its general utility and re-usability makes it a staple card IMO. The side deck is basically just all staples, really run whatever you want. You could also alternatively play 3x Give and Take in place of Gravity Collapse as they both accomplish similar goals of preventing any fun, but Gravity Collapse is generally more potent.

&nbsp;

Overall the deck is decently versatile and a lot of fun to play (although admittedly it's kinda annoying in YGOpro because of Dakki). Somewhat weak consistency and a limited extra deck hold back the deck a tad, but Mayakashis have more than enough tools to deal with a wide variety of situations."

Okay so how this works is
<ul>
 	<li>You find a way to activate appropriate when your opponent draws a card not during their draw phase</li>
 	<li>You just spam cards that allow your opponent to draw cards while you draw 2 cards depending on how many appropriate trap cards are active</li>
 	<li>And then you win.. Simple as that</li>
</ul>
<strong>However</strong>

Getting Appropriate in your hand on your first turn is a rather slim chance of 3/40 so you make the calculation. And activating it is another tough task so how can you speed things up?

<strong>You stall</strong>

Mystic Mine is your best friend when it comes to this deck as many duelists out there focus more on monster effects rather than destroying traps and spells

Mystic Mine is pretty much the child of Swords of Revealing Light and Skill Drain and it takes this one card to completely shut down your opponent

<strong>There are two ways to activate Appropriate in this deck,you either</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Wait for your opponent to activate a spell or trap and negate it with Dark Bribe</li>
 	<li>Force your opponent to draw two cards using either cup of ace(Pray for it to land on tails) or Gift of greed</li>
</ul>
and after that you are free to activate other draw cards like Dark World Dealings and Hand Destruction to draw out your entire deck

<strong>Word of Advice</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>I usually use 2 appropriates on the field to draw out cards on a much faster rate. Using three of them is overkill as two appropriates is more than enough</li>
 	<li>Becareful when using a deck like this because you will run into duels where instead of winning by the effects of Exodia, You deck out yourself on accident by the on going effect of appropriate to draw 2 cards.</li>
 	<li>But in all honesty, I just love the sight of drawing so many cards in a single turn so I sometime use 3 of them at the same time occasionally</li>
</ul>
<strong>In conclusion</strong>

The deck is pretty fun to play with as I usually play it for casual duels when I am not into serious mode. I know there are other more efficient Exodia decks out there but drawing cards until you have about 30 cards in your hand is pretty funny to me.  The deck is not easy to set up but hey...who said life was easy anyway?
