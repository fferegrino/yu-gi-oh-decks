","<p><strong>Hello fellow duelists.</strong></p><p>I have been testing out Danger Darkworld ever since the structure deck dropped, and I am pleased to say it is one of my favorite combo decks of the current format. If you like gambling, ripping cards from your opponents hand, decks that require skill to play optimally and insane end boards then this deck might be the one for you.&nbsp;</p><p><img class=""article-img-floatnone"" src=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbtfe4xlQu1rie4kjo1_640.png"" alt="""" width=""250"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><strong>Some quick tips:</strong></p><hr /><p>- Always go first</p><p>- Turbo Dugares and Coach King Giantrainer, protect them with an early Grapha fusion if possible</p><p>- If you are against Tear going second, scoop game one before they can mill you and get info on your deck, and go first in game 2, or else you're going to suffer the Abyss Dweller fate</p><p>- Do not activate the second effect of Mothman against Tearlament, ever</p><p>- Side in Neko Mane King going second against Tear, it's funny (trust me bro)</p><p>- Learn what is good Discard fodder and what is not (Genta, for example, is not, so you want it out of your hand immediately via activating its effect OR normal summoning it after its effect is used up)</p><p>- Search for archives with Snoww if you need extra draw power, fusion pieces if you want protection and hand loop pieces if you're already set up (""set up"" meaning you've used Dugares, Coach King and Saryuja so you have 9+ cards in hand)</p><p>- Three easy side slots for going second are 2 Ceruli and 1 Sillva (because why try and hand loop if your opponent has no cards in hand?) The next three you can side out are 1 Mothman, 1 Grapha and 1 Accession</p><p>- Once you get faster with the deck, you can change Volcanic Scattershot with Infinite Impermanence in the side deck for better chances going second</p><p>- If your opponent is smart enough to play Droll &amp; Lock Bird, side in the 1 Called by the Grave and pray</p><p>- Set your fusion spell after using it, it is a piece of your end board. If&nbsp; your opponent uses Dark Ruler No More on you, you can use it to make your negate + hand loop live again (and if you have another Grapha in hand you even get a pop, so 2 interruptions PLUS a hand loop for two despite being DRNMd)</p><hr /><p>If you have any questions or want more help playing the deck, I am happy to be of service. I managed to come second place at my locals with this deck and lost out on first to Tearlament, so it should serve you well on a relatively low budget too if you take the time to learn it. Thanks for reading and/or looking at my deck profile.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

For one, the Invoked package allows you to bait out interruptions and handtraps before you do your Prediction Princess plays. Secondly, Mechaba being a Level 9 monster allows you to get more advantage off of&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> than previously in this Deck since it allows you to practically search out&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> which is such an integral card to your plays.</span></p><p><span>3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Tarotrei</strong> has a Quick Effect to flip a monster face-up or face-down and it can Summon a Flip monster from hand or GY during the End Phase. She facilitates&nbsp;<strong>Tarotreith</strong> who Summons a Flip monster from Deck face-down on flip and has a Quick Effect to flip any number of monsters you control face-up or face-down. 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. If there is a Flip monster you want the most in rotation in this Deck, this is the one. She adds a Prediction Princess monster and any Ritual Spell from your Deck on flip and she also provides targeting and destruction protection for your Ritual Monsters. But most importantly, she Summons herself back face-down after being Tributed which allows her to be flipped face-up by&nbsp;<strong>Tarotrei</strong> to be used as a searcher in your starting combo. 3&nbsp;<strong>Aleister the Invoker</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> and 2&nbsp;<strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>. We are playing 2 of each for Ritual fodder and as targets for&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's field after being flipped and when it is destroyed (such as during the End Phase after being Summoned by&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>), it searches a Level 9 monster which is usually either&nbsp;<strong>Tarotrei&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Tarotreith</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> is either&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Greed</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Giant Trunade</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Raigeki</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>The Forceful Sentry </strong>on flip. It is good for removal or clearing boards and the drawing and shuffling back is good for building back advantage or preventing your opponent from gaining advantage. 3<strong> Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</strong> for extra searching for your Ritual-related cards. 1 <strong>Spirit of the Fall Wind</strong> as an extra searcher for your Flip Monsters.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For Spell/Traps, we have 2&nbsp;<strong>Invocation</strong>, 3 <strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong>, 1 <strong>Terraforming</strong>, 3 <strong>Magical Meltdown</strong>, 1 <strong>Called by the Grave</strong>. 3 <strong>World Legacy's Monstrosity</strong> which can Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from your Deck with a different type and attribute than a Level 9 monster you control. In a more pure version of Prediction Princess, you would target&nbsp;<strong>Tarotrei</strong> to Summon&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> to get Flip monsters into rotation and have material for a Rank 9. But because&nbsp;<strong>Bibliomuse</strong> is to important to your combo, you can do the Invoked line first to get an&nbsp;<strong>Invoked Mechaba</strong> under 5 Summons. This gives you a (monster) negate for handtraps like Nibiru or Ash which are killer against the Prediction Princess half of your Deck and because&nbsp;<strong>Mechaba</strong> is a Level 9 Light Machine, it gives you access to any 2 Level 9 monsters in your Deck off of&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which includes&nbsp;<strong>Bibliomuse</strong>. This now gives you more access to <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> for your Prediction Princess plays more so than in a pure build of the Deck. Finally, we are playing 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong>. We are only playing&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> for the sake of making our Deck more consistent with&nbsp;<strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong>.</span></p><p><span>Extra Deck:&nbsp;2&nbsp;<strong>Invoked Mechaba</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Invoked Purgatrio</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> which is a target for&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator.&nbsp;</strong>2&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> which sends a monster from your Extra Deck to the GY, and more importantly, it can detach any number of materials to attach the same amount of monsters in your GY to it. This allows you to get the Flip monsters used for its Summon into the GY for&nbsp;<strong>Tarotrei</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. A unique kind of removal/disruption, but really good. 2&nbsp;<strong>Phantom Fortress Enterblathnir</strong> if you want to start playing hand control later on into a game with <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>. 2 <strong>Nine-Lives Cat</strong> which can reborn a Level 9 from your GY or a monster from your opponent's GY. And of course, the 1&nbsp;<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj&nbsp;</strong>and 1 <strong>Secure Gardna</strong> for your Invoked plays.</span></p><p><span>Side Deck:&nbsp;3 Kaijus, I am playing&nbsp;<strong>Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju</strong> since it is a Level 9 monster. 2&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Spirit of the Fall Wind</strong> which you can side in if you want to go more heavy on the Prediction Princess side of your Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong>. And 3&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong>.</span></p>"

Sadly the locals I go to does not have the remaining&nbsp;cards I need to complete the previous deck list. After doing some testing I ended up replacing 1 imperm and the 3 lubelion with 3 ghost ogre and 1 ernus. In testing the hards were still able to get to Sheou or Seal.&nbsp;</p><h3>Edit 1:</h3><p>I was able to buy a Lubelion and an Imperm from my local card shop so I decided to drop Erunus and A Ghost Ogre from the main. Played against Live-Twins, Sprite (post ban list) and Despia. I went 1-3 which was a welcome improvement from the previous games. I might side out ghost ogre over dark ruler. Currently I am very happy with the deck!</p><h3>Edit 2:</h3><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>After playing locals this week, I decided to make a couple of adjustments. I went 2-2 tonight so an improvement overall. I lost against Swordsoul and Kashtira. The major changes are to the side deck, losing both Droll and the PSY gamma as Floo was not played as much anymore. Droll is still a good card to prevent special summons, but for right now I wanted to put a good front against Kashtira. I added Nib and Book of Eclipse, as well as an Appointer in order to get favorable going second matchups. Another change is removing Ghost Ogre entirely as currently it is not the best handtrap. I added the new Bystial but I might change that later as drawing a full hand of Bystials on going first is not the best. I am going to be looking into getting more draw potential with the deck. I will play around with using Kitchen Dragonmaid, as she can be a good card to save a dead hand. If your looking to build this deck or play it, let me know through comments!&nbsp;</span></p>"

This deck is also suprisingly good at procking scythe (yes that one). While I haven't included it in this list, you can simply swap out a hand trap or a copy of fluffal wings for a scythe and then any extra deck monster for dagda. The nature of toy vendor, wings, and penguin also provide for some very funny moments where you draw or mill exactly what you need. End boards vary a lot with you often bringing out a toad and a 3-4 material apollousa. A scythe in hand can then be used to summon out a whale for a non taget pop, or a tiger for a 2+ targeted pop.Sacred tree beast, Hyperyton is simply here as a negate if you manage to bring out 2 crule whales on your turn (it happens more often than you'd think).

An almost playable Tindangle deck that doesn't floodgate your opponent into oblivion (but can side into that).&nbsp;</p><p>Wait did I say doesn't floodgate, I mean doesn't use unbased floodgates, but rather based floodgates instead.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is your win condition number 1: Tindangle Acute Cerberus. It's a terrible card, but trust me if the stars line up, its a 3k monster that can be equipped with Gergonne's End and therefore become untargettable and indestructible. Also if you use Dholes to summon it, it can attack 3 times :D.</p><p>How likely is this to come up?&nbsp;</p><p>Well you don't see Nagel's Protection doubling battle damage in this deck, so I think you can assume this is not going to happen very often. And I have no clue how to make it happen often without more support or floodgating your opponent until they're a geriatric from how long they are sitting in the chair you have forced them into. At least without some new Tindangle support.&nbsp;</p><p>So I'm sure you're asking now. Now what? The main boss don't appear often and you can't make the great wall of indestructible DEF position monsters Nagel's Protection can create for funsies.&nbsp;</p><p>Well.. uhh....</p><p>If you can't Link your way to victory, then how about HEROES? I mean all of these are Dark Monsters, Dholes, Delaunuy and Toddler like being discarded... so throw in Mask Change 2, and you have DARK LAW...</p><p>which is a start i suppose...</p><p>Put hear this! If you draw Penguin Squire and a Level 6, 5 or 3, which if you haven't noticed are a bit abundant in this deck, you can make a SYNCHRO PLAY!!!</p><p>WHAT? SYNCHROS IN MY LINK DECK?&nbsp;</p><p>Well... Yeah, Penguin Brave is a 6 that lets you set Penguin Soldier from deck, and gives you a 2 Bounce Interupption, that also happens to protect your face-down monsters passively, while the Level 10 Icejade Synchro is just big, and does things... i think...</p><p>Uh...&nbsp;</p><p>HEY WHAT ABOUT XYZ's?? Crimson Ninja is a 5 that will always survive a regular battle, so you can turn it into Zeus. But wait a second! If your opponent happens to have a monster with less than 2000 attack, Doom Chimera Dragon can get itself AN EXTRA MATERIAL, SO WHEN IT BECOMES ZEUS, YOU GET 2 ACTIVATIONS.&nbsp;</p><p>DEAR LORD THE POWER!!!</p><p>...</p><p>Yeah, there's no other way to hype this deck up, but I'm sure it can win against something in a based way... though honestly dude, I think you're better off just adding in floodgates and Nagel's Protection and just making the Imperial Wall of indestructible idiots than whatever this is.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Overall strategy is still the same: Pot of Desires and Gizmek Orochi to banish as many cards as you can to power up Gren Maju Da Eiza in order to win by brute force. Only Danger! monsters are the Level 8 and Level 3 versions. The Level 8 ones make it extremely easy to XYZ summon one of the strong XYZ monsters, while Links are used for support with the high number of Special Summons that Gizmek and Danger!s can perform. Plenty of hand traps, making it a more defensive Gren Maju deck, giving you opportunity to stall/block an opponent's setup while working on banishing. Spells are split between trading out resources and blocking opposing plays to increase the amount of time you have to set up Gren Maju. Fusions are easy to summon with Super Poly, and Links are mostly there for extra support. Winged Dragon? Honestly, that's just a surprise pick if you decide to run Sphere Mode.</p>"

This Card can't be destroyed by Battle and you receive no Battle Damage from it. In addition it forces every Monster to attack you if possible. If an Attack is declared from the opponent or from you, you can place a Hallucination Counter on one of the opponents Monsters. This will negate any effects that Monster has.&nbsp;</p><p>With that explained here's the win Condition: Mosquito can activate it's 2nd effect to Deal Damage to the opponent equal to the ATK of one Monster with a Hallucination Counter whenever a attack is declared from any Player. Every strong OTK Board will fall into this Tricky Monsters trap resulting in easy reverse OTK wins. It's a truly fascinating card.

Then activate Dancing Leaves to Tribute the opponents ""Ninja"" Monster and Special any 1 other Ninja Monster from Deck, also triggering Iron Diggers 3rd effect to recycle the earlier Banished monster to the Hand or Special it Face Down to the field.

The Hidden Village can recycle cards like Baku but sadly he cannot use his effect then. Minor Archetype issues but issues nontheless.&nbsp;</p><p>Then again Mosquito and Meizen can really turn the tables quite often so do your best to keep them around. This kind of Ninja Strategy is very unknown and can easily surprise the opponent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Extinguishing the Fire and saving the Village</strong></p><p>Ninjas exist since the dawn of Yugioh (27.05.1999 OCG Armed Ninja), but only now over 20 Years Later they became a well rounded Strategy. Since they use the Face Down Defense Position a lot they can play around quite a bit of Removal, Negation and Floodgate effects. It's up to the player to decide which Tool to use and when's the right moment to do so. Having access to so many different Combo lines within one Deck is truly fascinating.&nbsp;</p><p>If you decide to pick Ninjas up, expect a Control oriented Strategy which can achieve easy OTKs and has a lot of Tools at their disposal. In addition you will notice how almost every card in the Archetype will generate Card Advantage which makes this Strategy an endless Pool of Ressources.

There are definitely more upgrades to be made but money is delaying that process. The deck performs well but likely could only compete against other decks that aren't quite meta-level but contain some meta-level cards. It might perform well in a small local tournament or something but it depends. It's <em>very</em>&nbsp;combo-heavy and a hand trap or interruption can really ruin your turn, especially if timed well.</p><p>Regardless, this deck is a lot of fun and one of my favorite decks that I've played with -- partially because I think vampires are cool and partially because it's actually a fun playstyle. When playing casually with friends, I take out the hand traps (a ""house-rule"" amongst us) and it still performs well, typically winning more than it loses.</p>"

""Why have things turned out this way?"" He thought. He was so sad and lonely. Ojama yellow had left him and ran off with Ojama green, they had started a new life together without him, leaving him with nothing but the trees and his budgy smugglers. The last he heard they had a house and some kids and ran around in striped pajamas all day. He clenched his fist and stared at the ground ""Why was I not enough?"" He said. He continued his walk along a long winding path that led to nowhere, sneezing out another snot bubble. He was finding a secure branch that would support his weight when suddenly, a bright light appeared in front of him and a figure came forth to stand there. A beautiful woman? No, not a woman...an ANGEL, he gasped.... She leaned in toward him and calmly took the rope from his hands. ""The world is in great peril, Ojama black. As we speak duelists are flooding the edge of our forest. They mean to cause us harm"". Ojama black was confused. He had only ever seen a duelist once and they sent him to the graveyard. ""What does this have to do with me?"" He asked. He sounded quite selfish. Her face darkened and her third eye glared into his soul. ""You need to understand. Your life will be no more if the duelists take over. You, Ojama yellow and Ojama green along with all the other monsters of the forest"" she said. He stared blankly at her, then the realization slowly started to set in. Ojama blacks palms became sweaty and his mouth felt dry. ""Ojama yellow will be no more?"" He choked. Tears started at the edges of his eyes and he could feel himself shaking, then, after a brief moment his expression changed. He looked serious and turned to face the figure in front of him ""What do I need to do?"". She lifted one majestic arm and gestured to the trees. ""We are harnessing the power of great beings, the likes of which you have never seen, by combining our strength in fusion. Without you and your fellow Ojama's our hope of success is non-existent. Find your family, Ojama black. Find them and come to me."" She lowered her arm and turned away before Ojama black could respond. Then another bright light flashed and she was gone. Ojama black stood for a moment and stared at the place the angel had been standing. A moment ago he was ready to end it all but now he felt different. ""I must save them!"" He said loudly to the forest and with that he picked up some moss and shoved it up his nose to staunch the endless flow of liquid. Then he set off in one direction to find his family and begin the fight for his people. The end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

And here the Miscellaneousaurus limitation does not become a lock for you to make excellent plays while you have follow up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Improvements this deck has for an exclusive Dinosaur engine:</p><p>1 - Many combinations of starting hands that have more than one move, that is, you don't depend on resolving an effect to be able to play like your normal summon or Miscellaneosaurus.</p><p>2 - Recovery of moves much higher than before, Dinosaur cards are not very good at generating follow up to redo the field again without having access to Miscellaneousaurus or some way to destroy a Babycerasaurus. Now you have the Ogdoadic which itself always cycles every turn and also Aleirtt, the Ogdoadic Dark returns Miscellaneousaurus to the GY.</p><p>3 - More ways to break the field with the engine of Scrap Raptor and Ogdoadic. Now there are many powerful cards that you can access in different ways like Evilswarm Exciton Knight, Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star and Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder.</p><p>4 - The Extra deck continues to follow the pattern of cards that work well for the Dinosaur deck, such as LINK-2 and XYZ RANK-4 monsters, but with many more ways to access them and enhance the combos.</p><p>5 - There are so many details in this version of the deck that compared to the basic version of a Dinosaur deck here you discover moves every new game, it is a very creative deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Now the best thing is to learn in practice:</p><p>I work with reality because you need to make safer game development where you analyze Risk vs Reward. I don't do combos that are pretty to look at but that in practice lose to hand traps or are too exaggerated with a lot of negates that you don't need like the ones they use (Apollousa + Borreload Savage + Evolzar Lambda):</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- The Dinosaur engine has always had a play theme around the Babycerasaurus card with many combinations of standard 2 card combos landing on the same end board;</p><p>- The Scrap Raptor engine amplifies what is already good in the deck's basic plays to access the Extra Deck with more game volume.</p><p>- These are the basic combos involving only these Dinosaur Scrap engines;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46457912</p><p>Archosaur + Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(remember Archosaur + Baby = Oviraptor + Babycerasaurus = Miscellaneousaurus + Baby = Oviraptor + Miscellaneousaurus - just have a little details in the start but the end board is the same)</p><p>Tyranno + Dolkka + Omega + Spright Elf + Petiteranodon</p><p>In any of these combos you will get the following cards: Oviraptor + Baby + Scrap Raptor + Archosaur (or Linkuriboh in the case of the Archosaur + Baby combo) + Double Evolution Pill in the Hand</p><p>or</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46458231</p><p>The difference here is that you don't play around hand trap doing Evolzar Dolkka early, but do it only in the middle of the combo and that way you end up having one more monster on the field which means being able to do one more XYZ like Abyss Dweller. A risky but very strong move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46458427</p><p>Lost World + Oviraptor</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46458731</p><p>Lost World + Scrap Raptor</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46458957</p><p>Scrap Raptor + Miscellaneosaurus</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These were just examples of what the Dinosaur Scrap engine is capable of doing on its own. Now let's apply the Ogdoadic engine as well.</p><p>Here you can choose to play safe and make King of the Feral Imps to add Nauya to your hand because he is the best starter of the Ogdoadic engine.</p><p>Finally, on the gameplay of why the deck is interesting: Turn 1 you usually spend with what Dinosaur Scrap does best which is Tyranno + Evolzar Dolkka + Spright Elf and what Ogdoadic does best which is a XYZ RANK-8.</p><p>What makes this deck oppressor are the follow ups, on the next turn you have the you can have (Chaos Ruler in the GY - se a carta sair da banlist LOL) that along with the Ogdoadic engine threatens Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star, you also easily threaten to do Exciton Knight, there's Miscellaneousaurus + Giant Rex that threaten Tyranno / Pankratops + XYZ RANK-4 which is giant in the grind game.&nbsp;</p><p>So you generate so much advantage in GY that it's no use your opponent breaking your field, he'll have to OTK because otherwise your turn is scary. This is not the new secret deck that destroys the meta but I believe it is the best way to still play Dino besides being fun and requiring considerable skill because it is not linear, each combo I present can be done differently depending on from gamestate, there are times when you can connect de uma forma que voc&ecirc; nunca pensou antes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMBOS INVOLVING CHAOS RULER AND BORRELOAD SAVAGE (when I used the card):</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46459669</p><p>Miscellaneousaurus + Babycerasaurus</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-33376148</p><p>This combo was not done in a didactic way but it already shows the potential of the deck's moves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-33380488</p><p>Snake Rain + Discard + Scrap Raptor = I:P Masquerena + Bagooska /in GY: Chaos Ruler + all the Ogdoadic names /in Hand: Search of Chaos Ruler</p><p>(The first time I had summoned from Aron because of the autopilot but you must summon from Nauya to access Bagooska)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMPLETE ENGINE BASIC COMBO:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46459967</p><p>END BOARD: Tyranno + Dolkka + Spright Elf + Petiteranodon + Number 38</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-33348273</p><p>Basic Combo version showing that you can easily play with just 1 Scrap Raptor, you don't need to use the second copy to make the combo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-33373914</p><p>In this combo, you just need to transform the Scrap Wyvern + Linkuriboh at the end into the Spright Elf and the result will be the same.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-33374185</p><p>This version of the Combo I made just to demonstrate the synergy that exists between Tyranno + Scrap Wyvern when he destroys the Scrap Chimera by using its effect:</p><p>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno is not just Book of Eclipse but a pop without targeting additionally because you destroy Scrap Chimera and Scrap Wyvern's eff trigger to give summon from Scrap Raptor that we still have in the deck to pop a card without targeting, that way you don' t need to use Tyranno's effect so early in the combo)</p><p>This is just so you can see that there is this synergy between these cards on the end board, but of course the most efficient thing is to transform the Wyvern + Chimera into the Spright Elf, which makes practically the same point of bringing Pankratopos in this case to destroy cards on the field, but here Pankratops is more efficient since you don't need to use the pop effect as soon as you use Tyranno's effect, here you can wait but this possibility is very important thing to remember between Tyranno + Scrap Wyvern.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>INDIVIDUAL PLAYS DURING THE GAME IMPORTANT TO SEE:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46460512</p><p>BLIND SECOND PLAY: Oviraptor + Miscellaneosaurus</p><p>(It's not hard to make Exciton Knight with the Ogdoadic engine too)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-34766275</p><p>Let's assume a grind game situation that happens with Lost World + Oviraptor</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-33374781</p><p>Lost World + Babycerasaurus Blind Second = FULL COMBO</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-33337033</p><p>Archosaur + Giant Rex (any Dino Lv4) = RANK-8</p><p>This combo is good to remember the detail that Archosaur can add Nauya or Nunu to the hand when destroying a Level 4 Dinosaur which means that in cases where you already have a Double Evolution Pill in your hand you can make this move to access the Ogdoadic engine without needing the King of the Feral Imp. This is important to remember in hands that don't come as strong to increase the number of possible moves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-33364312</p><p>Oviraptor + Double Evolution Pill = Tyranno + RANK-8 (Number 38) /in GY: Miscellaneousaurus + 4 Ogdoadic names</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-33379559</a></p><p>Oviraptor + Babycerasaurus + Nunu</p><p>This combo is good for you to see that when you want to avoid losing right away in the normal summon you can first Special Summon Nunu so in case of interaction you can do King of the Feral Imps and still have moves to do on the turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46461244</p><p>Scrap Raptor + Miscellaneousaurus = Version with the Ogdoadic Cards = Tyranno + Number 38 + Spright Elf /in GY: Petiteranodon and Miscellaneousaurus</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-33379559</p><p>Oviraptor + Baby + Nunu Combo with the Borreload Savage (when I used the card)</p><p>This combo is a demonstration that you can play around hand traps on Normal Summon by first choosing to resolve Nunu to come and if Oviraptor is negated on Normal Summon at least you can King of the Feral Imps and continue having some move to perform.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>*If instead of Nunu it was: Oviraptor + Baby + Nauya you would combo normally and if you were interrupted in the Normal Summon just do the combo that I show you next.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-33335815</p><p>Nauya + any Monster = RANK-8 /in GY: 4 more important of the Ogdoadic names</p><p>This is good if for example you give Normal Summon Ovirapor and the opponent negates it to extend moves and pass with something that guarantees you to survive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-33335402</p><p>Nunu + any Level4 Monster = I:P Masquerena + Aron, the Ogdoadic King</p><p>(at the time I used the Ogdoadic LV8 Aron but the idea behind it is the same)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Scrap Raptor = XYZ RANK-4 (Bagooska) or XYZ RANK-8 or Scrap Wyvern + Scrap Raptor (with 1 pop on the way without targeting)</p><p>Just so you know that Scrap Raptor itself can be an interrupt in many different ways like through a RANK-4 like Evilswarm Exciton Knight or Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star or Scrap Wyvern pop + Knightmare Unicorn</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-33336243</p><p>Snake Rain + Discard = I:P Masquerena + Aron, the Ogdoadic King</p><p>(at the time I used the Ogdoadic LV8 Aron but the idea behind it is the same)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46461541</p><p>Snake Rain + Discard + any Level4 Monster = I:P Masquerena + Bagooska</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46461795</p><p>Snake Rain + Discard + Oviraptor = I:P Masquerena + Tyranno + Linkuriboh /in Hand: Water Lily /in GY: Miscellaneousaurus</p><p>First: Archosaur add Double Evolution Pill and make Linkuriboh + I:P Masquerena</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46462298</p><p>Lost World + Oviraptor + Keurse = Tyranno + Abyss Dweller + Number 38 /Access to all 4 Ogdoadic Names and Miscellaneousaurus in GY</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>or</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46462132</p><p>Oviraptor + Baby + Aleirtt = Tyranno + Dolkka + Number 38 /in Hand: Water Lily /Access to 3 Ogdoadic Names and Miscellaneousaurus in GY</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do you do if you draw one of the bricks(Keurse or Aleirtt)?

At last, with Icejade Aegirine Rahn's release, my favourite deck is now finally playable.<br /><br />The deck's really simple, your playstyle will depend on your starting hand. We have 2 playstyles:&nbsp;</p><p><br />- <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=3355732"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/3355732.jpg"" data-card=""3355732"" data-name=""Icejade Kosmochlor"">Icejade Kosmochlor</span></a> + <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=83670388"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/83670388.jpg"" data-card=""83670388"" data-name=""Icejade Curse"">Icejade Curse</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;lock. You'll need 3 cards in order to set up that lock, the 2 cards mentionned before as well as our field spell. This lock makes it so that your opponent is unable to activate the effects of monsters on the field and with a 3000 defense body + the field spell's attack reduction, getting out of that lock is pretty tough. The pretty neat thing about that combo is that it doesn't even require a normal summon and you'll be able to go into other combos depending on how good your starting hand is. You usually wanna go for this combo whenever you're able to since it's such a pain in the butt for the opponent to deal with.</p><p>- Synchro out whichever lvl 10 you prefer. This playstyle is a lot more straightforward and will be much more used than the previous one considering how easy it is to pull off. There are multiple ways of doing it depending on your starting hand.

It's pretty much just a board wipe against non-water decks since Coral Anemone locks you into water monsters, making it so that Zealantis can only summon back water monsters. Go for it if your opponent has a card that's somehow both untargettable and indestructible or if you just want to see them suffer as their monsters are all banished.&nbsp;</p><p>That's pretty much it, I told you the deck was simple. If you're lucky enough, you could both pull off the lock AND get a lvl 10 synchro out! *sigh* It's a pretty fun deck to play, borderline rogue tier *inhales copium*. You'll be able to beat meta decks with a good enough starting hand. Overall, become a viable deck thanks to Aegirine Rahn so you should give it a try!&nbsp;</p>"

You can argue the Shaddoll Names you play, but they can be recycled and adjusted to your fitting.</p><p>The Dogmatika Package is quite good for setting up schism and getting a monster negation. The Incredible Ecclecia is there for just straight up lore, as well as its decent recovery and fusions interuption. As well as for any synchro and xyz plays, as it can special summon itself if your opponent controls a monster, though remove at your preference, if you want, add another nadir.</p><p>Scherin is Good for rank 4 xyz , you can make time thief redoer to fuse when you don't have other options. As well as, being able to send off of fusions spells for increased field prensce. Using other Tear names ends up sending your spells and such, so I feel running only 3 of Scherin to be a nice compromise</p><p>The Branded Fusion package is quite standard in any dark/light fusion build, as it allows for quite easy fusing on either turn. 3 Fusions , 2 Albazs is fine.</p><p>For the rest, you can customise your hand traps(and board breakers) to how you see fit, I'm too much of a ""budget"" player to spend for the bystials (except for Bystial Baldrake as it seems decent and cheap). Though, I would recomend having 1 light handtrap, for any fusing you do on your turn, and which you didn't draw in your starting hand.</p><p>For the Extra deck; 2 Apkhalone is decent, you send one off Nadir, and have one to use. You can also recycle it back with Scherin(if you dont banish it, but if you do , lubellion), 2 Construct, though this can be replaced with another winda if you want. For the Albaz fusions, you only really need 1 lubellion, as you can recycle back with scherin if needed, it can recycle itself back, and even if you can't , you should be able to attempt game with your remaing albion , after sending one. Titanclad is there for more Dogmatika synergy, but you can replace it with Gururua , as that is a more meta card, I just didn't want to buy it for its price. Gravity controller is there for the Shaddoll Fusions, remember , you can use any non-fusions after Branded Fusion OR any of the albaz fusions THAT FUSE.</p><p>The side again, can be customised to suit your tastes. I have Abyss Dweller in the Side and not main, due to not wanting to have other fusions, but you may feel that substituting it for the 2nd construct more to your liking. I wanted to also, make the deck TRAP SHADDOLLS, after the 1st game, in case of ANTI-SPELL and such, I also personally have a soft spot for the trap variant, as that was my first meta deck. I went 3 wins and 1 draw against Tear at locals with and adjusted version of this, mainly having sinister shadow games and paleozoic dinomiscus in the main, but I think changing them for handtraps&amp;Board Breakers is probably better.</p><p>My Channel dosen't have any clips with Nadir yet, as I literally recieved the cards before locals, so I only have replays with the Non-Nadir Variant, though this can showcase some of what the deck can do.</p>"

By using Abyss actor extras and placing curtain raiser, or by using dramatic story with liberty dramatist or sassy rookie, you can set up a rather powerful board. It shouldn't be very difficult to get an end board with a set opening ceremony (by either adding it to your hand or setting it off of abysstainment), the link 2 (without using the field spell effect), and a pendulum summoned monster. The key to remember is to set wild hope in your spell/trap zone with the link 1, then with the link 2 set Madona. Do NOT mix these two up. Also remember that your monsters archetype lock you, so it's best to wait for the following turn to try for an Xyz or Link play. It can be tricky to get the deck down, but I'm sure you'll all figure it out with enough practice. Board breakers in the side in the event your opponent is far too strong for a direct approach.</p>"

But the idea is that the deck plays like swordsoul, but uses the resonator/RDA engine to blow up the field. I feel like a lot of swordsoul decks tend to just be Tenyi Swordsoul, so this is my attempt at making something different - even if it doesn't perform as optimally as very good counterpart lol. I just want to be able to show some love to my favorite YGO monster :)<br /><br />I also think you could probably play the deck more heavy on the Resonator/RDA side if you want; and it'd probably make that portion of the deck much more consistent since the SwoSo cards can really take off on their own. (In this iteration I'd probably have Mo Ye be the only SwoSo monster at 3; and add Chaos Mirage Dragon w/some other wyrm chaos monsters? Tbh if playing chaos then Bystials definitely have a spot as well in the deck).</p>"

I would also consider changing the number of the Hex-Sealed Fusions. I like playing 3 dark because you can then send it with Branded Fusion, or you can use a Tearlament name to do both a Lubellion summon and a Tear summon. It's also debatable whether you play Despia, Theater of the Branded, but to be completely honest I just like having an extra target off Aluber other than Fusion and Lost. Tragedy is debatable at 3, but I don't have an argument either way so you can make that decision on your own. I also know that plenty of Tear decks played Mudragon and Garura, but honestly I didn't know how to play Tear optimally at its peak, so that's a decision others can make for themselves if they decide to pick this up. I should probably run handtraps in the deck, but I frankly don't care enough right now.&nbsp;</p><p>The Extra Deck is very debatable, I don't quite know just what you want to be playing in there, but I just picked what I thought might be good.

The synergy is pretty decent as you can do some funny plays(mentioned below) and no one really expects someone to be playing P.U.N.K with Swordsoul. There definitely are some things that could be changed with this list:</p><p>1. Playing another Jam Drive; its a great extender and definitely would be better to have more than one in grind games where I only see P.U.N.K names. Although in testing it seemed that it was more common to see more Swordsoul names (due to P.U.N.K cards searching each other and thinning the deck), so the second baxia came in clutch. If I end up playing more P.U.N.K names, definitely this will be a must.</p><p>2. More level 7 maindeck monsters; definitely the deck could be a little more fun if kashtrias were mixed in, I tried using more tenyi names but in the end, they usually would just be bricks. Doing something like a Fenrir and then summoning a level 3 P.U.N.K card allowed me to get barrone out faster for nub protection.</p><p>3. Playing more P.U.N.K names; although the deck would be more consistent in P.U.N.K combos if more names where played (like another foxytune or a madame spider), I didn't want the deck to be mostly P.U.N.K as I wanted to make sure Swordsoul combos were more consistent.Also playing another field spell would also be good, but I kept bricking with it in testing.</p><p>Deck Strengths:</p><p>1. You can do a full P.U.N.K combo without normal summoning (emergency tele). This leaves the normal summon open for cards like Mo ye that let you extend into swordsoul combos.</p><p>2. You can make an amazing dragon with Chixao and Sharakusai, this means you can use jam drive to go into psychic end.</p><p>3. The Tenyis are level 7, so you could summon vishuda and use emergency teleport to quickly make a barone.</p><p>4.The typical end board is; Barone + Psychic End + Chixiao/final sigma (with a normal hand).&nbsp; If you are able to draw the right mix of swordsoul names and P.U.N.K names (which is a lot easier than it seems due to ogre dance, foxytune, emergence, and pot of d), the end board is; Barone + Psychic End + Chixao + Sharakusai (lets you get into amazing dragon) + Gabu (searchable imperm).</p><p>Deck Weaknesses:</p><p>1. It's not good if you only draw into only P.U.N.K&nbsp; because it usually means your going to thin most of your extenders (like jam drive). You can still put up a decent board (a tower or a Sharakusai + level 8).&nbsp;</p><p>2. Unless you see emergency teleport, it usally means you can't get the optimal endboard unless you have the proper cards to search your P.U.N.K extenders.</p><p>3. The deck can die to nib, which means you usually want to try to make barone as soon as possible, none of the P.U.N.K cards (in main deck) have effects on summon, which means your opponent can nib you before you can resolve something like a ze amin.</p>"

But now that Tearlaments get nerfed it's more helpful playing mid game so the core cards are a bit limited. Searchable using Seedlings</p><p>- Naturia is for going first, able to withstand a lot of handtraps and able to spam during opponents turn.&nbsp;</p><p>- Dweller will become a lot weaker after the banlist.</p><p>- Rafflesia is really easy now to summon and gd's trap hole is for Nibiru (possibly the best counter to Madolche)</p><p>- Dark Ruler is for Swordsoul and many other full board control deck, comboing with Tiaramisu for wiping the board.</p><p>- Droll is so much better after the banlist so it's really helpful putting 3 in the side deck.</p><p>- Ash should only be played second so into the Side Deck</p><p>- Now that trap decks are much stronger it's always better to play Antjaw than Vein because it's level 2, going for barkion will completely destroy your opponent, whereas bamboo and vein are coounterparts for go first and second when facing spell deck such as runick or Pendulum respectively.</p><p>- Baronne de Fleur is also an option replacing Rafflesia or 106.&nbsp;</p><p>- Update: With Ancient Fairy eing released there're much more option firing a Madolche 1 card combo with either Angelly or Peting without normal summoning</p>"

The cores in question are (you guessed it) Eldlich control and Mayakashi. The rest of the deck is built on a zombie synchro/control engine (so obviously its geared more toward Mayakashi) but the eldlich part is consistent enough that it will mess with your opponents head when you pull it out.</p><p>The Eldlich core is 15 cards:</p><p>1x eldlich, 1x samurai skull, 2x cursed eldland, 1x zombie world, 1x called by, 3x conquistador, 2x Huaquero, 3x eldlixir, and 1x necro dragon (extra deck)</p><p>Very basic eldlich play and you don't need to use the extra deck very much so I almost added dogmatika punishment to the list (maybe an idea for the future), but it gets the job done. Looking at the eldlich side ins and whats different from how this deck plays the mayakashi side ins, we add an extra eldlich to up his consistency without compromising the spell/trap ratio as well as running an extra samurai skull to balance discard power after removing yuki musume and also an extra zombie world to up the consistency of the zombie world/rivalry of warlords lock. Finally we side out a tengu and replace him with zombie necro dragon because you may need that extra beat stick power and its one of the few synchros we can still make under these circumstances.</p><p>The mayakashi core is everything in the side deck</p><p>Its just normal Mayakashi play: search Dakki as fast as possible and climb the latter, end on Yuki-Onna (link 4), Gashadokuro, Dakki, and then hopefully a copy of the trap or maybe even a zombie world/rivalry lock. For a more in depth explanation of how basic mayakashi is played, most other mayakashi deck profiles will have an answer for you</p><p>Finally, lets talk about the engine:</p><p>The engine can be divided into 3 main parts: generic zombie stuff, negate, and anti-brick</p><p>The negate is exactly what you think it is; Ash blossom, Ghost mourner (or whatever other zombie hand trap you want to run there), and mazera</p><p>The anti brick is eldlich, bolan, and arguably samurai skull. Eldlich will discard spells and traps so you don't brick, bolan (by far the best anti brick in the deck) will discard excess monsters so that you can get at least one or two blockers on the field, and sam skull can put something in the grave, wether that be eldlich, balerdroch, spectralsword, or (my personal favorites), necroworld banshee or glow up bloom. Off bloom you can get an eldlich, balerdroch, or bolan to hand and off banshee you get a zombie world on field, but keep in mind you've already used your normal summon on samurai skull.</p><p>The zombie world stuff is everything else I haven't talked about yet: a couple tuners, some grave special summon from mezuki, rivalry, and also fun trap removal.</p><p>This deck IS NOT EASY by any means, but if you practice and learn how the cards interact, and start to understand how combos flow together, you can outplay pretty much any deck (even Kashtira and Tear, I know because I've done it myself). This deck is hard but rewarding, and bricks are few and far between.</p><p>Happy dueling</p><p>-Ornge</p>"

Next turn (the opponents turn) you can make Askaan (the level 8 synchro) with arianpos and shif. If you had a zepp (the red one) in grave you can banish it with arianpos and have it come back to make the deep beyond (the level 10 synchro) for a board clear, but that's highly unlikely. thats the basic combo in a nutshell.</p><p>Now to explain the rest of the cards in the deck:</p><p>Supay duskwalker special summons a supay from deck, which makes you a level 6 synchro (all without a normal summon mind you)</p><p>sniopsis is run at one pretty much only to (A) keep you from bricking and (B) banish a ton to power up the deep beyond</p><p>If you banish anything you get ixeep for free (who when banished can cycle a ghoti spell/trap away from banished). You can see why that's good</p><p>White stingray is an anti brick level 4 special summon in a deck that uses level 2 tuners to make level 6 synchros</p><p>if you have minairuka, it will be on the field by the end of the turn and it threatens negate</p><p>we're on 3 shifter 1 crow for hand traps because our bosses do a lot of the negating and removal</p><p>in terms of spell traps we're on ghoti stuff as well as some good one of's&nbsp;</p><p>Time to talk about weird combos:</p><p>If it looks like you bricked chances are you drew one of two hands: duskwalker, minstrel, a ghoti tuner, another monster, and one rando, OR beautunaful princess and 4 randos. Fortunately for you, those are some of the best hands in the deck.</p><p>in the duskwalker hand you need to special duskwalker and the supay from deck (in defense), normal the ghoti tuner, discard deep sea minstrel and banish whatever monster you want from opponent (they'll get it back later so it doesn't matter). Go into deep sea prima donna using the ghot tuner and duskwalker and activate its effect to unbanish the minstrel target and special a beautunaful princess (DO NOT ACTIVATE IT'S EFFECT) from deck to go into the level 8 ghoti.</p><p>From Beautunaful Princess, go into buzzsaw shark, activate its effect targeting itself and special out either a stingray if you think you can bring it back to the field later or a leaffish if you don't and make bahamut shark. detach the stingray or leafish and go into toadally awesome. Keep in mind you are locked into xyz for the rest of your turn though.</p><p>I think that's everything from the main deck? Time for extra deck!</p><p>We're on two of every ghoti except the spear because it sucks.</p><p>bahamut shark and toadally awesome for that combo.</p><p>Prima donna for her combo.</p><p>brionac might be a good option specifically going second in a hand where you'll have like exactly leaffish left in hand</p><p>White aura whale is a faster board clear if you'd rather get that then a level 8 ghoti</p><p>the adamancipator</p><p>the icejade is there if you'd rather a negate then a board clear</p><p>the swordsoul is there because it works absurdly well as the equivalent of accescode in a link deck</p><p>thats about it, happy dueling</p><p>-ornge</p>"

Well I recommend buying the SD and thus I shall show ya all a potential build. Keep in mind that the deck has the potential to top a local. I shall proceed by explaining some of my choices.</p><p>1. Dimension Shifter: I'm pretty sure this guy won't see that much use after the bloodbath banlist and thanks to the fact that he helps Kashtira. Nevertheless keep in mind that Tears aren't entirely dead and they will pretty much be an engine now for other decks (including Kashtira). Apart from that, I consider shifter pretty strong versus most of decks that's why I choose not to drop him (although he could be dropped for sth like Ash)</p><p>2. Small number of Traptrix main deck monsters: Guys you really don't want to see a hand that contains much Traptrix names so it's probably better to keep their numbers low. However, I could maybe accept running one more copy of Dionea.</p><p>3. Dimensional Barrier: I firmly believe that Kashtira and possibly Branded are this new format's best decks. Dimensional Barrier is probably really effective against their respective strategies. Apart from that I consider the card effective versus all those Mikanko variants that popped out of nowhere as well as Purrely and the fan favourite Swordsoul strategies</p><p>4. Evenly Matched: I believe nobody has a say against Evenly's strength. Instead people will ask why it is main-decked. Well it's just another going 2nd strategy ('cause you won't always win the dice roll) and a fodder for Holetaea when going 1st (if you don't have access to Dionea SS recover a Trap hole)</p><p>That's it for this profile. I hope it helps you enough. As always I'm open to suggestions (especially since I'm in search for a budget alternative to Prosperity) and, any ideas and comments are welcome.</p>"

When Qardan enters the TCG with PHHY, you can use him to set his permanent traps from Grave, and when he goes into Grave, use M7 to bring him back to your hand. In this Built, you play alot of good Traps and Boarder to control the Game. A lot of the deck can be changed like the extra deck or the traps in the main, but that's how I topped in the local. Have fun!</p>"

Currently settled on bringing this to future events for competitive testing but still debating on moving things around in the extra for more utiltity. Would be interested to see how triple tasking with triple tact would perform as well in place of the hand traps but don't have that kind of money lol.

Definitley a fun deck revolving around recylcing your resources and synchro summoning on your opponent's turn via Zep,Shif and Paces. Boss monster (Ghoti of the deep beyond) is actually quite powerful sometimes by banishing the field , but problem is some meta decks will actually benefit from that .&nbsp; This is just a ""blueprint"" I made with the ghoti's I had lying around and some staples that were an extra , or were bought , so You are definitley able and are recommended to alter it a bit to your own preference . Hope you enjoy the deck!&nbsp;</p>"
