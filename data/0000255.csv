Archfiend Guy here, bringing you all the Archfiend deck that I reached Platinum level with in Master Duel! If you are interested in an in-depth video of the deck, which breaks down the deck profile and related combos, then you can watch my <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/Y2cssS_jO_8"">deck profile video</a>  <strong>Deck style:</strong> Beatdown (Mid Range)  <strong>Important Concepts:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Potential vs True monster count</strong> <ul>  	<li>Archfiends float 1 or 2 at a time rather than spam multiple monsters. Because of this, your <strong>true</strong> monster count (what your opponent sees on your side of the field) is <em>not reflective</em> of your <strong>potential</strong> monster count (the number of monsters you have the potential to summon on any given turn). This makes it hard for your opponent to identify when they can push for game, as the <strong>number of monsters you can summon can be anywhere from 2 to 10+!</strong> Accesscode Talker usually cannot break through an Archfiend defence and it's important to tell you this before anything else as it is the main mechanic of Archfiends.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>Description:</strong> The main focus of Archfiends is to summon high attack monsters to beat over your opponent's monsters to win the game. They have the unique gimmick of being able to <strong>attack during your opponent's turn</strong> by using Dark Spirit of Banishment. Due to their high attack power, they usually have enough strength to attack over most monsters in the game. Additionally, Archfiends float very well thanks to their boss monster, Archfiend Empress. This monster, upon destruction, can summon any level 6 or high fiend from your GY to your side of the field. This effect is not once per turn! This means you can revive Archfiends multiple times in a single turn, so long as you keep reviving Archfiend Empress, which is easy to do with the Dark Spirit monsters, and Call of the Archfiend.  Archfiends also have access to Berserk Dragon, a 3500 ATK level 8 Zombie that can attack every monster your opponent controls! Its summoning Quickplay spell card, A Deal with Dark Ruler, is an Archfiend card, so is searchable through Archfiend Heiress. Thanks to Archfiend Emperor's ability and our link monster, Masterking Archfiend, Berserk Dragon is live often and has great OTK potential.  Archfiends also have the fusion monster, Archfiend's Manifestation, which is a 3k beater that can float into Summoned Skull.  Archfiends don't activate many effects on the field. Instead, they revive from the GY through the Dark Spirit monsters activating in the hand, or via Call of the Archfiend. They are mainly big beatsticks that build tall, not wide. This means that you tend to only have around 1 or 2 monsters on the field at any given time, and because of this, you can run powerful floodgates such as Skill Drain, Gozen match, Summon Limit and Mystic Mine.  Generally, you want to grind out the game and win through attrition, similar to Unchained. Once your opponent has exhausted their resources trying to break through your wall of Archfiends, you can safely attack for game. Conversely, you can also OTK using Berserk Dragon or the Numeron Dragon OTK.  <strong>The ""goto"" strategy every game:</strong> Your priorities should be focused on putting at least two level 8 fiends into the GY, one of which being Archfiend Empress, and putting both Dark Spirit of Banishment and Dark Spirit of Malice into your hand. Once you have this setup established, you can efficiently float through several means of destruction. Furthermore, once your Archfiends die through a card effect, your Dark Spirits will recycle themselves back into your hand, which allows you to float consistently every turn. An ideal game state is to have both Dark Spirits in hand, with Cherubini on the field alongside Archfiend's Manifestation and Archfiend Empress. Cherubini protects both from destruction and Archfiend Empress can also protect Manifestation by banishing dark monsters from the GY. <table> <thead> <tr> <td><strong>Potential Combos</strong></td> <td></td> </tr> </thead>  <tr> <td>Tour Guide and Scarm in hand</td> <td>Summon Tour Guide and Special Summon Fiendish Rhino Warrior from the deck.

Don't take the lists too seriously, it's just a skeleton. As a paleozoic frog player I think that one of the biggest problem of the deck is that we can't always end our board with <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>. <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> is a strong card that gives us an omni-negate that could stop strong combo piecies of the opponent or just protects our board or more importantly here our backrow. Cards like <a data-name=""Absolute King Back Jack"">Absolute King Back Jack</a> and <a data-name=""Rise to Full Height"">Rise to Full Height</a> already help a lot against s/t removals, but we aren't always be able to recover. I think that <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> could help the deck offering the same <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>'s protection. The key card behind this idea is <a data-name=""Hop Ear Squadron"">Hop Ear Squadron</a>. It can special summon itself from hand targeting a monster on our field during the opponent main phase and after that synchro summoning using it an the targeted monster. The plan is to put on board a paleozoic trap monster(really easy to do in the paleo rise/mill build) then during your opponent main phase summon  <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a>. <a data-name=""Melffy Catty"">Melffy Catty</a> is here in order to search <a data-name=""Hop Ear Squadron"">Hop Ear Squadron</a> and it's also a level 2 body for xyz summons. As I said earlier, this is only a list to show the idea or the deck. In the side I put some techs I'll test. I think I'll cut the frog engine. Put suggestions in the comments and stay tuned for next updated builds!"

Prepared for possible future fusion event on Master Duel and some HOPIUM for Konami to add th,"Hello everyone. For the possible future fusion event for Master Duel I created this deck focused on summoning a blue-eyes fusion every single game, in hope of Konami adding the missing fusions for the blue-eyes archetype and <a data-name=""Ultimate Fusion"">Ultimate Fusion</a> which are not available in Master Duel at the time of uploading this deck. The strategy is simple but you are going to face options and choices that depend mostly on your preferences and your opponent's deck so my advice would be to test it against different decks if possible before expecting to win or summoning a fusion with 3 <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a> every game. Usually, you would like to choose between these two monsters to summon depending on your field and your opponent's potential plays: <a data-name=""Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"">Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon</a>."

Thus Megalith is a privileged deck because it ""steals"" the Ritual Mechanics as it doesn't follow the standard for Ritual Summoning. At most, what managed to surpass this deck was <strong>Drytron</strong> that ""steals"" in the mechanics when Ritual Summoning using the monsters' ATK and not the level. It should be clear that Megalith is by no means one of the hardest decks to learn in the game at the level of a D/D/D for example. People say this because it's true that no one who plays versus Megalith knows what you're doing but overall the deck is not beginner friendly but very welcome for those who like creativity in Yugioh!  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ////<strong>Understanding Megalith Archetype Cards</strong>:  In general, Level 8 Archetype monsters <strong>Ritual Summon a ""MEGALITH"" Monster</strong> from your hand when <strong>discarding itself</strong> from the hand to the GY and <a data-name=""Megalith Aratron"">Megalith Aratron</a> has a Quick eff of Ritual Summoning which allows you to use it on your opponent turn to make moves.

An important detail is that all Megalith monsters can only use their <strong>Ritual Summon effect Once per Turn</strong>, however all <strong>Level 4</strong> monsters have the effect of when they are <strong>Ritual Summoned NOT HARD ONCE PER TURN</strong>, so if you manage to do 3 Ritual Summon from <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a>, <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> or <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> on the same turn they will activate their advantage effect every time, which makes them a bit broken and allows for a lot of different combos. And finally, along with all this, we have <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a>, which is a Quick-Play spell that, like Megalith Phul, Ritual Summons ""MEGALITH"" Monsters <strong>DIRECT FROM THE DECK</strong>, only here you must <strong>tribute a monster(s) with DOUBLE Level</strong> of the Megalith you are going to bring from the deck, so if you Tribute a Level8 monster you bring any Level4 Megalith and by Tributing any Level4 monster you bring <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> to the field, and if that wasn't enough Ritual Summon from the DECK to Megalith Unformed It is <strong>NOT Hard Once Per Turn</strong> and can be used multiple times in the same turn increasing the deck's power significantly.  The deck has <strong>incredible Recovery</strong> thanks to the <strong>Impcantation engine</strong> and the engine's own cards like <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a>, <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a>. High number of Starters and consistency cards and great interactions with the opponent and finally it is extremely budget. That's why you <strong>don't need to maximize Ophiel and Hagith</strong>, which is common for people to do, because their main role in turn 1 is to access Megalith Phul and then thanks to the engine's excellent Recovery you can always get them back to hand and do Ritual Summon every turn to gain advantage so it's best to leave both their slots for Tech Cards to improve the deck by going second.  <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> in my opinion is the best Ritual monster in the game, he <strong>adds any Ritual monster in the GY</strong> to the hand by <strong>manipulating its level</strong> to match the added target. And it has a <strong>Quick effect of Ritual Summoning</strong> Megalith straight from the DECK and doesn't even need to tribute it for that, so it generates a lot of advantage and interaction with the opponent throughout the game. A key part of the Megalith archetype.  <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Phaleg"">Megalith Phaleg</a> are surgical cards with Phaleg needed to <strong>finish</strong> and Och needed to <strong>control</strong> the game with Ritual Summon monsters outside the archetype. You want to use them whenever you need them and you don't need to see them in the first hand so we only use 1 copy of each.  Trap <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> is the best way to allow you to <strong>RANK-4</strong> plays in the <strong>Grind Game by reborning a Megalith every turn</strong>. It also <strong>synergizes</strong> with the FIELD Spell <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> which triggers eff of adding <strong>any Ritual Monster</strong> from the GY to the hand even if a Megalith is Special Summoned to the field and not only it was Ritual Summoned then the Trap triggers the Field Spell effect leaving your insane Grind Game even against the best Grind Game decks in the game you can manage very well.  <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> is the <strong>win condition</strong> of Megalith's archetype being the only <strong>interaction via engine</strong> available, when Ritual Summoned it targets and destroys opponent's cards by the number of Ritual Monsters with Different Names in its GY and can often <strong>destroy the opponent's entire field</strong> of just one time. And since the deck has several ways to Ritual Summon the opponent's turn, it's not difficult to bring it onto the field to be an interruption to the opponent's turn 2 plays and leave the <strong>simplified gamestate in your favor</strong>. And that's the strength of Megalith: its versatility in Ritual Summoning on the opponent's turn and interacting in different ways depending on the Deck they're using.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ////<strong>Generic Ritual Support to help Megalith</strong>:  Among the generic support of Ritual, the <strong>Impcantation engine</strong> stands out for generating an absurd advantage so that you can make Ritual Summon with the lowest possible investment, which makes perfect sense when it comes to the second oldest game mechanic that needs to be updated to be competitive. <a data-name=""Impcantation Chalislime"">Impcantation Chalislime</a> is the best starter in the engine because it has the effect of <strong>discarding a card</strong> from the hand to Special Summon an Impcantation straight from the DECK having 3 targets in the Megalith deck: <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> that when Special from the Deck adds a Ritual Spell that we only have the <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a>, the <a data-name=""Impcantation Talismandra"">Impcantation Talismandra</a> which adds a Ritual Monster from the Deck to the hand like <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a>, and the <a data-name=""Impcantation Penciplume"">Impcantation Penciplume</a> which adds a Ritual Monster from the GY to the hand. These monsters also have <strong>hand effects to reveal</strong> a Ritual Monster or a Ritual Spell to <strong>Special Summon BOTH it and an Impcantation from the DECK</strong>. All these monsters have restrictions on the use of their effects: <a data-name=""Chalislime"">Chalislime</a> makes you <strong>lose 2500LP</strong> if you don't Ritual Summon after resolving its effect, and the Impcantation non-Ritual Monsters can only use <strong>1 of the effects per turn, Only Once that Turn</strong> in addition to having continuous effect in the field that you <strong>cannot SPECIAL Summon from the EXTRA Deck</strong>. Finally, to complete the Impcantation engine we have the absurd Archetype Ritual Spell called <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a>, it Ritual Summons Any Ritual Monster by <strong>TRIBUTE ALSO ""IMPCANTATION""</strong> Monsters but in addition it has an <strong>excellent GY effect</strong> if you send an ""Impcantation Card "" from the hand or field to the GY to SPECIAL Summon an ""Impcantation"" from the DECK and return it to the hand which generates a lot of advantage and game volume.  <strong>Herald Engine</strong>: <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> is the best Normal Summon possible for Ritual decks because it does the same thing as <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> but with several more details, such as the fact that it can send both <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> or <a data-name=""N 'tss"">N 'tss</a> from the Extra Deck to be an interaction going second, and it even <strong>raises its own level</strong> by the monster sent to the GY being in these examples becoming <strong>Level6</strong>. It is also a <strong>TUNER monster</strong> which allows you to make Synchro plays and there are several excellent options available mainly because it becomes Level6 which allows you to make <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> on your End Board which is just the best Synchro monster in the game currently. Third it also has an <strong>effect when Tributed to Special Summon a Level 2 or lower Fairy</strong> monster from the Deck which is interesting to find synergies with the card, the main target to bring is <a data-name=""Eva"">Eva</a> which can add interaction to the hand when sent to the GY as <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> and another <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a>. Besides, we have to talk about the <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a>, which is an Extra Deck monster that you want to send to the GY because it has an effect equal to the <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> of <strong>adding a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell</strong> from the Deck to the Hand, We also have the LINK-2 of the Archetype <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> which is a very interesting card for being able to negate the opponent's Spell/Trap by sending Fairy Monsters from the hand to the GY and has an excellent Floating effect of being able to add up to 2 Ritual cards from the GY to the hand greatly improving your Grind Game.  <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> and <a data-name=""Senju"">Senju</a> are the Normal Summons of the deck and by themselves are great Starters to make plays. <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> is in the deck only because it is a search of Normal Summon <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> or <a data-name=""Senju"">Senju</a> when Tributed, you can also choose to use <a data-name=""Vanity's Ruler"">Vanity's Ruler</a> which is a very <strong>powerful floodgate</strong> to prevent only the opponent from Special Summoning and also helps you play around Psy-Framegear Gamma and Nibiru, the Primal Being. <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> is a card that will always appear in Ritual decks in at least 1 copy and for sure she is still in the game even with the abuse that Drytron did the card is very good for the other Ritual decks that people forget she is is also important. If there was a side deck in Master Duel you could use Benten to add <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>.  <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a> fetches all Rituals level 7 or lower which means Adding all starters in the deck and can also add Ritual Spell in GY to hand and it's not even hard once per turn.  Among the interesting generic Ritual Monsters to use in the deck we have the following main options: <a data-name=""Black Chaos MAX"">Black Chaos MAX</a>, <a data-name=""Lord of the Red"">Lord of the Red</a>, <a data-name=""Leviathan @Ignister"">Leviathan @Ignister</a>, <a data-name=""Shinobaron Peacock"">Shinobaron Peacock</a> and <a data-name=""Shirobaroness Peacock"">Shirobaroness Peacock</a>. <a data-name=""Black Chaos MAX"">Black Chaos MAX</a> is basically a Ritual Monster version of <a data-name=""Azathot"">Azathot</a> and that Megalith manages to loop to the field every turn quite consistently. In theory Black Chaos MAX is very good to <strong>turn off the opponent's turn</strong> and the game comes back to you and OTK it but it proved to be very difficult to do with the tests I made because practically you must first access it through <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a>, second get it by <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a>/Senju or <a data-name=""Talismandra"">Talismandra</a> and otherwise you can't do anything else besides the setup to Ritual Summon it on the opponent's turn, so you spend a lot of resources that when it comes back passes the turn you can't finish the opponent. Lord of the Red and Leviathan @Ignister I see them as the best <strong>interaction cards to use</strong> in the deck and the <strong>Shinobaron</strong> Ritual Monsters are also excellent forms of interaction, especially Shirobaroness Peacock which shuffles spells/traps back into the deck and both it has the effect that in the End Phase they go back to the hand and <strong>create two Level4 Tokens</strong> on your field to facilitate Ritual Summon on your next turn but I don't think they are necessary cards in the deck for the following reason: The biggest problem with these generic Rituals is that they only it has the function of entering the field and you <strong>spend a lot of resources</strong> for that which is the problem with Ritual mechanics about being too expensive. It's better when playing Megalith you do little, but that little if the opponent deals with the field I still have a lot of resources to get back into the game and if I need to enter the Grind Game with the opponent. The same goes for those who use <strong>Halqifibrax engine or FTK combos</strong> in the deck because one of two options will happen: either you instantly win when the Combo passes or <strong>lose to Hand Traps</strong> and Blind Second Cards like <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> that's when you can play for as much of <strong>Brick that adds to the deck</strong> when trying to make these moves. So it's much better to maximize Megalith's moves, which is a very well done archetype where <strong>all the cards talk very well with each other</strong> and make a respectful setup against any opponent than opt for those other engines that are not productive and don't generate you advantage in the same way that the purest version already does. Other Generic Ritual Monsters include: <a data-name=""Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended"">Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended</a> and Nekroz Rituals like <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a>, <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a>, <a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a>.  The deck's Extra Deck is mostly made up of <strong>TOOLBOX XYZ RANK-4</strong> that deal with almost any problem on the opponent's field and generate good interactions with the opponent like the <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> and <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> adding <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, we also have some useful Link Monsters in the Deck but which in general are less important than XYZ monsters, a good option is to use <a data-name=""Nephthys, the Sacred Flame"">Nephthys, the Sacred Flame</a> that when done with 3 Ritual Monsters it simply cannot be destroyed by battle or effects, cannot be targeted by cards and gains 2400ATK reaching 4800ATK which makes it an extremely difficult card for Control decks to take out as <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> and <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier,"">Black Luster Soldier,</a> LINK-3 are also a great win condition against Control decks. In general <strong>most of the cards are not mandatory so you can leave the Extra Deck as budget as possible</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ////<strong>Combos</strong>:  In the beginning, when I started to learn how to play Megalith, all the moves I made I always chose to access <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> through <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a> as quickly as possible and keep Looping Hagith and <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a>, Ritual Summoning them <strong>several times</strong> in a row to set up a minimal field and this worked because it was at the time of <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> existence in the game so even though it's not the most efficient way to use its resources because turning the engine doing Ritual Summon by the effect of Megalith and doesn't by the spell Unformed gives you much more advantage, <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> it simply regained all the advantage with its absurd effect of being able to add 2 to 3 Rock Monsters to the hand.  Over time I learned to use <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> more as a card for you to have on the end board to use on your opponent's turn. Of course, the card is excellent and you can use it as a <strong>combo starter</strong>, but as I got better with the deck I saw that looping Hagith Add Unformed and spending in many cases up to 3 Unformed on turn 1 is <strong>not the best way to make combo</strong>. With that I stopped using 3 copies of Hagith and Ophiel because you can use them several times per turn without needing the third copy as you have several ways to <strong>recycle them to your hand</strong> with the deck engine during your combos. And the Combos I do now with the deck play much better around cards like <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> and <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplets"">Forbidden Droplets</a> in addition to <a data-name=""Kaiju"">Kaiju</a>, which was only possible in the <a data-name=""LINKROSS"">LINKROSS</a> Format version because of <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a>, that is, the Combos were not the best way to play Megalith but you never got punished because you had the victory button called Block Dragon.  I would be using <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> instead of <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> if there was <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> in <strong>Master Duel</strong>, but for now Manju is enough for the deck but it's definitely a change I'll make in the future. Some of the combos must be repeated but at least it's good for you to train to learn Megalith because that's how you learn something. Some combos may be wrong so try redoing them to see if they are correct. Some combos I did Adding <a data-name=""Aratron"">Aratron</a> to the hand, but since I don't use him in the decklist anymore you can just add <a data-name=""Bethor"">Bethor</a> to the hand instead for example.  //////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo 1: (Chalislime + Discard) + Hagith + Ophiel</strong>  Chalislime eff Discard Random Card SS Candoll Candoll eff Add Inception Activate

cl2  //////////////////////////////////////////////// //// <strong>Final Deck gameplay details:</strong>  Megalith's Quick effects to Ritual Summon like <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> allow you to <strong>play around target effects</strong> like <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> to Ritual Summon them as tribute so they don't get negated and resolve their effects. Ritual Summon's Quick effect can also be used just to <strong>take advantage of negate and destroy monsters effects</strong> so you can chain the effect and use the Ritual monster as Tribute like Ophiel effect and Opponent's chain <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a>, you can cl2 use <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> eff to perform another Ritual Summon before Ophiel is destroyed <strong>gaining value even after taking interruptions</strong>. These same interactions apply to <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> to play around interactions that <a data-name=""target or destroy your Megalith monsters""><strong>target or destroy your Megalith monsters</strong></a> or even Manju's Normal Summon.  Funny thing about <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> Field Spell is that it triggers eff to Add 1 Ritual from GY to Hand even if your opponent Special Summons a Megalith Monster so in Mirror Match it has interesting applications. ***One move I make a lot is to Reborn <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> with <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> but this move makes when Phul <strong>leaves the field he goes back to the bottom of the deck</strong> which is something you don't want so a way to solve this is you start using <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> more during your combos because you can Reborn it and add Phul to your hand and use it as a tribute to Phul's Ritual and it will be the Megalith Och that goes back to the bottom of the Deck and not Phul and you have the <strong>setup to do Bethor on the opponent's turn in the same way</strong>.  Turn 1 the deck has no way in the engine to <strong>play around</strong> <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> unless you make a <a data-name=""Rafflesia"">Rafflesia</a> and use <a data-name=""Gravedigger's Trap Hole"">Gravedigger's Trap Hole</a> which only works in specific hands having to do 3 or 4 card Combo which is very ineffective though at least if you can add Trap <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> to the hand and Reborn <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> on the opponent's turn you will be able to <strong>Tribute the Nibiru Token that is Level11</strong> to bring <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> on the opponent's turn and destroy several opponent's cards, that is , even after taking Nibiru there are <strong>ways to have interaction and recovery on the opponent's turn</strong> with the combination of <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> and Emergence. Always try to <strong>play around Nibiru turn 3</strong> onwards if the <strong>gamestate is already simplified</strong> and you just need to finish the game with <a data-name=""Megalith Phaleg"">Megalith Phaleg</a> because you can definitely bring him to the field with a maximum of 4 summons. One cool thing about this deck is that you do a Turn 1 combo to add Nibiru to your hand with <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> because you don't care about having the field cleared by Nibiru since with 1 card like Emergence you can already recover the entire Megalith engine again to start plays. ***A tip about playing around Nibiru is not to use the <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> effect on the GY if you already have a way to continue the combo without having to use it, just in case you take <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> you use it as a Push to continue your moves and at least least able to add Trap <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> to the hand with <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a>. But if you are going to play <a data-name=""Talismandra"">Talismandra</a> Add <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> you can use Spell <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> eff in GY without any problems because to have a push after Nibiru will be easy since Benten Adds <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a>/<a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a>.  It's always very important when you have <a data-name=""Chalislime"">Chalislime</a> in the GY to add it back to the hand with <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> or <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> for the next turn to send it to the GY to add the <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> back to the hand and Special an Impcantation from deck.  Interaction Inpcantation Inception vs <a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a> = Even if Inception gets banished from the GY you will still Special Summon an Impcantation from the Deck.  Always check <strong>how many Ritual monsters you have in the GY</strong> to know who to Tribute with <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> effect to bring <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> straight from the deck.  <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> is certainly one of the <strong>best Grind Game cards</strong> in the game, it's absurd how this card alone can <strong>make your engine play again</strong> and even loop <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> because it returns the monster that gives Reborn to the bottom of the deck so every turn you get to use Phul to <strong>bring him back to the field</strong> and destroy all your opponent's cards.  Megalith has a lot of 2 Card Combo or 2 Card Combo and 1 Discard and the <strong>more cards you have in your hand</strong> the end result of the <strong>Combo will not be better</strong>, but <strong>more resilient to interactions</strong>. Depending on the hand you open you can <strong>break the opponent's established fields</strong> with various interations knowing <strong>how to start plays</strong> so that you can extend after the opponent's interruptions.  <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> only has the function of Adding Nibiru to the hand, so since its usefulness ends as soon as it's used you can RANK-5 <a data-name=""Drill Driver Vespenato"">Drill Driver Vespenato</a> on top of it that has an amazing floating effect. It's a pretty good addition to the build as well.  Always remember that if you choose to use <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> instead of Manju you can very easily make <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> to have an interaction with the opponent in the form of <strong>Omni Negate which is something Megalith was never able to do</strong> until the Baronne de Fleur was released in the game. Speaking of synergy between <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> and Baronne de Fleur if you needed to use Baronne de Fleur's omni negate on your turn you can in the <strong>opponent's Standby Phase</strong> use the effect of returning to the Extra Deck and Special Summon Diviner of the Herald and use its trigger effect and send a second <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> to the GY and add another Ritual Monster to the Hand. I'm still using <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> because I'm playing Megalith in <strong>Master Duel</strong> and there's no Baronne de Fleur in the game but for sure when he gets to Master Duel I'll use it in the deck along with Diviner of the Herald since it's the only way to you make an Omni Negate in Megalith's deck.  <a data-name=""Apollousa"">Apollousa</a> is a card that ends the Megalith, alone she can for all her play attempts. Interestingly if you use <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> + <a data-name=""Apollousa"">Apollousa</a> in Megalith's Extra Deck Apollousa has a <strong>great synergy</strong> with <a data-name=""Megalith Phaleg"">Megalith Phaleg</a> because it increases her ATK and that way you have a <strong>lot more negates to use</strong>. Speaking of LINK-4, the best option to finish games with this deck is <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> and not <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>. If you use the <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> in the deck, <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> can make really cool interactions, for example, even getting you to <strong>play around</strong> <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>, which is the best hand trap against Megalith and Ritual decks in general. Just in your first deck search do, for example, Ritual Summon <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> tribute <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> and do cl1 Benten Add <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> and cl2 Phul tgt <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> and add it to hand and that way when opening a new chain for your opponent to activate <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> you can deny it with Orange Light. However, as there is only one Benten in the game, having it available in the starting hand without having to pick it up is a very small chance and this interaction will rarely happen. This same interaction can be given throughout the game with the <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> when you do the <strong>first Ritual Summon of the turn</strong> because your Megalith will activate effect being cl1 like Ophiel for example, <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> cl2 Add Orange Light and <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> cl3 Add Benten and that way you have protection from <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>.  After understanding the combos better, despite Megalith being quite complex, you can see that there are several cards in the deck that <strong>play the same role in the combos with few changes</strong> in the way of building plays and the only real brick of the deck is the <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> that neither it's so harmful if it comes in the hand as <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a>/<a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> can also add <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> to the hand and even some hands can do Megalith Combo without needing the Impcantation engine because <strong>Level8 Megaliths</strong> can start their moves also. Thus, this is one of the most consistent Ritual decks in the game and, along with Drytron, the one that best <strong>interacts with the opponent during both turns</strong>. Certainly a fantastic deck, don't expect Konami to release something similar in the game, because it makes no sense to leave aside the Ritual Spell to make Ritual Summon, which is the great advantage that Megalith presents.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ////  <strong>Disregard the Side Deck</strong>, they are just card options that you can test in the deck or that is very common to see Megalith players using. Curious about the <strong>Megalith</strong> deck in <strong>Master Duel</strong> is that you can practically play it with <strong>full power in the ONLY N/R format</strong>, which makes this certainly the best deck in this format because of <strong>how powerful it can be compared to other decks</strong>. You don't have <a data-name=""Chalislime"">Chalislime</a> and <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> for example but there are still a lot of good combos left to do.  &nbsp;"

Now here we are in 2022 and it is still doing the same thing, only yet it is a lot more fun to have around than Monarchs (no offense to <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtube.com/c/Lithium2300"">Lithium2300</a>). Now with the recent ""important"" competitive taking place, and with the winter 2021/2022 competitive dueling season wrapping up, the meta have went full circle to undergo a 180° to where the reliance on Extra Deck monsters is now more than ever *(including with the recent shortcomings for the Adventurer and D/D decks that got the deserved boost from it's players at YCS Las-Vegas).</span>  <span>   How does Nekroz play into the picture as an Anti-Meta contendor with the sudden dependency of the Extra Deck? Simply put it that it has the ritual monsters that can skelter your opponents ability to utilize their ED monsters to their fullest potential; such examples include ""<a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a>"" (which entirely locks their effects if special summoned from the Extra Deck) and ""<a data-name=""Nekroz of Areadbhair"">Nekroz of Areadbhair</a>"" (used to tribute unnecessary Garnets from your hand or unwanted monsters from your field to negate and banish monsters such as DPE). Besides the usual Unicore and Areadbhair, also in the lineup is ""<a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a>"" (TL;DR, Knightmare Unicorn, but without a discard cost and can target 2 monsters that were Special summoned from the Extra Deck), and ""<a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a>"" (Banish 3 cards, but 1 each from your opponents hand, field, and Graveyard), ""<a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a>"" (Negates Effects of monster Special Summoned ftom ED and reduces attack to 0). Besides those, ""<a data-name=""Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz"">Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz</a>"" (once having very significant importance) still maintains relevancy to the deck only as a hit switch as an urgency tool for Areadbhair, Unicore, or even Trishula. As for the ritual spells, a 2-2-1 ratio (that being cycle, Kaleidescape, and then mirror) has been the most common ratio in modern Nekroz builds for a reason I am assuming involving them being a brick of sorts.</span>  <span>   As for Impcantations and the Dogmatika engine, the debate surrounding the two is that some say one engine is better than the other. To be fair, both have their fair share of problems, and both have their strengths. For Impcantations, I decided to go with a ratio involving with *(2 Candoll, 2 Talismandra, 1 Penciplume, 1 Bookstone).* The reason for not running Chalislime is because I feel it is not worth prioritizing the Impcantation engine solely for the sake of getting Nekroz monsters out; however I do keep in notion that I still use the Impcantation Ritual Spell card anytime I have the monsters not being conceived as Garnet pieces. As for Dogmatika, the only pieces I have going for it is Ecclesia, Titaniklad, and Nadir Servant. This is because of the components needed for Dogmatika Punishment which helps mill out all kinds of Extra Deck monsters I could use in any compacity.</span>  <span>  Finally comes the Other stuff which aren't too special; however the most notable cards include ""<a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom"">Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</a>"" (because it is a Draw 1 that allows me to put any pieces back that I will need later on); ""<a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a>"" mainly due to the fact I'm not running any hand traps for Nekroz doesn't traditionally run handtraps in their main deck unless necessary; and ""<a data-name=""Diviner of the Heralds"">Diviner of the Heralds</a>"" to mill cards like ""<a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a> and ""<a data-name=""Herald of The Arc Light"">Herald of The Arc Light</a>"" on summon.</span>"

Next I combined them with Rikkas, since their main gimmick is to tribute monsters, and for the most part, that worked out decently well (if anyone wants that version, I can upload it).  Firstly, what *is* a Lair of Darkness deck? It's a deck centered around it's field spell, a field spell that lets you tribute your opponent's monsters. Although that sounds amazing, the deck can brick, very hard, this deck aims to improve consistency and/or stall enough to where you can get your plays going. I'll touch up more down below the explanation of the monsters/spells/traps. Without further ado, let's go through what the deck consists of, and why they're there.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Monsters:</span></strong>  <strong>(I will NOT be covering Maxx ""C"", Monster Reborn, or Raigeki here)</strong>  <strong>Tour Guide From the Underworld</strong> - Tour Guide is a staple in virtually any fiend deck, as it allows you to special summon 1 level 3 or lower fiend monster from your deck when it's normal summoned. She's a great extender and an amazing combo starter for this deck, as the fiend monsters (every one of them, aside from Tour Guide herself) don't *need* their effects (I'll touch up more on this later). (3)  <strong>Lilith, Lady of Lament</strong> - Lilith is arguably the boss monster of this deck, although her stats aren't as good as 'Darkest Diabolos', her quick effect (she's the only one in this deck with one) allows you to tribute 1 dark monster (more on why this is good later). If her effects aren't negated, you can tribute 1 monster to reveal 3 normal traps and have your opponent choose one of them at random to set on your field (so keep in mind, if you want to add more Trap Trick in, that's totally fine).  <strong>Ahrima, the Wicked Warden</strong> - Ahrima is honestly what makes the deck a lot more bearable, you can discard him from your hand to search out 'Lair of Darkness', making him invaluable to have. When he's on field, you can also tribute 1 dark monster to search out your 'Darkest Diabolos', which you'll almost always want either in-hand or in your GY.  <strong>Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</strong> - Diabolos is the other boss monster of this deck, and you'll always want at least 1 copy of him in your deck list (you can add more, but he can be bricky at times). He can't be tributed and your opponent can't target him with card effects, both very good effects for the most part, but aside from that and being a beatstick with 3k attack, he's very easy to get on the field, as he special summons himself from the GY or hand when one of your monsters is tributed (yes, even getting Kaiju'd works). To top it off, when he tributes, your opponent has to put a card from their hand on either the top or bottom of their deck (their choice).  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Spells:</span></strong>  <strong>Foolish Burial</strong> - Mostly included here for 2 reasons: you can use it with Monster Reborn, and to send Diabolos to the GY.  <strong>Terraforming</strong> - A must-have for any field spell centric deck, it just searches out your field spell.  <strong>Pot of Extravagance</strong> - This deck can be very bricky at times, and you definitely don't want any of your main deck banished, so this and Pot of Prosperity are the next best thing. The only reason I included this instead of Prosperity is because of allowing you to draw 1 more card, you can swap these if you want, though.  <strong>Lair of Darkness</strong> - The main center piece of this deck and something you'll always want on the field, it's the field spell. When this card is on the field, all face-up monsters become DARK attribute monsters, making your life a lot easier. Once per turn, you can tribute 1 face-up DARK monster your enemy controls, which is great removal as it's not destructive, it doesn't target, and it allows you to potentially get some of your effects off. To add on to those 2 effects, it also creates tokens up to the amount of times the turn player tribute summoned. That means if you tributed 4 times, you get 4 tokens. Note that if you tribute on their turn, they get the tokens.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Traps:</span></strong>  <strong>Dimensional Prison </strong>- This trap allows you to target and banish an opponent's attacking monster, making it decent at stalling and helpful for situations where you need it.  <strong>Trickstar Reincarnation </strong>- Normally you'd use this with the other Lament sister, Malice, but I'll touch up on her down there. This trap card is limited to 1 (thankfully), because it allows you to banish your opponent's entire hand (they get to draw the same amount, so it's usually run with 'Droll &amp; Lock Bird', but they'd end up bricking us).  <strong>Metaverse</strong> - Another limited 1, kind of Terraforming's older brother, it allows you to take a field spell from your deck and either add it to your hand or activate it.  <strong>Waking the Dragon </strong>- In a deck with as many traps as this, and with how often people run things like 'Harpie's Feather Duster', this is a no-brainer. When your opponent removes (in any sense, banished, destroyed, or gently sent to the GY), you get to special summon 1 extra deck monster.  <strong>Grinning Grave Virus</strong> - GGV is something that can make your life worse or better, depending on what's sent to the GY. It allows you to tribute 1 DARK monster with 3k or less ATK, and then have your opponent destroy 1 card for every 500 ATK of that monster from their hand and/or deck (so if you tributed a monster with 1k ATK, they'd destroy 2 cards). If you, however, tributed a monster with 2k or more ATK, you get to look at all the cards your opponent draws until the end of their 3rd turn after you activated it. Not only that, but all monsters they draw are immediately destroyed, and they can't activate their effects in the GY the turn they were destroyed by that effect.  <strong>Trap Trick</strong> - Trap Trick is another must-have for this deck, as it allows you to banish 1 trap from your deck to set a copy of that trap (you have to have 2+ copies), which you can activate that turn.  <strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong> - It'd be weird if I didn't include this in the deck profile, it's a trap that allows you to target a monster in your opponent's GY, special summon it to your field (its effects are negated), and then banish a monster they control of the same type (ie. if you use this to target a Dragon in their GY, and they have Dragon on field, you can banish both of the cards.) So at worst it's a worse Monster Reborn.  <strong>Solemn Judgement</strong> - This deck doesn't have much of anything in terms of negation, so this is probably your best bet for that, highly advised to run with at least 2 copies.  <strong>Skill Drain </strong>- I know people hate Skill Drain and that's just another reason I put this in here, it's something that not only stops your opponent from using on-field monster effects, but it doesn't really affect this deck much at all (more on that).  <strong>Summon Limit</strong> - Pretty self-explanatory, neither player can summon more than 2 times per turn (negated summons still count), and it's not like we're summoning a bunch of monsters anyways, aside from tokens.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <strong>Naturia Exterio</strong> - Naturia Exterio is an amazing card to have on field since he's like a Drytron for activated spells/traps. You can banish 1 card from your GY, send the top of your deck to the GY, and then negate an activated trap/spell (doesn't work on already activated traps/spells). Best part? It's not a once per turn, as long as you have banish targets and a deck, you can negate.  <strong>Black Rose Moonlight Dragon</strong> - You don't necessarily need this, but it does help a lot in keeping your opponent in check, since it (on special summon as well) allows you to send 1 level 5 or higher special summoned monster your opponent controls to the hand. With summon limit, it becomes a lot more oppressive.  <strong>Geomathmech Final Sigma</strong> - Sigma is a win-con by himself a lot of the times, since he's unaffected by card effects outside of other Mathmechs (which, who runs?). Any battle damage this card inflicts is also doubled, which at 3k attack, is pretty decent. The catch being that this card *has* to be in the Extra Monster Zone for those effects.  <strong>Beat Cop from the Underworld</strong> - Beat Cop is a great addition here, since she not only can tribute a monster your opponent controls, but when you do tribute a monster with her (so long as you used 2 DARK monsters with different names), you can put a Patrol Counter on a card, allowing it to be safe from destruction, by the amount of counters on it (your main target for them would be Lair of Darkness).  <strong>Wee Witch's Apprentice</strong> - You can definitely take her out or substitute her for something else, but she's mainly just another way of getting back a monster from your GY, which you can also use tokens.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Extra Information:</span></strong>  This deck has a lot to it for the most part, a lot of it comes down to knowing your opponent's decks, since you'll want to make the most out of your 1 tribute summon. I'll add some 'I-think-you-should-know-this' info down below.  <strong>What happens if my monster effects are negated?</strong>  Outside of maybe 'Tour Guide' who special summons Lilith or Ahrima, you don't really need them, as you can still activate their effects and tribute monsters, they just don't get the benefits of them tributing (ex: you can tribute a monster with Lilith, but you don't get to excavate trap cards if her effects are negated).  <strong>Why do you run 'Waking the Dragon' in this deck?</strong>  Simple, it's a trap heavy deck and centered around a field spell, people are going to want to pop every trap and the field spell at any chance they can get, why not reap the benefits if you don't have an out to them like Solemn?  <strong>Why Skill Drain at 3? Isn't that a bit bricky?</strong>  Absolutely, it can be a brick, but like Solemn and Summon Limit, you can't search for them as you can with normal traps, so you'll want to increase your chance of having it in your starting hand.  <strong>No hand traps outside of Maxx ""C""? </strong>  The deck needs all the consistency it can get, putting Ash Blossom, Called by the Grave, or any other hand traps would just clutter it or make it harder to stall.  <strong>Why is the Extra Deck so small?</strong>  Mostly because I'm leaving it to you, so I can be lazy, as I'm not all that knowledgeable on the best targets for 'Waking the Dragon' (and no, I won't just Google ""best targets for Waking the Dragon').  <strong>No Sangan?!?!</strong>  Swap out Sangan for a Skill Drain if you want, but I just prefer stalling until I get that monster on field.  <strong>Where are the other cards, 'Alice, Lady of Lament' and 'Diabolos, King of the Abyss'?</strong>  They're probably hanging out with 'Trouble Sunny', who is also not in the game. Give us them, Konami.  <strong>Recurring Nightmare?</strong>  You can tech this in, but it's not searchable and for it to appear in your hand often you'd have to add 2 or 3, so it's not really worth it in my opinion.  <strong><span>Weaknesses:</span> </strong>  So we've covered the good, what's the bad? Well firstly, since it *is* based around its field spell, it can be vulnerable if you don't have negates or anything to stop the removal of it, which can stop your play dead in the tracks if you don't have that good of a hand. Although this deck can go second and still win, it'll have some trouble, as we rely heavily on our normal summon and not having our stuff, y'know, destroyed.  The deck also struggles with cards being sent to the GY and/or being banished, as there are hardly any ways to get them back, so that means if an enemy is about to banish your on-field Lilith, let her tribute herself and/or a monster that will be removed. Pot of Extravagance is both a blessing and a curse for this deck, as you can banish your main 'Waking the Dragon' targets, so be weary on using it. Backrow heavy decks are also an annoying matchup against this deck for the most part so keep that in mind.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Last thoughts:</span></strong>  This deck is an absolute blast to play for the most part, which if you didn't like playing Eldlich because it's just ""bring back goldie boy, activate trap monster"", you might like this. I have not done any playtesting in Platinum with this deck (I don't want to) so I can't say this is a Plat 1 deck, but it is very annoying when you have the right setup going. I hope I don't see this deck in Ranked, please keep it away from me, thank you."

With all the cards in place, both Red-eyes and supporting cards (Vishuda, Nessie, Dogman, Dark Magician, Alternative Black Dragon, etc.) you can keep summoning monsters from both your hand and GY. Also, your spells and traps, give some base security when special summoning, especially Return of The Red-Eyes, or when you need to maintain your rhythm in summoning (Allure of Darkness). However, your main objective is to bring out mainly Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon and Dark Dragoon, as Flare Metal will burn your opponent per effect, and Dark Dragoon can break your opponent's board. Your Link Monsters can also support your deck by co-linking and thus drawing cards, but also destroying and negating your opponent's monsters and card effects. Usually aim for Verte Anaconda, as its effect can secure you Dark Dragoon and keep summoning cards (if you copy Red-Eyes Fusion's effect, which disregards its downside)."

PS: I did make some better versions of this deck so it's easier to get zeus off, will share soonTM  Strat is quite simple:  Main Deck:  3x Skull servant - here just as fodder, can be used for Wightprince effect or summoned with Unexpected dai to make a Xyz summon and get Zeus on the field.  3x Wightprincess - defensive option/combo starter, either summon her and use the effect to throw Wightprince to the graveyard and start the combo or keep her around to use her quick effect to throw sand at the eyes of anything with a high level.  3x The Lady in Wight - the shield of the deck, can protect the King against MOST stuff that would break him, can be easily put on the field with the effect of Wightmare after being banished with Wightprince effect in the graveyard.  3x Wightbaking - this one is the goat, either keep him around to save any of the cores with his quick effect or throw him to the graveyard for his other effect and grab Wightprince (to be discarded) and Wightprincess (to throw sand) or Wightmare to get Lady in Wight in the field.  3x Wightmare - the only thing he's here for is unbanishing a extra skull servant or sumonning a banished Lady in Wight or King of skull servants, or you just normal summon him as fodder for a link/xyz summon.  3x Wightprince - either use him as discard/link summon fodder, just throw him to the graveyard to use his effect.  3x King of the Skull Servants - he's the sword of the deck, can be easily normal summoned since it's a lvl 1, can also be summoned with Wightprince graveyard effect.  3x Maxx ""C"" - this is necessary against most tier 1-2 decks, plus getting the right cards with it can be a insta-win (unless they negate you to oblivion).  3x Ash Blossom - good combo, unfortunately, i don't want to see 10+ minutes of summoning and resummoning, L + negated + you get no cards.  2x  Mezuki - good to be used with Avendread Savior effect, good atk, and is also a way to get Lady in Wight in the field.  1x Raigeki - board control is important.  1x Harpie's Feather Duster - board control is important.  1x Monster Reborn - either used to unbrick or to get the King back in the field  1x Foolish Burial - use with Wightbaking to get Wightprince + Wightprincess and you're off to a great start  1x One for One - mostly a combo starter  2x Tri-Wight - let's you recicle some monsters to Link/Xyz summon, also a easy Zeus summon  2x Unexpected Dai - also a easy way to Zeus  1x  Lightning Storm - board control is important  2x Burial from a different dimension - use along with Wightprince grave effect to get the King without the -3k attack demerit from having banished the cards  2x Twin Twisters - another way of discarding a combo starter and dealing with Skill Drain/Imperial Order and other hard counters  1x Mirror Force - Classic one, still useful  1x Evenly Matched - you normally only need 1-3 cards on the field, so this is also a good way to deal with extensive combos and full boards  2x Infinite Impermenence - really useful, some effects can be a insta-lose  1x Dark Sacrifice - a way to save the cores, and throw Wightbaking to the grave at the same time  1x Solemn Judgement - omni-negate, can be a insta-win if they can't recover  2x Uni-Zombie - combo starter  Extra deck:  1x Zeus - he's just here for the board control  2x Linkuriboh - normal summoning Wightprince/Wightbaking into Linkuriboh is a decent first turn option most of the tim.  1x Slacker Magician - can be easily used to summon Zeus since she can attack anything and don't worry about being destroyed  1x Number 39: Utopia Roots - also a good option for a Zeus summon, it's also a good option for defense.  2x Number 48: Shadow Lich - good Offense/Defense option if you need to rely on classic beatdown.  1x LANphorhynchus - it only needs two monsters of any king/level so it's good to get rid of vulnerable monsters on the field.  1x Knightmare Phoenix - good ofense/utility and can discard something to the grave.  1x Knightmare Unicorn - same as Phoenix but works for any card instead.  2x Avendread Savior - his effect being able to discard a card from the deck to lower a enemy attack is useful for combos and for defense (wightbaking/mezuki as the main targets)  1x Accesscode Talker - good ofensive option if the opponent has ways of dealing with the king  1x Saryuja Skull Dread - one of the less used cards, but it's kinda useful in late game situations  1x Rasterliger - budget Accesscode Talker"

Place <a data-name=""Qliphort Scout"">Qliphort Scout</a> + <a data-name=""Qliphort Stealth"">Qliphort Stealth</a> or <a data-name=""Qliphort Carrier"">Qliphort Carrier</a> into Pendulum zone, get a free (800LP) monster from your deck every turn. Place one on battlefield (Preferably Stealth) and just beat your opponent with 2900-3400 attack monster while they are cannot do a single move, thanks to your floodgates.  If you couldn't block them out of play, your Qliphort Monsters have absurd Tribute effects: <ul>  	<li>If you tribute a Carrier - Bounce Monster into hand (you can bounce your own Scout, to activate it again this turn! NO ONCE PER TURN ON SCOUT LOL)</li>  	<li>If you tribute Helix - Destroy Spell or Trap on battlefield (sometimes you can destroy your own to open some space)</li>  	<li>If you tribute Summoned Stealth - Bounce any card on battlefield (again, you can bounce Scout!)</li> </ul> Basically all you do is disrupt your opponents plan as much as possible before you locked them out of the game, while your Normal Monster beat the crap out of them.  Also, Qliphort Monsters is good because you can summon any of them without Tributing, althought their stats will be lowered as well as level... except the fact that Skill Drain, negates stats loss and in same time, your monsters in Pendulum Zone gives free bonus ATK or decrease ATK of opponent monsters making a really huge difference!  &nbsp;  And you know whats funniest about this deck? You actually need only 2 cards in Extra deck: Dragon Master Knight for our Dogmatika Punishment, the rest of them is just a banish fodder for pot! Even Genius!"

A lot of this is based on a standard <strong>Toadally Awesome</strong> deck with some staple cards added, since I designed this for Master Duel, but I'll go over the strategy regardless as there are some cards I don't think I've seen in Frogs before. <ul>  	<li>The boss here is of course <strong>Toadally Awesome</strong>, which can be used to Special Summon monsters and steal your opponent's cards.</li>  	<li>If you have a Frog monster in your GY, <strong>Swap Frog</strong> can be used to get <strong>Ronintoadin </strong><em>and</em> another Frog monster from your hand on the field at once. If that monster is a <strong>Ronintoadin</strong>, <strong>Des Frog</strong> or <strong>Dupe Frog</strong>, then you're one step away from being able to play <strong>Des Croaking</strong> or Fusion Summon <strong>D.3.S. Frog</strong>.</li>  	<li>When Normal Summoned, <strong>Tradetoad </strong>can Tribute itself to get a Level 2 Frog on the field.</li>  	<li><strong>Wetlands</strong> is key to this deck, as it's one of the most powerful members of the ""Field Spells that add ATK"" family. Use <strong>Terraforming </strong>to search for it.</li>  	<li><strong>Solidarity </strong>gives your cards a further ATK boost, since every monster in this deck is Aqua.</li>  	<li>Because all of your monsters are WATER, <strong>Mastar Boy </strong>boosts them all by 500 ATK. I was considering whether <strong>Star Boy</strong> would be a better addition since he can benefit from <strong>Wetlands</strong>, but he doesn't have the ability to recover monsters when destroyed and I felt like he might be too inconsistent to run in a singles duel.</li>  	<li>A non-Frog monster that I did add to the Main Deck is <strong>Squirt Squid</strong>, since the tokens are free material for <strong>Toadally Awesome </strong>and can become bosses in their own right.</li>  	<li>The rest of the Monsters are <strong>Paleozoic </strong>Traps. These are so useful in a Frog deck because not only are they decent Traps in their own right, but they they can gain double attack with <strong>Wetlands</strong> <em>and </em>be used to summon <strong>Toadally Awesome</strong>.</li>  	<li><strong>Salvage </strong>can be used to recover Frog monsters, while <strong>Gravity Bind </strong>and <strong>Aquarium Stage </strong>can stop powerful monsters from destroying your board.</li>  	<li>The final card I want to talk about is <strong>Fury of Kairyu-Shin</strong>.
