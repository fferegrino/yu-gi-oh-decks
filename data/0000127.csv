&nbsp;

also suprisingly effective against a variety of decks, as long as you don't get your precious draw power ash blossom'd or your normal summons interfered with in any way (effect veiler, destruction, bounced to hand/deck, you name it), but good luck finding room for any tech cards of your own lel

updated to change the deck into OCG, for the sole reason of making use of pot of disparity, and disparity <strong>claps</strong> with convulsion of nature. if you got covulsion and disparity, you can banish 6 cards from the extra deck (or 3 if you're a COWARD), add the card you want, which could very well be the convulsion you need for this, organize the other 5 cards in reverse of the order you'd want to draw them, then play convulsion and <strong>BAM</strong>, you've made disparity's downside into straight-up advantage state, adding one card of a selection from what is now the bottom of the deck to your hand while having the 5 cards of your now topdeck be in exactly the order you want, letting you use true name or archfiend's oath to draw into your optimally ordered topdeck, with true name even giving the immediate option of shuffling the deck with it's divine search if you want your next draws to be different from your disparity's selection. If Disparity is Pot of Duality on steroids, then Disparity plus Convulsion is Duality and Card Advance on <strong>fuckin' PCP.</strong>

if you're a goober like i am with most unfamiliar decklists, then some tips are that you should always try to go first, don't forget the nuances of your cards (ex. using reactor slime's quick effect if it's targeted for battle, or keeping it around for more tokens if it's not) and egyptian god slime is your best friend, with it's high attack, immunity to battle destruction, use as 3 tributes, and it being the only monster that can be targeted by your opponent's effects while on your field. immortal phoenix is the only reason foolish burial is played, but archfiend's call can also send it to the grave if it's topdeck as long as you declare the wrong card, and if it's in your hand a knightmare monster will discard it easily. don't waste your extra tribute effects from card advance and ancient chant, and only use chant's graveyard effect if your ra gets 3000+ attack from it. <span>also the xyz monsters and saryuja are just there as options for specific scenarios, so don't be heartbroken if you gotta break the rank-ups with disparity</span>

&nbsp;

honestly this deck has grown on me, it's so confoundingly simple with its <em>12</em> topdeck cards bumping out <em>any</em> room for tech cards combined with the laughing stock of boss monsters that is egyptian gods, but it just <em>works</em>. <a data-name=""The True Name"">The True Name</a> was <em>asking</em> for egyptian convulsion to happen, and i put the pieces together, ignoring the temtations of the meta as well as my other far-from-meta decks that i ignored while playing this (sorry pure magnet warriors), and whaddya know, this has become my dumb fun deck."

Here I am, with yet another horrible horrible horrible idea! What could go wrong?</span>

<span>So, I was messing around with some of the Entity cards, and decided to make a deck with them! Hooray! Unfortunately, this deck utilizes banned cards (Elder Entity Norden and Outer Entity Azathot), and can not be used in competitive play. However, this deck is absolutely perfect for casual games! I've had a blast using this, personally. But, enough about me, and onto...</span>

<span> </span>

<b>The Monsters:</b>

&nbsp;

<span>3x Danger! Mothman!: Mothman here is one of the cards used for level 4 spam, so that you can go into your Outer Entity Nyarla. Danger! monsters are particularly useful for this, as they have an easy (and not once per turn) way to summon themselves for relatively free. As a bonus, you even get to draw a card!</span>

<span> </span>

<span>1x Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing: Coltwing is used for plays with Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon, and serves no other purpose in the deck. However, a thing to note is its level, which can be used for XYZ monsters in a pinch.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3x Danger! Chupacabra!: One of the other Danger! monsters, Chupacabra serves a similar purpose to Mothman for its inclusion, as it is a level 4, and is easy to spam onto the field with the added benefit of drawing a card, potentially letting you go into your combo pieces.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3x Goblindbergh: Goblindbergh! One of my favorite cards in the game at the moment, this son of a bitch is one of 2 good normal summons in this deck, and lets you summon a monster for free (which will usually be Summoner Monk if you have it. If not, it's alright to use its effect on a Danger! monster or another copy of itself). You'll find yourself going into our lord and savor Nyarla very easily with this card.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3x Summoner Monk: Summoner Monk serves an almost identical purpose to Goblindbergh, letting you summon a level 4 or lower monster. However, this card does not need to be normal summoned for its effect to work, and can summon monsters from your deck instead of just the hand. However, this comes at the cost of discarding a spell card. This and Goblindbergh have situational applications, so be sure to use them at the right momens.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1x The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak: Used as the main target for The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche's effect, and is further used for its effect once in the GY to add a Phantom Knights card to your hand.</span>

&nbsp;

1x Steam Synchron: Used to summon Halqifibrax.

&nbsp;

<span>1x Deskbot 001: Used as part of the Halqifibrax package.</span>

<b>The Spells/Traps:</b>

<span>3x Dreamland: No, this isn't the Dreamland a certain pink ball hails from- this is one home to numerous unimaginable horrors! Hooray! This card isn't the greatest- but provides some useful support for your Entity cards. The effects you'll find yourself using the most are the Synchro effect, and the XYZ effect.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3x Forbidden Trapezohedron: I actually had no idea this card was a thing before making this deck. There isn't much direct Entity support- this card is actually the only one that lists any Entity cards directly, which is kind of sad when you think about it. I really think there needs to be more Entity support, it's such an awesome archetype.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1x Instant Fusion: Used to summon Elder Entity Norden. Fun fact: this card's existence is the reason for Norden's unjust ban!</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1x Terraforming: Used to add your Dreamland to hand.</span>

&nbsp;

3x Tuning: Used to search Steam Synchron for your Halqifibrax plays.

&nbsp;

<span>2x Super Polymerization: Super Poly is one of those cards you look at and go ""What the hell were they thinking?"" Maybe if you could react to this card, it wouldn't be as good. But, alas, we do not live in such a world. This card is a good piece of removal, allowing you to get rid of problem cards that would have been impossible to get rid of otherwise.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3x The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch: This is one of 2 ways to summon Outer Entity Azathot, the main boss monster of this deck. This can be done during your opponent's turn, and you will be wanting to use your Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon to summon it after using its effect. I don't know of any other DARK rank 4 XYZ monsters that can detach all of their materials easily- and this is the best I could find.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>2x Forbidden Apocrypha: This is one of my favorite cards in the game- due to what it is based on (the Necronomicon). However, in practice, it isn't the greatest. Although it does have some use, and thus is used in the deck.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3x Infinite Impermanence: Imperm is a really good staple handtrap. What more do I need to say?</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3x Wonder XYZ: Wonder XYZ functions in a similar manner to The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch, allowing you to get Azathot on your opponent's turn in order to lock your opponent. You'll be targeting your Outer Entity Nyarla with this card, in order to summon it!</span>

&nbsp;

<strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong>

<span>1x Starving Venom Fusion Dragon: Used as a Super Poly target.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1x Elder Entity N'tss: Currently, this is one of the more played Fusion monsters in the game, mainly due to Dogmatika's existence. This is one of the better Entity cards, and you'll want to be summoning it if possible. Its effect to special summon is also incredible, but is not as useful due to its difficulty in summoning it.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1x Elder Entity Norden: Your target for Instant Fusion, abuse its effect to special summon from the GY for free as much as possible.</span>

&nbsp;

1x Borreload Savage Dragon: Used as part of the Halq combo, and is the general end result. It serves as a powerful negation and a strong beater.

&nbsp;

<span>1x Old Entity Hastorr: One of the lower end Entity monsters.Although it is useful in some circumstances, it is not recommended to be used over Cthuga.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>2x Old Entity Cthugua: Cthuga is the best Old Entity, and you'll be wanting to use it for its ever so important draw effect.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1x Martial Metal Marcher: This card is the key piece in the Halq combo, you'll be using this to revive your Deskbot 001.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1x Outer Entity Azathot: Azathot is going to definitely be your big summon. It locks the opponent out of effects the turn it is summoned, leading to use with cards such as Wonder XYZ.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1x Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon: Summon this card, use effect, and use The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch on your opponent's turn.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1x Outer Entity Nyarla: nyarla funny </span> Nyarla is used in order to summon Azathot with Wonder XYZ, or during your turn.

&nbsp;

<span>1x Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon: Part of the Halq combo, link summon this after special summoning Deskbot 001 with Halqifibrax. After summoning the tokens, tribute 3 of them to summon your Coltwing, and then use its effect. The main reason for Coltwing's use is its level, allowing you to go into Savage Dragon easily.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1x The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche: Used to search The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1x Crystron Halqifibrax: The central piece of this deck; use it to get a strong boss monster on the board with relative ease.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1x Linkross: Used as a potential alternative to the Auroradon+Halqifibrax combo if you want to go into one of your Old Entities.</span>

<strong><span>The Side Deck:</span></strong>

Most cards are put in here for 2 reasons, and I will reply with a letter coordinating with these: A= ""Super Poly Target"", and B = ""Used for ratios""

<span>1x Dinowrestler Pankratops: Good removal.</span>

<span>1x Predaplant Triphyoverutum: A</span>

<span>1x Predaplant Dragostapelia: A</span>

<span>1x Elder Entity N'tss: B</span>

<span>1x Elder Entity Norden: B</span>

<span>1x Mudragon of the Swamp: A</span>

<span>1x Old Entity Hastorr: B</span>

<span>1x Old Entity Cthugua: B</span>

<span>1x Outer Entity Azathot: B</span>

<span>1x Outer Entity Nyarla: B</span>

<span>3x Lightning Storm: Good going second card that can devastate boards if a deck isn't prepared.</span>

<span>1x Upstart Goblin: For more draw power.</span>

<span>1x Super Polymerization: B</span>

<h1>DECK LIST</h1>
<h4><span>MONSTERS:</span></h4>
3 <a data-name=""Uni-Zombie"">Uni-Zombie</a>: this is pretty self explanatory as it is one of the most important cards in every zombie world deck.

3 <a data-name=""Shiranui solitaire"">Shiranui solitaire</a>: this is also self explanatory as it searches out your uni-zombie which is important.

3 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a>: this is the best starter and extender in PK. Definite 3 of.

3 <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a>: your entire deck are zombies. special summoning them from grave is really good.

2 <a data-name=""Necroworld Banshee"">Necroworld Banshee</a>: this is a great card because it gets your Zombie World out easier.

2 <a data-name=""Doomking Balerdroch"">Doomking Balerdroch</a>: this is your main boss monster as it constantly special summons itself from grave if <a data-name=""Zombie World"">Zombie World</a> is up and provides a negate.

2 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a>: Searches out your PK monsters when banishing from grave. you could run this at 3 but given how tight the deck is I wouldn't recommend

2 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a>: Same with cloak but with S/Ts. You could run this at 3 but I don't recommend

1 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves"">The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</a>: This is handy to dump off an extra PK resource if you need it.

1 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves"">The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves</a>: This is literally just used for extensions, It has no other effects that would benefit in other situations.

1 <a data-name=""Jack-O-Bolan"">Jack-O-Bolan</a>: This card is helpful for grave recovery and that's about it.

1 <a data-name=""Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> and <a data-name=""Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>: These are your main garnets of the deck. Used in PK combos

1 <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a>: While not as good as Mezuki, Gozuki is still handy to have on occasion.

1 <a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a>: this can allow a more synchro variant to the deck because it's a great tuner. There is no Synchro package here because i'm not the big brain boy who can make the ED space like my mom apparently still thinks I am.

1 <a data-name=""Glow-Up Bloom"">Glow-Up Bloom</a>: You need Zombie World on the field one way or another.
<h4>SPELLS:</h4>
3 <a data-name=""Zombie World"">Zombie World</a>: you need this card to be live as much as possible.

3 <a data-name=""Book of life"">Book of life</a>: Its good, like really good. Its basically a budget <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> for Zombie World.

3 <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>: With Zombie World up you can steal your opponents monsters for Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon.

1 <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force"">Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force</a>: This is <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a> but better in the majority of situations, as you don't have to use it on a monster w/out mats.
<h4>TRAPS:</h4>
3 <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a>: its EXTREMELY good in this deck, everything are zombies.

2 <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a>: the most important trap card the PK engine has to offer, you can bump it up to 3 if you like.

<h3>EXTRA DECK:</h3>

2 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Break Sword"">The Phantom Knights of Break Sword</a>: this card is helpful when setting up your rank 4 going first, and helps break up boards going second

2 <a data-name=""Leviair The Sea Dragon"">Leviair The Sea Dragon</a>: this card is really integral to PK combos to recover the monsters you've banished from grave.

1 <a data-name=""Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon"">Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon"">Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon</a>: These are the cards you will have at the end of a PK board. Non OPT monster negates that float Xyz monsters in the process is pretty insane

1 <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</a>: you are running Xyz monsters; therefore, run this card.

1 <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>: this card is here to clean up boards and OTK

1 <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> and <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>: removal, what can I say

1 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>: this is the best card out of the PKs, it's been banned after all.

1 <a data-name=""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss</a>: this card is integral to your PK combos and gets your graff in grave to combo off.

1 <a data-name=""Vampire Sucker"">Vampire Sucker</a>: This card is extremely strong when it comes to consistency boosting via draws on grave specials (OPT). It also gives a strong option to essentially Kaiju your opponent for a tribute summon (This effect won't come up often if at all but it's handy to know about it.). And can give you a free target to super poly with easier.
<h2>PROS AND CONS</h2>
<h4>PROS:</h4>
The deck has a good capability of Keeping its ground and playing through a HT or two

The deck provides some easily accessible tuner monsters (one of which being a starter card), allowing you to run a Halq Synchro package if you wanted to.

Speaking of which, This deck is very flexible, you can switch out cards and ratios to your heart's desire, build the deck the way you want to. THIS IS NOT A SET IN STONE LIST, go on, <strong>experiment!</strong> I wanna see what you guys can come up with.

This deck can end on powerful boards when given the opportunity, A fog blade, Bardiche pop, and three Requiem negates is strong.
<h4>CONS:</h4>
This deck has a larger potency to brick than the more pure builds of either of these decks. The easiest way to fix this is to optimize one or both engines. (I don't know how to do that effectively so i'm just gonna let you do that for me (: )

If you were to buy the all of the cards in this list to play in person, IT'S NOT FINANCIALLY WORTH THE MONEY, Unless you have majority of the cards already, just don't go for it or try to make it as budget as you can (Switch accesscode for borrelsword, change Ice Dragons for a cheap HT like <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, etc.)

This deck is <strong>EXTREMELY HARD TO PILOT</strong>, The Phantom Knights alone require you to switch your combo routes on the dime depending on the situation, or else you'll be stuck in a decision paralysis running down the clock that can really make the deck uninviting if you don't know what you're doing, adding the Zombie World stuff just adds another layer of what combo routes to take. You are going to need to playtest a lot to get the hang of what to do in the right situations. (back on the pros, the flexibility of the deck can help ease up this difficulty to pilot.)

(I can't really put a game plan because 1: deck is designed to be tweaked and tinkered with until you make a list you're happy with, which may not go with said game plan I put here and 2: It would be extremely long given to extremely varying situations and routes to take and i'm not really in the mood to write an entire article for game plan alone.)"

The D/D/D deck is really hard to master so forgive me for any misplays you might notice me do in the replays. You have to think several steps a head, there are so many cards and so many combos you can do that it just gets overwhealming sometimes especially if you aren't used to playing the deck. Essentially the only basic/main combo is to use D/D Swirl Slime to summon D/D/D Flame King Genghis, use Swirl Slime's second effect to summon a D/D from hand, trigger Flame King special summon effect and go for D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh. Everything else extending the combo just basically depends on what cards you drew. The deck is very versatile and has a response to multiple decks. For example main deck D/D Orthros gives you better chance of dealing with Mystic Mine and D/D/D Super Doom King Purple Armageddon can surprise opponent and prevent you from getting OTKed by Numerons. D/D/D Duo Dawn King Kalijuga can get rid of Red-Eys Dark Dragoon and so many other annoying monsters. I think this is a really fun deck but not exactly meta. It can certainly surprise meta players who aren't familiar witht he deck since relatively few actually use D/D/Ds.

And finally pure!,"Oh boy, for the love of me I cannot find a draitron pure deck and people keep contaminating it with heralds( no offense). Anyways, I decided to build my own draitron deck from scratch and i have to say it's looking pretty good. Onto the explanations!

The main gimmick of draitrons is to special summon themselves from the hand or graveyard by tributing another draitron monster from your hand or field and the effect monsters have varying effects, such as adding ritual monsters or ritual spells, recovery from GY etc. The big boss monsters of the deck are level 12, which may seem confusing, but fear not! Draitron's other gimmick is that they use their attack as factor for ritual summoning rather than levels. And with 2000 atk monsters it normally needs 2 small draitron's for the big chonk. The boss monsters themselves have different applicabilities, one is to counter spell and traps and the other is to counter monsters. Then, we have draitron spells( heheah boi no traps). Nova helps provide with fodder in order to go into more plays, start a play or go for the big bois. Fafnir is there to boost consistency and provide protection ( now dont go around asking why they chose a dragon for the field spells art, I don't have a clue). Meteornis is your ritual spell that can be recovered from the GY via its own effect(best to use the atk reduction on a smaller draitron if possible). Now regarding the rest of the cards: Ash and Ogre you probably know, impermanence is for ez negates, extravagance because the deck doesnt use the extra deck that often( the extra deck consists of outs and plan Bs). Terraforming to add Fafnir, Raigeki and HFD for field wipes and reborn for plays or comeback.

There is no specific combo with draitron's but it is best that your starting hand has Alpha, Zeta and Fafnir or Terraforming.

That is all! Hope you have fun with this deck of mine, because I can totally say that draitrons are my favourite ritual archetype!"

1. Introduction

New version is here with very different version of the combos. Such as getting 2 normal monsters (1 tuner)is basically like a full combo. The deck plays that many extenders that even through nibiru it might even play past that card. This updated version makes calamities with the basic combo which you basically open with every game. 1 more extender can result in a herald and vfd, 2 more extenders can result in a buster vfd and if you get really lucky you can even make the herald, buster and vfd. This deck is really consistent at making vfd though.

2. Combos

Due to my ban on dueling book this is now available at the discord server. Make sure you do have edopro to view the files as it is a ydk file.

3. Discussion

So many of these things might look a bit weird and why I don't play certain things so I will try to go through these as fast as I can.

Why avarice - Well as the only main deck card that I added in may look a bit weird, pot of avarice may need some explanation. For recycling back your resources and getting a good follow up. 1 thing this deck struggles at is the end of a combo, you have used all of your resources once you have finished the combo, it may be hard to get a good follow up for next, especially since 3000 damage doesn't make game.

NO dragon shrine - I tested this card and I didn't like playing it essentially since all it did was set up my monster reborns which painful decision already does that AND gets your normal TUNER to your hand.

Secret Village of The Spellcasters should be played in every DM deck tbh. It locks your opponent out of spell cards which is helpful because you see Infernobles and DL use those type of cards to extend combos. No spellbook engine because i don't really have space for that and I want to keep the HTs.

Naturally I turn to my good friend Dark Warrior to help me out with this, Every card integral to this combo was a mistake, please forgive me for my sins.

The deck consists of a bunch of warrior starters to make Isolde, the main combo pieces, and magical mallet to shuffle back your garnets.

Combo: Make Isolde, then mill 4 equips to fetch armageddon knight from deck, dump plagues to then revive it and make a noodle, bring out a red rose dragon, use red rose and armageddon knight to make power tool and a white rose, use power tool to reveal 3 DDR and add one to your hand, banish armageddon knight and one other warrior, use DDR to get armageddon knight sending the phoenix blade, dump zephyros, use zephyros to bounce DDR to hand, use phoenix blade to banish armageddon and something else again, DDR armageddon again, dump s'monk, use armageddon and zephyros to make dugares, dugares to revive s'monk, s'monk for s'monk, make n'tss with power tool and dugares, use phoenix blade again, s'monk for s'monk, use white rose dragon and n'tss to make utopia double, then use the 3 s'monk to make rusty, rusty to dump a PK setting one RUM, banish PK for other RUM, use double to search double to make kaiser, kaiser to bring out grinder and big eye, and on your opponents turn make VFD and Kali Yuga."

This deck is still really strong and can still make great boards without Block D","Tips:

If you open with Adhara or Madolche, special summon them first then use your normal summon.

If you have 2 tuners ( and one of them is Analyzer) Always use the tuner for Halq.

If you have Koa'ki Meiru Supplier in hand when you summon Halq, and you used a rock for Halq's summon Special Summon Koa'ki Meiru Supplier and use its effect to add a Koa'ki monster to your hand.

If you open with Doki Doki and 2 Rock Monsters, Summon Doki Doki first and with it's effect and special summon an Adamancipator. (Ex: If you open with 2 Dokis and a Level 4 Rock, discard that Rock and summon Adamancipator Analyzer. Same thing applies to Level 2 Adamancipator's)

If you open with Red-Eyes Fusion it is not the end of the world. When you bring back Plague Spreader from your GY, shuffle Red-Eyes Fusion into your deck.

If your opponent negates your Halq and you have nothing else, Summon Linkross, make 2 Tokens, Link into Linkuriboh with one token, Link both Link monsters off for Verte and Summon Dragoon.

If you open with an Rock Monster and Researcher, Summon the Rock then, summon Researcher.

Adamancipator Risen- Dragite, Should ONLY be summoned if your opponent has already established their board, so you can Evacuate and hopefully send some of their cards back to their hand. I'd rather take Borreload Savage Dragon's Omni negate and 3750 ATK than Dragite's 3000 ATK and Spell Negate

Combo:

1 Adamancipator monsters, 1 Extender, and an Evacuation Target (So basically you need at least 1 tuner, and 2 level 4's for full combo)
Summon Adamancipator and Extender (If it is a level 4, the Evacuation target can be any Rock)

Summon Evacuation target, use Evac. target and Extender for Halq.

Halq Summons Plague Spreader.

Use Halq for Linkross, Summon 2 Tokens with Linkross

Use Plague and 1 Token for Metal Marcher

Use Marcher to bring back Plague

Use Marcher and the 2nd Token for Herald

Use Plague Spreader and 1 Token for Metal Marcher

Use Metal Marcher and summon Plague Spreader

Use Metal Marcher and the Other token for Herald.

Use Spreader and Non-Tuner Level 4 for Rapite.

Use Rapite and Evac 1 Rock Monster.

Bring back Plague by Shuffling in a card (Preferably a Rock, and not imperm or ash)

Summon  Borreload using Rapite and Spreader and equip Halq.

use Linkross and the Rock you Evacuated with Rapite and Summon verte.

Use verte and summon Dragoon.

Deck Strengths and Weaknesses</span>
<p><span><span><strong>Strengths</strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
 	<li><strong><span>Versatility</span></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><span>High draw &amp; search power</span></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><span>Potential to OTK</span></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><span>Ability to lock the board down</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span><strong>Weaknesses</strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
 	<li><strong><span>Prone to bricking</span></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><span>Very dependent on the Graveyard</span></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><span>Reliant on multiple special summons for combos (<a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a> weak)</span></strong></li>
 	<li><strong><span>Requires some practice</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<span>II. Key Cards</span>
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> - This is the main beater of the deck and can be used offensively as well as defensively. Aside from board wiping, he can protect Fairy monsters from targeted effects and also act as a secondary Darklord Contact. This deck more so focuses on summoning him off of Super Polymerization (usually without Morningstar as material) for his protective abilities rather than board wiping.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a> - One of the best draw power and setup cards in the deck. Can send itself along with another Darklord card to the graveyard to draw 2 from the deck. Can also copy a Darklord spell or trap in the graveyard as a quick effect for 1,000 LP.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> - This is your main setup card for fusion, link, and xyz summons. Superbia's ability isn't a once per turn effect, so it's always a prime revival target for Darklord Contact, Monster Reborn, and The First Darklord. (Of note: A copied Darklord Contact from the graveyard will not proc Superbia's effect upon revival as the timing will be missed).</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> - This card synergizes incredibly well with Super Polymerization since it gives 2/3 material for The First Darklord or a free Starving Venom Fusion Dragon.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> - A very multifaceted fusion card; can be activated during your turn or your opponent's turn since it's a quick-play spell. It does require a discard to activate- so make sure you save a card to discard to the graveyard. Since this deck uses 2 Pot of Desires for additional draw power, Super Polymerization serves as a good safety blanket if either Darklord Uprising or Darklord Morningstar get pitched.</li>
</ul>
<span>III. Combos</span>

<strong><a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>This combo is essentially the bread and butter of the deck. It requires a bit less setup than the standard Darklord Uprising fusion and it's more <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>-friendly since draw power is really important for this deck. Ideally you want to weed out the possibility of getting Ash Blossomed before attempting this combo. <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> does 2 things: it gives you a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> target on your opponent's side of the field and it gives you a free search for a Darklord monster. As long as you can get a 3rd monster on the field (usually by reviving from the graveyard), you can get <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> very easily and then start to revive your monsters again. This combo is centered around The First Darklord's ability to swarm and protect your field rather than board wiping your opponent.</li>
</ul>
<strong><a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>This combo is a bit niche, but can be both offensive and defensive. <a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> allows you to tribute monsters from the graveyard instead of the field, which can help pave the way for things that can't be special summoned like <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a>. Offensively, it's an additional tribute summon that can bring things like Darklord Morningstar to the field or a second Darklord Superbia/Zerato for rank 8 XYZ plays. This also works around <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> if you have it on the field since this wouldn't be considered a special summon. Defensively, <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> is also able to use it's normal summoning quick effect during your <em>opponent's</em> turn, meaning you could tribute summon <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a> from your hand after your opponent finishes summoning their monsters during the main phase. Afterward, you can use Morningstar's ability to swarm Darklords to your side of the field based on the number of effect monsters your opponent controls.</li>
</ul>
<strong><a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Darklord Uprising"">Darklord Uprising</a></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>This is a pretty well-known combo: you link summon <a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a>, use her ability to discard <a data-name=""Darklord Uprising"">Darklord Uprising</a> to the grave and add <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a> to your hand. During your <em>opponent's</em> turn you quick effect Darklord Uprising from the graveyard (using Darklord Ixchel, Nasten, etc) to fusion summon <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> using <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a> from your hand to board wipe your opponent's field.</li>
</ul>
<strong><a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> &amp; Any Revival Effect</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Like I mentioned before, Darklord Superbia's ability to revive an additional fairy from the graveyard <span>is not a once per turn effect</span>. Meaning you can continuously revive it from the graveyard and still proc its effect. The exception is if you copy a Darklord Contact from the graveyard using monsters like Darklord Ixchel or Nasten- as the timing for Superbia's effect would be missed. In terms of this deck, there are 3 ways to revive Superbia for its effect: <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a> (from the hand), <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a>, and <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>. If you're lucky enough to have access to all 3 of these revival effects in a turn, your board will be well protected with link monsters such as <a data-name=""Apollousa Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa Bow of the Goddess</a> and <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a>.</li>
</ul>
<span>IV. Tips and Tricks</span>
<ol>
 	<li>If you don't have <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> in hand, try to weed out Ash Blossom as quickly as possible depending on your strategy for the turn.
<ol>
 	<li>If you're planning to go the Indulged-Super Poly route, use other draw/search cards to bait such as Allure of Darkness or Pot of Desires. Typically you really don't want to get Ash Blossomed on Indulged Darklord.</li>
 	<li>If you don't have Super Polymerization in hand, you could bait with Indulged Darklord and use a different combo depending on what you have in hand.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Don't worry about the possibility of pitching <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a> or <a data-name=""Darklord Uprising"">Darklord Uprising</a> if you need to play Pot of Desires, you're also running 3 copies of <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> for fusion summoning.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Darklord Amdusc"">Darklord Amdusc</a> can bring back Darklord Superbia or Zerato to your hand from the graveyard if you need a level 8 monster for Trade-In.</li>
 	<li>When looking for monsters to banish for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>, usually I'd go with Amdusc, Zerato, or doubles of monsters that are already in the graveyard.</li>
 	<li>Most Darklords can only be special summoned once per turn, but Darklord Superbia and Indulged/Capricious Darklord are exceptions to this rule. This makes it possible to go into Rank 4 and 8 XYZ plays.</li>
 	<li>If you're having trouble deciding whether to play offensive or defensive, <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> allows for more aggressive offensive plays while <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> gives you more opportunities for defensive plays during your opponent's turn.</li>
 	<li>Remember that <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> only allows you to fusion summon from the field while <a data-name=""Darklord Uprising"">Darklord Uprising</a> allows you fusion summon from your field and hand.</li>
 	<li>Watch how you play <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a>, it locks both you and your opponent from special summoning.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> is good for spell/trap protection that doesn't specifically target your fairy monsters (ie. Raigeki, spells that search for monsters, Mirror Force, or Dark Hole).
<ol>
 	<li>Make sure you have a fairy monster in hand to discard to use its negation effect, otherwise it would be better going into Condemned Darklord or Knightmare Phoenix.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<span>V. Addressing Weaknesses </span>
<ol>
 	<li>The biggest problem with <em>any</em> Darklord deck is bricking. I only run 1 Ash Blossom in this deck because I felt like I was bricking too often on opening hands. Running any non-Darklord card will increase your chance to brick since a lot of Darklord cards require other Darklord cards to work with and start combos; ie. Ixchel needs another Darklord card for her effect to go off, Nasten needs 2 Darklord cards to discard to special summon itself. In a perfect world I'd run zero handtraps (or add more Called by the Graves if it wasn't limited to 1).</li>
 	<li>So...the graveyard. If your opponent does anything to hinder your access to the graveyard, then it really puts this deck down. Most- if not all Darklord combos require some degree of revival from the graveyard for fusion or link summoning. Aside from using Allure of Darkness for draw power, you really don't want to see your Darklords getting banished from the graveyard. Also just hope you never get matched up against a <a data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a> deck.</li>
 	<li>This should be self explanatory, but you're doing a lot of special summoning to go into your fusion monsters and links. If you notice that your opponent is running <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a>, you can either play defensive by setting up a <a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Darklord Uprising"">Darklord Uprising</a> combo during your opponent's turn- or stick to the main beaters of your deck without going into your extra deck. <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a> and <a data-name=""Darklord Nasten"">Darklord Nasten</a> can definitely hold their own on the field, especially if you have Darklord spells and traps in the graveyard.</li>
 	<li>Lastly, this deck will require some practice. You likely won't be using the same combo twice in a row between duels depending on what you have in your opening hand. If you like the thought of thinking up new strategies on the spot and being creative- you'll probably enjoy testing it out.</li>
</ol>
<span>VI. Side Deck &amp; Other Deck Options</span>
<ol>
 	<li>In terms of Darklords in my side deck, they're mostly for namesake if I feel like I can extend combos (especially since half of the Darklords can only be special summoned once per turn). <a data-name=""Darklord Tezcatlipoca"">Darklord Tezcatlipoca</a> is the closest thing we have to a Darklord hand trap, but it isn't really worth running it compared to Ash Blossom since it only prevents card destruction. Nergal and Nasten are more niche picks and Capricious is there in case I need to play more defensive. <a data-name=""The Sanctified Darklord"">The Sanctified Darklord</a> is a decent option too if you want to play more defensive.</li>
 	<li>I have 3 Ash Blossom in my side deck just in case- though I <em>reaaaaallly</em> don't like using them because they tend to brick hands. I also have 3 Nibiru and 3 <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> for some more added protection just in case the Super Poly strat isn't working.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a> is....reasonable. It can surprise your opponent if they're not expecting it, but you're not really in control of what's summoned by the effect. More often than not you'll end up special summoning Superbia when you want it to be in the graveyard instead. <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> is also a good option if you want to thin your deck down. <a data-name=""Celestial Transformation"">Celestial Transformation</a> is also an option since you're running almost all Fairy monsters, but it could also result in a brick.</li>
 	<li>If you feel like it isn't worth running Ash Blossom at all- the best replacement is probably <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> since it's more draw power and it thins your deck down.</li>

Overall illegal, but a really good going second deck. I might change it later, it just is really fun to try and see what I can do with illegal combos. Since the deck has so many ways to special summon, it is easy to get Synchro and Xyz monsters on the field.

","So here we go, expierementing with a ritual deck. Here's Drytons, with a lot of the pieces taken from Eric Meadow's article. His article was a great help for this, so go check it out: https://ygoprodeck.com/drytron-your-guide-to-the-ritual-monster-galaxy/ Back on topic, this is more so an in depth guide on my deck with a playing guide.
<span>Deck list
<span>2x Gamma- Gamma is one of the first smaller Drytons, this time capable of reviving Drytons from the gave. This is great for extending plays as you can use Drytons you already used for ritual summons and the like. I opted to run it at 2 because it could be bricky at 3, although some variants can run it at 3.
</span></span>2x Alpha- Alpha searches out our ritual monsters, although not just the Drytons, but any ritual. That effect makes it amazing, as it can snatch up any ritual neccesary. I opted to run at 2 for ratio reasons, but in a deck trying to run more regular monsters, Alpha should be run at 3.
1x Beta- Beta recovers cards banished by Draconids and Quadrantis, making it fairly good for recovering resources mid to late game. Although, you want to draw into this card after using their effects, so Beta is best at 1.
1x Delta- Delta, at the cost of revealing a card the opponent will probably already be expecting us to have,  allows us to draw a card. This can be fairly good as long as we get a nice top deck.
1x Zeta- Zeta, as the parralel to Alpha, searches out any ritual spell. Although we're only running 1 ritual spell, this is still a great effect for searching it out.
3x Manju- Manju is the deck's only normal summon, which you'll want to do before you go through the minituare Drytons, as they lock you out of the normal summon for the rest of the turn. Manju gives you a ritual or a spell, basically filling in the gaps of your hand and giving you whatever you need.
3x Dawn Knight- Dawn Knight is a very interesting card in this deck. The core idea of it is to summon Union Carrier, and equip it to Union Carrier, then tribute the Union Carrier for a ritual. Since Dawn Knight was equipped, it'll go to the grave and send a card. It's basically a long winded but still great foolish burial. This combo is quite strong and reliable, although in emergency situations you can normal summon Dawn Knight and tribute him directly for a ritual to get his search.
3x Draconids- Draconids is basically the deck's boss monster, and a fantastic one at that. It's a 4k beater that's easy to get out, since the miniature Dryton's add up to 4k without a problem. It's also able to banish monsters from the grave to send an opponents monster. While it does target, sending it directly to the grave is great, as it dodges tons of destruction effects. Draconids also has monster eff protection, which helps it dodge a lot of the plentiful monster negates and such in the current meta.
2x Quadrantids- Quadrantids is basically a secondary boss monster, as I prefer Draconids to it, but it's still fairly strong. Quadrantids has a Harpie's Feather Duster effect, which doesn't target, making it a great counter to decks like Altergeist (get fucked Doug Dzeef). It also has protection against spells and traps, dodging cards like Imperm. And, on destruction, it specials Dryton's from grave who's attack equal 4000.
1x Brionac- Brionac is the first card of the small Nekroz package. Brionac removes extra deck special summoned monsters, which can clear out problem monsters from the field or draw out negates. It can also discard to search out a Nekroz card in order to fill in the gaps of your current hand.
2x Unicore- Unicore negates all effects of extra deck special summoned monsters on the field, which makes it a fantastic one sided Skill Drain on legs. In addition, it can discard itself to add back a Nekroz from your GY, recovering valuable resources.
2x Trishula- Trishula banishes cards from the opponent's hand, field, and grave, all without targeting, making it a fantastic card for removal. Afterwards, it's just a 27k beater to OTK alongside Draconids. Although, it can also discard itself to protect a Nekroz from an opponent's card, which can help protect something weaker like a Unicore or Brionac.
2x Natasha- Natasha is the only Cyber Angel card in here, as I decided to cut down on the amount of Cyber Angels that were originally chosen in the article, in favor of more splashable Nekroz. Anyway, Natasha's on field effects are very forgettable and not worth mentioning. in the grave, though, she can banish another Natasha to ss herself and take control of an opponent's card with no downsides. This effect is amazing, as it's a Snatch Steal on legs with no downsides. It's easy to get multiple copies of Natasha in the grave, with Dawn Knight, Foolish Burial, and using her as fodder for Ritual summons, so that makes this effect even better.
2x Sauvaris- Sauvaris is a fantastic ritual hand trap that helps to protect your monsters from destruction. While it's rarely summoned, though, it can be summoned going first for a more control oriented style. You can bounce it back to the hand in order to negate a important summon, crippling many combos as long as you know what you're doing.
3x Meteonis- Meteonis is a key card for the deck, as it can summon literally any ritual, not just Drytons. Meteonis also uses monster's attack, not levels, which makes it easier to use cards like Union Carrier for the Dawn Knight combo and such. Meteonis can also recycle itself, by removing 1000 attack from one of your Drytons to bounce it back to your hand.
3x Fafnir- Fafnir is the archetype's obligatory field spell, and one that reminds me of Magical Meltdown somewhat. It adds a Drytron spell upon activation, making it another layer of consistency to get out either Nova or Meteonis. It also adds on another layer of protection for you, making it so ritual spells can't be negated. And, it also allows you to lower the level of monsters by every 1000 attack they have. The last effect, i'm not sure of how to use it, but i'm sure it has a good use in some gimmick.
3x Nova- Nova is another fantastic card for the deck. It allows you to special Dryton's from deck, including the rituals. of course, you'll most likely be wanting to special out the miniature Drytron's, as it allows you to get out more ritual fodder much easier. Although, the only restriction of Nova is that they're destroyed in the end phase. So, you could very well special out a big Quadrantis to get in extra damage, and then you get it's destruction effect in the end phase.
2x Asterism- Asterism is a fairly good piece of monster removal for the deck. You can remove 1000 attack from any Ritual, not just Drytons, to pop an opponent's card. You can easily remove 1000 from one of your worse Nekroz or something less valuable to pop an opponent's boss monster, clearing the board for an OTK alongside Draconid's monster removal.
1x Foolish Burial- Foolish Burial serves as simple graveyard set up, sending either a Natasha for the Snatch Steal eff, or sending whatever minituar Drytron you need to get their SS from grave.
1x Monster Reborn- Monster Reborn is basically insurance as you can revive your rituals and revive the minituare Drytrons to extend plays, getting them out easier than their weird tributing effects.
3x Extrav- Extrav is the deck's main draw power. The extra deck barely matters, aside from Union, so it's just banish fodder.
<span>The extra deck
<span>3x Apollousa- Apollousa is basically just banish fodder. I don't get why you would summon this, as getting out 4 monster sin this deck is insanely hard, but even if you get out 4 you'd rather use them for a ritual than anything. Just banish it
</span></span>3x Union Carrier- Union Carrier combos with Dawn Knight, which I explained earlier, but i'll explain again. Since Dawn Knight sends when it leaves the field, you'll want to summon Union Carrier and equip it with Dawn Knight. Union Carrier is of the perfect attack stat to be tributed for a ritual, so you tribute him off for a ritual. You then get the search of Dawn Knight, since it was equipped, and send either a Natasha or a miniature Drytron. Remember to shuffle your extra deck heavily when using Extrav, so you don't banish all copies of Union Carrier.
1x Linkuriboh- banish
1x Secure Gardna- banish
1x Nyarla- funny XYZ
<span>Playing guide
<span>After screwing around with this deck, i've come up with somewhat of a strategy. Some of it is taken from the article, but a lot of it is of my own. Basically, you'll first want to normal summon Manju and get off it's search, grabbing whatever you need. Afterwards, you'll  want to use the miniature Drytron's effects to shit them out and get enough out to make tons of Rituals. Then, link-2 into Union Carrier if you have Dawn Knight in hand. Equip the Union Carrier with Dawn Knight, then tribute the Union Carrier along with others for a ritual. That'll get Dawn Knight's search, and you can send either a Natasha if you foolished one earlier or send a miniature Drytron for more combos. Then, simply go into a Nekroz or two to remove as many cards from the opponent's board as possible, and then hit the field with Draconids. Rinse and repeat until you OTK.
</span></span>Things to note: The side deck is up to you, although I included the Drytron's trap because it's only really useful going first, to control the opponent's board. You'll want to not use it going second, as it's probably a dead card then.
Any suggestions or feedback is appreciated. Thank you, have a good day!"

What a C-C-COMBOOOOOOOOO!","Strat of the deck is to make use of Danger! and Dark World synergies, and since they consist of dark monsters that want to be discarded, it only seemed natural to include a Dark Armed Dragon... or two :D. Overall illegal, but a really good going second deck. I might change it later, it just is really fun to try and see what I can do with illegal combos. Since the deck has so many ways to special summon, it is easy to get Synchro and Xyz monsters on the field. The level 4 Xyz monsters are particularly easy to make with Dark Grepher and Beiige, Vanguard of the Dark World. I love this deck!"

This deck was build with the 2002 ban list at the release of the Phara,"The Strategy of this Deck is quite obivous, beat down your opponent by swarming Jinzo and Mechanicalchaser on the field and use Limiter Removal on them. This deck has the potential to OTK quite easiy. A Jinzo with two Limiter Removal or a Jinzo and Mechanicalchaser with a single LR can easily OTK on an empty field without having to worry about backrow thanks to Jinzo's effect. To facilitate this Strategy we run one copy of Snatch Steal and Change of Heart each. Tribute your opponent's Monster for Jinzo and with two LR it's game over. As you don't want to tribute too much and want to swarm as much as possible you want to maximize on your Premature Burial, as well as one copy of Monster Reborn and one copy of Call of the Haunted to get as many copies of Jinzo from the graveyard on the field as possible. Jinzo can easily be send to the Grave with the two copies of Card Destruction, Painful Choice or Morphing Jar.

Cyber Jar not only gets you out of a tough spot, it also enables you to swarm the field with Mechanicalchaser and even provides tribute fodder in case you can't special summon Jinzo. Mystic Tomato, Sangan and Witch are included as Searches to speed up the process. Magician of Faith can loop important spell cards like Pot of Greed, Monster Reborn or Card Destruction as well as Limiter Removal. The rest of the cards are just powerful staple cards, espacially Imperial order (pre-errata), which you could run at three copies at the initial release of Pharao's Servant. If you want to test this deck with the pre-errata version, you play it in yu-gi-oh legacy of the duelist (not link evolution, the first version) or online on EDOPro"

Use this to have fun or a base to build off on. ,"Tips and Tricks to help secure victory.

Swap Frog + Any frog = Toadally Awesome
<ol>
 	<li>Normal Summon Swap Frog, mill Ronintoadin</li>
 	<li>Bounce Swap Frog, and Special Swap Frog, discard the other Frog, mill Dupe Frog</li>
 	<li>Special Ronintoadin, banishing Dupe Frog</li>
 	<li>Special Summon Toad</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

Opabini(with a trap ) + level 2 aqua:
<ol>
 	<li>Detach the trap XYZ to search a trap you can activate.</li>
 	<li>Active the trap and trigger the trap in grave</li>
 	<li>Overlay the 2 monster for any XYZ, usually Toadally Awesome or Sky Cavalry Centaurea</li>
 	<li>Battle</li>
 	<li>Use Opabinia for Zeus</li>
</ol>
Don't be too eager to use your traps, traps are important triggers for paleos in grave. It can be tempting to use them to block hits, but getting a Toadally Awesome online to jumpstart the frog engine is worth trading the lifepoints!

Mistar Boy provides valuable attack boost that can end games.

Paleozoic Canadia's effect can stop many combos or prevent them from starting.

Don't shotgun Marella's effect during your opponent's turn. The less information they have, the better.

When using Marella, send the card you least want to draw.

Keep a card in hand for Dinomischus(Traptrick), think carefully about what card you want to discard. My favorite targets are the second pot of extravagance or ronintoadin.

Traptrick represent 2 activation of paleo graveyards effects, since they are trap effects rather than activating a trap card.

Keep track of how many frogs you have in deck, it can be easy to churn through all the frog, but try to keep one dupe in deck for Toadally awesome.

Send RoninToadin &gt;&gt;Dupe Frog &gt;&gt; Swap Frog &gt;&gt; Last Dupe Frog

Dupe Frog recurs from grave, grabbing a swap from a loaded grave give the grind a little more juice.

Don't feel pressured to return Toadally Awesome if you only have one copy left, Paleozoic Anomalocaris represent a equally potent control tool and engine.

https://youtu.be/rDPQ47o8TH0","Krawlers archetype features flip effect monsters that summon themselves from the deck if your opponent removes it from the field face-up by effects and summon 2 more Krawlers from the deck. The deck slowly gains resources from setting monsters until it can OTK the opponent. The Krawlers are underrated and I feel as if the deck needs some spotlight. The deck also has some space to side in hand traps or whatever answers the current meta. Gozen match is a great choice for this deck as the monsters are all earth attribute.

The steps for this deck is to
<ol>
 	<li>Set 1 or 2 Krawler monsters and set <a data-name=""Lost wind"">Lost wind</a> or other floodgates/Negations.
<ol>
 	<li>or if you open The Tindangles, you can S.S from your hand or search the deck for a flip monster using <a data-name=""Tindangle jhrelth"">Tindangle jhrelth</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Flip The Krawler Monsters with <a data-name=""World Legacy Pawns"">World Legacy Pawns</a> to interrupt during your opponent's turn.</li>
 	<li>S.S from the deck if your opponent removes your faceup Krawler monster</li>
 	<li>Stall until enough resources to OTK with <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker </a>or Flooding the field with Krawler monsters.</li>
</ol>
The bug Spray:
<ol>
 	<li>The deck can struggle a little bit when the spells and traps are removed but lost wind and galaxy cyclone and lost wind can make up for part of this since it can be milled by <a data-name=""World Legacy Survivors"">World Legacy Survivors</a>. or if removed it can recur itself</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> can also be a problem and mystic mine, but <a data-name=""Galaxy cyclone"">Galaxy cyclone</a> can help bypass these floodgates.</li>
</ol>
Conclusion:

it is an amazingly fun deck and can even out dragoon and other annoying monsters, Deus X-Krawler is an epic negator where your opponent cannot activate monster effects for the rest of the turn. Do not link off or combo too early, bide your time and dismantle your opponents board little by little until you are sure that you can otk that turn.

You can't escape me, I am always watching, I am always haunting your life. But now, before I mercilessly stalk you in your dreams, I present to you: a crappy Evilswarm XYZ deck. It's bad. Why did I make this.
<span>Deck guide
<span>3x Salamandra- Salamandra is, basically a vanilla in most situations.  All he really is is archetypal XYZ fodder, although late game while you have more XYZ out, you can summon him, use his effect and then push for game. That's the only situation in which he's really of use.
</span></span>3x O'lantern- O'Lantern reminds me of a specific Ben Ten alien i can't remember the name of, but that's not important. O'Lantern, like Salamandra, is basically a vanilla on the field. O'Lantern's effect is pretty useless, although at times it can be used to remove problem monsters from the field. This removal is subpar compared to Bahamut's though, so it's only really usable in an emergency situation.
3x Castor- Castor is basically a double summon on legs in the deck, which is very valuable, as the Evilswarm archetype struggles to summon a good amount of monsters. That's all Castor really does, although that single effect is great and allows you to go into a lot of XYZ.
3x Ketos- Most of the time, Ketos is basically a vanilla, as his spell/trap removal is much worse than what you'll have in the side deck. Ketos can out a Mystic Mine or a problem card if it's an emergency and if you have more monsters to go into an XYZ with, though, so that's a plus.
3x Kekyoin- I can't spell his name so this is the best you're getting, an unfunny JoJo reference. Kekyoin's first effect is useless, although his on field effect is great. At the cost of getting rid of useless mosnters, you can recur valuable resources like Castor, and get an additional normal summon.
3x Mandagora- Mandagora serves as a great card for  the archetype, as going second, you can easily special summon it and go into more XYZ. Mandagora is mostly a dead card going first though, although it's too good to side out.
3x Goblindberch- Goblindberch serves to help special summon out more Evilswarms, which is great for such a slow archetype. The only bad part is that it's not actually archetypal.
3x Ash Blossom- the obligatory hand trap, Ash serves to cripple tons of combos and is a obligatory 3 of in every deck. I may or may not own a mat of her.
2x Ghost Ogre- Ghost Ogre serves as valuable monster removal, which is great in this deck, as it can struggle to get over some monsters.
3x Infestation Pandemic- Pandemic serves as monster protection for a turn, which is best when you're first doing all your plays and such to avoid things like Imperm.
3x Double Summon- Double Summon serves to allow you to normal summon twice, going into XYZ much easier. It's another  one of those cards valuable for how it allows you to summon more than the Evilswarms are built to.
3x Xyz Unit- Xyz Unit serves to buff up your XYZ to nice levels of attack and serves as extra detach fodder. I've found it can brick sometimes, so it might be better to run at 2, depending on your adjustments.
3x Terminus- Terminus serves as late to mid game removal, which can cripple your opponetn's chances at a comeback by bouncing various important things that they can't or struggle to re-use back, although at a cost of banishing your own main deck Evilswarm you have to leave on the field for this, as you don't want to use a valuable XYZ.
3x Infection- Infection allows you to unbrick hands by basically tossing out useless cards to add things that are much better like Castor.  The problem is that Infection is basically a slower, archetypal trade in, so you mgiht choose to run at 2 due to how slow it is.
<span>The extra deck
</span>2x Bahamut is, in my opinion, the best Iswarm XYZ. He's basically a snatch steal on legs with no reprucussions, aside from a discard cost which isn't all that bad. (Some variants of this play a Danger! engine, so if you do, you can turn Bahamut's discard cost for this into a plus with Dangers.)
2x Ophion- Ophion is basically a floodgate on legs, which you can summon if you have excess monsters to make 2 XYZ in order to completely halt the opponent, as this deck doesn't summon anything above 4. It  also searches Infestation spells/traps, although this isn't as great or notable as the floodgate.
2x Ourboros- Ourboros has a steep cost of 3 monsters, which makes it very situational, but it is quite good when you do manage to summon it. It can pop cards, disrupt the grave, and tear cards from your opponent's hand. The hand effect isn't as good because that can just give graveyard setup to some decks, so be wary when using it. The other 2 effects, though, are great.
1x Thanatos- Thanatos is basically a monster with protection, except he needs to detach to have said temporary protection. He's not great, he's just here cuz he's archetypal.
1x Nightmare- Nightmare is basically a book of moon on legs, which isn't as great as the effect of Ophion or Ourboros,which both do much better as interruption. Again, just here cuz it's archetypal.
1x Exciton Knight- Exciton is basically just a worse, but also archetypal Evenly Matched. Against some decks though this can tear through boards, so a well timed Exciton can be quite good. Not that good anymore though, as a Evenly Matched is just better.
3x Nyarla- summon NYarla and win lol
3x Zeus- Zeus is a fantastic rank up option if you manage to attack, as it can clear the entire field and is a nice 3k beater.
<span>Playing guide
<span>The deck is, fairly simple. You want to get out at least 2 monsters, using cards like Castor, Goblindberch, and Double Summon to get out a good amount of monsters. Then you go into your XYZ, equip it with XYZ unit and do whatever you can. Personally, if you're going second I like going into Bahamut and stealing the opponent's boss monster to interrupt them heavily. If going first, you want to go into Ophion to set up a floodgate to shut down the opponent. As long as you're going second, you can then hit for a bit of damage and go into a Zeus. After that, the game is more so a grind game of slowly setting up more XYZ and then blowing up the board with Zeus. You can also use Nyarla as a fantastic card in general, and you have Ourboros in case you manage to get out 3 monsters.
</span></span>Things to note: This is more so geared towards going second, but it can do stuff going first. A tech idea I like a lot is running Mystic Mine with Terra and Demise of the Land, as it can slow down the gamestate a lot to better fit the tempo of Evilswarms.
Any feedback is appreciated, like always. Have a good day!"

This build allows you to either go first or second, although with Eldlich it's good to go first to have full control.

Your ideal turn one setup will be hidden city with Guru on field, fiendess in hand with Scarlet and either Conq or Haq set. Your follow up turn could be used to normal your Fiendess, effect to set Guru then link for Anima to take an opponents monster, then if you used both Conq and Haq, overlay for Pleiades for more disruption, knightmares to further devastate and more and more control.

Your side deck aside from Lightning Storm is designed to go first with access to Numerons, cause we all know how broken Zexal is, and Dragoon for not only negates, but also pops.

Now yes this deck does have its choke points and your opponent probably knows them, but one you have Guru on field, Golden Land traps and Eldlixirs in grave along with golden boy, it can be very hard for your opponent to not only overcome, but also to come back from such devastating interruptions.

I believe this is quite a monster of a deck and you should give it a shot, and if you go against, tread lightly because one wrong step and you will most likely lose.
