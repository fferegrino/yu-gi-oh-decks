And that's why we play 60 cards! As it ensures if you draw into one brick, you'll still have many options to play with The main point of this deck is to have as many starters as possible, and achieve heights you could only dream of with the previous list. However, this comes at the cost of consistency, so if you're more of a combo player who doesn't mind a few dead hands, and can think in 5 dimensions, this might be the list for you (provided you also wanna play Doremichords) <strong>EXPLAINING TECH OPTIONS(DIVINER AND OTHER OPTIONS' USES CAN BE FOUND IN THE FIRST VARIANT DECKLIST)</strong>  -<a data-name=""Mythical Beast Master Cerberus"">Mythical Beast Master Cerberus </a>+This card Searches out Jackal king, Jackal king summons Cerberus, that's a free body (note that it summons it to an extra monster zone so you need to link using it) so after using this, you have a Jackal in extra deck to summon later, and a body to link with, pretty good. -<a data-name=""Symphonic Warrior Guitaar"">Symphonic Warrior Guitaar</a> +This card special summons Miccs, which is a pendulum monster, that also lets you normal summon one more time in addition to your normal summon, and that's obviously very good in this normal summon heavy archetype, moreover it's a free body on the field, and doesn't use your normal summon either! You do have to discard with Guitaar to activate his effect, however, you can always just discard any bricks, or spells that won't make much of an impact/you wouldn't use. <strong>WHAT ARE THOSE TUNERS DOING THERE? </strong>Combo pieces, you'll get to see their use in the videos below. <strong>GAMEPLAN</strong> General gameplan with this deck is just, try to make the best board you can for turn 1, by using your amazing starters, getting free bodies on board, linking into Musesea, getting your scales, pendulum summoning using her effect to go very plus off of all of this, normal summoning if you still have that, making an apollousa and a Masquerena. or whatever else you can afford to go into, and surviving the next turn. After you're done surviving, Dismantle their board and OTK. <strong>BREAD AND BUTTER COMBOS </strong><span><strong><em>GENERIC COMBO</em></strong></span> <a>https://streamable.com/ny7zky</a>  <span><strong><em>3 CARD COMBO (note that they do not have to be those exact cards as long as you can get to them) </em></strong></span><a>https://streamable.com/5l80jz</a>"

Not a particularly strong deck, but a fun one nonetheless.  Fire Flint Lady (searchable with Durendal) and Jogen are both extenders, allowing you to normal summon any warrior type ninja and link into Isolde. Upstart Golden Ninja is a good but vulnerable starter, and it not being once per turn allows you to spam Hanzo and copies of itself from the deck with its own effect to spam monsters for XYZ/link plays, provided there are enough traps in your hand.  Isolde allows you to search Kagen with her first effect, letting you pendulum summon Twilight Ninja Getsuga to summon copies of Hanzo from the GY. Hanzo's ridiculous ability not being once per turn makes it possible to search every ninja card in the deck in one turn if your hand is decent.  Ninja Grandmaster Saizo allows you to set any ninjitsu art card from the deck, which can be used to draw cards via notebook into alchemy, set up a disruption or floodgate with the transformation cards into Amorphage Greed/Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds, or just set the field spell and activate it to provide protection and recursion for the ninjas and ninjutsu arts.  The abundance of search effects makes it possible to bait handtraps from your opponent (although the deck is especially vulnerable at the beginning and dies hard to droll), and allows you to generate insane hand and field advantage, allowing you to link summon Saryuja with four monsters and extend into even more plays, as well as maintaining hand advantage.  The side deck includes other options to shut down other types of decks, with Anti-Spell Fragrance and Dark Simorgh in conjunction with each other allowing you to prevent your opponent from using spells and traps. It also contains a few going second cards, since this deck struggles in that department.  Overall a fun and somewhat quirky deck which is sure to surprise any unprepared opponent.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This deck brings together zombie world, Eldlich and some rather scary ","I like to use either doomking and uni-zombie or golden lord and uni-zombie into halq so that you can bring either of the boss monsters back the following turn with their effects. Then you go into halq, summon glow-up and link it out for linkuribo for glow-up blooms effect to activate in the graveyard to special summon a golden lord or doomking from deck. If conquistador is playable have it activated and ready to be used to synchro summon clear wing once halq has switched out to formula. This combo leaves you with a strong board full of negates and once doomking comes back in the next standby phase if zombie world is on the field, the board becomes almost unbreakable along side a number 23 and a 3500 atk golden lord.  Uni-zombie is pivotal for this deck, discarding the correct cards for the field you need can be orchestrated by this card.  You can summon geomathmech sigma with combo: halq into glow-up. Make sure to have golden lord on the field readily available. Next turn, activate halq into formula, chain both its effects and synchro sigma. For additional destruction, it's best to have guardian of the golden land activate in M1 to target an attack facing monster on the opponent's side of the field so that you can make their attack 0 and go into it with sigma for 6000 damage.  I hope you like my line-up, it mashes many boss monsters together in a convenient way I think. You have many choices and decisions to make when playing this deck, a quality I love. I am still looking to improve my deck and become a better player."

Let's talk about what it's trying to do.  __________________________________________________________________________  This deck wants to go first and flood the board. A sort of.. swarm. We're looking for stuff like Rescue Rabbit, Castor + lswarm, Singing Lanius, Mothman, and Brigandine to get level 4s on the board to XYZ into Force Strix. We almost always want to go Force Strix as our first XYZ to detach for 1) Singing Lanius if you didn't open it, or 2) Strangle if you did. We then want to use those to make Wise Strix to search out Mimicry (any other if you've already drawn it). A good hand will have another extender to let you go into a second Force Strix, pull/ summon Singing. Once you activate the second Force, Wise will draw you RU Soul Shave Force. Activate this to go into CD Infinity. (If you necessarily had to summon a Strangle before you cannot)  End Result?

If you've got Soul/Circle, probably the one that protects your back row. If you don't have that stuff, probably Dark Dragoon. If you're feeling foot-loose and fancy free, bring out the DM Girl Dragon fusion, for style points.

Going minus 2 on every summon, making handtraps hurt like a Kalut in Damage Step, I decided to let other people figure out how to steer the deck.</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">Until then I wanted to give Solfachords a chance. I never played Pendulum but I thought they'd fit in perfectly between my Lyrilusc and Marincess decks so I opened the Deck Constructor on DB and started constructing. Maybe it's my fault for playing them pure, maybe it's my fault for not watching enough Triff Gaming but gosh dang did they feel awful to play. They end on what, a </span><em><span lang=""EN-US"">reactive</span></em><span lang=""EN-US""> monster destruction and a targeted card negate? Not wanting to spend money on even more cards I've never got the hang of I dismissed Ancient Guardians as an overall bad product and simply looked forward to opening them together with some friends (In all conformity with the law! I think).</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">If you're wondering why I've already shared my earliest census without even talking about Ogdoadics that's because I thought they were the worst of the bunch. Having read ""Tribute 3 monsters;"" and the synergy between Kind and Queen with Light and Dark, everyone of which requiring even more tribute fodder, I thought they made Ursarctic's card disadvantage seem attractive.</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">…Well I guess I was wrong. I mean, I was also right. Getting all of these monsters out by their own effect is awful and not how this deck's combo turned out but I'm glad that there's more to them because as I was opening pack after pack I realized just how gorgeous their design is. (Still a fan of Ursarctic's design, if anyone wants to make that deck good, be my guest)</span>  <span lang=""EN-US""> </span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">A new Invoked deck has awoken, as my credit card got revoked.</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">Sorry for the rhyming but it could be worse, I could write in Nickelback songs. </span><span lang=""EN-US"">The preferred engine has established itself very quickly. Ogdoadic's lack of a necessary Normal Summon to start their plays gives way to who's probably the most beloved and despised person in all of the Yugiverse, Aleister. But every Invocation comes with a price, quite literally (I </span><em><span lang=""EN-US"">just</span></em><span lang=""EN-US""> realized that you can play this deck with a single Invocation, making this not much more expensive that buying three Chaos Space). </span>So I decided to opt for some different engines.  The first one's are the Sacred Beasts. Not the Beasts themselves of course but their small little minions. All you need is <a data-name=""Opening of the Spirit Gates"">Opening of the Spirit Gates</a> or <a data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a> for an I:P and another monster to go into Apollousa or to use as tribute fodder for you snakes.  The other engine is the <a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a> engine. Giving you two bodies and 2 cards in hand, one of which is a body for next turn is insane. You can either go into Sphere for an early interrupt on the board and a punish for Nibiru or, in case you drew both engines, you can go into Elpy and Pisty under Apollousa to go into Diabolos to handloop a card. Diabolos is also a level 8 for Dingu or Number 68, which singlehandedly can win you a game against decks that need to summon from the Graveyard. I'm thinking about ditching the Rikka engine to make space for Number 38 but we'll see.  &nbsp;  For now there's not much else to say. It's new, it's fun, it's something.

Salmangreats can easily make a rank 3 with gazelle or a link 3 with gazelle and salamangreat spinny. if you open no salamangreat traps you go for the phantom knight route and mill or send with Cherubini. If you open a salamangreat trap you try to make sunlight wolf and then make your pk plays if you are able to otherwise save it for next turn and set fog blade.  use discard cards such as card and hand destruction to help fix your hand as well as do it selectively.

The deck really full filled all the expactations I had of it and even more. Its a highly debatable version which rewards extending just a little further than usual while also having a hidden tool box with cards most people dont know / expact to see.  And while I know Back to duel ( https://imgur.com/a/Vz9opPZ )  is just some locals which can range from casual to competitive depending who attends, it still shows that the deck can win on a consitant basis, putting it not only on a even length with other versions like Dragunitymaids, Controlmaids or other versions. But also making it a strong contender against Dragonlink ( actually one of the best match ups for this deck ), can challenge any Shadoll version and is flexible enough to counter almost any rouge strat. Best part, you cant lose to mystic mine with this deck, its literall impossible.  A replay so you get an Idea : https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=447320-27026681  The replay isnt using the same list as I show a bit below, but it still shows the combo you want to do, so I will be lazy and keep it as example. Sue me : D  Now lets find something else to combo to. This time we focus on instead of not letting our opponent play, we will just make it so they cant interact with our cards and we throw as many stone in their way as possible. To make it simple I will copy my explantions for each card from the last list, just updated for all thats new.  Also remember, Laundry is the best Maid, even if she is the worst card.  Well I assume you are here to look at one of the endless versions of Dragonmaid decks. Its the reason why this archtype became a fan favorite since its launch. You can play controll, stun, combo, 40 cards, 60 cards. Throw pots in, or throw them out ones you see that there is no money left after buying 3 Hospitality. Orrrr you are here for the waifus. Hey I dont judge, aslong as we agree that Drident is best maid.  Lets go over it card by card and talk about the goal we have with this deck.  The dragonmaid core :  3 Chamber : Searches you the fusion spell, hospi to extend, tidying to extend if you have ravine or to set for controll. She is one of the 1 card sphere maker and what is really important, she is the only one able to summon the fusion maids from grave at the start of the bp.  3 Parlor : Basically works the same as chamber and does almost all the same. Only difference she can send tidying directly for combo, but cant gets its controll eff. However if you already have extender in hand she is a good way to get nurse or any other maid you may need later to grave. Also a 1 card sphere  1 Nurse : She is one of the cards holding the deck together. Overworked nurses are sadly also part in a fantasy card game, thats why you want to use her every turn to extend and summon more maids. She is basically a flat +1 or +2 everytime you summon her ones the grave is set.  2 Changeover : Your fusion spell to go into the gem of the deck Dragonmaid Sheou/Strahl, or House when you are lead down the dark path of VFD. Important to remember for the gy effect, even if the target leaves the board, you still add changeover to hand.  3 Hospitality : Probably one of the most broken extender to ever be printed. Set up your grave, non target summon from hand and gy. Searchable and one activation a turn no use. Sadly the price tag is justified, but dont buy it if you can avoid. Dont let people sky rock the price and gate people out. the reprint is coming !  3 Tidiyng : Looping cards back to hand and in best case triggering your House is always good, but non target summon from hand or gy in etiher players turn while being searchable by two cards ? This card should be the 40$ one~ Also REMEMBER the targets once targeted dont need to stay on board to resolve. You can tar sphere, chain sphere and bounce 2 cards.  &nbsp;  Rokket :  2 Tracer : Its tracer, it summons another rokket for a free  Savage Dragon, and can be summoned by quick launch. Yeah, I dont know how quick launch and this can exist at the same time. Also its a 1 card I:P , allows you to do guardragon through hand traps and is always a combo saver / extender / starter.  1 Absoruter : As we play Ravine we love discarding things that also give us free cards back so this card is already good for us, but it can also work as a mini noctovision dragon if we have a rokket on board. Dragon, free summon and search? Sign me up  1 Silver : Wont come up often but the banish eff can be nice. ( Update : after maybe 50 games, the banish eff still never came up. Still a different name so we keep it)  1 Recharger : target for quicklaunch and tracer, but also can work with striker dragon eff to recycle a tracer back to hand and summon 2 of boot sector <ol>  	<li>Boot Sector : Summon striker, search this spam rokkets. Simple</li> </ol> Dragons :  3 Noctovision : Make striker = free summon. Simple. gives you a extra draw and protects your set tidying when in grave, this card is basically a dragonmaid. Since its release its been probably the most played card which isnt part of the archtype.  2 Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay : With dragon link and other link decks running around, its just a nice card to have, also it fixed goddess weakness of being targeted + its a high level dragon to fusion. Also it lets you dig for super poly and other cards which may save your day when the opponent starts playing solitair.  1 Dragons Ravine : Search of Romulus and dumb extender and send extender. Or send Gram for another big body. Also cleans your hand of cards you dont want to have there  1 Tempest 1 Gold Sako : Simple combo to search Gram or Parlor  1 Fallen of Albaz : You summon him of Sphere most of the time and just poly away their boss Monster for a titanclad, its a easy dragoon out, as if they negate sphere bounce you just summon him and fusion dragoon away. Its probably my favorite non maid in this deck.  1 Dragunity Gram : Lets not lie to each other. This card is just a Dragon Ruler in disguise, you cant fool us Gram. But we gladly welcome him as he is extender with a negate packed to it.  Hand traps : 3 Ash + Super poly/ Nibiru . Super poly is king in this deck as we can also use it during the BP to get a bit more damage on board, while it also just ruins dragonlinks day, and annoys shadoll / invoked to no compare.  Extra :  1x Dragonmaid Sheou : Its your best card, its your free summon omni negate, waifu, dragon. Also we play only one because she shuffels herself back.  2x House Dragonmaid : So we can use Sheou omni negate, or pop a whole opponents board. We can shuffel her back and usually dont need more  1x Borrel Savage : Omni negate, whats to say. Sadly not a maid  1x Titanclad the Ashdragon : Summon of Albaz to remove a boss monster or if its send by maximus to get you a free albaz to combo with / fusion into venom dragon  1x Starving Venom Dragon : Its a awesome super poly / fallen of Albaz target. While also a threat to the board right after being summoned.  1x Romulus : Searches Dragon Ravine for you and is a good link 2 target with good zones  1x Pitsy and Elpy : The extender dragons which hopefully get banned soon. Usually made with Nurse + any maid  1x Sphere : One of the stronges interrupts in the game + free summon from deck + good zones + being a dragon + 1 card out to dragoon  1x I:p  : We need her to link summon in the opponents turn + she is dark so rokket is a 1 card combo to her  1x Trishula : Not to sure if we keep him around. Its a nice fusion target, it gives us a free search and lets us take our opponents good cards away. Also it gives the guardragons a good use if we dont go for five head. You can exchange him for another Pitsy if you want, which would be live under five head.  1x Striker Dragon : link 1. dragon. searches boot sector launch. the only thing this thing misses is a it pointing downwards  1x Underworld Goddess of the Closed World : The new card we try to abuse, or atleast flex with. We usually will always summon her with I:p but its not to hard  summon her with all the dragons and maids rotating at all times. She also doesnt care about DRM and all the annoying things being played. Laughing at Dragoon with her only being outed in battle  1x Link God Dragon/ Fiveheaded Link Dragon : We want to make him almost every turn, as your opponent will 99,99% not play anything that can out this thing. You will have a full grave for atleast 3-4 turns were you could just sit on it , but as you play maids, you will just combo again and again with a 5k beater who cant be stopped.  &nbsp;  All in all this deck is just learning which card leads to which combo, but the end board you should aim for is usually Sphere + Sheou or ones you know the cards a little better you can end on  Borrel Savage + I:P + Five headed link dragon + Sheou = I:P + the maids summoned by Shoeu go into the new Link 5 and steal another Monster from the opponent  Borrel Savage + Sphere + Sheou  or if we eat to many hand traps, just a classic Sphere + Sheou  &nbsp;  Afterwords : I am happy with how this deck developed over the past weeks and I think its close to being as good as this version can be. The deck rewards you for making decisions in either players turn while also having straight goals which you play towards. But in the end the best part of this deck is, having your opponents scoop instantly after playing five head / no fully realizing how immun it is / not wanting to belive what they read for a moment, while than seeing that they are now on the glock to out this thing or lose.  I think in all my games only 1-2 Persons were able to win after it was summoned. One was just stalling until I ran out of cards to banish other was a Kaiju top deck. So its still a good average of staying and winning you the game.  &nbsp;  And thats my crap guide to Dragonmaid, you welcome.  &nbsp;"

Let me tell you that Toons can and are very deceiving. While it's not a top-tier meta deck Toons are unpredictable and you can often pull out surprising results.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">I'll go over all the cards in the deck and why we play them</span> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">FAQs at the bottom</span></strong> <span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">T</span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">oon Ancient Gear Golem&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">- A worse version of Toon BLS in every way so why do we run it you might ask? I like to go into rank 8 XYZ monsters quite often so having a different level 8 monsters to search out with Toon Page-Flip makes it easier. But like I said it's a worse Toon BLS so we run an extra in the side deck so you can switch it out if not needed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">0-1 Copies</span></strong> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Toon Black Luster Soldier&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">- The BEST card in the deck maybe besides Toon Dark Magician. Can attack the same turn it's summoned(which is only toon card able to do so). Can be special summoned from the hand by sending cards to the grave in the hand or field whose level is 8 or more. So you could bring this card out the first turn if you wanted to. Also can banish any card on the field at the cost of not being able to attack that turn&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">2-3 Copies</span></strong> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Toon Dark Magician</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;- Another card that can be considered the best card in the deck. By discarding one Toon card you can special summon ANY Toon monster from the deck except itself (great for comboing with Red Eyes). Also instead of special summoning, you can add any Toon spell/trap to your hand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">3 Copies</span></strong> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Toon Red-Eyes Black Dragon</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;- Lets you special summon any Toon monster from the hand. Easy to bring out with Black Stone of Legend or Toon Dark Magician.

It's an old Class A toon monster though so besides going into Bahamut Shark or using it as tribute fodder(If you have to do that) it's sort of useless but, it's a free summon.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">2-3 Copies</span></strong> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Toon Harpie Lady</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;- Another card that can be special summoned from the hand plus the bonus of destroying a spell/trap card if you control another Toon Monster.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">3 Copies</span></strong> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">The Black Stone of Legend</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;- Lets you bring out a Toon Red-Eyes from the deck which in turn lets you special summon another Toon from the Hand.

You almost always can get Toon Kingdom on the first turn so that gives all you Toons protection. It also lets you set up your amazing traps. Going second does have its benefits like being able to Comic Hand your opponent's boss monster for an OTK but overall I would say&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">First</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">.</span> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Are Toons Bad?</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;Before the support yes but after...mostly yes.</span> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Should I Attack Directly?</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;I do most of the time. Unless your opponent has an obvious combo piece of the field. Don't forget about BLS's banish too.</span> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">When To Go Into Extra Deck Monsters?</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;For the most part, you aren't unless you can OTK with Number 100. Being able to attack directly every turn will hurt any deck but that doesn't mean it isn't there. The extra deck is mainly for protection so use it when needed.</span> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">How to deal with MTS/Cosmic Vortex/Harpies</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Duster?&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">I'll be real with you for a second, your Toon World WILL be destroyed a lot. But, unlike old toon decks at least your monsters don't get destroyed. You can only try and prevent this by getting as many Toon Bookmark's in the grave as possible so always go TToC-&gt;Toon Bookmark-&gt;Desired Card.</span></p>"

I do not own the deck nor am I the person who made this variant! I simply enjoy this variant and tweaked with the ratios a little bit.</strong>  The original video:<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sasLW7AenE</a>  Hello everyone! Dig Benis here, and today, I come at you with a <em>heavily </em>unexplored variant of Ogdoadic which I feel needs a little bit of love. To sum up what this description is going to be, it essentially will tell you which version is better (with a little bias), one of it's combos, and of course the meaning of the engines played (as I'm a little too lazy to give a reason for every card in the deck), one more thing is in the end, I will suggest some cards you could play otherwise in the overall deck. And now, without further ado, lets start. <p><strong>The Combo</strong></p>       So to start off, we will start with the combo. This combo will be a copy of <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare and a copy of Snake Rain. To start this off we will activate Snake Rain to go ahead and discard the copy of Knightmare to pitch Aleirtt, Keurse,  Nunu, and Nauya.</a> Then, with the effect of Nunu (since we control no monsters) we can special summon it. Then we will summon Keurse from the graveyard by tributing the Nunu (causing it to be banished via it's effect) and activating it's effect to bring back Nauya from the graveyard, which will use it's effect on summon to search for Water Lily from the deck. Next we will use Knightmare's effect to banish itself to send a copy of World Wand to the graveyard (the target doesn't matter, as we are going first and aiming to link away the monsters on field as of right now. And now we shall use World Wand to banish itself to bring back Knightmare. Next we will use Nauya and Knightmare for the summon of Galatea (Nauya will be banished because of Keurse), who will use her effect to shuffle away the World Wand to be able to set a copy of the field spell, Orcustrated Babel, from the deck to the field zone. We will (of course) activate the field spell, which will allow us to have a decent amount of disruption in the graveyard, which will bypass any Dark Ruler No More or Forbidden Droplets thrown at our board at the end of the combo. Now, using Galatea, we will be able to make Dingirsu without properly Xyz summoning it, and then tribute it for the summon of Aleirtt. Now we will use the effect of Aleirtt to return the banished cards into our graveyard, further putting more utility into the graveyard. Then you would either link them into an I:P or a Verte Anaconda. The Dragoon package is something I will further elaborate on later during the deck description. Now, to label the disruptions, we have Knightmare to send Skeleton, then Skeleton to revive Ding to non target <strong>send </strong>to the graveyard, which means any monster that either has protection from targeting or destruction, will just be sent. Making this a better board than the Invoked board (also more of that later on). Now, even if they out the board and we manage to survive, our follow up play is to activate the Water Lily we searched earlier in the combo, to send and special the Ogdoabyss Overlord man to nuke the board, which is nice, and in addition to that, we can do the plays with the snakes that we did earlier, again. Since Nunu can special itself even if we have a reptile on the board as opposed to the no monsters on the board.  &nbsp; <p><strong>The Comparisons and the Explanations</strong></p> &nbsp;  Now, we begin our next section. The comparisons. Now, we will be comparing this variant to the other two that have solidified itself. Invoked Ogdoadic, and the Ogdoadic FTK. Now right off the bat I can say without any hesitance that this variant is better than the FTK variant, as it is a deck that works game one, won't succeed in games two and three, as this deck has so many choke points, it's not funny. Another thing to bring up is how easy it is to disrupt the FTK since it's, well, and FTK. Next is a slightly harder comparison, the Invoked Ogdoadic version of the deck, I can say that it is better, since it provides the same follow up play, but better forms of disruption before, and it's semi-immunity to DRNM and Forbidden Drip. While anything with the Invoked engine is at least tier 3, it's just not that good, seeing as they also have a normal summon they could disrupt. And the combo we perform doesn't need a normal summon (something I just realized as I'm typing this bit). Anyway, lets move on the engines of this deck. <p><em>Orcust</em></p> I decided to play the Orcust engine for it's synergy with using the graveyard with the serpents. I also favor this engine as it allows us to have somewhat less linear plays than the other variants, and they provide disruption that although is weak to things such as D.D. Crow and Lancea, can be helpful when your board eats a going second card such as DRNM or Forbidden Drip. Overall, I like this engine a lot and definitely recommend this to any Ogdoadic player to try out. <p><em>Ogdoadic</em></p> I chose this engine to mix with Orcust as, stated before, the archetypes have synergy with themselves, seeing as both of them provide their plays in the graveyard, and are less linear than most strategies in my opinion. They have a fun boss monster that can nuke the board and are the first competent reptile archetype to take advantage of Snake Rain. <p><em>Shaddoll</em></p> <p>I played the Shaddoll package as a way for this deck to play going second, as this deck isn't always guaranteed to go first (unless you're a god at winning the dice roll, in that case, teach me your ways) and provides neat interactions. Shaddoll Fusion is just a great card as it lets you send from deck to fulfill a fusion summon if your opponent controls a face up monster from the extra deck, something almost every deck in Yu-Gi-Oh usually ends on. Genius and Dragon are neat as well as since they were sent off of Fusion, which happens to be by card effect, they can negate the effects of a face up monster on their side (though if you play that card in this deck, then you better plan on making something else) and to pop a spell/trap on the field. The fusion you would be making is Apkallone, which has the effect to negate a face up <em>card </em>on the field, which can be helpful in some instances. Overall, I can say this engine has done me well, though you could possibly brick on the Shaddolls sometimes.</p> &nbsp; <p><strong>The Alternative Options</strong></p> This will tell you alternatives for the cards throughout the deck (Main, Side, and Extra)  &nbsp;  Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight - Dark Grepher, Armageddon Knight, Reinforcement of the Army  I would recommend this as a budget alternative to this card, as these cards provide a similar role to it, that being the ability to access the normal summon that can send Orcust monsters from the deck to the graveyard. They do provide a better utility as with Dark Grepher can get rid of cards from your hand to provide a decent trade off. Armageddon Knight simply just sends a DARK monster from deck to grave, sweet and simple. Reinforcement of the Army allows you to add one of these cards from your deck to hand.  &nbsp;  Forbidden Droplets - Dark Ruler No More  Dark Ruler does provide the same role as Droplets, though at the disadvantage due to you not being able to inflict damage after the card resolves, while Droplet sends cards from your hand to graveyard, which in this deck is super useful, since you want more cards in graveyards.  &nbsp;  Accesscode Talker - Topologic Zeroboros  Zeroboros can provide a neat little disruption, the ability to banish the entire board. Something that Accesscode can't do. And its like Dingirsu and how it doesn't target or destroy anything, this time a little stronger as nothing hits the graveyard either. I genuinely wonder why this card hasn't been seeing play in a myriad of different decks for it's useful boardwipe-esque effect. It also can bring itself back in the following Standby Phase, and it gains attack for each banished card (x200) and starts off with a 3k body, which isn't even that bad.  &nbsp;  Lightning Storm - Cosmic Cyclone, Twin Twisters, Harpie's Feather Duster, Hey Trunade!  They all remove backrow, Cosmic requires you to pay life points but it banishes the card instead of sending it to graveyard, therefore acting as a one for one. Twin Twisters can act as a two for two, requiring a discard (which this deck will take any day of the week) and hits two backrow, though they do go to the graveyard. Harpie's Feather Duster is the second effect of Lightning Storm and just destroys all backrow from your opponent's side of the board. Hey Trunade is my preferred pick as it bounces all set spells and traps to hand, easily winning you many backrow heavy matchups like Eldlich and Paleofrog. Unless they have the Solemn Judgement (every game I used this card, they have a Judgement...).  &nbsp;  I:P, Unicorn, 2 Allures, and one Super Poly - Dragoon package  I don't like the Dragoon package in this deck, but you can run this if you want to make life harder for you to create the entire deck. This is more of a Budgetless Alternative as the package costs more than the cards it replaces. There is nothing really to say about this, since Dragoon is a towers negate that gains 1k each time it negates something, discards (something this deck is very fond of), and burns your opponent going second. Verte easily makes this at the cost of 2k life points and two monsters. Overall, don't be a meanie and play this engine.  &nbsp; <p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></p> <p>I would like to round out this deck with a question, a poll at the end if you will. The question being, What is your favorite version of a deck that you feel is unexplored and less recognized than the others? Any constructive criticism would be nice in the comments below.</p> Now on the overall deck, it could be better. It might not be the best variant in everyone's eyes, but I can see this variant peeping through the cracks of rouge and making a splash there. The consistency of the deck may be weaker than the Invoked variant but the end result of this combo it can pull off regularly is fantastic. I give this deck an 8.5/10, as it does have choke points, and loses against most graveyard disruptions (Crow, Abyss Dweller) and Lancea. Anyway, I think I have had your attention for a good enough portion of your day. Comment below what you might want to see me profile, and until next time.  &nbsp; <p><em>Arriverderci~</em></p>"
