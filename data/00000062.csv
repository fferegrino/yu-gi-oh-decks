Clearly, the game is balanced exactly as John Konami intended. This list is pretty straight forward as far as the deckbuilding goes, with a side deck included for cards I've been considering swapping in. Lancea for the mirror, Allure for more draw power and banish value, and TB to help extend hands of ""Normal White Rabbit"" further. So far though, I've been enjoying the deck as-is. TB-11 and Allure open up more vulnerablities to Ash and Droll. With Lancea, I would likely swap them in for the Imperms, but losing a decent negate when going second for a dead card against most other decks doesn't feel great. Weigh the pros and cons as you will.</p>"

Same line can pitch Clockwork Knight to search Regulus for an omni (BEATS NIBIRU), or it can be left on field as a floodgate, or a Crystron can pop it. More machines on board helps make Qliphort Genius prior to Tristaros effect to summon 2 from deck; also searches Regulus. Nachster in hand can pitch Crystrons for grave effects. Running more than 40 to hide bricks like Cyberdark Chimera and Power Bond. Ideal endboard going first (Cyberdark Realm + Smiger in hand or grave) can end on S:P, Heosvarog, Regulus, Infinity, Dragster, Tristaros, and Cluster. Tristaros can't activate immediately but Heosvarog and Regulus both jump off the board when they use their negates.</p><p>I've found Crystron can have some difficulty OTKing after playing through opponent's interaction - this list can generate a lot more damage, particularly due to funny synergies like where Nova can bring back Nachster from grave, which then can summon Eleskeletus since it has 2100 DEF, and Eleskeletus debuffs the opponent's ATK/DEF by 500. Nova can then banish that Nachster to gain 2100 - with Eleskeletus and Clockwork Night, you can beat over almost anything.</p><p>Tried running Core but didn't love that it used the normal and is such an easy choke point. Obviously some Crystron hands don't need to normal but it's a lot stronger and more versatile if they can.</p><p>Would run Charmies and Thrust for more going second options if I owned them.

Inspired by AllPureYGO's YouTube video where he plays against a friend playing a Skill Drain Turbo deck. Check him out if you're interested!: <a title=""Edison Format Gravekeeper's Deck vs Skill Drain Turbo | YuGiOh!

Full Duel Match Games | June 2025</a></p><p>And if you bother to read this and have any questions and/or recommendations for possible card inclusions, I'd love to hear them!</p><p>Disclaimer!: This deck is a fun, non-meta deck, created by an amateur deckbuilder who just started playing Edison this year with another deckbuilding friend named Petrichor. Misplays are embarrassingly common with us, so don't expect a fine-tuned machine of a deck that you can build and start taking names with at an RBET or anything.</p><p>Prime Time!:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Main Deck (40)</strong></p><hr /><p><strong>Beast King Barbaros x3</strong></p><p><strong>Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast x3</strong></p><p>These are the two ace monsters of the deck. There's something special about normal summoning a 2800 or 3000ATK monster while under Skill Drain or with Forbidden Chalice set on the field. They feel almost made to be abused by such cards. So of course, they see play here at three.</p><p><strong>Gorz the Emissary of Darkness x1</strong></p><p>Just a good card. Everyone playing Edison knows Gorz. Everyone playing Edison loves Gorz, unless its your opponent's Gorz. He can singlehandedly turn games you were losing right around, and is the reason why many Edison players properly sequence their attacks when their opponent has no cards on the field. you never know when Gorz might get dropped down. His inclusion needs no explanation in most decks, but I gave one anyway for new or returning Yugioh players.</p><p><strong>Machina Force x1</strong></p><p><strong>Machina Fortress x3</strong></p><p><strong>Machina Gearframe x3</strong></p><p>Machine decks are a thing in Edison because of these cards. They're just so strong. Your best first turn is often to just normal a Gearframe, add a Fortress to your hand, special summon Fortress by discarding it and another machine monster to the grave (it can send ITSELF to the graveyard from the hand to special summon itself from the graveyard, which is wild, and non-intuitive when first reading the card), then equipping Gearframe to Fortress to protect it for a turn, Bonus points if you set a Skill Drain on the field. Skill Drain stops Gearframe from activating, but not Fortress from special summoning itself from the hand or graveyard. Machina Force is a garnet that you can tutor with Gearframe and sac to ss a Fortress in grave.</p><p><strong>Cyber Dragon x2</strong></p><p>It's a Machine, it can special summon itself under Skill Drain, 2100ATK is higher than most normal summons, it can out other Machine decks by contact fusing into Chimeratech Fortress Dragon, and this sentence is getting long, so 'nuff said.</p><p><strong>Thunder King Rai-Oh x2</strong></p><p>Rai-Oh is a 1900ATK beater under Skill Drain whose negation effect is not actually negated by Skill Drain, since he's tributed for cost. That means if your opponent can special summon something bigger than this, Fusilier, or Fortress while under Skill Drain, you can use Rai-Oh to negate that special summon.</p><p><strong>Plaguespreader Zombie x1</strong></p><p>I like having access to synchro plays or the extra deck in general in most of my decks, and Plague plays around Skill Drain since its special summoning effect activates in grave. Plague + Brain Control can also act as removal and allow for synchro plays that wouldn't otherwise be possible (Level 8 synchros, Ally, or Armory Arm). It can easily be cut for something else if you don't value that, however.</p><p><strong>Forbidden Chalice x3&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Skill Drain x2</strong></p><p>The bread-and-butter of your deck. You'd play 3 Skill Drains if it were allowed, but it's semi-limited. Skill Drain shuts off all monster effects while they're face-up on the field. That means no Caius effect, no DAD effect, Brionac can activate and discard, but not bounce, Gorz and ChaoSorc can special summon themselves but have no effect while on the field, - essentially, all face-up monsters are normal monsters now. And with Barbaros and Fusilier, your monsters are often the biggest kids on the block.</p><p>Forbidden Chalice, meanwhile, does what Skill Drain does but only once for a single target. That's still REALLY good, and surprisingly versatile. You can normal a Barbaros or Fusilier and attack with a 3400 or 3200ATK monster respectively, set it and use it as a combat trick when your opponent attacks your monster, or use it against you opponent's monster and negate its effects. Playing it at 3 is absolutely essential.</p><p><strong>Brain Control x1</strong></p><p><strong>Heavy Storm x1</strong></p><p><strong>Mystical Space Typhoon x1</strong></p><p><strong>Smashing Ground x2</strong></p><p><strong>Mirror Force x1</strong></p><p><strong>Solemn Judgment x1</strong></p><p><strong>Torrential Tribute x1</strong></p><p><strong>Trap Dustshoot x1</strong></p><p><strong>Bottomless Trap Hole x2</strong></p><p><strong>Compulsory Evacuation Device x3</strong></p><p>This is your removal loadout, intended to clear the way so your big beaters can beat face. They all see heavy play in plenty of Edison decks. They're pretty self-explanatory, so I don't feel the need to explain them as much as other includes.</p><p><strong>Call of the Haunted x1</strong></p><p>Good card. It can reborn Barbaros or Fusilier at full strength.</p><p><strong>Starlight Road x1</strong></p><p>This deck plays a lot of traps, so a good way to not get blown out by a Heavy Storm is having a Starlight set along with your other traps and spells. It can also protect your board from a Mirror Force or Torrential Tribute. I love this card, so I'm a little biased, but it really works well in this deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Extra Deck (15)</strong></p><hr /><p>This is a pretty standard Extra Deck for Edison so there isn't much to talk about here. You play 2 <strong>Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</strong> because of Cyber Dragon, 2 <strong>Stardust Dragon</strong> because of Starlight Road in the main and side deck, and primarily level 6 synchros because it's the easiest to summon with Plague + Gearframe or Rai-Oh. You're not really a dedicated synchro deck, so they're mostly there on the off chance you do manage to synchro summon and to not telegraph that your extra deck is more often than not inaccessible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Side Deck (15)</strong></p><hr /><p>I don't really know how to build a side deck, lol. So this is subject to change. So I'll just talk about the cards I think will remain: <strong>D.D Crow</strong> is a hand trap for your opponent's graveyard. Really good side deck option. <strong>Book of Moon</strong> is incredibly versatile, but doesn't actually remove creatures off the field like the removal in the main deck. There's an extra <strong>Starlight Road </strong>if you really need the extra protection. And <strong>Dust Tornado</strong> if you need more Spell/Trap removal.</p><p><strong>Royal Oppression</strong> can be really good in this deck as well. Barbaros and Fusilier are normal summoned, so if you can stick one, Skill Drain or Forbidden Chalice it, and set an Oppression, some decks just can't out that without special summoning a monster.

Chef's absolutely cracked and allows us plays through both Droll and Fuwalos (although the through-Droll plays aren't exactly super powerful, and require either hand setup or a read that Droll is about to drop), Recipe Book is an MVP in time scenarios and allows us to deal lethal without relying on game-enders such as Accesscode or Link Nephthys, and Angry is a nice consistency boost.</p><p>For a pure build, I would really recommend a small Nadir package - 3 Servant, 1 Maximus. Nadir Servant is actually a 1-card combo to a very basic board here, since you can Servant pitch Garura add Maximus, Garura draw 1, Maximus banish Garura special self, Maximus send Arc Light + Shuraig, Shuraig add Buerillabaise, Arc Light add Angry Burger, Angry add Chef, Chef add Restaurant, Restaurant add Fish Recipe, Fish Recipe Ritual Buerillabaise tributing Maximus. Obviously, you'd modify the combo based on what you have and don't have, but it's a very flexible card here that can be both starter and breaker depending on what you send. Ultimate Slayer is also added here as non-engine to synergize, since they use the same Extra Deck pitch tools.</p><p>The only thing I've been wavering on is the other non-engine slots. Fuwa and Ash are obviously staples, but I haven't decided on whether the current slate of non-engine or their ratios is correct. Right now it's fairly defensive, using Called By and Crossout (+ 1-ofs), with more of the power traps in Side, but I could see the argument for moving the other Drolls and Nibs into Main while putting cards like Sales Ban in the side to insulate from Droll.</p><p>I'm feeling fairly good with this build, though. Took it to the Premiere event, did very well. I'll probably build a Fiendsmith variant after the banlist drops - that seems to have the best synergy. But for now, I'm happy with this.</p>"

Super fun deck. Great synergy with Fiendsmith. Able to banish Requiem for Dogmatika plays in a pinch. Ideally can play through 3 Imperms with all 3 engine pieces in hand. Start with Aleister normal summon Invoked combo for Mechaba (Anti-Niburu) (Almiraj in grave for Dogmatika plays). If interruped you begin your Fiendsmith combo with either Engraver or Tract. If that play is interrupted you can then activate Nadir Servant to banish an extra deck monster to start your Dogmatika plays. If you began with the Aleister combo, even if Aleister was negated you will have Almiraj in GY to banish for Dogmatika plays. If no Almiraj in GY, send your worst fusion monster or ED monster with Nadir Servant, as it will get banished anyways with the Dogmatika play. So send Elysium usually. If going second you can send Apkallone to GY with Nadir Servant to add one of the Shaddoll main deck monsters. As once discarded by Apkallone's effect, will either negate a monster, or pop back row. Dogmatika plays are always final in the chain of events due to lockout ED summoning. Of which even Nadir Servant must be activated final as well due to same restriction/lockout. Dogmatika Punishment seems like a bad card for the deck, however if all you draw is Ecclesia and hand traps or Ecclesia and board breakers, it works in a pinch if you can't get your combo going. You can however link off Ash into Almiraj, then Almiraj into Secure Gardna to Start your Dogmatika plays with Ecclesia.</p><p>Ideal starter formation:</p><p>Invoked - Fiendsmith - Dogmatika</p><p>Invoked - Fiendsmith</p><p>Fiendsmith - Dogmatika</p><p>Shaddoll engine added once Apkallone is sent to GY through Dogmatika plays to add Schism.

With at least twelve 1.5 card starters, some made better if you open certain extenders with plenty of room for non-engine, you get a deck that can make a competent half-board through Droll and consistent Nib-free combos. What's more, is that your main combo can searcgh Gamma or Delta, some of the best handtraps the game as seen.</p><p>I also feel like the ratios are perfect. Three of each 1.5 card starter, three Foxy Tune, which does require more hand economy and makes a slightly worse board, but very slightly, and three Parallel to play through Imperms or any other monster negates. It's no Ryzeal or Maliss, but with how unlikely it is that this deck will be directly impacted by the banlist and how cheap it is (minus some handtraps and Rising Scale), it's a deck I'd recommend.</p>"

MST itself has a tiny bit of utility in popping your own Area Zero, but otherwise since you have 6-7 cards that search it, and considering how Striker's run Cosmic Cyclone before, it's honestly a more flexible option over Jamming Waves.

This format is compatible for 2-4 players.</p><p>This deck built from the Salamangreat archetype is a starting point to understand the format and should not be considered competitive-focused.

This format is compatible for 2-4 players.</p><p>This deck built from the Atlantean and Mermail archetypes is a starting point to understand the format and should not be considered competitive-focused. It primarily focuses on bringing out your XYZ monsters and swarming the field with monsters while also recycling them to your deck and hand, often with high risk, high reward tactics. Worldsea Dragon Zealantis is the avacard.</p><p>More information, including a link to the rulebook for the format, is forthcoming. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://discord.gg/MmJZVwEYaA"">Join the discord for more info!</a></p>"

Work in progress.","<p>Some of you may be wondering what's so manly about this deck. It originally started out as a Charmer deck, but once I added Dark Doriado as the Deck Master, I realized that I could now run a card I've always wanted to use... Weather Report! The card is a gimmick at best, but a retired Yugituber known as Yugioh4RealMen had a video where he would use this card alongside Exchange and Swords of Revealing Light to trick opponents into giving him a second battle phase. Also, I'm running a pre-errata Darkness Approaches, since it was the only card that places cards in face-down attack position.<br /><br />This deck is not just gimmicks, mind you. Subterrors can be effective when they work and you have enough flip support to potentially control something with the Charmers. I'm also rather fond of the Wake Cups, and should you play into the only Thunder monster in the deck, Thunder Dragon Colossus is an option as well! I think there is potential here, but this deck could use just a little bit more gas. I'll try to make a few tweaks later on, and hopefully find a way to reliably search out the Weather Control combo.</p>"

Nekomusume + Night locks any  Level 4 or more face-down. Fairy reuses cards and revives monsters.,<p>A really strong Ghostrick deck I built.<br /><br />Nekomusume + Ghostrick Night makes a lockdown. Any monster Level 4 or higher summoned by opponent is locked facedown immediately.<br /><br />Fairy can help with reusing cards such as Nekomusume or your backrow if something happens to them. She can also fetch Ghostrick Night giving you 4 1-turn board protections per Duel. When she is flipped face-up she can also flip enemy monsters face-down. If something happens to Fairy you can use Break to get her back.<br /><br />Doll can be useful be she is also a double-edged sword. If you use her correctly you can flip enemy monsters face-down at the end of the turn and also use her effect to summon Ghostrick from Deck. Her first effect can set your Ghostricks down so you can lose the Night lock you have established. Preffered in early game.<br /><br />Skeleton can mill opponent Deck for alt win-con. If you have field setup you can mill a lot of cards and make your opponent lose very fast(up to 6 cards per turn in some cases even opponent's turn).<br /><br />Ghoul is for those monsters you can't target and which you can't get rid of with Socuteboss. You can make him or another Ghostrick massive ATK at Main Phase 1 then wipe the boss.<br /><br />Getting Parade or Angel of Mischief out is something you should strive for as soon as possible. They let you get your setup and lockdown tools.<br /><br />Aim to utilize Ghostricks' Flip effects as much as possible even during opponent's turn using Go-Round. Or during your turn you can put your Ghostricks face-down then enter a Battle Phase just to use Go-Round to put enemy monsters face-down.<br /><br /><br />I play a lot of matches with myself and honestly I don't know how someone beats this without using Link monsters which can't be set face-down therefore cheating their way around this deck.</p>

Vanquish Soul may increase the ceiling of the deck, and does give you more in-engine ways to play Turn 0, but it's also complicated. You got to add, return, and even not play the cards in your hand to get the most out of the Vanquish Soul cards, and there's a lot of little ways that's rewarding, but sometimes you want a scalpel, and sometimes you want a hammer. I just found I was enjoying playing with the K9 half of the deck more than the Vanquish Soul half, and while having only 6 cards you typically want to play presented an interesting deckbuilding challenge, I wanted to see what a purer version of K9 might look like. I really wanted an excuse to play 3 K9 Case and 3 Chaotic Elements, so here it is.</p><p>Somewhere midway through testing various level 5 extenders, I encountered Kozmoll Dark Lady. Exactly Jokull can summon her from your hand, giving you even more insulation against various monster effects. The deck already beats Nibiru by summoning Ripper on 3,4, or 5 summons, but with one of these it beats Nibiru + Veiler, and often beats Droll as well. It's slighly bricky, especially when you see multiples, and you will lose some games to bricking out on them. However, the only other bricks in your deck are the maindeck Purulia, and honestly Overlay Booster and Ready Fusion are just not quality extenders in the modern game. Somewhere through that process of testing Dark Lady, I came to a few conclusions. The first was that Tribute Summoning Dark Lady was not just reasonable, but actively good. The second was that I needed more starters. I tried to test with 1 Dark Lady and the Seventh Tachyon Package. This package was sweet in the deck, by holding back on it for the right moment you could either search your dark monsters. Ultimately I cut all of my bad extenders and ran 3 Dark Lady again. You really want to naturally see the Lady in a lot of situations, so even though it's occasionally a brick, it's not really a searchable card with engine (3 Seventh Tachyon are not really ""engine"" in a sense"", not if you search Dark Lady) it really is a card where if you're running it you should probably run 3.</p><p>The deck basically puts up boards of Rank 5 XYZ monsters, notably Ripper, Vallon, plus K9 - EX Forced Liberation to rank-up into Werewolf after you burn your negate. Some boards also put up Constellar Pleiades, sometimes as early as turn 0. It also ranks rank 5s up to Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer into Zeus, and with Lupus attached your monsters have targeting protection very often. Another board I like to set up, and sometimes it's just part of a board, but you set up twin Rippers with the rank-up. These boards are often backed by Vallon and/or Dark Lady. That board means you can one of your Rippers to add on your turn, another Ripper to negate on your turn, then in the draw phase make Wereworlf to snipe their hand. From that moment you have perfect, or at least near perfect, information about what your opponent is playing and what they opened, and you've probably already burnt them out of some resources. This gives you the data you need to figure out the Dark Lady and Ripper chokepoints, but it is at the cost of 1-2 interruptions. It can also be useful going second, to make a Ripper and a Werewolf before the batter phase without losing to Nib.</p><p>I might come back and do combo tutorials, but they're all pretty obvious, that's one thing I actually like about this version from a competitive perspective. It's easier to play than VS, and significantly easier at that.</p><p>So first of all, let's talk about our Rotas. You have 9 cards that are solely here to search cards</p><p><strong>ROTAs</strong></p><p>3x Chaotic Elements</p><p>1x Seventh Tachyon</p><p>2x Seventh Ascension</p><p>3x Case of K9</p><p>Chaotic Elements was always going to be good some day. Theoretically the GY effect could come up in a grind game, but it's mostly irrelevant. The bonus effect could also come up in a grindgame, and is also mostly irrelevant. This searches the Dark K9 monsters, Jokull, and Lantern. Neither of these are one card starters, and this deck actually has none. Wild right? You need to see two different cards to combo. Chaotic Elements helps you see Jokull more often, and also can search Lantern whenever you see Jokull, so I think it's well worth the slot. You don't have a lot of K9 monsters in the archetype, so you need to maximize your odds of seeing them.</p><p>Seventh Tachyon searches any of your K9 monsters, and also searches Dark Lady if you have exactly Jokull. As a result you should use Chaotic Elements or Case of K9 before using Seventh Tachyon, so that you know what to search for, and so you play better into Droll. On the other hand, you want to search Dark Lady before using Jokull in a lot of hands, and this may be a factor that would have you play it the other way. Case of K9 is a ROTA on a continuous spell, but if it gets popped it sets your rank-up spell, K9 EX Forced Liberation, assuming you didn't already have access to it. It can also reset it from the GY, making Feather Duster and Heavy Storm innefectual. It also gives you an attack boost if the opponent has activated a monster effect in the hand or GY, and it boosts K9 monsters to high ATK, which is nice. I think being able to have 3 K9 Case in the deck is one of the perks of the pure version. I think Seventh Tachyon is also mandatory for pure, even though I don't love the card.</p><p><strong>End-board Pieces</strong></p><p>3x Kozmoll Dark Lady</p><p>1x K9 EX Forced Liberation (rank-up)</p><p>One of my favourite additions to the deck, Kozmoll Dark Lady is a monster negate that destroys. This can insulate you even further from hand traps, provided you find some way to get it onto the field. It can be a brick, especially if you see multiples, but for every hand that bricks on it there are multiple hands that it increases the ceiling for. It does warp combos slightly, but you can use Lupus to Xyz summon after the negate and it's just an extra interruption, and a very good one at that. Nib can eat shit, this card gives you the ability to play through Nib + Veiler, and it can also sometimes stop Droll, this card is an essential piece to our gameplan going first. Side it out going second to make room for Fuwalos and backrow sweepers. You either play 3 of this card, or you don't play this card. I decided after testing it at 0, 1, and 3, that I wanted all 3, to increase our ceiling and resilience, but you could decide it's a brick and just run more non-engine. This card is non-essential, but in my opinion very good.</p><p>Case of K9 is the best of the two rank-up spells for K9, because it adds and extra interruption to the rank-up. This is relevant in combos, both breaking boards and interrupting. I'll go into what you're summoning with this in the Xyz monster's sections. It looks itself provided you don't run out of K9 monsters to throw into combat.</p><p><strong>K9 Monsters</strong></p><p>3x Jokull</p><p>3x Lantern</p><p>3x Izuna</p><p>3x Lupus</p><p>The pure build has to max out on these, they are absolutely mandatory. This deck wants to see names in combination, so Lantern is needed in greater numbers than VS builds. More of your grind game also depends on Lantern. All of your K9 monsters except Lupus share the effect to normal summon themselves without tributing, provided the opponent doesn't have 1 or 0 cards in hand. This means turn 1 going first, and often enough turn 2 going second, you can normal summon them despite them being level 5. Lupus and Izuna share the trait that they can summon themselves out of the hand if the opponent has activated an effect in the hand or GY that turn.&nbsp;</p><p>Jokull is your main starter. His best effect is that he searches for your other names. Since you can NS him you might be thinking he's a 1 card combo. However, because the extenders he searches for are conditional, he's not really. Despite that, there's no doubt that you play 3 of these. If you reveal another level 5 in the hand, you can special summon both Jokull and it and immediately ignite Jokull for a search. If that monster is Dark Lady, your opponent can't even ash or Droll you profitably in this case, and because you can make Ripper (a hand/GY negate) early, even if you burn up the Dark Lady negate you're still not weak into Nib. If you use the summon effect, the monsters you summon can't make a Light Xyz, which dramatically reduces how many Xyz monsters are viable for this deck.</p><p>Lantern is a 1 card Xyz monster... Conditionally. Unlike Jokull, Lantern can only target level 5 K9 monsters (your maindecks). But this revive is its main effect. While on board, you can search for a spell. Provided you haven't use Case of K9 yet this turn, this strings into a monster search. It can even search itself in a roundabout way, to hold one for follow-up. However, you should be prioritizing adding the rank-up spell to your hand. You can get up to 2 searches for spells, but if 1 is going to get negated you want to add the rank-up spell. Lantern is an extender of sorts, provided you can get a maindeck K9 monster in the GY, such as by sending it or detaching material. Lantern also locks you out of making Light monsters, in our case Constellar Pleiades and Hound.</p><p>Izuna is actually our best normal summon. On summon it sends a K9 card from the deck to the GY. This is usually Lupus or Jokull, you could send the rank-up spell if you're under Droll and have a battle phase, and that's about it. However, normal summoning this is key to a lot of your combos, and it's also a clutch hand trap of sorts going second.</p><p>The reason Izuna is a hand trap (sort of) is Lupus. In addition to summoning itself, Lupus grants targeting protection to any Xyz monster its attached to. It also has a third effect, where at spell speed 2 you can Xyz summon a rank 5 using Lupus. This means turn 0 if you see Lupus and Izuna, you're making a rank 5 on the opponents turn as soon as they activate an effect from the hand or GY. These are also good tribute fodder for Dark Lady. Lupus basically boils down to an extra interruption in a lot of your combos.</p><p><strong>Non-Engine</strong></p><p>3x Ash</p><p>2x Maxx ""C""</p><p>2x Called By the Grave</p><p>1x Crossout Designator</p><p>3x Droll</p><p>3x Mulcharmy Purulia</p><p>1x Nibiru</p><p>I wanted to focus on high impact hand traps, but in a Maxx ""C"" metagame I felt this deck, even though it can sort of play on both player's turns, still needed the cards for the minigame, which is dissapointing (I don't feel like Maxx ""C"" is nearly as effective and K9 VS). Purulia is the Charmie of choice for me, mostly because it pairs most effectively with Droll of any of the Charmies, but you could main the Fuwa and side the Purulia. Droll is just mandatory in the modern game, especially when you're worried about K9 VS.</p><p>The extra deck is not particularly tight. 2 of these monsters you're never summoning.</p><p>#C104 Umbral Horror Masquerade</p><p>#C106 Giant Red Hand</p><p>Are just here to reveal off of Seventh Tachyon and search for level 5 Earths and Darks. Umbral Horror Masquerade is essential if you're playing Seventh Tachyon, and I think you should play Seventh Tachyon, Ascension, and C104 in pure K9 even if you're not playing Dark Lady and especially if you are. Giant Red hand is probably worth the space, and I really dug deep into the well looking for rank 5 Xyz monsters, and drained that well dry. You don't normally need to search the Earth K9s, but it is nice to be able to.</p><p>The most important monsters in the extra deck are the K9 monsters</p><p><strong>K9 Xyz Monsters</strong></p><p>3x Ripper</p><p>2x Werewolf</p><p>1x Hound</p><p>The most important of these is Ripper. Ripper has 2 effects. The first one is a search, for any K9 card, and then you can set a K9 quickplay spell (the rank-up) if your opponent activated a card in the hand or GY. This effect is relevant in combos, both sending an Xyz material to the GY and adding a card to the hand. The set can be relevant, and is moreso in this varient, but mostly just think of this as a search - you don't have enough spells to grab 3, and the quickplay spell we're not playing isn't particularly helpful without another Xyz monster to summon. Ripper also negates the effect of a card that activates in the hand or GY. So this negates Nibiru, and just the vast majority of hand traps in the game, in addition to preventing GY effects to handle follow-up. Additionally, more and more monster effects are activating in the hand to start or extend in combos, so this negate is very relevant. At least one of these should always be on your end board going first, and there are combos that put up two of them to insulate against Nibiru.</p><p>Werewolf is also consistently a part of the end board. It can only be summoned with the rank-up, by ranking up another K9 Xyz. You make him on your own turn going second, and on your opponent's turn going first. This is because its effect varies depending on whose turn you are on. On your own turn it detaches 1 material for a Chenying style banish effect, or 2 thirds of a Trish: he banishes 1 card your opponent controls and/ or a card from their GY. GY banishes are essential to dealing with the follow-up of a more and more decks every year, and banishing on the field after destroying a card with the rank up means going second the rank-up was worth 2 interruptions. However, the real peaks of this card are on your opponent's turn: You look at your opponent's hand, and banish 1 card from it of your choice. This gives you perfect information, or nearly perfect information in any game where your opponent has banished their own cards facedown. It also removes their potential extender from their hand right after you banished a card from their board. If you can fire off Ripper early, then use the rank-up to pop a card and make Werewolf, then immediately snipe their hand. If you have Dark Lady on board, or any other interruption you know, at the very least, know how you're hosed, and at the very best you know exactly how to disrupt your opponent. You need 2 of these - the rank-up resets itself, so you make 1 in the first 2 turns, then you can turn Werewolf back into Ripper for a negate and a pop, then you turn Ripper back into Werewolf. If you can make a second Ripper with your hand for follow-up, you do that, and then rank-up that Ripper into second Werewolf, after you've used up Werewolf's material. Werewolf has a third effect, which is that it can attack a number of times equal to the Xyz material attached to it. That means, you break boards with attacks before you banish in a lot of situations. It can realistically have 3 attacks, so this will help you OTK with the attack clause.</p><p>Hound is trash. You need an extra name to make with the rank-up, and it can help OTK and break boards, but typically I basically never make this. I still think you have to play it. It detaches a material to target and banishes a card, but only during the standby phase, which is not ideal timing for a banish on the field. It's also Light attribute, so you can't summon if if you're used the Dark maindeck monsters' summon effect. But you'll sometimes make this either to rank-up, or with the rank-up, and it's banish is sometimes relevant. It also grows larger and larger over time, and has destruction protection to go with the targeting protection you can give it with Lupus, meaning it's sort of a ""1 turn Towers"". I think you just need the names, even in the extra deck.</p><p><strong>Generic rank 5s</strong></p><p>1x Vallon, the Super Psy Skyblaster</p><p>1x Constellar Pleiades</p><p>1x Ragnafinity</p><p>Vallon is the best generic Xyz monster that isn't Light, excepting Ripper, which we're already maxed out on. This deck desperately needs non-Light rank 5s. If it gets sent to the GY, even as Xyz material, it picks apart the opponent's backrow, which is a nice bonus. It also has a ""Book of Moon"" effect to set facedown a monster on the field. This is a good interruption, and has remained a good one for a long time, but it isn't exciting. You still need this card and add it to almost any end board.</p><p>Constellar Pleiades would be the perfect Xyz for this deck... If it wasn't a Light attribute in a deck with a anti-Light lock. Still, your handtraps and normal summoned monsters make this easy enough. I considered Artifact Durendal and Chronomaly Vimana. Durendal's problem is the deck does get a lot of it's quick play spell, meaning it's spell negate doesn't actually help against backrow hate (In fact it hurts it). Vimana seemed sweet to summon with your hand traps and get a cheeky negate on. However, in the modern era detaching two material is a major downside, ideally you'd summon something for an interruption on their turn, and then use it again on the crack back. Pleiades does exactly this.</p><p>Ragnafinity is cool. Because many of our lines put up one extra monster, and because Ragnafinity isn't a light monster, there are easy setups for this going first and second, including using Lupus to quick Xyz into it on the opponents turm. It banishes a card on the field at spell speed 2, and also inflicts damage in the process. It does this by detaching a single material. It's other effect is not relevant. Whether you're going first or second this is a useful ability, and the fact that it can do it twice without losing the targeting protection granted by Lupus is super nifty. I'm getting conflicting reports about Pair-A-Dice Smasher. Master Duel Meta and the wiki say it's banned, but the ban list on Dueling Book doesn't seem to include it, so I guess if you're playing on Dueling book replace this slot with Pair-A-Dice Smasher.</p><p><strong>Zeus package</strong></p><p>1x Zeus</p><p>1x Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer</p><p>It's Zeus. It detaches 2 materials to send every card on the field as material. This can be clutch as a ""last resort"" to clear a sticky field, but also you can break the board then sit on the Zeus as a big interruption on the follow-up. Lancer is just here to rank up onto rank 5s, to get an extra material under your Zeus. It can also attach a card from your deck if something gets popped, a lesser used effect, but occasionally relevant. I think you need Zeus and a monster to slap on top of your 5s.</p><p><strong>Ty-Phon</strong></p><p>Good ol Typhon. Just slap it on top of a guy and concede. You can just slap it on top of something provided your opponent summoned from the extra deck twice. Ty-Phon is a floodgate that negates the effects of monsters with 3000 or more ATK, and can also detach an Xyz material to non-targeting bounce something, and the extra deck isn't very tight, so I think this makes a lot of sense. It's non-essential, but I think good enough, and if slapped on top of an Xyz monster you can even have a Ty-Phon with targeting protection.</p><p><strong>S:P</strong></p><p>Yeah, we run S:P. You'll be locked out of S:P if you activate Seventh Tachyon, but having S:P in the extra deck is a good way to have tools and clear your zones in a protracted grind game. The field/GY banish is also really good. You don't make this a lot, and if there was a non light rank 5 Xyz monster that was worth running, I'd cut this right away. But there isn't one, so this stays.</p><p><strong>Sideboard Guide</strong></p><p>It's pretty simple. Going First you want all 6 Solemns, and you don't need Mulcharmies, or Droll. Usual pattern for when you know you're going first is</p><p>Out - 2x Droll, 1x Nib, 3x Purulia</p><p>In - 3x Solemn Judgement, 3x Solemn Strike</p><p>You could easily replace these with floodgates you think are good. However, I like to play the based approach when it is viable. Solemns are also extremely powerful - negating inherent summons is clutch, and so is negating card effects at Spell Speed 3. You could leave in the Nib if you know your opponent is on Nib but not Droll, but keeping in a single Droll for Crossout is usually Correct.</p><p>Going second you have a bunch of bad cards to cut, and some Mulcharmies and backrow sweepers to side in</p><p>Out - 3x Kozmoll Dark Lady, 2x Called By the Grave, 1x Crossout Designator</p><p>In - 3x Mulcharmy Fuwaloss, 1x Harpie's Feather Duster, 1x Heavy Storm, 1x Twintwisers</p><p>As the game has evolved, backrow sweeper have turned back into generic cards for going second, rather than hate for actual trap deck (they do that too). Fuwalos is usually going to be good, but you can leave the anti hand trap cards in if you don't think it will be good, or if you think it is good but Purulia is bad.</p><p>Veidos is kinda a neat one. It's a Dark Pyro monster for Chaotic Elements, and basically in any matchup where a field spell does something broken, even just adds a card to start with, you can Summon this to your opponent's field and pop the field spell. Your opponent can't really profitably link it off, since it destroys the whole board if they do. It could be essential against Tenpai, where it acts like a more targeting Ghost Ogre, but unlike Ghost Ogre it answers literally any field spell as it is activating. Its ability to destroy the board can also create opportunities to break the opponent's board. You board it over whichever hand trap you think is least effective in the matchup against vitrually any deck with an important field spell, which is more and more of the field all the time. You could cut this for something else if you think you need to, I just like that it's searchable in good matchups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I thought it was cool to include Chengying but then i realized Qixing only took a Wyrm non-tuner which can be fullfilled with Metaphys Horus.<br />Its a really great tech due to it being a negate (targets any card) upon summon basically. then u can use it alongside ur level 4 recursive tuners to go into Qixing for a banish 2.<br /><br />Really fun to pull off but isn't always possible.

Dogmatika locks out fusion armament so make sure you use that before using Dogmatika cards if your going for tribute summon The Great Maju Garzett.<br /><strong>Synergies:</strong></p><p><strong>Maju </strong>- Great Maju Garzett gains double the attack of the original attack of the 1 tributed monster you use. I pair it well with fusion armament to summon blue eyes ultimate dragon as tribute fodder so that its attack can go up to 9k leaving open an option to otk. You can also use spell card soul exchange to tribute opponent monsters as tribute material for its attack. Alot of players like summoning high attack boss monsters. I usually bait out all their negates and responses and go in for the ol' soul exchange and swing for game.</p><p><strong>Dogmatika </strong>- Very good at dismantling your opponents board by sending out the right extra deck monsters to get rid of their backrow or monsters. The extra deck monsters have multiple way of activating their effects, whether it be sent to the GY or by banishing itself from the GY if you want to bait out a response like garura to bait out their ash before searching for cards if you open with dogmatika. It locks you out of fusion armament if used before it. However if you use it after you can special summon ecclessia from hand now 3 headed-blue eyes is on the field so you can save your tribute summon for Great Maju Garzett.</p><p><strong>Yubel</strong> - Stall long enough to get the cards on the field you need or if your opponent has no out to it, its a free win. You can also bait out their maxx c and hold yubel in hand for when they attack the next turn so they dont draw cards off you.</p><p><strong>Nightmare Throne</strong> - Can be used to add Yubel or any other fiend with 0 attack including Great Maju Garzett/Emperor Maju Garzett if you really need it, you might want to bait out your opponents responses and use this towards the end of your combo.</p><p><strong>Spell Card (Soul Exchange)</strong> - If used right can otk your opponent by tributing 3 headed blue eyes from fusion armament summon giving him 9k attack or tributing your opponents monsters with yubel or maju then activating life hack on two of your monsters if you and your opponent both at 8k, you can swing for game if you can attack directly after getting rid of all their monsters</p><p><strong>Life Hack&nbsp;</strong>- Can be used twice on your turn to increase attack of two monsters on the field, 1 equal to your LP and one equal to your opponent's LP but half dmg. Can be used to otk your opponent if you dont have Great Maju Garzett. If you can get two bodies on the field, whether it be maximus and ecclessia by adding them with nadir servant or yubel and squirter by adding it with nightmare throne for two bodies, or any combination you can come up with and attack directly. Both monsters have to be 8k attack in order to otk however it does succeed in lower your opponents LP enough for you to land the finishing blow next turn. Can also be used on your opponents turn to lower their monsters attack if their on low LP or increase ur monsters attack to your opponent's LP during the battle phase. Good Synergy with Yubel if they have to attack it or to stop the enemy from otking potentially.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Fun deck, rarely bricks and if you do 9/10 times you can stop your opponent from doing too much and it gives you time to play. Plays around nib very well as your'e at most summoning 3 monsters most of the time, 4 max.</p><p><strong>Tips:&nbsp;<br />#1</strong> - Not all extra deck monsters destroy; some send to the GY instead like Evil Twin Sunny. It requires the one evil twin monster in the deck not to be in GY or banished to work when you activate the effect in GY. This to get around monsters that cannot be destroyed or targetted. <br /><strong>#2</strong> - Packbit activates when you send it, you discard one card and target a monster on the field and place it as a trap/spell, very good for getting around monsters that cannot be destroyed or have annoying effects that stop you from playing or monsters that activate a bunch of effects in GY.<br /><strong>#3</strong> - Fossil Warrior Skull Knight and Fossil Machine Skull Wagon both can be activated after sending it to the GY. Which can be used to play around doom king and zombie world or anything like that.<br /><strong>#4</strong> - Wind Pegasus can be used anytime one of your monsters is destroyed so you can use it during your turn if your opponent destroys your monster by card effect or destroy your Maximus/Ecclessia during their battle phase if they have an annoying monster that you need to shuffle into the deck<br /><strong>#5</strong> - The other two Maju's, very niche circumstances. Maju Garzett cannot be added with Nightmare Throne unlike Emperor Maju Garzett. Emperor Maju Garzett is to out monsters that cannot be destroyed by battle and is in defense mode to inflict piercing.

Feels bad drawing into and discarding non-engine, so only running around 10-12 in 40-50 cards. Fluffals weirdly don't really do anything in grave other than Wings, so running a smaller package. Running multiple Lurrie since the summon back is not once per turn. The extra bodies can be really useful in extending.</p><p>The gist of this deck is that you need Edge Imp + Fluffal + Polymerization to be able to make anything, and that can be hard to do. There aren't really any one-card starters, and you have to use your hand to minus before you plus later in the turn. Deck can go both first and second, engine is flexible. Fiendsmith helps raise the floor and ceiling of this deck. Two bodies represents full FS combo, which can also help you get something like Edge Imp Chain into grave to trigger its effect. Fiendsmith Sequence is particularly great in this build since it does not force you to make a FS fusion and can make something like a Frightfur Tiger to pop opponent's cards or Toy Vendor (example situation, Toy Vendor + Fluffal Dog: normal Dog, search Sabers, Vendor to discard Sabers and draw/discard, summon back Sabers. Dog and Sabers for Moon for Requiem, summon Lacrima dump Engraver. Engraver summon from grave, make Sequence, Seq effect for Tiger. Tiger pop TV, TV can grab something like Bear for a second Vendor, and you still have 3 link material on field to continue to link climb. In a different build, 2 fiends makes Yama, search Sharvara, pop set Vendor and search again, make Soul of Rage).</p><p>Most Frightfur/Edge Imp/Fluffal builds run 3 Penguin, but in testing it felt winmore. It doesn't do anything to get you started or really extend for that matter unless you already have Edge Imp and Poly access. Sheep feels really good in the FS build to get that second body on field when playing thru interruption. Fusion Sub with Poly felt good to shuffle back fusions like Desirae or Tiger, but only being able to use field and not hand was tricky in some situations. Super Poly package seems fitting with the discards. Eldlitch always felt good in hand. Frightfur Meister is the unsung hero of this deck. Interruption on Fluffal Dog when you have Meister access or can send Chain to grave, you can tribute a level 4 (i.e. Dog or Chain) and summon Lacrima from deck for full FS combo. Hell yeah. Also can help bridge Fluffal into Edge Imp if you hard draw it.&nbsp;</p><p>Deck overall is very flexible and has many lines; fun casual build that is skill-testing. Considering building more with Fiend Link in mind a la Yubel. Side deck just shows some options for other cards and ratios one could play.&nbsp;</p>"

The Relinquished package replaces the Scapegoat/Meta package in standard Chaos Control. The deck obviously has a lower power ceiling as a result, but it is very consistent at putting Relinquished on the board and is less at risk of the awkward bricky draws Meta can sometimes create. This build is also a little more consistent at playing its chaos monsters because Manjus are extra light monsters that can effectively send themselves to the GY. Additional search power for the combo can be played (Senju &amp; Sonic Bird), but I don't think there's any need to - between Manju, Sangan, and generic draw power this deck already assembles Relinquished + Ritual reliably. If you did want to make it more consistent, I would instead play even more generic draw power such as Jar of Greed.&nbsp;</p><p>Some ideas to make this build more competitive without abandoning Relinquished:</p><ul><li>Build a side deck (duh)</li><li>Add Duo</li><li>Find room for 2 Kycoo</li><li>Find room for some number of Solemn and/or Dustshoot in the main (and more in the side that should exist)</li><li>Swap Wing Blast for Raigeki Break (although I'm not 100% on this change - I think Blast is pretty underrated and situationally may be better than Break)</li></ul>"

A deck intending to turbo out a Destiny End Dragoon as fast and as reliably as possible. It's an alright anime boss monster, so you can probably win the game off of it. Probably...</p><p>And if you bother to read this and have any questions and/or recommendations for possible card inclusions, I'd love to hear them!</p><p>Disclaimer!: This deck is a fun, non-meta deck, created by an amateur deckbuilder who just started playing Edison this year with another deckbuilding friend named Petrichor. Misplays are embarrassingly common with us, so don't expect a fine-tuned machine of a deck that you can build and start taking names with at an RBET or anything.</p><p>Prime Time!:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Main Deck (40)</strong></p><hr /><p><strong>Destiny HERO - Dogma x3</strong></p><p><strong>Destiny HERO - Plasma x3</strong></p><p>These are your primary fusion materials for Destiny End Dragoon, so you need to play three of each unfortunately. At the very least, Plasma can actually be special summoned if you burial a Dandylion and normal summon another monster, or by playing Scapegoat (more on that later). It actually has a decent one-sided Skill Drain ability, and a once per turn removal ability that allows it to relinquish one of your opponent's monsters and gain half its original ATK. That's actually pretty strong. The only thing holding it back is it's special summoning requirement of tributing 3 monsters, so it's difficult to reliably summon. Good thing its mostly just material for Destiny End Dragoon.</p><p>In order to special summon Dogma, you need to tribute 3 of your monsters on the field, including one ""Destiny HERO"" monster. The only other Destiny HERO monster we're playing is Plasma. So in order to summon Dogma, you'd need to: tribute 3 monster for Plasma, summon 2 more monsters somehow, then tribute all 3 monsters to summon Dogma. All to get a card that's worse than summoning Plasma or Dragoon. So yeah, we're never special summoning this card. NEVER do this. Dogma is just a garnet used for the fusion summoning of Destiny End Dragoon, whether its in hand or in the grave, and a dead card in hand otherwise. Good thing we're playing Trade-Ins and Destiny Draw to cycle this card into something else.</p><p><strong>Elemental HERO Stratos x1</strong></p><p><strong>Elemental HERO Ocean x1</strong></p><p><strong>Elemental HERO Prisma x3</strong></p><p>This is part of your Elemental HERO package (the other part is E - Emergency Call x3). Stratos is without doubt the best Elemental HERO ever printed, which is why it still sees play to this day when the HERO archetype gets modern support. It's a tutor for <em>any </em>""HERO' monster in your deck on an 1800ATK stick. What's not to love?&nbsp;</p><p>Ocean is a Water attribute Elemental HERO. So it can be tutored by Stratos and Emergency Call and used as fusion material for Elemental HERO Absolute Zero. That's pretty much it. I mean, you CAN normal summon it and add a ""HERO"" monster (Stratos) back to your hand during your next standby phase, but if your opponent allows that to happen without answering Ocean on their turn, they deserve to lose.</p><p>Elemental HERO Prisma is a bonkers card. It's a Foolish Burial and a substitute fusion material for any of your fusion monsters all in one 1700ATK body. It saw play in several decks over the years that <em>weren't</em> HERO decks. Fun fact: If you're playing against a Machine deck, you can side in Cyber Dragon, dump it into the graveyard with Prisma's effect, then contact fuse your opponent's machine monsters away along with Prisma, which is now named ""Cyber Dragon."" With 2 Cyber Dragons, 3 Prismas, 3 E-Calls, Reinforcement of the Army, and Stratos, you have TEN copies of Cyber Dragon in your deck against a Machine deck. That's insane.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dandylion x1</strong></p><p>Dandylion is an Earth attribute monster that can be used as fusion material for Elemental HERO Gaia. On it's own, that wouldn't be enough to see play for me, but if it's sent to the graveyard by anything (being destroyed by battle or card effect, from Polymerization, Future Fusion, or Foolish Burial), it'll summon 2 little plant monster to the field. Meaning a Foolish Burial, a Plasma, and a normal summonable monster in hand represents the potential to special summon Plasma. Worst case, you can also just play Dandylion to stall out 3 attacks if you don't have combo. Dandylion is a versatile card in the deck that supports two different ways the deck can play, so that's why I run it. But it can suck to draw sometimes, so I only run one nowadays.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>King of the Swamp x3</strong></p><p>This card is a tutor that you can discard from the hand to search for Polymerization! At 3, you're effectively playing 6 copies of Poly. It can also serve as fusion material for AbZero since its a Water attribute monster.</p><p><strong>Brain Control x1</strong></p><p>It's Brain Control! A premier interactive card in Edison. For 800 measly life points, you can take control of a monster your opponent controls for a turn. With it, you can permanently remove it by using it as fusion material (it would have to be Earth or Water in that case tho, unlikely but possible), clear the way of attacks, attack another one of your opponent's monsters with it, attack for game, use it to do your taxes, and have it cook you a nice meal after you win the game with it. Isn't controlling your opponent's monsters nice? p.s. If you steal a tuner, those Synchro cards sitting pretty in the Extra Deck might actually see some play.</p><p><strong>Future Fusion x1</strong></p><p><strong>Miracle Fusion x3</strong></p><p><strong>Polymerization x3</strong></p><p>This is you fusion package! Does Future Fusion count as a fusion card? 'Cause it's really just a two-in-one burial to send two fusion materials to the graveyard so you can banish them with Miracle Fusion, which is broken by the way. The fact that Future Fusion is essentially two Foolish Burials in one in this deck really highlights how absurdly powerful the card is, and it's even MORE powerful in a Dragon or Machine deck. The fusion monster in two turns is just a bonus, if your opponent lets it happen. Future Fusion is broken - new Edison hot take.</p><p>Polymerization and Miracle Fusion are your main fusion cards. Poly is an oldie but a goodie; it can special summon a Fusion Monster whose fusion material are either in the hand or on the field, and sends the fusion material to the graveyard. Whereas Miracle Fusion can special summon a Fusion Monster whose fusion material are either on the field or in the graveyard, and banishes the fusion material. Both are great, and essential to your gameplan, so both are at 3.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Destiny Draw x1</strong></p><p><strong>Trade-In x3</strong></p><p><strong>Upstart Goblin x3</strong></p><p>This is your draw package, used to turbo through your deck and get to your combo: summoning Destiny End Dragoon. Trade-In allows you to discard Plasma or Dogma to draw 2 cards, and you can use Plasma or Dogma later as fusion material for Miracle Fusion or special summoning Dragoon from grave. Destiny Draw is just another Trade-In in this deck, and Upstart is a draw one that essentially allows you to play a 37-card deck. Your opponent gaining 1000LP from playing Upstart is usually irrelevant to whether you win or lose.</p><p><strong>Reinforcement of the Army x1</strong></p><p><strong>E - Emergency Call x3</strong></p><p>This is your tutor package!&nbsp; Reinforcement and E-Call are used to tutor for any Warrior or ""Elemental Hero"" monster respectiv- Stratos. They're used to tutor for Stratos. If you already have Stratos, tutor for Prisma, or maybe Plasma or Dogma with Reinforcement only if you can either special summon Plasma or Fusion summon Dragoon (please note: E-Call cannot get Plasma or Dogma, it can only tutor ""Elemental HERO"" monsters). Tutoring for Ocean is also an option, if you're out of options, or if you wanna fusion summon AbZero. I heard that's a good card.</p><p><strong>Giant Trunade x1</strong></p><p><strong>Heavy Storm x1</strong></p><p>These are auto-includes in any turbo deck in my opinion, because the best thing to stop you from turboing off and winning with Dragoon is your opponent activating Torrential Tribute / Bottomless Trap Hole on summon, or Mirror Force / Dimensional Prison on attack declaration, or [insert other trap cards here]. Giant Trunade can sometimes be better than Heavy Storm, since it's not outed by Starlight Road. Both are outed by Solemn Judgment, but there's not much you can do about that. But generally, you'll want to try clearing the board with either before you make your big play, and ideally finish off with setting a Royal Decree.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Foolish Burial x1</strong></p><p>Send one monster from your deck to the graveyard. Very simple. Very powerful. If you have Miracle Fusion and one fusion material in the grave, you can send Dogma or Plasma to special summon Dragoon, Ocean or King of the Swamp to special summon AbZero, or Dandylion to special summon Gaia AND/or two plant tokens, which can be used to special summon Plasma. All that utility, and it only has a single line of text. They don't make 'em like this in Yugioh anymore.</p><p><strong>Scapegoat x1</strong></p><p>Like Dandylion, Scapegoat can be used to stall out 4 attacks if you don't have combo. Also like Dandylion, it can be used to special summon Plasma. It's essentially a one card Plasma summoning machine; Sure, the 4 goat tokens you summon off Scapegoat can't be tributed for a tribute summon, but that doesn't apply to being tributed for a special summon, such as Plasma's special summoning condition. So it's an okay card with multiple uses, and that's why it sees play here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Royal Decree x2</strong></p><p>This deck plays no trap cards, so a good way to not get blown out by a deck that plays a lot of traps is by having a Royal Decree activated before you precede to turbo off and special summon Dragoon, or after if you turbo off on turn 1. It'll protect your Dragoon from a Mirror Force, Torrential Tribute, Bottomless Trap Hole, Solemn Judgement, CED, [insert other trap cards here], you name it! As long as it's a trap, Royal Decree stops it dead in it's tracks. Admiral Ackbar would be proud.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Extra Deck (15)</strong></p><hr /><p><strong>Destiny End Dragoon x3</strong></p><p>This is your boss monster, the card that you're trying to turbo out as fast as possible. And now I need to be real with you: As I alluded to in the first paragraph of this primer, Destiny End Dragoon... is not all that good. ""WHAT?!"", says the imaginary reader in my head. ""How can this be?! The entire deck is built around this card, how can it not be good?!"" Well, in comparison to boss monsters in other decks like LADD, DAD, Red DMD, Kristya, Machina Fortress, Stardust, and Brionac, Dragoon is rather lackluster. It <em>reads</em> like its broken: It has 3000ATK, which is more than all the aforementioned boss monsters, has an activated effect that Ring of Destructions one of your opponent's monsters, and can bring itself back from the graveyard by banishing one of its fusion materials. That sounds great! Unfortunately, it is also more difficult to summon than the aforementioned cards, requiring 3 other cards that have next to no other utility to summon Dragoon. That's bad card economy. It's activated effect also prevents you from attacking for the turn, which is not especially great. And its recursion effect doesn't really matter when the most popular way of dealing with a monster is to banish it with cards like Caius, Chaos Sorcerer, Bottomless Trap Hole, and Dimensional Prison. Going -2 to summon this only to have it banished is a losing proposition, and card games, especially Yugioh, are all about card economy. Bonus points if you can't even summon it do to LADD or Kristya's effects. So why am I playing this card, and this deck?</p><p>Because I want to. Because it's fun. I don't need it to be a broken card or a meta-defining deck, I just need to have fun with it. That's what I'm here to do, and I hope you are too. :)</p><p><strong>Elemental Hero Absolute Zero x3</strong></p><p>This is a broken meta-defining boss monster. ""WHAT?!!"", reiterates the same imaginary reader. 'Why aren't we turboing this out instead then?!' Well, you can, lol. But that's not what this deck sets out to do. Summon Dragoon, or you're a coward. If you want to play AbZero more consistently, you should play a more meta Diva Hero or Frog deck instead. But yeah, this card is insane. A 2500ATK mon that wipes your opponent's monsters if they answer it with anything other than a summon negate is kinda busted. It's Mutually Assured Destruction, a Raigeki effect on a monster, and that card is banned in Edison for good reason. Did I mention it has another effect? Like Stratos, I tend to forget it has another effect. It gains 500ATK for each Water monster on the field. Not very relevant unless you're playing against a Water deck or summon Ocean or King of the Swamp, but it is there.</p><p><strong>Chimeratech Fortress Dragon x2</strong></p><p>As mentioned before, this card is for when you're playing against a Machine deck. So its either the most useless card in your extra deck, or the best card in it hands down. Y'all know how it is; this card is THE reason Machine decks don't dominate the meta, and it and Cyber Dragon are auto-includes in most extra and side decks as a result. I have a healthy respect for Machine decks, so we're running the maximum 2.</p><p><strong>Elemental HERO Gaia x2</strong></p><p>Uh, this card is uh... look, this is a Fusion deck. And a ""HERO' deck. It's on theme okay?! We run Dandylion so we can actually summon this thing if necessary, but you'd really rather just summon Dragoon or Abzero in most cases. But hey, it could win you the game in certain niche situations. It could, okay?!</p><p><strong>Stardust Dragon x1</strong></p><p><strong>Black Rose Dragon x1</strong></p><p><strong>Blackwing Armor Master x1</strong></p><p><strong>Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier x1</strong></p><p><strong>Goyo Guardian x1</strong></p><p>The synchro monsters are just here on the off chance you Brain Control a tuner monster. Otherwise, you're not summoning them. They're placeholders, more or less irrelevant to your gameplan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Side Deck (15)</strong></p><hr /><p>I still don't really know how to build a side deck, but I really tried with this one!</p><p><strong>Gorz </strong>is the 41st card in the deck that I couldn't fit. If you really want to, you can give up the idea of summoning Plasma, cut Scapegoat for Gorz, and run another card in the side deck. That's probably even objectively correct. I just... don't want to do that. So in the side deck it goes! The <strong>Battle Faders x2</strong> are for if you're playing against another turbo deck or an aggressive deck and they attempt to OTK you before you can set up. You'd kind of want insurance in Game 2 to stop that if necessary.</p><p>As mentioned before, the <strong>Cyber Dragons x2</strong> are for when you're going up against a machine deck. <strong>Mystical Space Typhoon</strong>, <strong>Dust Tornado x2</strong>, and<strong> Eradicator Epidemic Virus x2</strong>&nbsp;are for when you need even<em> more</em> spell and trap card removal. This deck can support <strong>Deck Devastation Virus x2 </strong>as well by tributing Dragoon, so that's in the side deck too, and they're<em>&nbsp;really</em> good against particular decks.</p><p>Finally, <strong>Horn of Heaven</strong>, <strong>Solemn Judgment</strong>, and <strong>Torrential Tribute</strong> are insurance against the card that best outs Dragoon. What outs Dragoon? Getting banished from card effects like Bottomless Trap Hole, Dimensional Prison, Chaos Sorcerer, and Caius. Bottomless and D-Pris are answerable by Giant Trunade, Heavy Storm, and Royal Decree in the main (as well as MST, Dust, and EE-Virus in the side), so they're not as much of a threat. But Chaos Sorc and Caius are bastards, especially Caius; Priority makes his effect hard to interact with. Horn of Heaven can tribute a Dragoon to negate the summoning of Caius or any other problematic monster, which is fine since you can probably bring it back from the grave during your next standby phase by banishing a Plasma or Dogma. Torrential Tribute is even better, since it can remove any other creatures your opponent may have on the field as well. And Solemn is arguably the best. For half your life points, it'll just straight up negate the summon, without needed to tribute your Dragoon. So yeah, this is basically the ""Oh shitake mushrooms, my opponent is playing Caius"" side deck options, lol.</p><p>Uh... this was over 2.5k words. If you're reading this - Why?</p>"

We are only playing D/D Gryphon because it&rsquo;s a Level 4 D/D that can Special Summon itself from hand if you control a D/D.

Copernicus sends either a D/D or Dark Contract card from Deck to GY on Normal or Special Summon. This either sends Lance Soldier or Lamia who can then bring themselves back via their GY effects. I don&rsquo;t know if anybody else would agree with me on this, but there should be a greater focus on making new Dark Contract cards with a wider range of utility instead of printing new D/D monsters. I mean, the new support from Doom of Dimensions is really good, but having a Dark Contract that literally just says send a D/D from Deck to GY or one with an effect that just Special Summons a D/D from GY would be really nice. Like those would be played at singular copies in order to pivot to them whenever necessary. Lance Soldier can target a D/D you control to increase its Level by up to the number of Dark Contracts on field and GY. This is really nice since it is a Tuner monster. As for its other effect, if it is in the GY, you can target and destroy a Dark Contract you control to Special Summon it, but it is banished when it leaves the field. As functionally another copy of Lamia with more utility, it&rsquo;s really good. As for Lamia, its a Level 1 Tuner which can Special Summon itself from hand or Gy by sending a D/D or Dark Contract card from your hand or face-up field to the GY, but it is banished when it leaves the field. Lamia is fine to draw, but you would rather not. However, Lance Soldier is a brick.

Unfortunately the game has long since sped past this slow accrual of resources. Fortunately, with a dash of new support and a heaping handful of new toys to play with, we can bring back the nostalgic feeling of asking out opponent, ""What'll it be; Trick or Treat?""</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Madolche is an archtype focused on making rank 4 XYZ monsters, and shuffling cards back from both players graveyards and fields. Mimighoul is an archtype focused on giving your opponent face down monsters, that trigger punishing effects for them when flipped face up. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of synergy on the surface, but there are a few advantages to mixing the two. Firstly, both of these archetypes are comprised entirely of Earth monsters, making the Vernusylphs an easy inclusion, especially with their ability to access strong starters for Madolche. Second, the Mimighoul cards cover a lot of Madolche's weaknesses. The Madolche cards have a lot of powerful normal summons to access their combos, but lose to pretty much any interaction on them. The Mimighoul cards can threaten searches and summons without commiting the normal summon, and often without putting monsters in the GY to leave madolche open to take over from there. Even less impactful Mimighouls like Armor or Cerberus can insulate from many popular hand traps like the Mulcharmmies and Imperm by placing a monster on the opponent's field, and with the newest wave of support, any spare bodies left behind by the Ghouls can be funnelled into Meowcaroons to find full madolche combo regardless of the madolche name you open. Also, running this many engine cards is a great excuse to play more than the minimum 40, which reduces your odds of drawing the brickier cards in each archetype by diluting your deck with more searchers and starters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are a couple of issues to keep in mind with this list. 1) less non-engine. Fitting 3 archetypes into 1 deck sounds great until you really really really need to see a board breaker or a hand trap or SOMETHING to interrupt your opponent, Unfortunately this is a duel, not a game of solitaire. 2) Nibiru and droll. None of these archtypes play super effectively into either of these cards, and the more searchers and extenders your open, the harder you play into them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With that I hope you have fun playing this concoction of confection and confusion, and a happy Halloween!</p>"

Not much to take note of here, it's just tried and true Paleo. I suppose you&nbsp;could <em>kind</em> of call it an alternate version; we didn't have enough Gems and Points to make an optimized list, so we ended up just sticking in as many known tech options like Magicolloidal, Vulmina etc. and the spare Extra Deck space we just ended up filling with generic options like the I:P package.</p><hr /><p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong></span></p><p>We're in a bit of a weird spot with this one. Not only is this deck not something that we brewed ourselves like with our previous deck, it's also a very well-known, thoroughly-developed deck that's been optimized for many years, so whatever gameplay knowledge we could put in here pales in comparison to what other, more skilled Paleo players have already put out there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, instead of doing that, here's a few videos from some other creators that can help you get a good grasp on the deck:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the newcomers, <a>here's a basic guide by Duellogs.</a> It gives a basic breakdown of the archetype and gives some good directions for deckbuilding:</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRHvxfiK5a0&amp;t=737s</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a>Here is a gameplay video by Joshua Schmidt</a>, who is basically the face of the archetype. He's a good source for learning the deck in practice, and his high-level gameplay can give you some solid ideas on how to manage your resources and navigate some more difficult scenarios. He's also the main source which we based our deck upon (if you couldn't tell Cx):</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQVdZ9pzlc&amp;t=53s</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For those with a higher attention span, <a>here's a challenge video by Hardleg.</a> In it, he goes on a multiple-day climb trying to take the deck to Master 1 on the ladder, going through various versions of it to see how much further it can push him. It's a good place to discover some alternate builds, and to get a grasp of it in practice against a wider variety of decks:</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWhoHWPlroE&amp;t=6768s</p><hr /><p>Deutschland Deutschland Ja Ja Ja :D</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

But i would suggest to play chronicle, since if you hard open your 1 card combo AND a card you would usually search within the combo (Example: Squirmer or Nightmare Pain), You can add chronicle which makes your endboard Soul of rage, varudras, Phantom, Samsara, Nightmare pain, Escape AND Superpoly + Next turn you have either 4 or 5 counters on Chronicle so you have follow Up.&nbsp;</p><p>I do want to play more unchained cards like prison and stuff but i do not have a built for that yet.
