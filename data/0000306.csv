Pot of Prosperity is also at one. This may have slightly weakened Machina, but Machina will always adapt to the meta!<br /><br />Excellent support for the archetype includes <em>Machina Citadel</em>, which functions as a quick effect board wipe of all your opponent&rsquo;s monsters which is a very potent form of interruption. <em>Machina Overdrive</em> enables a circular resource loop between the banished pile, GY, deck and hand, while <em>Machina Redeployment</em> greatly increased the consistency of the deck. Newer support from main sets like <em>Unclaspare (R4NK enabler, free special summon and foolish burial)</em> and <em>Ruinforce (4600ATK beatstick and banish recursion) </em>have also greatly increased the power for this archetype.<br /><br />The resulting support turns Machina from an archetype that was a jumbled mess into a compact powerful fighting force that can succeed in a grind game. Together with high impact staple trap cards and crippling floodgates, Machina functions as an anti-meta deck versus the combo-heavy meta! Control the game, simplify the game-state, then OTK your opponent in one fell swoop with your high ATK Machina army!</p><div class=""x_elementToProof""><p class=""x_MsoNormal"">Want to see the deck in action?

Dissolverock is the answer, The highest ATK of a monster that still can't be destroyed by Trap Hole. Technically tied for the highest but with all the Dissolverock support cards able to boost its ATK once it's on the field it's definitely the best choice. A word of caution though, if you already have Wasteland on the field then Dissolverock can be destroyed by Trap Hole so remember to use your De-Spell then summon Dissolverock then activate your second Wasteland.

New players step up, while former contenders step down or get neutered; current contendors that were rogue either become the new key players, or get sacked from their position; or the king of kings from last format retain their throne until the next banlist. Dinosaurs this format are in the best of both worlds in this situation. Sure they didn't get their key cards back nor the True King engine (Excluding Calamities) hasn't came back; but that honestly hasn't stopped them from being at least playable. At least if you are willing to seethe and cope for another 3-5 months with a awkward, wobbly, and fragile rhythm of building up to until you get to Ultimate Conductor Tyranno.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; However rest assured it didn't take as long as expected to figure this out (maybe about 3 days, but that's better than what most take to figure out how to make Burn decks competitive without Mystic Mine). For one Twitter has done the only good thing (before Elon Musk came in), and insist to make a small Spright package be inserted into the Dino War Machine. That in the end has payed off very well, and allowed not only the recycling of Babycerasaurus; but also allow for further extensions, and access to the Rank-2 monster ""Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition"" (read the card text, then look at why I also added Infinite Impermanence in the deck as well). While Crystron Halqifibrax is no longer in circulation as the synchro fodder; it didn't stop LV8 Synchro monsters like ""Blood Melfist"" and ""Borreload Savage Dragon"" from being played, thanks to the PSY-Framegear package widely available (and more accessable with PSY-Framelord Lambda).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Finally comes the original Dino lineup, which has hit multiple times on the banlist throughout the years; but still manage to opportunisticaly comeback to competitive sphere at any given moment. Even with Miscellaneousaurus still being at 1 copy per deck, banishing with Giant Rex can make a Rank-4 monster in one turn (if Souleating Oviraptor is on the field at the time). Not to mention that Babycerasaurus is still unlimited, which not only gives a reason to play the mentioned ""Spright"" package from earlier; but also gives fuel for Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, and gives you options to go into Rank-2 plays. Knightmare Unicorn and Accesscode Talker still remain prominent in Dinosaurs to this day, all because of their easy setup; and while not always needed, can be used at any situation (and can give you some payment for the cost of Pot of Prosperity).</p>"

Note that apparently the Borrelsword/Tetrahertz thing didn't work so I removed it from the deck. This deck works on tearing the bigger picture up rather than preventing it from being painted, and once done, keeps your opponent locked down with negates. Reason being, decks like Tearlaments will continue to do their plays reguardless of how many times you try to negate their effects, so the best way to deal with them is to assert dominance over their prime board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What you do with this deck is start of by dumping Borrels for bayonet punisher(via Nadir servant, Maximus, Dogmatika punishment, and Dogmatikatrix), and removing threats with sphere mode and Ultimate Slayer before ritual summoning Zoa(pieces can be searched by Ecclesia, Dogmatikatrix, and Herald of the arc light)to finish taking threats out. Then, you can safely set your backrow and play your Bystial/Ecclesia cards. And once the board is broken, you use cards like solemn Judgment, Dogmatika Punishment, Ash blossom, and Effect veiler to keep it broken. A thing to keep in mind is that Zoa is an acceptable casualty due to the fact that you have Cyber Eltanin in the deck, who can wipe all monsters off the board so you can land a finishing blow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The bystial work by summoning Magnamuht during your opponent's turn, which adds Druisworm during the end phase. You can summon Druisworm during the end phase. Then, come your turn, overlay both for Utopia beyond, clearing the threat of any beatsticks. And if you didn't OTK with it, White Zoa, and a 3rd monster, then you can overlay it for Zeus. Also, Cyber Eltanin was just added to the list, If Zeus winds up in the gy(which can be done via Dogmatika effects), you can banish it to summon the card, which then sends all monsters on the field to the gy. Paired with lightning storm, this card gives you a clear shot for game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A strong point to this deck is it evades a crazy amount of commonly used staples and floodgates as it avoids being dependent on many vore mechanics a deck can utilize, the list being:</p><p>&bull;Secret Village of the spellcasters</p><p>&bull;Dimension shifter/Silent graveyard/Marcos cosmos/Dimensional Fissure/D.D. Crow/Artifact Lancea</p><p>&bull;Lava golem(In the instance you only have Zoa/Fenrir and a heavy backrow set)</p><p>&bull;Winged dragon of ra- Sphere mode</p><p>&bull;Extra deck nuisances like Zeus and Bagooska</p><p>&bull; Skill drain as Zoa is a beatstick and you have removal</p><p>&bull;Iblee</p><p>&bull;Kshatria Fenrir as you have several ways around it becoming a threat</p><p>&bull;Extra deck based cards such as Dimension barrier and artifact scythe</p><p>&bull;There are quite a few instances where Ash Blossom doesn't do anything as you can get your searches another way.</p><p>&bull;Zombie World</p><p>The big threats to this deck are There can be only one(in the instance you have to search Zoa with Ecclesia), Mystic mine(In the instance that you don't draw one of the 8 removal cards/prosperity). And other cards that prevent you from special summoning are threats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another strong point to this deck is it's layers of protection. You've got Dogmatika nation which pops anything attacking your Dogmatika monsters so your opponent can't gain a big advantage from wiping your field, White Zoa makes Dogmatika cards unaffected by extra deck monsters like Ghoti mass banishing and can't be bullied by Tearlaments stealing your turn, and you have Wind pegasus, which shuffles a threat away if said threat destroys a card. And if you added it in, Palladium Oracle Mana protects your Dogmatika monsters from being targeted or destroyed by card effects.</p><p>Things you can play but I didn't include are:</p><p>Dark Ruler No more instead of Ultimate Slayer to save yourself $130.</p><p>Cyber emergency to search Eltanin.</p><p>2/3Magicians' souls and 1 Palladium Oracle Mana for an extra layer of protection on your Dogmatika monsters and extra draw power. Oracle Mana presents your opponent from targeting and destroying your level 7 or higher spellcasters, AKA Zoa/Maximus/Flueridis.</p><p>Prosperity can come in handy, but isn't an absolute must have for the deck. You can use an Upstart goblin, one day of peace, and an Into the void instead if you want to save a ton. You could also go with wonder wand on Ecclesia or a Maximus that has served it's purpose(probably the better option of the two cheaper methods, but prosperity is still the best option).</p><p>Update: I put Link disciple in the side deck in case you end up facing a Spright player using Knightmare Corruptor Iblee, you can link it away and continue comboing. Dragonmaid Lorpar replaced Bhalyutia the grand radiance in the side deck, either can be used but I prefer Lorpar for it's ability to force out negates and force Zeus to activate it's effect before you set up with Ecclesia or Dogmatikatrix.</p><p>Thats all I have on this deck for now, but I might update it sometime later if I stumble across better tech options.&nbsp;</p>"

I expect the top decks in this format to remain relatively unchanged with Tearlament being the prominent deck and Spright still being tier 2. Other top decks will most likely be Drytron, Despai, Stun, Exosister, and Mathmech/cyberse. Matches are often going into time as a combination of long turns and grindier matches cause individual games to go as long as 30 minutes. <br /><br />1) D.D. Crow, Ghost belle &amp; Haunted Mansion, and Infinite Impermanence are some of the best hand traps currently. This is because they can all end can Tearlament's turn on their own depending on the opponent's hand and mills. D.D. crow is the premier hand trap in this format and can also shut down our own turn if our opponent happens to banish Sarama's target or one of our best resource engines in Disaster. Ghost Belle doubles as a defensive tool to negate D.D. crow incase our opponent tries that. Due to the recent banning of Ronin Toadin, Spright is now also weak to Ghost belle as they need to specifically special summon Swap Frog from the GY with Spright Elf in order to go into Toadally Awesome.<br /><br />2)&nbsp; Tour Guide From the Underworld: Because games are slower, having access to both Dark Spirits means we are favored in any grind game. Tour guide can either tutor both dark spirits from the deck by linking into Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss or search Sangan to either grab a hand trap or an unchained monster for follow-up. <br /><br />3)&nbsp; Rivalry of Warlords is one of the best flood gates in the current meta. A well timed activation can skip your opponents entire turn and also has the benefit of slowing the pace of the game to a speed where Unchained fares better. (edited)<br /><br />4) The extra deck is pretty boilerplate. It's worth noting that Tour Guide does allow easier access to Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder making him viable in this deck when you go 2nd.<br /><br />5) As far as the side deck goes, I have floodgates, extra hand traps, and a few board breakers. Anti-spell Fragrance goes in when I have to go first against anything except Spright. Solemn judgement will make sure it sticks. For weird match-ups where Rivalry is not relevant, there are extra hand traps. Including Ghost Mourner &amp; Moonlit Chill. As I mentioned earlier, matches are often going into time. Ghost mourner can force your opponent to stop playing otherwise they have the potential of losing in time. It also doubles as another copy of Infinite Impermanence whereas Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood is completely useless otherwise.<br /><br />Dark Ruler No More is unfortunately a necessary evil until Spright all but drops from the meta. It&rsquo;s a 1 card win con in the match up but doesn&rsquo;t pair very well against the other top decks. </p>"

Now because we summon in a duel&nbsp; an <strong>Ultimate Crystal Monster</strong> and because&nbsp;we have 7 crystal beast and the <strong>""R.O""&nbsp;</strong>in our GY we can special summon our&nbsp;<strong>""Ultimate Crystal Rainbow Dragon Overdrive""&nbsp;</strong>and he gains 7k attack so he will have 11k, and also he can as quick effect if he hasnt attacked in the turn tribute himself and send all the cards from the field back to the deck and summoning back any number of the banished crystal beast monsters. also between this two summonigs we can summon the <strong>""Rainbow Dragon""&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>i recomend to summon him after you use the&nbsp;<strong>R.O&nbsp;</strong>quick effect, so you will have him and the&nbsp;<strong>""Ultimate Crystal Rainbow Overdrive"" </strong>in the field too. And that's it, this deck have worked very good for me so far, its fun to play and quick but we have to be very careful with not getting any of the single crystal beast killed or banished cuz we need 7 different beast in our hand, deck or field, so be careful with that and use the ones that have extra copies most of the time. Protect your&nbsp;<strong>""Ultimate Crystal Magic""&nbsp;</strong>at all cost haha because with out that your gonna be playing the slow way, you could still do the main combo but it will take you more time and will be harder.&nbsp; So thats it, have fun playing my deck.&nbsp;</p>"

Opponent's turn board clears. Mystic Mine outs.,"<p>Deck inspired by Trif, but with my own spin on it. The deck is pretty beefy at 45 cards but I don't think I've bricked on more than a handful of occassions. Definitely stronger going first, but there is good support for going second in the sideboard, (of which I'm still trying to lock down if you have suggestions).</p><p>Main strategies:</p><p>-Create a clear board on opponents turn by creating Spright Elf and I:P Masquerena. Activate Spright Elf and search out the Merrli you used, then chain I:P Masquerena to link climb to Topologic Bomber Dragon. Spright Elf resolves and put Merrli to any place the Bomber Dragon is pointing to, this of course triggers Merrli's summon AND grave effect. Topologic Bomber Dragon is NOT once per turn.</p><p>-Create a board of negates with Baronne de Fleur which you can get out fairly easily using your Scareclaw package. Predaplant Dragostapelia, and Wandering Gryphon Rider. (Just make sure you didn't do any normal summons that you activated the effects of, like Merrli or you won't be able to play Rite of Aramesir)</p><p>-It is entirely possible to achieve both main strategies, in which case you would try to negate through the board before finally doing your Topologic play as this clears your board as well. If you find this situation coming up often, changing Bomber to Zeroboros would not be a terrible idea.</p><p>-Abyss Dweller is there for the mirror matchup and any other decks that benefit from graveyard effects.</p><p>-Set rotation for clearing out Mystic Mine</p><p>-Mystic Mine for when the match goes sideways and you need a moment to breathe</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-When siding, consider removing any spell that isn't searchable for your tech choices.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please let me know what you think! This is the first deck I've submitted and would love feedback.</p>"

Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</p></div><p class=""MsoNormal""><br /><br />This deck features incredibly potent anti-meta cards like Dimension Shifter, Macro Cosmos, Imperial Order and True King of Calamities. Generaider Windwitch plays comfortably under these floodgates, while the opponent keels over and dies. If you have access to any of these cards, they generally insta-win you the game since they shut off almost every route of play.<br /><br />While preferring to go first, this deck can still comfortably go second if forced to, since it features 12 hand traps. It can also play past interruption, since it has multiple methods to start off its gameplay.<br /><br />I found it funny that almost nobody knows what the heck Generaiders and Windwitches do, and they end up underestimating the deck until it's too late. Before long, your opponent may find themself facing down Harr's omni-negate, Crystal Wing's monster negate, Dimension Shifter's banish, and lethal backrow like Judgment and Imperial Order!<br /><br />Another bonus about this deck is that it functions nicely under Maxx ""C,"" the undisputed king of Master Duel. This deck doesn't summon much, so the opponent doesn't have much incentive to use Maxx ""C."" This deck can even function under Summon Limit or Winda!<br /><br />The only major problem about this deck is that it bricks HARD, since there are 6 ""hard"" bricks in the deck (5 Generaider bosses + Ice Bell) and 1 ""soft"" brick (Glass Bell). This weakness is avoided with Pot of Prosperity and Maxx ""C"" functioning as cards that will get you starters for the deck.<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</p>"

From my play testing it hasn't been hard getting cards in the grave for the primary target Winda. Getting both Winda and Every on the field plus some dogmatika pops has been moderately successful in the lower tiers.</p><p>The biggest issue I've found with the deck is that it's incredibly slow, which hinders it from competing with pretty much any competent/consistent deck unless their pilot is not experienced with their deck. Your biggest advantage is no one has any clue what you're doing and if one line (say your Fortune line) gets negated, you can usually go into your Shaddoll or Dogmatika lines after.</p><p>I believe adding the other Fortune Lady cards only makes this deck more bricky/inconsistent than it already is which this deck DOES NOT need, especially since they have incredibly niche applications that don't meaningfully progress your gameplan.</p><p>I'm posting this deck because I think it's as solved as it'll currently get but if someone comes along with innovations or if new cards enter play, I'd like to see where people can take my variant.</p>"

The card will help with the consistency issues. The deck's main goal is to put 2 Sacred Beasts on the field with Cerulean Skyfire &amp; Awakening Of The Sacred Beasts. Cerulean Skyfire negates any spell/trap card no matter its spell speed. Awakening Of The Sacred Beasts will negate the activated effects of your opponents monsters as long as you control 2 different Sacred Beasts.</p><p>For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more.

The extra deck is almost only to fuel spells and traps like Ghost Reaper and Dogmatika Punishment. I'll go over every card in the card in the deck, explain why it's there, and at the end explain some of the strengths, weaknesses, and strategies of the deck.</p><p>2x Toon Black Luster Soldier: This is the strongest monster in the deck, but you don't really want to draw it and rather summon it from deck off of Toon Page-Flip or Toon Dark Magician, so I only play two.</p><p>3x Toon Dark Magician: This card is an extremely good searcher for the deck, being able to search nearly two-thirds of the deck by itself. In most situations, this is the monster you want to see off of Toon Page-Flip.</p><p>2x Red-Eyes Toon Dragon: Once again, this is a card that is very good for the deck but you don't really want to draw it, getting it off of Page-Flip, Dark Magician, or Black Stone of Legend. This is the other prefered card to get off of Page-Flip.</p><p>1x Toon Cyber Dragon: This is only here in case you need another monster to select for Page-Flip, or if you're going second and want to make Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon with your opponents monster.</p><p>2x The Black Stone of Legend: I would recommend only playing as many of these as you play Red-Eyes. This can either get Red-Eyes, or if it would be more useful, get Linkuriboh.</p><p>2x Field Barrier: This is to protect Toon Kingdom from being destroyed.&nbsp;</p><p>3x Comic Hand: One of the best cards in the deck, you can just take one of your opponents monsters and it can attack directly for no cost. The only downside is it's an equip spell, but that's not too bad of a downside.</p><p>3x Toon Kingdom: The absolute best card in the deck, this protects your Toons from destruction by battle and card effects. You need to have this on the field and be able to protect it.</p><p>1x Dark Ruler No More: In case you have to go second, you can use this to stop any negates to be able to set up your end board, and since you won't be doing any life points your first turn, not being able to deal life points doesn't affect the deck much.</p><p>1x Harpie's Feather Duster: Spell and Trap removal, which the deck desperately needs since almost none of the deck has any form of removal.</p><p>2x Pot of Prosparity: You can either run this or Extravagance, but I prefer Prosparity since you can choose what cards you banish and choose what card to get, but if you think drawing more is better go ahead.</p><p>1x Terraforming: Use this to search for Toon Kingdom.</p><p>3x Toon Bookmark: The best searcher in the deck, as you can search most of the deck with it and it acts as protection for Toon Kingdom in the graveyard.</p><p>1x Toon Rollback: Since the end board of TBLS, Red-Eyes, and Dark Magician is 100 lp off lethal, I run one of these to give that last push if needed.</p><p>3x Toon Table of Contents: Almost as good as Toon Bookmark, but without the protection and it can't search Comic Hand unfortunately. Usually I end up using this to search out Bookmark to get more protection for Toon Kingdom.</p><p>3x Toon Page-Flip: This is to search either TBLS, Red-Eyes, or Dark Magician. None of them are bad to get off of this, but it is definitely preferred to get Red-Eyes or Dark Magician than TBLS simply because usually with one of those two you can get TBLS on the field anyway.</p><p>3x Toon Terror: The only negate in the deck, which is pretty good but requires Toon World and a Toon monster which only happens most of the time.</p><p>2x Dogmatika Punishment: Basically free removal since we don't use the extra deck too much.</p><p>1x Metaverse: Just in case you can't get Toon Kingdom out on your turn, you can try and get it out on your opponents.</p><p>1x Toon Briefcase: This is a decent card that doesn't activate graveyard effects which is pretty good, but if you want you can run a third Punishment instead.</p><p>Dragon Master Knight, Flower Cardian Lightflare, Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer, and Five-Headed Link Dragon: These are for Dogmatika Punishment and that's it.</p><p>1x Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon: One of the only cards in the extra deck we actually use. If you don't run Toon Cyber Dragon don't run this, and vice versa.</p><p>2x Linkuriboh: The other card we actually use sometimes in the extra deck, this is only for if it would more useful to get this than Red-Eyes.</p><p>The rest of the extra deck: These are just here to be targets for Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries. You can change these out for other cards if you think they are more of an issue.</p><p>1x Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon: I don't know, I just think it's funny and it doesn't feel like a Toon deck to me without this guy being at least somewhere.</p><p>3x Dimension Shifter: This is good against a variety of decks, and is just a good card.</p><p>3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring: It's Ash. That's it.</p><p>3x Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries: An underrated handtrap in my opinion, this against a few decks can just shut them down depending what is in our extra deck.</p><p>1x Pot of Prosperity: In case you want one more, here it is.</p><p>2x Evenly Matched: In cases where we brick and can't do anything, this is a good card to make the opponent destroy almost all of their board.</p><p>2x Toon Briefcase: If you really like this card, you can use more if you want.</p><p>Now for the strengths and weaknesses of the deck:</p><p>Strengths: Many people don't know what this deck can do, and they will think it's an easy victory because Toons are widely regarded as very bad. This deck is very good at OTKing if you get the right board.</p><p>Weaknesses: This deck is kind of bricky, and the deck cannot stop Zeus. If the opponent can get Zeus on the field, your best bet is for you to side into Ghost Reaper and pray you draw it, because if you don't you almost always lose.</p><p>Tips: 1) Go first if you can. This deck is based OTKing, but since most Toons can't attack the turn they are summoned the first turn you can OTK is turn 3 if you go first. 2) Protect Toon Kingdom. Get as much protection as you can for it, because if you don't, you will just lose. The main way to do this is using Table of Contents -&gt; Bookmark -&gt; The card you need.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

After that, tribute the spheres to summon su from hand, and maybe another su of tefnuit from deck.

Per riuscire a farlo vengono in nostro soccorso gli impcantation; la piuma ci fa recupare i mostri rituali dal cimitero, il libro le magie rituali dal cimitero, la candela ci fa prendere le magie rituali dal deck mentre il talismano i mostri rituali. Una volta capito bene come concatenare bene gli effetti dei mostri e delle magie nessuno potr&agrave; fermarvi tranne se ha un deck che contrasta gli effetti delle nostre carte. RICORDA: il drago occhi blu chaos quando attacca cambia la posizione dei mostri dell'avversario rendendo il loro atk e def a 0 invece il drago occhi blu chaos max infligge il doppio dei danni se atacca un mostro in posizione di def(es. 4000atk-2000def=2000 danni x2 grazie all'effetto diventato 4000 danni mentre se 4000atk-0def=4000 danni x2 =8000 danni), GLI EFFETTI SI ATTIVANO SOLO SE ABBIAMO USATO DRAGO BIANCO OCCHI BLU PER EVOCARLI!!! grazie per aver letto fino a qui e spero che vi piaccia come deck. se avete consigli per migliorarlo scrivete pure.</p>"

Just made some minor tweaks to the main and side deck.</p><p>The idea here to turbo out Meteor Black Dragon with Fusion Party and just go for the OTK. Run (3) of each of the fusion materials as we'll want to see them as soon as possible. We also run (3) Double Coston to pay for Red-Eyes. This will be helpful if you need some extra attack for the OTK or if you get really unlucky and don't draw into Meteor Dragon. Sphere Kuriboh is here to prevent dead hands and provide some protection.&nbsp;</p><p>As for spells, we'll run (2) Polymerization and (3) Summoner's Art. This pretty much gurantees we can perform the fusion on our first or second turn. If you want, you could probably even replace one of the Polys (or both?) with a Hammer Shot to help clear the board. I've rarely had to use an extra Poly as Fusion Party is just an incredibly powerful card for this deck.</p><p>For traps we run (2) Dust Tornado and (2) Red-Eyes Spirit. Dust Tornado to keep the backrow clear and Red-Eyes Spirit to get our fusion pieces back with ease for even more attack.</p><p>The extra deck willl just run (3) Meteor Black Dragon. A very classic and nostalgic card if you grew up on Forbidden Memories like I did. The side deck is kind of a toolbox to deal with whatever you need to in the current meta. Anyways, have fun with it!</p>"

Bait out an Ash Blossom using Terraforming/Evil Eye Domain.</p><p>2. Set any Unchained spell/trap. Destroy it with Aruha or Rakea.</p><p>3. Special summon Sarama from the deck. Use their effect to set your spell/trap onto the field and destroy your other Unchained monster.</p><p>4. Special summon Abominable Unchained Soul or Unchained Soul of Disaster from the deck. Go into Unchained Soul of Rage or any other available Fiend Link monster.</p><p>5. If you have your normal summon left, use it to summon Serziel and equip it with Evil Eye of Selene.</p><p>This does unfortunately leave you open for Nibiru (5 summons). If you want to play it safe and not risk having your field tributed, you can skip either step 3 or 5. If you think your opponent has a negate or interruption available, think about skipping step 3.</p><hr /><p>The side deck mostly consists of cards you can consider adding to your deck. If you know you are going first, it might be a good idea to take out DRNM for Infinite Impermenance or Evil Eye Retribution. If you have Pot of Prosperity, then you can also replace Pot of Extravagance with it to avoid unlucky banishes. The number of Torrential Tributes is up to preference.</p><hr /><p>Thank you for reading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

You could remove the main-deck Ghostrick monsters from this list, but I wanted to challenge myself and see if I could build a list that uses them effectively. The endboard we are looking to make is Psychic End Punisher, Utopic Draco Future, and a set Ghostrick Renovation with a Ghostrick Mansion in our field zone, letting us activate Necrovalley on the opponent's turn. This isn't a final list, just a proof-of-concept that I hope others will take and run with to better optimize the build. I'll be going over what the archetypes do together, the card choices, and a few combos for the deck down below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>P.U.N.K. needs little introduction, they're an incredible synchro engine that can turbo-out Lv and Rank 8's, as well as Lv 3 mons. We use the Lv 3 summoning capabilities to make Alucard, which lets us extend into UDF while searching out other pieces of the Ghostrick toolbox. We lean heaviliy on the P.U.N.K. engine, so we are running a pretty full package. The Ghostricks in the deck are for turn 2 and later, letting us build advantage in a longer game, and helping us to survive if our combo gets stopped. The Lv 1's are here to protect our lifepoints and let us live for another turn should our board get broken, the Lv 2's are great at halting the opponent's momentum, and Jianshi is a good searcher. We are only running one Scare, as it is searchable and our turn 1 play doesn't involve setting mons, and we run Shot at 2 due to it's versatility and ability to extend our plays and provide follow-up on future turns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Out basic lines of play all start with a P.U.N.K. starter (Ze Amin, Foxy Tune, Ogre Dance, Emergency Teleport, or Sharakusai with another P.U.N.K. in hand). Our goal is to get Ze Amin on the field, search Foxy Tune / any other starter, then combo to the best of our ability. If we normal Ze Amin and get negated, but have another starter in hand (E-Tele, Foxy), we can summon another Lv 3 and make Alucard, then follow the Ghostrick line into UDF, or we can extend further by summoning Sharakusai, fusion-summoning Rising Carp, using Carp to summon a Lv 3 and a Deer Note, make JAM Dragon Drive adn search our remaining Lv 3, summon back a Lv 3 / Lv 8 off of Deer note, and make either Psychic End Punisher or UDF. An ideal hand is Ze Amin, an extender, and another P.U.N.K. in hand. We summon Ze Amin, search Foxy / Ze Amin (if we already have Foxy), then special out Sharakusai. Fuse Ze Amin with the other P.U.N.K. in hand to make Rising Carp, tribute Carp to summon Wa Gon and Deer Note. Use Wa Gon to search the field spell and activate it, then make JAM Dragon Drive, searching Madame Spider and summoning back Sharakusai, and drawing a card off of the field spell. Special Madame Spider with the field spell, then search a trap, drawing another card. Make Psychic End Punisher, then overlay for Alucard, overlaying him for Angel of Mischief. Detatch Alucard to search Shot / Mansion / Renovation, depending on what your hand looks like. Summon back Alucard with Shot, overlay for another Angel, then detatch again to search another card, adding Shot back from GY with Alucard's effect. Overlay for Utopic Future, then for Utopic Draco Future. If we had Shot / Mansion / Renovation in hand at the start of the combo, we can also end on a set Renovation with Mansion active, swapping Mansion out for Necrovalley on the opponent's turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this list has inspired you to make your own take on Ghostricks! Hopefully this has been a fun read, and an interesting build! Thank you for reading this, and I hope you have a great day!</p>"
