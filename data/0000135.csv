Zoodiac-Zeus  just couldn't stand up to the metagame and it just couldn't play the slow game - something a control deck is supposed to be good at, it burns it resources too early. For this reason I am using both the Dogmatika and Eldlich cards to do this job. This deck and play both the 1st and seconds game, is very consistent and has only 1 brick in the form of driver. Going first it can set up a multiple negate board and going second Zeus can wreak everything. This deck can end on Drident, 2 pops, a monster negate and multiple backrow going first. Going second you can make Zeus with multiple materials, and also use cards like gamma to counter VFD and use golden lord as removal. This deck is a solid pick for the metagame and can also counter most meta decks. The side deck was designed to answer all the top tier meta decks as of now.

","40 card infernoble deck, using armageddon knight and plague spreader. Also using the deskbot auroadon combo. Cut the genba out, and the chalice to 2 bc i really wanted to make the profile 40 cards. The deck can play through certian handtraps like ash and imperm, but the deck loses to nibiru more often now. This isn't a problem because right now there is no deck that beats every hand trap. So if you are scarred to play any deck bc it loses to one hand trap you should just play a different game lol no side deck currently bc I have only played it online in singles. When i test it on remote duels and irl i will add a side deck. Also the deck has good one card/ two card combos that end on nasty boards, but also it has its own bricks, but any deck can brick. The bricks are not terrible you can play thru one brick bc plague spreader can put one card back into the deck, but drawing two of them makes it tougher, and you just need to use your brain to figure out a play. Also since i cut genba if you draw two of the one off equip spells you cannot do full combo, so adding genba is not a terrible idea if you want to have a back up play incase you do draw that. Also extra deck is pretty standard, except the abomination, i like it bc the charles abom synergy is ridilous but you can switch it for any other card maybe appolusa or accescode talker. Also the phantom in the side deck is for a hand loop combo i will show in a video. ALSO HAND TRAPS CAN BE CHANGED IF YOU OWN TTT PLAY IT INSTEAD OF LANCEA ITS BETTER BUT pick handtraps that fit ur meta and what decks you play against."

The deck is semi-competitive and you might brick some times (for me it happens in 1 out of 10 duels so it's not terrible).  You would ussualy go first and hope your opponent doesn't have a way to stop your plays. A great opening hand is Crimson Resonator + level 4 non-Tuner monster. Special Summon Crimson, then summon non-Tuner, go into Red Rising, revive Crimson and then use Crimson's effect to summon more tuner and go into other plays.  The deck has some decent field destruction, effect negation and A LOT of beatsticks. I put Red Supernova because it's just a very fun combination of beatstick and negation, but you can put whatever you want,e though you can can summon it on first turn to flex on opponent ;)  Most of spells and traps are there due to my personal prefrences and you can change them, but you should keep at least 2 Resonator Calls, 2 Resonator Commands and 2 Iron-scrap Signals."

(artimyle sucks btw)  just a way, to full on attack the main weakness is monster effects, cause with lady in wight in graveyard its unnefected by battle or trap/spell effects.  so yes monster effects can counter this deck but not enough to destroy it. this is a way to catch someone offguard leaving even a 4000 atk monster in attack still being aable to win."

No Problem! Behold my Funny Numbers deck! I can assure you that they will die a quick overwhelming death ;) by","Hello fellow Yu-Gi-Oh! Players. Did you just accidentally wanted to search for boring Meta decks but somehow got into my shitty side; then well what a welcome suprise. This deck is one of the simplest and funniest decks that you have ever seen. I have run a countless amounts of tests and I say that it is a deck that kills fast and efficient (if they don't play magic zylinder). But don't take my word. Take the words of our specialists called my friends (just kiddin, I have no friends ) and if you like it or support those braindead idea of mine, just leave a like or comment something for me to know so that I can post more of those abominations. And if you have questions about this deck, just comment bellow and i'll answer them as quick as possible.  How the deck works is simple. Even me monke brain understands this. Effektive Going 1st and 2nd, be assured that you're opponents will die as easy as possible by beating them with some 20k beatsticks for you being able to have lunch while otheres are sweating to win the match. And the best thing is that it is cheap. I made this deck as cheap as possible for you guys so that even the brokest of people (me included) can afford a competetive meta deck. I am talking to the brokest of the broke, the people that want to have the most fun with the least money to dab on the corpses of the meta players that paid hundreds and hundreds of dollars for crappy cardboard. *dab* And for the rich people out there that play gucci or louis vuitton there are some extra variants that you can play by putting your average op cards in it. Without further a do let's get right into it.  What's the strat?  Firstly be a gentleman and ask them whether they want going first or second. For you it doesn't matter but going 2nd is most of the time funnier because you can then run them over with your beatsticks.  Rules and Card effects are:  Try to get network resolving at all costs.  You can summon only one monster after network is resolved(but you can set 1 extra)  Always throw the kaiju at the opponents side before activating network.  You can only activate network if you control now monsters.  Psychic Fervor must be the last chain if not you'll die from Lp loss.  All your numerons cards get banished if they were not used for summon material in end phase.  Don't summon more monsters than neccessary to otk because of network and nibiru can screw you up longtime.  If you activate Kaiju slumber give yourself  the Light machine one first before giving the other one the normal light thunder one.  Going 1st you usually just summon 3 gates out of network to avoid nibiru and then go into zexal (a cheap trick for a cheap deck). and try to resolve gamma by negating a handtrap or activating Hope to draw additional cards to otk your opponents next turn with your drawn cards. Or just summon Inspector Boarder, set and pass. Works almost every time.  Going 2nd you usually make it a little bit more interesting. Firstly you have to get rid of the problematic monsters. If you drew a kaiju and your opponents summoned a monster just tribute the one that negates and then activate the eff of numeron network. No worries you'll draw it I made sure that this deck is filled of to the brimm with cards that search it and if not just resolve mystic mine (teeheehee). The strat is to bring out the gates because, if you haven't figured out yet. It's skystriker. ok ok I'll stop. Almost all of the monsters this deck has are light and machines what makes them perfect targets for having otk potential by activating Limiter removal, Psychic-Fervor, Honest or vic viper t301. The trick is to get the atk of your monsters on field as high as possible. The effect that boosts atk the least must be activated as the latest chain so that the atk will be as high as possible. And if you have problems getting over monsters or fear of backrow you can always use your extradeck. Mekk knight astram being a light with the eff to gain atk when attacking a special summoned monster (Kaiju *cough cough*) and Megaclops being machine make them viable with the doubling atk cards so that they will ensure you to kill them in one turn. And if you have kaiju slumber and two cards that boosts atk for example honest and limiter remover your monster's atk will get up to 13200atk which will roll over your opponents monster with ease.  The rest is self-explanatory.  Bonus for the ones reading this far:  You can spice this budget deck up by putting money cards in it to make it even better but more expensive. I would highly suggest putting magicians souls(with dogmatika fleur de lis) to get rid of unnecassary copys of network in your hand. This card will also allow you to play relinquished anima. Effect veiler although not expensive will also allow you to go into needlefiber and then selene and with the spells you discarded threw souls you'll be able to summon access code talker that is in itself a beast. A perfect addition to the main would also be forbidden droplet which in bonus of negation, reduces the opponents atk. Don't forget AA Zeus after overlaying into zexal and stunning your opponents. Guess what? Zeus is Light-Machine! And where should I begin with the side? Lightningstorm and so on and so on...  And if you came this far let me tell you a secret. Did you know that the Invoked Engines bossmonsters Invoked Mechaba is a Light Machine?!?! and that aleister has a effect that further doubles the atk? If you like me to show you the Invoked version of the deck let me know in the comments. Wish you a happy 2021!  Edit: HOLY FUCK! HOLY FUCK! I just realized now that Drytrons are LIGHT-MACHINE. How come I have just noticed yet. So now you can choose from Invoked, Numeron and Drytron-Light-Machine OTK! I'll probably make one Invoked and Drytron one sooner or later. I look forward to it. See ya!!!"

""Digital Bugs"" are often labeled as the test version for the ""Zoodiac"" archetype, since they use their archetypal monsters to stack into other monsters at their disposal. They are, however, a lot weaker due to overall weaker effects, the need for Xyz materials to start Xyz climbing and the focus on position changing. Nonetheless, they gained a support card in <em>Blazing Vortex</em> that helps immensely and makes them a fun little deck that can actually use its gimmick to full effect.</p> <p>Due to their restrictiveness in summoning by asking for specific Attribute/Type combinations, you will have to run quite a lot of the archetype's monsters. I run three ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Resistrider"">Digital Bug Resistrider</a>"", which is an amazing support card that can manipulate levels, Special Summon itself when a Level 3 Insect monster is Normal Summoned and allows for position changing which benefits the overall strategy. ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Centibit"">Digital Bug Centibit</a>"" summons monsters from the deck and allows the Xyz monster this monster is material of to attack all opposing defense position monsters. ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Websolder"">Digital Bug Websolder</a>"" changes positions, Special Summons Level 3 Insects from the hand and makes defense values 0 when used as Xyz material. ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug LEDybug"">Digital Bug LEDybug</a>"" searches and allows Xyz monsters to draw cards whenever they destroy monsters in battle. ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Cocoondenser"">Digital Bug Cocoondenser</a>"" is primarily used as a monster revive.</p> <p>Non-archetypal monsters include ""<a data-name=""Galaxy Worm"">Galaxy Worm</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a>"", which provide easily summonable and self-searching Level 3/Level 5 monsters, ""<a data-name=""Honest"">Honest</a>"" as surprising ATK boosts, ""<a data-name=""Bachibachibachi"">Bachibachibachi</a>"" to deal trample damage when used as Xyz material and ""<a data-name=""Mirror Ladybug"">Mirror Ladybug</a>"" as an additional Special Summon.</p> <p>The backrow is pretty straightforward: ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>"" clear front and backrow respectively, ""<a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>"" is a useful draw option that does not really deal any damage to the overall consistency since every necessary card is at three, three ""<a data-name=""Bug Signal"">Bug Signal</a>"" allows your Xyz monster to dodge certain targeting effects and serves as the ""Digital Bug"" Rank-Up. Three copies of ""<a data-name=""Bug Emergency"">Bug Emergency</a>"" can provide additional monsters for Xyz summons while also giving you an easier time summoning higher ranked monsters, three ""<a data-name=""Stumbling"">Stumbling</a>"" trigger summoning effects of ""Digital Bug"" monsters while providing some field control and lastly two ""<a data-name=""Curse of Anubis"">Curse of Anubis</a>"" to have position changing on reaction. I also included ""<a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a>"" to potentially stop opposing plays.</p> <p>The Extra Deck looks as follows: Three ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Scaradiator"">Digital Bug Scaradiator</a>"" are absolutely necessary for climbing, beatdown and useful effect negation, two ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">Digital Bug Corebage</a>"" have grown on me since they do actually work quite well and one ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Rhinosebus"">Digital Bug Rhinosebus</a>"" as a finisher/beatdown option. Going into ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>""/""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>"" is a useful option that can be opted into rather often, ""<a data-name=""Inzektor Exa-Stag"">Inzektor Exa-Stag</a>"" is another Rank-Up option, while ""<a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse"">Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse</a>"" is backrow removal. The deck included one ""<a data-name=""Number 20: Giga-Brilliant"">Number 20: Giga-Brilliant</a>"" which was a worst-case-scenario option, but after some feedback I included a copy of ""<a data-name=""Number 3: Cicada King"">Number 3: Cicada King</a>"" for being an absolute god-send that interacts with the ""Digital Bug"" archetype in various ways. The Link monsters consist of ""<a data-name=""Inzektor Picofalena"">Inzektor Picofalena</a>"" for small stat boosts, deck thinning and card draw, ""<a data-name=""Armillyre, the Starleader Dragon"">Armillyre, the Starleader Dragon</a>"" for Special Summoning, ""<a data-name=""Topologic Trisbaena"">Topologic Trisbaena</a>"" as an improved backrow remover and ""<a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a>"" for all the useful things the monster does.</p> <p>This ""Digital Bug"" build is certainly not the end-all-solution to what can be done with this archetype. However, I think this is a valid start.

From the time the archetype was originally released up to 2019, the deck was, quite lacking to say the least. The archetype in more pure builds had not much going for it, and required a bunch of generic extenders to get plays going. Then 2019 came along, releasing the Legendary Hero Decks. So far the most recent installment in the Legendary Decks series of products, came with a blessing for the PK players (or at least the people who like PK), but a curse to practically everyone else, <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>. This card was and still is an absolutely insane card that boosted the PK deck immensely to the point that in pure builds the best way to play it was Bardiche turbo. Being able to cover a majority of the PK's major weaknesses as an archetype were fixed, being able to both send a PK monster to the graveyard, and set a PK S/T afterwards. This is where the card gets more insane when you remember the PK's best S/T is a trap card that negates, and being able to send <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a> to fetch another one from the deck. If Bardiche doesn't get negated, you have one free negate on the board just by summoning the damn thing. The craziest thing about <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a> is that the card only requires Dark monsters for its summon, being able to be abused by predominantly Dark decks. This is where the best deck at the time, <a data-name=""Orcust"">Orcust</a>, comes in. Orcust was a powerful beast of a deck in 2019 with major consistency and <a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu</a>, being able to stack the PK's newfound power on top of it, along with another insanely powerful card at the time, <a data-name=""Outer Entity Azathot"">Outer Entity Azathot</a> (basically the VFD of 2019, when being summoned by <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a>, also settable through Bardiche btw), It became too much of a trouble where Konami pulled a <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> FTK format and didn't hit the actual enablers of these plays until January 2020, Banning <a data-name=""Orcust Harp Horror"">Orcust Harp Horror</a>, the main consistency booster of Orcust, <a data-name=""Bardiche"">Bardiche</a>, for being an insane splashable tool, and Azathot, to let people play the game again. (Oh and the rest of the 2019 meta, everything got banned), Fast forward to September 2020, Konami decided to bring back The <a data-name=""Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>, to help hype up the upcoming set in November 2020, Phantom Rage, which came with some new Phantom Knights support, which has not only made the purer builds of PK more menacing, but also boosted the power enough to make the deck a rouge competitor in the meta today! <h2>Deck List:</h2> <h4>The Phantom Knights</h4> 3 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a>: This is the best piece of support the Phantom Knights archetype got in Phantom Rage and for good reason, It's both a starter card, and an extender card. This is a card that you want to play 3 of as much as you can in any PK deck, its insane versatility and reliability as a card in the deck makes it a permanent 3 of in every form of PK.  3 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a>:  3 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a>:  2 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves"">The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</a>:  1 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves"">The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves</a>: <h4>The Other Monsters</h4> 3 <a data-name=""Marauding Captain"">Marauding Captain</a>: This is the second of your 3 normal summons in the deck, being able to turbo out another monster on summon making easy cherubini plays is really, really nice to have. Not every build must play this, but it's one that's used in a lot of builds for it's generi use. A classic card,.remembering the days of GOAT format when this thing was at 2 to make the battle lock less consistent, now that effect of Marauding Captain doesn't come up often nowadays, it's still something to take note of.  3 <a data-name=""Tour Guide from The Underworld"">Tour Guide from The Underworld</a>: The 3rd main normal summon of the deck, has the same first effect as marauding captain but it's type specific but allows you to not need the target you want in hand, it's a duality that is nice to remember, Marauding summons in from hand with only lv restriction, Tour Guide summons from hand or deck with both a type and lv restriction.  2 <a data-name=""Graff, Malebranche of The Burning Abyss"">Graff, Malebranche of The Burning Abyss</a>: This is the main target you want to summon off of Tour Guide, not drawing into Tour Guide is still not much of an issue if you can still make <a data-name=""Cherubini"">Cherubini</a> to send this card to get it's effect off. Playing 2 of it is ideal because if you draw into it as a 1 of, your combos will require more resources, and playing it at 3 is not ideal in this build since you don't necessarily want to draw into it outside of PK Fire.  2 <a data-name=""Cir, Malebranche of The Burning Abyss"">Cir, Malebranche of The Burning Abyss</a>: This is the target you want to summon off of Graff. Also playing 2 for the same reasons and it's also a harder garnet than Graff if you play it at 1.  1 <a data-name=""Farfa, Malebranche of The Burning Abyss"">Farfa, Malebranche of The Burning Abyss</a>: The card you want to summon off of Graff if you go second instead of Cir to help clear up your opponent's board of a troublesome card during your combo. Don't need to run 2 as you aren't always going second, and that it's not entirely dead in hand.  ,3 <a data-name=""Kagemucha Knight"">Kagemucha Knight</a>: The best extender in the deck, if you draw this with any other monster, you practically just have a free Cherubini to start off your combos. (It can also chain block your Tour Guide against ash which is really helpful but not insane as imperm is still a card, but even then you still have the materials to go into Cherubini so it wouldn't matter too much.)  1 <a data-name=""Psychic Traker"">Psychic Traker</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Psychic Wheeleder"">Psychic Wheeleder</a>: You can definitely play more of these if you want but I prefer the Danger!? package because of it's draw power.  1 <a data-name=""Danger!? Jackelope?"">Danger!? Jackelope?</a> &amp; Danger!? Tsuchinoko?: This little Danger!? package is really nice to play in the deck as they are dark lv 3 monsters that special summon themselves while also setting up the graveyard, albeit randomly, that also draw a card on their summon, play 3 of these if they ever go back to 3.  1 <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a>: Garnets in every sense of the word, only played in here for the Dragoon engine, an engine that is really helpful in PK as PK can't play through negation as easily as decks like VW or Infernobles.  1 <a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver"">Psy-Frame Driver</a>: Gamma fodder and that's it. <h4>Spells</h4> 1 Reinforcement of The Army: One of the most famous cards in the game and for good reason, generic searching fro any warrior monster you need is really helpful.  1 Foolish Burial:  1 Emergency Teleport:  1 Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force:  1 Red-Eyes Fusion: <h4>Traps</h4> 3 Phantom Knights' Fog Blade: <h4>, Hand Traps</h4> 3 Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring:  3 Infinite Impermanence:  3 Psy-Framegear Gamma:  (Im going to finish writing this i swear =-=)"

Then you just tribute for Vanity's and pass. Most modern decks rely on summons, so Vanity's is a great card. Addittionally, you can have extra negates in Orange and Ultimateness."

Miradora, Skywing of the Whirlwind)","A Speedroid deck and a poor example of wordplay. I hadn't really played Speedroid in a while, so when I realized that Miradora, Skywing of the Whirlwind is a thing, I decided to make this. This is more of a go-second deck, thanks to the 9 hand traps (Including the three Miradoras) and the Lightning Storms and Harpie's Feather Duster.  &nbsp;  As for Miradora itself, it's a pretty iffy card. Firstly, yes, it's good that its effects and their activations can't be negated. But you can only summon it if the monster your opponent summoned from the Extra Deck has at least 2000 ATK. So against cards like Invoked Mechaba, Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon, The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche, and Borreload Savage Dragon, the card is pretty good.  &nbsp;  But against weaker monsters that still have very powerful effects likePredaplant Verte Anaconda, this card is useless. Still, I'm not gonna let an excuse to use Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon go to waste!"

There are staple cards in the extra-deck to help along the deck and make it more consistent. For example, an easy board to get out is Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon and Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess with 3-4 link materials. This board has 3-4 monster negates and an omni-negate. If you can get even better combos you can extend to things like Borrelsword Dragon and Borreload Savage Dragon. The main combo starter of this deck is Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm which you can get into the grave with cards like Dragon Shrine and Foolish Burial to start the board off. Overall this deck is pretty decent but isn't overly good that can be considered top tier. Maybe at best a tier 3-2 deck or rogue deck that can do good at times.

You shouldn´t expect to outgrind something like Eldlich, but most of the time you can.  The new Ravenwing/ Blackfeather (what ever his name is to you) is amazing, it is basically a +2. For the most time you won´t have a problem to mill a Plunder, so u get a free recursion plus a special summon, also if u milled Bluebeard you can special summon him too.  Also if u use Ravenwing + Redbeard to link off into Blackbeard u can equip the redbeard of its own effect and then special summon him back of the effect of Ravenwing, so u got a material for Blackbeard.  Don´t get me started on the possibilities u get with Ravenwing + Goldenhair, for example you can pitch Goldenhair for any effect, then activate Ravenwing to recur her, then use Goldenhairs effect to special her, then u can link em off into Blackbeard. Now you can special Goldenhair from GY again of her effect (since her special summons are two different effects and both can be used once per turn) and if u got an equipped Plunder u could special this one too because of Ravenwing.  As I mentioned this card is amazing, recursion + special summon + replacement for zero cost (since most of the time you will be locked into Plunders anyway).  Now I would like to explain my deck choices. You will be playing 3 of any Plunder monster, because all are at least useable (redbeard) and most of them are really good (Whitebeard/Goldenhair/Ravenwing). 3 Pot of desires, so you play almost anything as 3 and you need the draw power. 3 Shipyarrds, the field spell is amazing it mills and it searches - amazing, therefore also 1 Terraforming. 2 Shipshape ship shipping, honestly you can play 3 of them since this card is very good for discarding and it frees you from a light monster to summon lys and it equips plunder cards, but it´s my least favorable card and I don´t wanna play more than 40 cards. At last 3 booty, amazing card recursion + attribute choice - really important card btw. My handtraps are 3 ash, 2 veiler, 3 imperm and for backrow 2 twin twister.  My extra is nothing special, two of every Plunder (if u aren´t that good or unexperienced with plunder I recommend to ditch the bijinki and play 3 Blackbeards), 1 Dragite for spell/traps, 1 bahamut +toadally for negates+recursion of toadally, 1 white aura whale good almost board wipe which can be chain blocked by the materials for it (not that good in the current format, u could swap it for masquerina), 1 almiraj for goldenhair shenanigans, 1 bujinki for the 1 abyss dweller.  My side deck shows a wide spread of possible cards which can be used, but I really recommend the Kaijus (good outs for Dragun and attributes for u to use).

""Fortune Ladies"" are a fairly unique archetype with various effects that gain stats according to their level times a certain number. Right off the start, the Main Deck monsters are rather bad at battling despite the fact that this is actually an Aggro deck, but they can build a very potent draw engine that allows the Extra Deck to shine.</p> <p>The archetypal monsters in the deck consist of three copies of ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Water"">Fortune Lady Water</a>"", who are the main monster of the draw engine due to allowing you to draw two cards whenever she is Special summoned while you control a ""Fortune Lady"" monster (not once per turn, btw.), three copies of ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Light"">Fortune Lady Light</a>"" who searches other ""Fortune Ladies"" when she leaves the field due to an effect and three ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Past"">Fortune Lady Past</a>"" as a ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Light"">Fortune Lady Light</a>"" enabler and very useful Tuner monster. The single copies include ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Dark"">Fortune Lady Dark</a>"", which can trigger a revival chain if all the stars align correctly, ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Fire"">Fortune Lady Fire</a>"" as monster removal with a useful burn effect and ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Wind"">Fortune Lady Wind</a>"" who dabbles in backrow removal when Normal Summoned. I also included a some ""Fortune Fairy"" monsters since they also belong to the archetype: One ""<a data-name=""Fortune Fairy Hikari"">Fortune Fairy Hikari</a>"" helps with the summoning of either ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Light"">Fortune Lady Light</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Past"">Fortune Lady Past</a>"" while still being useful to summon ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"" in a pickle, while ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Swee"">Fortune Lady Swee</a>"" can take both your and the opposing monsters from the field temporarily for various effects.</p> <p>Due to the lack of disruption and sizeable beaters, I got inspired by ""DarkArmedDuelist"" and included a ""Silent Magician"" engine. The three copies of ""<a data-name=""Silent Magician"">Silent Magician</a>"" can reach up to 4000 ATK in the deck with relative ease and provide Spell negation while they can also search the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Silent Magician LV8"">Silent Magician LV8</a>"" upon their demise.</p> <p>The backrow helps the archetype's strategy in various ways: ""<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>"" can fetch ""<a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>"" to get rid of a monster, while also potentially summoning ""<a data-name=""Time Wizard of Tomorrow"">Time Wizard of Tomorrow</a>"" for a gimmicky nuke effect. ""<a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>"" searches either ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Light"">Fortune Lady Light</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Past"">Fortune Lady Past</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a>"" is able to summon ""<a data-name=""Quintet Magician"">Quintet Magician</a>"" as a potential game-ender, the ""Spellbook"" engine of ""<a data-name=""Spellbook of Secrets"">Spellbook of Secrets</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledge"">Spellbook of Knowledge</a>"" allows for searchable card draw that also triggers ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Light"">Fortune Lady Light</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Calling"">Fortune Lady Calling</a>"" is a useful summoning tool that can fetch you ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Water"">Fortune Lady Water</a>"" for draws but can also summon all the others, ""<a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a>"" is there due to various levels to hit, ""<a data-name=""Fortune's Future"">Fortune's Future</a>"" can use banished cards for further card draw, ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" gives more consistency by searching ""<a data-name=""Future Visions"">Future Visions</a>"" which is helpful for your ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Light"">Fortune Lady Light</a>"" while potentially screwing the opposing plays over, ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" revives, ""<a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>"" counters Hand Traps, ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Rewind"">Fortune Lady Rewind</a>"" is a ""<a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a>""-esque card for the archetype and ""<a data-name=""Fortune Vision"">Fortune Vision</a>"" is a searcher with various useful effects added to it.</p> <p>The Extra Deck has, as usual, various options to help your game plan. We covered the Fusion monsters already, so there is only the same ratio of Synchro and Link monsters left to talk about. Since ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Calling"">Fortune Lady Calling</a>"" locks you into Synchro monsters it is nice to have some options, such as ""<a data-name=""Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons"">Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons</a>"" as a sizeable and growing beater against certain matchups, ""<a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a>"" as a really solid negation/beatdown tool, ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" as a field nuke, ""<a data-name=""F.A. Dawn Dragster"">F.A. Dawn Dragster</a>"" as another negate and ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Every"">Fortune Lady Every</a>"" for both her recurrence and the banish effect. The Link options consist of ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"" to get yourself rid of the attack restriction of ""<a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>"" while also walling single monsters, the ""Knightmare"" engine as removal and ""<a data-name=""Puzzlomino, the Drop-n-Deleter"">Puzzlomino, the Drop-n-Deleter</a>"" as a level manipulation tool with added monster destruction.</p> <p>""Fortune Lady"" really seems like a deck that is rather fickle. One game you might be able to draw 10+ cards due to your combo working perfectly well, while completely bricking in the next game. They are certainly interesting to play and use some effects that you do not see that often in the game. If you want to know more about the ""Fortune Lady"" archetype, I have written an archetype analysis for them, which you can find here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/11/01/archetype-analysis-fortune-lady-fortune-fairy/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/11/01/archetype-analysis-fortune-lady-fortune-fairy/ </a></p>"

The goofball known as ChupiTrooper returns with yet another Time Thief list! What's gotten into him THIS time? Is he plotting some grand heist to ring in the new year? Has he finally lost it and begun to plot his revenge against those who wronged him?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  ...Nah. It's just the chemicals in my brain responding to super weird rogue strategies acting up again.  Odd and boisterous intro aside, Happy New Year, all! Congratulations on surviving the prior, taken as you will. Figure I may as well start this year off with something interesting I discovered.  Now, I'm sure my previous list, the post-Phantom Rage build of Phantom Thieves of Time can show off the unity that these history-altering vigilantes can exhibit with fellow DARK doofuses. But what about their capabilities going solo?  Well, I'd say that I and all fifteen other players of Time Thieves are in luck! By some strange miracle, Konami had the heart to grace us with another wave of support for these guys! (albeit somewhat sparse and not what we were initially expecting) Guess they really do care for these guys after all. First the indirect support line that was Phantom Rage's collection of Phantom Knights, Raidraptor, and Xyz Dragon bolstering attempts, now this. Which, I can't complain. Any friend of sweet ol' handsome Mr. Redoer's a friend of mine.  Back to the original point, it seems I've spent so much time splashing PK's with these bad boys that I never really realized how well these guys have it playing it solo. Well, maybe ""solo"" isn't too accurate given the presence of some certain LIGHT-Attribute helpers here, but I digress. Truth is, these guys can actually get a lot done if you focus on them and them alone! Not to say other variants of Time Thieves aren't on its level. Play whatever sings to ya, you crazy metaphorical choir conductor!  Though, full disclosure. And credit where credit is due. I've cited a majority of the decklist, combos, and ideas for this article from the two lovely lads known as <strong>BladeYGO</strong> and <strong>Rogue Theory</strong> on YouTube in their recent collaboration, <strong><span>Time Thief - A Timely Guide (Lore &amp; Archetype Explained!) - Yu-Gi-Oh!. </span></strong><span>Go do yourself a big favor and check out both that video and their other content, they had me sold from this and this alone! Not to mention, they're far more talented and knowledgeable on these silly TCG matters than I'll likely ever be.</span>  <span><strong>The wonderful video in question:</strong></span> <a href=""https://youtu.be/2Rab5Am4fmk"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">https://youtu.be/2Rab5Am4fmk</a>  <span><strong>BladeYGO's Channel:</strong></span> <a>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQfpwDdx3MNcWNYZEByt3qg</a>  <strong><span>Rogue Theory's Channel:</span></strong> <a>https://www.youtube.com/user/megamanox1</a>  &nbsp;  With that out of the way, and without further ado, my take on pure Time Thieves awaits! Holy cow, what kinda energy crept into me while typing this? But yeah, the deck is all about Xyz material and opponent's card manipulation, bouncing out card to avoid disruptive effects, and overall just biting back hard if your opponent dares to try anything devious against you.  As always, I'll opt to go in order of archetypes, as to demonstrate each card in a set organization to go over what they do for the deck. <h2><span>Time Thieves</span></h2> The stars of the show. The head honchos. The big dogs---well, five head honchos and a dog, per se.  Time Thieves are back in quack-tion, at least in my humble opinion, and they're more than capable of messing with your opponent's field, deck, GY, and head in such a way that the ""Virus"" Traps could only dream of doing. Five Main Deck monsters and three Extra Deck monsters deep may seem kinda underwhelming, but these guys more than make up for it with what I believe to be one of the most interesting and sly methods of interaction ever since their Savage Strike Debut. <ul>  	<li>Rounding things off as always is the mandatory three-of and equally as loyal pooch, <b><a data-name=""Time Thief Regulator"">Time Thief Regulator</a></b>. Best Normal Summon in the deck, and card you want to open with, though bringing him out with a certain tribal Quick-Play Spell will do equally as well. Either way, when he's all alone on the field, he tributes himself to round up a pair of his differently-named brethren from the deck in Defense. This not only lets you set up an Xyz Summon like nothing, but also allows you to proc some of your most useful effects to get your plays started. Its second effect revives itself should an Xyz Monster you control be walked over by an opponent's monster, with the threat of being banished should it leave the field afterwards. Man's best friend, I tell you. Or um, should it be man, woman, and double machine's best friend in this case?</li>  	<li>Next in the line of three-ofs is the second most handsome go-getter in the deck, acting as both a play starter and extender when the situation calls. <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Winder"">Time Thief Winder</a></b></span> is something else, lemme tell ya. Should you Normal Summon him or activate his in-hand effect to Special Summon himself by detaching a material from an Xyz monster you control, he allows for the search of any ""Time Thief"" card in your deck, barring himself. Truth be told, if he's summoned period, you can activate his effect just as easily! Makes wish every Main Deck searcher was this intuitive.</li>  	<li>About time this deck got its dedicated Foolish-ing system, no pun intended. Popping up in Ghosts From the Past as Perpetua's past pupil, <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Adjuster"">Time Thief Adjuster</a></b></span>'s the young lassie we've all been waiting for. Her first effect gives you the option whenever your other Time Thief is summoned, to summon her from your hand as a freebie. Her other's more important, however, as she lets you send a ""Time Thief"" card of any kind from your deck to your GY. That way, you can set up the effects of the last two Main Deck Thieves or one of their backrow when the time comes! One little thing, however. Whoever decided Adjuster needed to have the same ""only one effect per turn, and only once that turn"" clause as the Elemental HEROes Shadow Mist and Liquid Soldier needs like, a very light bonk on the noggin with a squeaky hammer. Just sayin'.</li>  	<li>Whether you're playing one or two of this next monster, he definitely puts in some work. <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Bezel Ship"">Time Thief Bezel Ship</a></b></span>, who looks like a projectile weapon from Touhou or Legend of Dark Witch or something, has the core role of reviving himself from the GY by detaching an Xyz material from one of your monsters, a la Winder. Unlike Winder, though, he has the same fear of leaving the field for a reason other than future Xyz material much like Regulator. But! If you should bring him out with say, a Normal Summon, the tribal Quickie, or the second-best tribal Xyz yet to come, he can tribute himself as a Quickie to attach any card from your opponent's GY to a Time Thief you control as material. In an era where Called by the Grave has been sadly Limited, this is some GY disruption worth noting. As I mentioned in my previous Time Thief list, your opponent can't use what's no longer in their GY. So chaining this effect to say, a Monster Reborn or similar revival or retrieval effect is nothing short of the bee's knees.</li>  	<li>Sorry OTK'ers, you won't have an easy time doing your job while <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Chronocorder"">Time Thief Chronocorder</a></b></span>'s on his. The reasoning for that being that he tributes himself during your opponent's Battle Phase to give you a one-time protection against battle damage. How, may you ask? Your opponent just takes the damage for you! I like to consider this Destiny HERO - Dynatag on espresso. Though you'd really only use this particular effect of his in the case of an emergency. The effect of his you really wanna go for, however, is when any Xyz Monster of yours leaves the field by a card effect (including the main man's own), he revives himself from the GY to be used as future material or the aforementioned damage reflection in a pinch. One to two will do you just fine, much like Bezel Ship.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Starting the Extra Deck off right is the big man himself. The star of the show is none other than YGO's best husband with a black card border, <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a></b></span>. The thing that might draw you to him the most is the fact that he can essentially replenish his own materials by attaching the top card of your opponent's deck to him every Standby Phase. That, and he's blessed with being brought out with any two generic Level 4 monsters. But let me tell you, this guy is far more than a splash into Traptrix or Phantom Knights. As a Quick Effect at any time in any turn, once per turn, you can detach up to three kinds of materials from him to activate corresponding effects. For a Monster, he banishes himself until the turn's conclusion in order to dodge attacks, disruptive effects, you name it. This makes him VERY hard to take out in the right hands. For a Spell, he nets you a free draw akin to Jar of Greed. And what I consider to be his best, detaching a Trap gives you a non-targeting, non-destruction removal of any face-up card your opponent has in store, simply by placing that sucker atop the deck. I cannot tell you how many times this has saved my skin. Your opponent thinks they've got Redoer on the ropes with a non-targetable or destructible bungus like Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon and the like, but a generic Rank 4 with a purple card under it can inexplicably dispatch it like it's nothing. And as you'll see further on, there will be multiple ways to put a Trap under this guy.</li>  	<li>Case in point, Redoer's very own prime partner comes in the form of <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Perpetua"">Time Thief Perpetua</a></b></span>. She's like the cleric and technical genius of the team, which isn't surprising given her lore and portrayal through her different iterations of the card artwork in this tribe. During either Standby Phase (remind ya of anyone?), she detaches a material in order to revive any Time Thief monster from your GY other than herself. This can be Winder for additional searching, Adjuster for more Foolish-ing, Bezel Ship during your opponent's turn to snatch their GY resources, or either of her fellow Xyz leaders should they kick the bucket prematurely. As another Quick Effect, she targets any of your Xyz monsters, emphasis on ""any"", to attach a Time Thief card from deck to them as material. That way you can get Redoer the Chronocorder or tribal Trap he needs at the moment, or replenish just about any other good Xyz monster you'd like to utilize more! She and Redoer are a match made in heaven. In an on-field sense, that is. Can't really confirm whether or not these two are a thing in-lore.</li>  	<li>I gawked when I first saw it, too. Another Extra Deck Time Thief? You'd think they'd get a tribal Link Monster (I can spitball like a dozen ideas for how it could work), but I suppose for now <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Doublebarrel"">Time Thief Doublebarrel</a></b></span> will fill that void just fine. I too shed an imaginary comically-sized sweat droplet when I found he couldn't attach his own materials and had to wait until the opponent used an effect to use his, but after some consideration, he can get the job done. Detaching a Monster nets him 400 extra ATK, which doesn't usually mean much but can add up and remains permanent unlike the tribal Continuous Spell. Speaking of, detaching a Spell makes him a walking non-targeting Crackdown (Jinzo - Layered, is that you?). But his best one is for detaching a Trap, which is all too familiar. Doing so is netting you a non-targeting Effect Monster negation, plain and simple (How about them apples, Dragoon?). You'll more than likely have to rely on the other Thieve's effects to make the Trap attachment to him possible, though. But I wouldn't sweat that all too much. He's more of a sidekick than a new star of the show in my eyes, but that's not to say he hasn't earned his keep. Also, I wholly agree with Mr. Rogue Theory that this guy should be localized as ""Time Thief Do-Over."" Rolls off the tongue FAR better than any of the localized Virtual World monsters, and just makes all the sense in context for Time Thieves in general.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Barring the gadgets that make up two of the Main Deck monsters, the Time Thieves have some other nifty tools of trade to get things started. First up being <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Startup"">Time Thief Startup</a></b></span>, a Quick-Play that summons a Time Thief monster from your hand for free. This can de-brick your hand and get more materials on the board in a split, and also allows you to bring out Regulator for his effect without expending your Normal Summon. Alternatively in a future turn, you can banish it from your GY to attach one of each Time Thief card type to a Time Thief Xyz monster you control as material. A triple material replenish, especially to apply for all the effects of Redoer or Do-Over (Yes, I'll be referring to Doublebarrel as that for the remainder of the article), can make a heck of a difference. Especially when your deck feels all but depleted of ammo for the pair of troublemakers.</li>  	<li>A Continuous Spell that might not be all too important but still sees some good use, <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Hack"">Time Thief Hack </a></b></span>earns its stripes in two good ways. During the turn your Xyz monsters hit the field, they can't be targeted or destroyed by your opponent's card effects. As its second option, it lets you target an Xyz monster you control to give them a turn-wide power-up of 300 ATK for every material on it. And if at least one of them happens to belong to your opponent, direct attacking becomes an option for them! Imagine hopping over so many big beatsticks on your opponent's side like nothing. Just ah, beware of like, Drowning Mirror Force and stuff like that.</li>  	<li>For Traps, these guys have it made. <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Flyback"">Time Thief Flyback</a> </b></span>is good on-field or in the GY, for activating it lets you attach any Time Thief card from deck to your Time Thief Xyz monster as material. Typically another Flyback if Perpetua's not around to do so already. But if your opponent's silly enough to pop this card on field, they're just opening a whole nother can of worms. Either way, its effect in GY banishes itself to play Bezel Ship's game of snatching a GY card of your foe's for Redoer, Perpetua, or Do-Over's own. That way, you can really stick it to them for popping it in the first place!</li>  	<li>And now for another card that's gonna save your skin when the situation calls. One of your primary search targets with Winder, a Counter Trap that can come in unbelievable clutch is <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Retrograde"">Time Thief Retrograde</a></b></span>. Like Rogue Theory says, this thingie can be very telegraphed, but not necessarily any less hard to deal with once it's live. Case in point, if Redoer, Perpetua, or Do-Over are on the field at all, this baby lets you negate the activation of your opponent's backrow and then not destroy it, but attach it to one of those three as material. Imagine the insult to injury of negating their Trap, attaching it to Redoer or Do-Over, and then activating their effects to detach those suckers later on in the turn. Always keep at least one on standby, you never know when you'll need it.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2><span>Performage</span></h2> For those of you unfamiliar to how a lot of Fusion/Xyz setup decks tend to function, these guys might seem a little oddly-placed. But I can assure you, these dubious magician dudes in a sea of Psychics more than earn their keep. They're conditional freebies in a way, one of which can recur itself or its ally. <ul>  	<li>The one you've likely come to know best, either from the likes of Lightsworn or Shaddoll, happens to be <span><b><a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a></b></span>. His bouncing act upon that ball of his is quite fitting, as when he hits the GY by any means (discarding, detaching, Foolish-ing, you name it), he can target any Performage in your grave including himself to revive them at the cost of its whole stat line and 1000 of your LP. No worries, it's not too steep a price if you ask me. For another means of making my Rank 4's that doesn't require RNG this time around? Heck yeah, I'll ditch a stack for him!</li>  	<li>His partner in crime, being much easier to summon and not being a once-per-turn is <span><b><a data-name=""Performage Hat Tricker"">Performage Hat Tricker</a></b></span>. Simply if there are at least two monsters on the field, period, he's a freebie summon from hand that acts to extend your summons. As far as his effect to put a counter on him to prevent effect damage, I can't say I've been able to make too good use of that, even taking into account Trick Clown. But hey, all's good in the red-and-white-striped hood this pair hails from if you ask me.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2><span>PSY-Frame</span></h2> Now I must have really lost it! You're telling me that in an archetype of Psychic-types, we're ACTUALLY going to run Psychic-type support cards? It sounds crazy, but yes! PSY-Frames happily make an appearance in this deck, and they're more synergistic with the second snatchers than you'd speedily suspect. They're likely the trio you'd expect, so I'll try and keep it brief. <ul>  	<li>It's no secret that the Main Deck pairing of <span><b><a data-name=""PSY-Frame Driver"">PSY-Frame Driver</a></b></span> and <span><b><a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a></b></span> are capable of dishing out some serious payback to your opponent if they wanna try and use their monster effects. Simply put, while you have a barren field and your opponent activates a monster effect, a single Gamma in your hand will be a good blessing. From there he summons both himself and Driver from your hand, deck, or GY to render the effect null and void, and the monster destroyed. Heh, rhymes. Call me crazy, but this is actually a significant out if your opponent tries to Ash your Regulator! That way, you get four summons off Regulator tributing himself instead of just two. At the end of turn, the pair banish themselves into the abyss, unfortunately. But if it's during your turn, you're more than able to use them to make...</li>  	<li>Another shockingly synergistic pal, this time with a blue border! <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;PSY-Framelord Lambda&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>PSY-Framelord Lambda</strong></a> has made good friends with Redoer, believe me. For those of you scratching your heads, lemme try and explain. Lambda allows you to use Gamma's negation effect even if monsters are on your field. Meanwhile, if a Psychic of yours happens to become banished (Redoer's gotcha there with his monster detachment!), she lets you, at End Phase, add a Gamma from your deck to hand. So it's all the more worthwhile for you to summon her using an already-expended Gamma and Driver during your turn! That, or use them for a Synchro Summon or something. Whichever works.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2><span>Main Deck Staples</span></h2> Of course, I'd be silly to make a deck and not go over the more non-specific tools of trade included therein. So thankfully, that's what I've dedicated the next two sections for! <ul>  	<li>You may have seen him in Link-based decks, including my own just previously, but here he makes another fine appearance. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Parallel eXceed&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Parallel eXceed</strong></a> may be bricky, but provided you're able to Link up on the fly, he's a very useful extender. When you summon say, Lambda or Ahashima with an open Link point, make sure to plop this guy here so he brings out a copy of himself from deck, both at Level 4. And just like that, another Rank 4's at your feet!</li>  	<li>As if my inclusion of LIGHT-, WIND-, and EARTH-Attribute monsters in the Main Deck didn't seem crazy enough for me, here comes a WATER for good measure. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Xyz Slidolphin&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Xyz Slidolphin</strong></a> isn't a face you'll see pop up too much, but he can act as either a freebie or an extra tool for one of your Xyz monsters. In hand, the former kicks in to bring him out to extend your plays. In grave, the same condition lets him tack on a third material to your up-and-coming Xyz monster for good measure. Dolphins truely are some of the wisest creatures on the planet, eh?</li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Foolish Burial&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Foolish Burial</strong></a> sees play as more or less an emergency button if you've no other way to, say, bin Bezel Ship or Chronocorder. Or get Trick Clown out, for that matter. A one-of you can play without shame, since after some consideration I'm not too sure whether Upstart would have a fitting home here.</li>  	<li>Until these poor thieves get some tribal consistency to fetch out their searchers at the beginning of games, <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Pot of Prosperity&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong></a> will have to do the job of grabbing your essential pieces to start things right. With the banish of 3 or 6 cards of your choice from the Extra Deck, likely your spare copies of Redoer, Perpetua, and some of the more situational Xyz and Links you've got, you look at the same number of cards from the top of your deck and snatch one to use immediately. It may take away some Extra Deck slots and ability to dome your opponent for lethal, <strong><em>not to speak of how expensive the dumb sucker is,</em></strong> but it'll get the job done. If this card's out of your price range, there's no shame in running <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Pot of Desires&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Pot of Desires</strong></a> in its place.</li>  	<li>This is more of an optional pick of mine I like to run for some more unusual removal, but you're cool to replace this with something you'd rather in its place. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Xyz Import&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Xyz Import</strong></a> is a heck of a card, lemme tell ya. Blessed with the symbol of Quick-Play Spell, on either turn it allows you to target a monster your opponent controls with equal or less ATK than an Xyz Monster of your choice, then yoinks that son of a gun to them as material. Not only does this let you get rid of monsters and interrupt plays in ways other decks otherwise can't, but imagine the craziness that'd ensue when a non-Time Thief can utilize the second half of Hack's power-up effect.</li>  	<li>It's an Xyz deck, so you know this pretty purple boy's gonna make an appearance. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</strong></a> is its name, and thanks to me you likely know this card by heart. Brings itself out as a Level 4 Normal Monster that's perfect for your Rank 4 summons. Best case scenario, to make either Redoer or Duo-ver. Speaking of, what looks and sounds better for Doublebarrel? Do-Over or Duo-ver? Pfft, I dunno.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2><span>Extra Deck Staples</span></h2> It wouldn't be Time Thieves if they didn't have a toolbox of friends to call upon when the situation calls, now would it? As with Live and Evil Twins, these suckers are blessed to have several randos behind their back for the long haul. <ul>  	<li>Prime example being <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tornado Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tornado Dragon</strong></a>! He's a walking MST that gets two bits of ammo that can each be fired off once per turn. That's not to say you can't reload them using Perpetua, however! I swear, that lady's a cleric for this archetype in more ways than you'd first imagine.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Abyss Dweller&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Abyss Dweller</strong></a> is in the exact same camp, and he's beyond useful if you can spare the materials. As soon as possible during your opponent's turn, you'll want to give this bad boy a whirl as detaching a material from him shuts off your opponent's GY effects for all of their turn. And given the prevalence of decks using the GY as a second hand, I bet they won't be too prepared for a deck that uses the GY as their personal armory, now will they?</li>  	<li>Here to act as an emergency button coming in shocking clutch is another fun Rank 4, <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</strong></a>. At the cost of one of his materials during your turn, he forces all non-Link monsters on the field into defense, and negates their activated effects so long as they remain in that position. This affects your stuff as well, but if you can whip out a good Link monster to play around that, I doubt you'll have too much trouble.</li>  	<li>Now THIS is a card you'll want to bring out a lot. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Bujinki Ahashima&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Bujinki Ahashima</strong></a> is a total blessing for Xyz decks as a whole, not just for her own tribe. Bringing her out with, say, the two monsters summoned off Regulator lets you bring out two L4's, one from your hand and the other from your GY, to immediately use them for an Xyz summon. This is a great way to get L4's out of your hand after you've already Normal Summoned or reuse the ones in your GY. Don't sleep on it, I urge you. Especially if you have your Xyz monster detach a material in its zone.</li>  	<li>Think he's in this deck because he's chasing after those who stole his time? Ahahahaaaaaaa, poor jokes aside, <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Number 60: Dugares the Timeless&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</strong></a> makes use as either Prosperity ammo or in a powerful situational clutch. Detaching both his materials nets you a super strong effect with a drawback on your following turn. Whether you're using him to draw, revive, or power up, he's got his moments. Though more often than not, you're definitely using the former two effects. Fingers crossed he gets a reprint someday.</li>  	<li>Following Dugares in the ways of Prosperity fodder is <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Number 101: Silent Honor ARK&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Number 101: Silent Honor ARK</strong></a>. You've likely seen this guy in the odd Duel Devastator box and didn't think blink twice. Well, I can't exactly say I blame you, but should he still be in your Extra Deck and you need to slurp up a Special Summoned attack position monster on your opponent's side a la Relinquished, this boisterous boat's got you covered. Or um, is it a starship? Could go either way, really.</li>  	<li>Trust me, you can make this bad boy turn 2 if you know what you're doing. And boy howdy is it worth it! Speaking of Dragoon-proof, in again careens <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</strong></a>. The second most valuable splashable boss for Xyz decks, your opponent can only dream of stopping this guy with effects or attacks from monsters that don't have black borders. And furthermore, he can revive an Xyz from your GY by snatching a card your opponent controls for its pal to use as material! It's so generic, useful, and downright terrifying, you'd swear it was printed in Duel Overload.</li>  	<li>Meanwhile, if you're in need of a swift offensive finisher to your games, you're always more than welcome to run the Utopia Double package. Herein lies <span><span><b><a data-name=""Number 31: Utopia Double"">Number 31: Utopia Double</a></b></span></span>, who searches <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008000;&quot;&gt;Double or Nothing!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong><span>Double or Nothing!</span></strong></a> from deck to go into either <span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008000;&quot;&gt;Number 31: Utopia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Number 31: Utopia</strong></a></span> or <a data-name=""&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000080;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number S31: Utopia the Lightning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;""><span><strong>Number S31: Utopia the Lightning</strong></span></a>. A good way to finish off things if you've no other option.</li> </ul> So yeah, there's the deck! To think a pure build of these guys can be just as competent as if you're splashing another big archetype into, which you're more than cool to do. Still though, I'll keep in mind some play notes for when you try this out yourself. <h2>Handy Play Notes</h2> <ul>  	<li>The starting combo that Rogue Theory laid out and I've confirmed as useful is as follows. First, bring out <strong><span>Regulator</span></strong> and tribute him for <strong><span>Winder</span></strong> and <span><strong>Adjuster</strong></span>. Chain block one of them effectively depending on whether you truly need a Retrograde or L4 right away to search with Winder, or to bin <span><strong>Bezel Ship</strong></span> or <strong><span>Chronocorder</span></strong> with Adjuster. From there, use both of them to make <span><strong>Bujinki Ahashima</strong></span>, who'll use either a <span><strong>Bezel Ship</strong></span>, <span><strong>Chronocorder</strong>,</span> or other L4 like <span><strong>Slidolphin</strong></span> or <strong><span>Trick Clown</span></strong> and a L4 from grave to make <span><strong>Redoer</strong></span>. From there, it's all a matter of reviving Bezel Ship and/or Chronocorder by any means necessary to make <strong><span>Perpetua</span></strong>, and either <strong><span>Do-Over</span></strong> or <span><strong>Abyss Dweller</strong></span> if you've got materials in reserve. Set the backrow cards you need to complete your task, and it's off to the races.</li>  	<li>During your opponent's turn, use Perpetua's primary Standby Phase effect to revive Bezel Ship from GY to get him up and running to snatch a card from your opponent when the time calls. And if necessary, use her second effect to attach a Flyback to Redoer so when he bounces himself and an opponent's card out later, you can snatch another card from your opponent by banishing Flyback. During your turn, use the aforementioned primary Perpetua effect to bring back Winder to replenish your hand or Adjuster if you're in need of extra Bezel Ships, Chronocorders, or Flybacks in GY.</li>  	<li>If you're looking to use Gamma during your opponent's turn, realize that it may be the only time you get to proc him since he and Driver go ""See ya, chief"" if they're still on the field come the End Phase. That's why it's worthwhile, if you're lucky enough to use them on your own turn, to Link them off into Lambda so Redoer's banishment can also net you a second Gamma to use the Driver in GY again.</li>  	<li>Still not too certain what the use in running Xyz Import is? Let's say, for example, your opponent has a setup monster that just so happens to be at or below the ATK of Redoer or Do-Over. Import's got you there by not only letting you remove them from your opponent's control and utility, but also to use as ammo for their future effects. And this can be any Xyz monster, not just the head honchos!</li> </ul> &nbsp;  And at long last, there's the pure Time Thieves in full. They've had quite a visit to other archetypes, but with the recent wave of support and confirmation that Duel Terminal is where they've resided this whole time, I'd say they're right at home where they belong.  As always, thanks again to BladeYGO and Rogue Theory for providing me with the inspiration and research that went into this, though I doubt I'll ever be at their awesome level. And thanks to you for reading! Hopefully you got some good insight as to what these guys are capable of. Or at the very least, a chuckle at my attempt to deliver such.

I have been using The Creator deck as my main deck for roughly three years. This is the updated version I made in 2020. It is far more refined and is way easier to win with. Your main strategy is to get out The Creator and special summon a bunch of boss monsters from the graveyard, whilst making sure The Creator doesn't perish.  The biggest threat to this deck is obviously bigger boss monsters that negate effects, i.e. Dragun, True King, etc.."

The ""Watt"" archetype features a lot of little Thunder-Type critters that have low stats but some helpful effects in terms of battling. The archetype also has some Synchro monsters to work with, but since I decided against running any of the ""Watt"" Tuners and those are specifically needed to summon them I did not include them. But there are other options in the Extra Deck to make up for that.</p> <p>""<a data-name=""Wattgiraffe"">Wattgiraffe</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Wattcobra"">Wattcobra</a>"" are the direct attackers of the deck, with ""<a data-name=""Wattgiraffe"">Wattgiraffe</a>"" stopping the opponent from activating cards and effects after damaging them, while ""<a data-name=""Wattcobra"">Wattcobra</a>"" does the absolutely delightful job of searching whenever it damages the opponent via direct attack. ""<a data-name=""Wattwoodpecker"">Wattwoodpecker</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Wattsquirrel"">Wattsquirrel</a>"" are able to attack twice during each Battle Phase; they do have additional effects, but most of the time they are just needed to push some damage. ""<a data-name=""Watthopper"">Watthopper</a>"" can create the well-known ""<a data-name=""Watthopper"">Watthopper</a>"" lock, which can stop the opponent from attacking or targeting your ""Watt"" monsters. ""<a data-name=""Wattdragonfly"">Wattdragonfly</a>"" is the only three-off, since it serves as a battle searcher. This means that you can technically fend off up to three attacks by searching ""<a data-name=""Wattdragonfly"">Wattdragonfly</a>"" whenever one dies to battle and can end the chain with ""<a data-name=""Wattlemur"">Wattlemur</a>"", which will prohibit the opponent from using next turn's Battle Phase if it gets destroyed.</p> <p>In addition to the ""Watt"" monster line-up, there is only one more monster in the Main Deck, but it is of paramount importance overall: ""<a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a>"". This monster functions as a ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" on legs if summoned, which is not as important; but it also once per turn summons a ""Batteryman Token"" which helps summoning Link monsters. The only problem is that it often wants to take the Normal Summon slot, so we have to work around that. I provided a few options to make summoning easier: ""<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>"" provides access to ""<a data-name=""Kaminari Attack"">Kaminari Attack</a>"", which not only triggers the token summoning of effect of ""<a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a>"" but also allows the deck to summon ""<a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Titan"">Thunder Dragon Titan</a>"" to have access to a larger beater. ""<a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>"" can search for ""<a data-name=""Watthopper"">Watthopper</a>"", which can give you the ""<a data-name=""Watthopper"">Watthopper</a>"" lock there and then if you have the other copy in hand but also triggers ""<a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a>"" also provides another monster, but for instant access into a Link-4 monster you can play the three copies of ""<a data-name=""Photon Sanctuary"">Photon Sanctuary</a>"": Normal Summon ""Batteryman Solar"", play ""<a data-name=""Photon Sanctuary"">Photon Sanctuary</a>"" to gain two tokens and gain another one via the effect of ""<a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a>"".</p> <p>The backrow includes some other cards aswell: ""<a data-name=""United We Stand"">United We Stand</a>"" provides sizeable ATK boosts depending on the monster on your field, ""<a data-name=""Psychic Blade"">Psychic Blade</a>"" can always provide a flat 2000 ATK boost but costs life points to do so and ""<a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>"" allows every monster you play to check opposing hitters, with ""<a data-name=""Wattsquirrel"">Wattsquirrel</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Wattwoodpecker"">Wattwoodpecker</a>"" even destroying two monsters. ""<a data-name=""Wattkey"">Wattkey</a>"" allows all the ""Watt"" monsters in your deck that cannot already directly attack to do so; the card is by no means required, but is a searchable one-off that can give the double attackers what they need to OTK. One ""<a data-name=""Messenger of Peace"">Messenger of Peace</a>"" can keep opposing monsters in check without completely invalidating yours.</p> <p>Trap-wise I included ""<a data-name=""Armory Call"">Armory Call</a>"" as an Equipment-searching surprise that can give your monsters bigger stats on reaction, one ""<a data-name=""Waboku"">Waboku</a>"" to prevent damage/destruction, one ""<a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Drowning Mirror Force"">Drowning Mirror Force</a>"" against opposing attacks, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Bye Bye Damage"">Bye Bye Damage</a>"" to potentially kill an unsuspecting opponent via their own attack, two ""<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>"" as useful recurring ATK decreases and monster effect negates, two ""<a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a>"" to get rid of opposing monsters/defenses while gaining Link material and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Thunder Dragons' Hundred Thunders"">Thunder Dragons' Hundred Thunders</a>"" as a ""<a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>"" sort of card, but with the added bonus of allowing you to revive three copies of ""<a data-name=""Wattdragonfly"">Wattdragonfly</a>"" once they hit the graveyard.</p> <p>One three-off that I left out so far is ""<a data-name=""Wattrain"">Wattrain</a>"", which is both useful as a multi-searcher and as a swarming tool. Playing it after ""<a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a>"" did its summon will normally net you three additional ""Watt"" cards and swarming the field one turn later is slow but very helpful in the deck.</p> <p>The Extra Deck, aside from the two Fusion monsters, runs basically options that might help the deck in various situations. Both ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" provide backrow removal, while ""<a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>"" provide answers against opposing monsters. ""<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>"" keeps the graveyard in check. ""<a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a>"" can boost a direct attacker, ""<a data-name=""Hip Hoshiningen"">Hip Hoshiningen</a>"" boosts all Light monsters, ""<a data-name=""Some Summer Summoner"">Some Summer Summoner</a>"" can technically trigger ""<a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a>"" again but can also opt to resummon ""<a data-name=""Wattlemur"">Wattlemur</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Wattdragonfly"">Wattdragonfly</a>"". The Link-3 and Link-4 monsters really just provide more of the same but the ""Borrel"" monsters really give the ""Watt"" deck attacking power that they rarely ever had before.</p> <p>""Watt"" is a fairly interesting archetype since it does little in both stats and effect text but can still perform some plays on a non-competitive level. Sadly, there is not that much more going on with them and they do rather poorly in more serious environments.

Ankuriboh),"This here is an old Dinosaur deck I made in 2018, upgraded to fit the current format as well as possible. The deck uses a tech choice that not many people would expect to see: Ankuriboh.  Because this Dinosaur deck uses Ankuriboh and Monster Reborn to revive your monsters, I named this deck ""Life Finds A Way"" in reference to <em>Jurassic Park. </em>  &nbsp;  And because it's a Dinosaur deck that does not use Pot of Extravagance, you wanna go second 9 times out of 10. As for Ankuriboh itself, let's focus on its second effect first. If it gets destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, you can add a Monster Reborn from your Deck or graveyard to your hand during the End Phase. Ultimate Conductor Tyranno can destroy it while it's in your hand, so you don't need to have it on your field. Also, it's first effect is okay, since Dinosaur decks have some good monsters to revive with it. If your opponent attacks, you can discard Ankuriboh to summon one of the following:  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Souleating Oviraptor to search or mill a Dinosaur.</li>  	<li>Animadorned Archosaur to destroy a Babycerasaurus, Petiteranodon, or Overtex Quatlus and search a Double Evolution Pill.</li>  	<li>Dinowrestler Pankratops to target and pop one of your opponent's cards.</li>  	<li>Secure Gardna to protect yourself from taking battle or effect damage one more time (Or just once, if it was sent to the Graveyard <em>before</em> the Battle Phase).</li>  	<li>Borrelsword Dragon, since it has 3000 ATK, can't be destroyed by battle, and can switch one of your opponent's monsters to Defense Positon.</li> </ul>"

The extra is just synchro good stuff with super poly targets and some decent link monsters to go into.  Zombie world can be a destructive floodgate against certain decks, although drytron and VW couldn't really care less sadly, but you do main deck enough outs for those decks anyhow.

I was a Godzilla fan in middle school, and I started to become one again in 2020. So while I was cooped up in my house last year, I found out that several statues of the King of the Monsters can be seen scattered throughout Tokyo, Japan. Which is kinda appropriate, seeing as how Tokyo has a target on its back in his movies. Seriously, the people living there just can't catch a break...  &nbsp;  So if you ever wanna go to Tokyo, Japan, now you have a good reason to go!  &nbsp;  Now, anyone who's actually played Trains knows that they want to go second every single game, especially since this deck has Kaijus in it.  Your goal is to summon a Rank 10 (Or Dreadnought Dreadnought if you can't) and attack. If you don't OTK your opponent, use your Xyz monster to summon AA-ZEUS. And in case your opponent is running a backrow-heavy deck--or just has backrow period--this deck uses 2 Lightning Storm and Harpie's Feather Duster.  &nbsp;  And if you're playing against more competitive decks, the Side Deck has some meta cards, as well as some draw power and cards that punish your opponent for using hand traps (AKA, Triple Tactics Talent and Called by the Grave). So have fun rampaging at your locals and summoning your big monsters!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"
