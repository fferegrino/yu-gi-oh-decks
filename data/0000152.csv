It's a pretty strong combo deck, as the Thunder Dragons banish themselves and then use their banish effs to rapidly gain more advantage and combo off. For these combo lines, I included the usual Thunder Dragon cards, along with Some Summer Summoner for combo extension, and Instant Fusion with Kaminari for more bodies on field. Since the deck doesn't really use it's normal summon, you can normal summon Aleister for it's amazingly consistent search. You can go into Mechaba for negates, or Caliga for a floodgate, both as turn 1 options when going first. Those are just things you can do with your own cards; there's always versatility with the opponent's cards. Aside from those two archetypes, I included Verte Anaconda, to make summoning Titan (unban collossusu) much easier and more consistent. I also included a ton of handtraps since this deck had so much space, meaning you can easily beat the opponent's shit in, control wise. This deck turns into more of a going first control deck, with Mechaba or Caliga for negates/floodgate and quick play pops using Titan. You also have a ton of hand traps, meaning they can't build a board or combo off. Afterwards, you can OTK easily with huge numbers. Also, this is a great way to make them meta again, smile. Also, i didn't add it in, but you could add in a Dogmatika engine."

Pantheism is used as a draw engine and to search your monarch floodgates.  Stormforth lets you use the True Draco monsters to get rid of your opponent's monsters with destruction or targeting protection, and as fodder for Pantheism.  Inspector Boarder is Inspecter Boarder, it stops your opponent from playing Yugioh and can give you an extra turn to set up.  Pot of Duality is a free excavate three pick one, there's basically no penalty because you usually aren't going to be special summoning during your turn if at all.  March of the Monarchs is a bit questionable, but it gives your monsters targeting and destruction protection and is fodder for Pantheism.  &nbsp;  Now on to the side deck.  Lightning Storm helps you out if you're gonna go second, it sort of gives you a chance. You could probably also swap this out for DRNM.  Field Barrier stops your extra deck lock from dying to 1 destruction, and tells Mystic Mine troglodytes to shove it.  Macro Cosmos and Imperial Iron Wall screw over certain decks, Skill Drain is a slightly worse (for this deck) Monarchs Erupt.  Light-Imprisoning Mirror shuts down Drytron and Eldlich.  Mind Drain stops hand traps and Virtual World's hand effects.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Over all this deck is pretty good at cheesing out wins against stronger decks, without having to resort to the degeneracy that is Mystic Mine."

Opcionalmente, si tenemos acceso a más Drytrons, ya no es necesario ir a por Mu-Beta Fafnir.  <strong>Searchers para buscar los requisitos</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Where Arf Thou: </strong>Sirve para añadir un Drytron cuando ya hay uno en el campo. Ya que el uso de Alpha y Zeta es intercambiable, sirve para buscar a cualquiera de los dos.</li>  	<li><strong>Jack in the Hand: </strong>Debe ser usado primero por ser algo impredecible. Usualmente escogeremos a Alpha, Zeta y Gamma. Si el oponente toma a Alpha o Zeta, escogemos al otro. Si toma a Gamma, no hay problema, ya que llevamos otra copia, y además escogemos al Drytron que necesitamos.</li>  	<li><strong>Cyber Emergency: </strong>Literalmente trae a la mano cualquier Drytron.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish Burial:</strong> Cuando hablamos de Drytron, el cementerio y la mano son casi lo mismo.</li>  	<li><strong>Drytron Nova:</strong> Trae a cualquier Drytron al campo, el cual puedes enviar al cemenerio al usarlo para invocar a Linkuriboh.</li>  	<li><strong>Drytron Fafnir: </strong>Añade a Nova a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Preparation of Rites: </strong>Sirve para traer a Benten o Phul a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Extra Foolish Burial: </strong>Con esto podemos enviar a Herald of Arc Light al cementerio y activar su efecto para traer a un ritual. En el peor de los casos, se puede enviar a N'tss para destruir algo del oponente.</li>  	<li><strong>Ritual Sanctuary: </strong>Trae a Benten a coste de descartar una magia, que en este deck, hay de sobra.</li>  	<li><strong>Terraforming: </strong>Es el más versátil, ya que puede traer a Fafnir (si necesitas un Drytron) o a Ritual Sanctuary (si necesitas un ritual).</li> </ul> <strong>Partes del combo:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Arcana Force XXI - The World: </strong>Con él nos saltaremos el turno oponente. Es importante invocarlo con Light Barrier en campo para no depender de la suerte.</li>  	<li><strong>Soul of Purity and Light: </strong>Con ella tendremos los materiales necesarios para invocar a Beatrice.</li>  	<li><strong>Minefieldriller: </strong>Destruyéndolo con Auroradon, recuperaremos a Light Barrier del cementerio.</li>  	<li><strong>Light Barrier:</strong> Es necesario para asegurar el efecto que queremos de The World.</li>  	<li><strong>Megalith Ophiel:</strong> Un target para Phul, además de brindar un cuerpo en campo, nos añade otro Megalith a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Megalith Bethor: </strong>Sirve más para deshacernos de cosas molestas del oponente.</li>  	<li><strong>Megalith Phaleg: </strong>Facilita el OTK al incrementar el atk de tus monstruos.</li>  	<li><strong>Drytron Meteonis Draconids: </strong>Al igual que Phaleg, ayuda a realizar el OTK, y da algo de versatilidad al deck.</li>  	<li><strong>Vanity's Ruler: </strong>Pega bien, además de ser un buen plan B si todo lo demás falla y no tienes los materiales para ir por The World</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente (73%).</li>  	<li>No tiene garnets, por lo que todo en la mano es útil.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil.

You use Guru with the field spell to get fiendess to negate things. The traps in the deck just help you stay in control of the game. Super Poly in this deck isn't as good in this format as it used to. Subterror Final Battle setting itself face down can constantly flip your monsters and can OTK at times. If you want to play a more budget version your can cut the Extravagance for any trap of your choice, and the Ash Blossoms for cheaper hand traps. If you are willing to spend more money you can take out the Ghost Belles and side the Super Poly. Then you can buy Dragoon and Verte Anaconda for the deck.

Get Toon BLS out asap and use Toon Harpies as backrow removal instead of free summons."

You say go big or go home? You like XYZs? you want to have 10k beat sticks? Then this deck is for you!,"This Deck uses Alternative XYZ Summoning Conditions to get the rare seen and strong bossmonsters on the board. I have added 1 Banned card in the extra deck since i wanted to see what happens, but you can just go ahead and put any XYZ in that slot that you like.  Basicly this is an Onomato &amp; Time Thief Deck. Why you ask? For the powerfull level 4 Engine of Onomato and Time thief shananigans to increase material counts.  The time thiefs are there if you want to go ""Number86: Heroic Champion"" or ""Super Quantal Mech King Magnus"" to increase theire material count to get the big effects going. (also some nice Protection!) The Onomato engines job is to shit out as many MAterials for XYZ plays as possible.  So the alternative XYZ turn and vocalpoints are:  Number27: Dreadnough Dreadnoid -&gt; Magnus  Number 39: Utopia Double-&gt;Number 93:  Utopia Kaiser -&gt;Special: Dark XYZ below Rank9 -&gt; Using Phantom Knights Rank up Magic for  &lt;Rank 10 plays (this is a quickplay and can be used in your oponents turn to stop him from plays!)  Other highlights:  Exciton Knight for Comebacks Double or nothing+Number 39: Utopia for 10k beatstick.  The hole point is to abuse XYZ, so all your utility lies within your extra deck. Thsi version is for the luls, but if you want to actually pack a punch you shouldt probably switch out some cards in the extra deck. (i.E. Utopia the lightning) or just focus on one of those XYZ things, like Time Theifs OR Rank-up-magic."

And pretty che","<span><strong>The Budget-friendly Zombie deck of your dreams!</strong></span>  <span>I made this deck to be 1) budget-friendly, 2) as anti-meta as possible, and 3) consistent as can be.  Thankfully, the deck does all three <em>very effectively</em>.</span>  <strong><span>Budget-friendly</span></strong>  <span>The most expensive cards of the deck are the Eldlich package (cutting out Black Stone and Eldland to skim off about $100+), the Zombie World package (2 Necroworld Banshee, 2 Glow-Up Bloom, 2 Doomking Balerdroch, 3 Zombie World), and Shiranui Solitaire.  The rest of the cards are about $1 or less, even the Mayakashi cards now (they've dropped a lot in value recently).</span>  <span><strong>As Anti-Meta As Possible</strong></span>  <span>This deck <span>STOMPS</span> on a lot of other decks currently out in the meta right now, as well as a lot of other decks in general.  Anything that relies on tributing or a specific monster type on field or in grave is almost always at a loss as soon as the field spell <em>Zombie World</em> hits the field, which this deck can do consistently and often by turn 1.  Being able to side in cards like <em>Give And Take </em>and <em>Artifact Lancea</em> utterly destroy decks that rely on the Extra Deck and Banishing, respectively.  And because Zombie World makes everything in grave Zombie-type, a pitched <em>Artifact Lancea</em> can be brought back every turn with <em>Return of the Zombies </em>or <em>Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom</em> during your opponent's turn for more disruption (also works with other Artifacts as well, but the deck isn't the best at self-popping backrow outside of <em>Eldlich The Golden Lord </em>and a sided <em>Twin Twister</em>).  The deck has many starters and utilizes multiple Zombie engines to ensure you send to grave as many of your important cards as possible from deck to set up future plays.  <em>Mayakashi Hajun</em> + <em>Yuki </em>into the Link-2 Mayakashi + a revived <em>Yuki</em> = a send from grave, <em>Uni-Zombie</em>, <em>Gozuki</em>, and <em>Samurai Skull</em> also send from deck to grave, and <em>One For One</em>, <em>Mayakashi Return</em>, <em>Shiranui Solitaire,</em> and <em>Ghost Meets Girl - A Shiranui Story </em>all get these engines going.  A neat tech includes making <em>XX-Saber Gottoms</em> with <em>Uni-Zombie</em> + <em>Gozuki </em>and, with a bit of setup, equates to about 3-4 cards discarded from your opponent's hand in one turn, and at least an extra one every turn.  <em>Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom</em> is especially good if you can bring out the chain of Mayakashi synchros, since she can tribute any zombie during either turn to bring out the synchros from grave for more disruption.  <em>Return of the Zombies</em> is <span>non-targeting banishing removal</span> while Zombie World is out on the field, or an emergency Monster Reborn for yourself as needed (that used up <em>Dakki, </em><em>The Graceful Mayakashi </em>is often a good target).  Finally, <em>Glow-Up Bloom</em> has many targets in the deck for adding to hand or special summoning and is easily recovered and reused multiple times throughout the duel, allowing you to quickly get out a <em>Doomking Balerdroch</em>, <em>Eldlich The Golden Lord</em>, or <em>Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom</em> as needed.</span>  <span><strong>Consistent As Can Be</strong></span>  <span>Oddly enough, despite being a 60 card deck, <strong>The Horde<em> </em></strong>is a very consistent Zombie build that very rarely bricks.  At worst, you usually end on a <em>Zombie World</em> + <em>Balerdroch</em> combo, at best...you end on a lot, lot more.  The deck utilizes a lot of starters and engines to allow nearly every hand to have multiple options per duel, and most of those short, simple combos allow for deck dumping to set up current and future plays with ease.  </span>  <span>Weaknesses</span>  <span>Obviously, the deck isn't perfect.  The deck likes its field spell very much, and while it doesn't die like Lair of Darkness does when it disappears...it's a pretty important piece to the Zombie Horde puzzle.  Protect your field spell, and if you can, try to keep another <em>Necroworld Banshee</em> in GY just in case you need another!  The deck can be severely hurt if multiple starters are blocked.  If you opponent has a lot of negates on the field, try to bait what you can before activating <em>Zombie World</em> and using <em>Super Polymerization</em> to get rid of as much as your opponent's field as you can.  You may find other generic Super Poly targets being warranted depending on your locals.  Finally, this is a <span>graveyard</span> deck, so cards that hit the graveyard or stop banishing (i.e. for <em>Glow-Up Bloom</em>, <em>Mezuki</em>, <em>Necroworld Banshee</em>, etc) will affect this deck VERY MUCH.  Not much you can do about that, but the deck still has temporary options for it, like its Super Poly targets, the Golden Lord himself, etc.  </span>"

They can be very consistent and have some pretty cool plays. Evil Heel and Superstar are your main deck boss monster which can clean games nicely. Comic relief and Fantastic theater can destroy Abyss Script-Rise of the king and Abyss Script-Abysstainment to destroy monsters and special summon monsters. This deck is really fun and can do some crazy things against meta.

This is a different approach to the Harpie strategy. I made this deck a while back after seeing just how useful the vanilla <a data-name=""Harpie Lady"">Harpie Lady</a> is. The monster summoned off of Elegant Egotist has been a controversial topic in most Harpie decks. Some people say <a data-name=""Cyber Harpie lady"">Cyber Harpie lady</a>, others say <a data-name=""Harpie Lady 1"">Harpie Lady 1</a>, but in this deck the default Harpie Lady is so good.  This deck's main focus is to turbo out <a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a> as most winged beast decks these days. If you haven't noticed there are only 11 cards in the extra deck. That's because those are the main cards needed for the combos. In the side deck are options for what you prefer to build. There are a few variants you could do based on the amount of bricks you want in your deck. I will go over those variants at the end.  The best normal summons in the deck are <a data-name=""Harpie Channeler"">Harpie Channeler</a>, <a data-name=""Harpie Lady"">Harpie Lady</a>, and <a data-name=""Harpie Perfumer"">Harpie Perfumer</a>. Whaaaaat? How is Harpie Lady a good normal summon??? The first objective of the deck is to get a normal monster on board to make <a data-name=""Imduk the World Chalice Dragon"">Imduk the World Chalice Dragon</a>. Along side the triple copies of <a data-name=""Elegant Egotist"">Elegant Egotist</a>, <a data-name=""Hysteric Sign"">Hysteric Sign</a>, and <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>, normal summoning Harpie Lady is a safe option to get a normal monster on board. Harpie Perfumer is a risky normal summon if you don't have <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Storm"">Harpie's Feather Storm</a> in hand. If it is hit with a Veiler or Imperm, its name no longer is Harpie Lady and you cannot activate Elegant Egotist. It is pretty good Ash bait though. Harpie Channeler is the best normal summon since you don't have to activate it's effects immediately as you summon it. This deck runs 16 ""Harpie"" cards so it can satisfy it's cost most of the time. A cool combo with it and Elegant Egotist is to normal Channeler, activate Egotist summoning Harpie Lady from the deck, link off the Harpie Lady for Imduk. Then activate the Channeler's affect by pitching a Harpie card to summon Perfumer from deck and since Imduk (a dragon monster) is on field, Channeler is a level 7. Since there is a level 5 or higher Harpie monster on the field when Perfumer's effect is activated you can add 2 cards from your deck to hand. Pretty nice huh.  <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Chalice&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Chalice""</a> is a nutty card. Once you get a normal monster on field and link it off into Imduk with this card in your hand you can tribute summon it using Imduk's double summon effect. Imduk also summons a World Chalice monster from your hand when its sent to the graveyard, its such a good card. When you tribute summon the Chalice, you can link it off using <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> to trigger its effect to summon a <a data-name=""World Chalice Guardragon"">World Chalice Guardragon</a> and <a data-name=""Lee the World Chalice Fairy"">Lee the World Chalice Fairy</a> from your deck. Very fragile to hand traps at this point so be wary when doing this (unless you have a Harpie on field with Feather Storm in hand then go off). You can then use Almiraj and Guardragon to go into <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> since there is a World Legacy card in the grave now. You can use her effect to set <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a> if you need material or <a data-name=""World Legacy Sorrow"">World Legacy Sorrow</a> if you have too many material that you can co-link (Sorrow is best in the Codebreaker version, you can take it out if you aren't using it). At this point you can banish Guardragon to summon Harpie Lady and link off into Simorgh.  This deck runs many different Link 2's because you never know which one you might need. Sometimes you dont have any World Chalice monsters in hand. Sometimes you have too many. <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Romulus"">Dragunity Knight - Romulus</a> is another fantastic card in this deck. You can use Imduk and Guardragon to make this since it takes both dragons and winged beasts. You can activate it's effect to search out <a data-name=""Dragon Ravine"">Dragon Ravine</a> which can be used if you need a way to get Guardragon to the grave. <a data-name=""Harpie Conductor"">Harpie Conductor</a> is nice if you need a winged beast to go into Simorgh. <a data-name=""Auram the World Chalice Blademaster"">Auram the World Chalice Blademaster</a> is such a cool card that can be very useful to bring something back from the grave or special from hand. Lib is the best if you have Chalice. The <a data-name=""Cyber Slash Harpie Lady"">Cyber Slash Harpie Lady</a> is basically another link 2 but the materials are any two Harpie monsters, it isn't the most essential card in the extra deck but its flavorful and can be used to out your own barrier statue if you need to. The most basic ending board this deck can easily make is Simorgh plus <a data-name=""Barrier of the Stormwinds"">Barrier of the Stormwinds</a>.  If you want to use the Codebreaker variant, add the two Codebreaker links and <a data-name=""Knightmare Gryphon"">Knightmare Gryphon</a>. You will also need to add <a data-name=""Codebreaker Zero Day"">Codebreaker Zero Day</a> to your deck which is a pretty annoying brick to draw but luckily its not a garnet as it can also be discarded and used from the graveyard if needed. This combo only works if you have 2 materials left after making Simorgh which isn't too difficult of a thing to happen. You will need 2 EFFECT monsters so if you have a Harpie Lady as one of those two materials you will need to link it off into a Imduk or <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> (if you decide to run it) before making <a data-name=""Codebreaker Virus Swordsman"">Codebreaker Virus Swordsman</a> and summoning Zero Day from deck. Then link off the Virus Swordsman and Zero Day into <a data-name=""Codebreaker Virus Berserker"">Codebreaker Virus Berserker</a> and use its effect to bring back the Virus Swordsman and Zero day. You now have a link 3, a link 2, and a level 4 monster to do what you want with. Use the Berserker and Zero Day to make <a data-name=""Knightmare Gryphon"">Knightmare Gryphon</a> right under the Simorg so its co-linked. The cool thing is if you used <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Storm"">Harpie's Feather Storm</a> to protect yourself from handtraps the turn you make Gryphon, you can use its effect to discard a card to place the Feather Storm back in your spell/trap zone for the next turn. If you went through the Lib route then you also have an active Sorrow set to protect your board from any board wipes. Then there is the classic infinite negate combo with <a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a> and the Mist Valley cards. That one is pretty basic and well known enough for me to not need to explain it. You could potentially use this with the Codebreaker variant but it is a lot of bricks you don't want to draw. You don't want more than 60 cards either since you want to. I discovered the Codebreaker Combo through SuperNix's profile here: https://ygoprodeck.com/world-chalice-harpie-post-september-2020-banlist/  The <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> and <a data-name=""Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior"">Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior </a>are not essential but cards I really like in this deck, especially going second. Ningirsu is World Chalice in name and a fantasic way to out certain problematic cards (DRAGOON) whereas Avramax is just a strong generic card that can be made with 2 link 2's and is hard to out. Other notable cards that can be run are included in the side deck. <a data-name=""Accesscode talker"">Accesscode talker</a> should definitely be in the extra deck if you have it. It is so easy to make in this deck and there are so many different attributed link monsters ran in this deck. I just don't own the card myself and will not until it gets reprinted. Instead run one of the Borrel monsters or just Avramax for a big link 4. <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>, and <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> are just great cards to have in the extra deck if you have them. You can also run any number of generic rank 4 xyz monsters to fill in any gap. Notable ones being <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> or <a data-name=""Lightning Chidori"">Lightning Chidori</a>.  On the ratios, I decided to only run 2 Perfumer. This is because I only have 2 of them and never bothered to get a third since I don't find myself needing the third whenever I play. Playing 1 or less definitely seems bad though. 1 <a data-name=""Harpie Harpist"">Harpie Harpist</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Harpie Oracle"">Harpie Oracle</a>, and 1 <a data-name=""Harpie Queen"">Harpie Queen</a> are just there for the extra names and their usage with <a data-name=""Swallows Nest"">Swallows Nest</a> and Simorgh summons in the grind game. They can be be discarded off of Channeler. Oracle can be an extender if needed. You can side deck more Queens/<a data-name=""Harpie's Hunting Grounds"">Harpie's Hunting Grounds</a> if you are facing more control players. I only run 1 of each since they are searchable easily. As for the World Chalice Ratios, 3 Chalices since I want to see it in my hand, 3 Guardragons since its actually a fantastic extender, and 2 Lee since if I only play 1 and draw it my Chalice is dead. Lee isn't a bad card to normal summon if used in combination with Unexpected dai or if you have nothing better to normal summon off of Imduk (its the only World Chalice in hand). I run max copies of Egotist, Sign, and Dai to get that normal monster. I run 11 Harpie monsters so there is a good chance that the Egotist is not dead in hand. You can bump up the Swallows Nest ratio if you want, its a great card against Imperm and Veiler. Also not a bad card to just set.  &nbsp;  Thank you for reading all this. I am definitely not the first one to mix these two archetypes but this is my take on the deck. I might make a video on this deck in the future. If you have any suggestions on what to change feel free. Its a very fun combo deck that usually ends on the same board but the way to build that board varies from game to game. It can play through hand traps pretty nicely sometimes thanks to Feather Storm and all the different extenders the deck runs. It has access to so many different cards you can tech. I think this deck can have competitive success in a future meta. We will just have to see."

Herald (Competitive and Balance) VS TCG World 7 Hand Trap (Ash, Herald, Lancea) 3 Support Spell (Droplet)","Hello, everyone  Back again with me, Kusari Hanzai  This time I will share my Drytron deck to you all  Just like yesterday I use OCG card and TCG ban list  I hope you all like it  Thank you, and let's go  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Introduction</div></blockquote> It seems that I have started to like this archetype  Not only unique, but his extraordinary ability to perform ritual summon in every match made me want to dig deeper into the potential of this deck  Yap, this archetype is Drytron  Anyways, let's jump to the deck list  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Monsters</div></blockquote> 3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring  Competitive decks always need hand trap to support them, and this is Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring.  No need to further explanation, I believe that all of you already know the power of this card. One of the best hand traps you can find in Yu-Gi-Oh!  3x Herald of Orange Light  This card shines again after a long time with quick effect to negate opponent monster effect, although it requires one other fairy card as a condition of using it but still useful for awakening the full power of the strongest Herald  3x Diviner of The Heralds  Other cards from Herald archetype, but did you all realize that she is not only a beautiful fairy, her abilities are also lovely. Send 1 fairy card from deck or extra deck to graveyard and her level also increase by the level of the sent monster. Amazing  1x Herald of Ultimateness  The strongest ritual monster from the Herald archetype with the ability to negate everything. Yap, he is one of the bosses on this deck  1x Artifact Lancea  Why only one copy on this deck? The reason is because this card can be searched using the effect of Cyber Angel Benten and Herald of The Arc Light. And this card is only useful for dealing with certain decks that often banish. But don't worry, there's one more copy on the extra deck. Based on my experience one to two copies in the deck is enough  2x Eva  This cute little fairy who looks like an alien will help you add a fairy card to your hand. Send this card to the graveyard and banish up to 2 other light fairy monsters to add the same number of level 2 or lower light fairy monster with different name. Use this effect to add Herald of Orange Light and Diviner of The Heralds.  3x Drytron Alpha Thuban  3x Drytron Zeta Aldhibah  2x Drytron Gamma Eltanin  Alpha, Zeta and Gamma these 3 card are the main character in this deck, Alpha search ritual monster, Beta search ritual spell, Gamma being itself and special summon other Drytron from graveyard  1x Drytron Delta Altais  Reveal 1 ritual card and draw 1 card, use this effect to reduce brick  1x Drytron Beta Rastaban  Rarely used but it’s important, so here one copy of it  1x Drytron Meteonis Draconids  Second big boss on this deck since the first one is Herald of Ultimateness, banish monster card from graveyard and target face-up card send it to graveyard  1x Drytron Meteonis Quadrantids  Third big boss on this deck, cannot be targeted with spell/trap card or effect, also can destroy all spell and trap your opponent control. Always be prepared for the worst.  3x Cyber Angel Benten  Tribute fodder and great searcher  1x Cyber Angel Natasha  Hidden boss, steal opponent monster and win the game, always like that. Treat her well, because she is the key of your win  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Spells</div></blockquote> 1x Meteonis Drytron  One is enough and treat this card gently  3x Drytron Nova  Special summon Drytron monster from deck to reduce brick  1x Foolish Burial  Brick alternative solution, can be used to send Drytron monster, ritual monster and fairy monster  3x Cyber Emergecy  Amazing searcher and help you reduce brick. Towards infinity and beyond  3x Forbidden Droplet  Use it well, especially when facing Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Extra</div></blockquote> 1x Linkuriboh  1x Union Carrier  Use this card effect to equip Union Carrier with Eva, and ritual summon Cyber Angel Benten using Union Carrier so Eva can be in the graveyard  1x I:P Masquerena  Best girl. If you all see something bizarre with your opponent like having a deck of more than 40 card, most likely they have Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon. You all better make this spicy girl instead of Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess in 1st turn. If Herald of Ultimateness has been defeated, you all can make Borrelsword Dragon by using I:P Masquerena effect, and that dragon will become immortal.  1x Knightmare Unicorn  1x Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess  Goddess of negate  1x Accesscode Talker  Alternative boss, Yusaku Fujiki from Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS approve this  1x Borrelsword Dragon  Link 4 monster that can be used to destroy Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon  1x Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir  XYZ monster which has the same vibe as Foolish Burial with extra protection for Drytron ritual monster, also can help you reduce brick  1x Lyrilusc-Assembled Nightingale  Direct attack, XYZ summon to Downerd Magician, XYZ to Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder  1x Downerd Magician  Material for Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder  1x Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal  Can be XYZ summon using Diviner of The Heralds and Cyber Angel Benten. Use her to send another Drytron monster if you having trouble with brick. Remember when using her effect send Diviner of The Heralds first. This strategy will be useful for deterring opponent from banish Cyber Angel Benten in graveyard. You also can use her effect to send Eva in opponent turn and add more fairy monster  1x Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder  Expensive boss  2x Herald of The Arch Light  Send this card to the graveyard and add 1 ritual card. Yap another brick solution  1x Black Rose Dragon  Synchro summon this card using Diviner of The Heralds and Drytron monster, this card will help you to wipe out opponent board  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Side</div></blockquote> 2x Nibiru, The Primal Being  Sometimes he is not the end of everything  1x Artifact Lancea  Stop opponent banish card  2x Skull Meister  Negate card effect in graveyard also give him more love, he deserves it  2x Droll &amp; Lock Bird  Stop opponent add more card  1x Blue-Eyes Chaos Max Dragon  Alternative boss, Seto Kaiba from Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Dark Side of Dimensions approve this  2x Lightning Storm  Great removal  1x Harpie’s Feather Duster  Also a great removal for spell and trap  2x Triple Tactical Talent  3 awesome effects in one card, use them wisely  2x Cosmic Cyclone  Pay 1000 LP feel’s good, it also banish a card  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Strategy in 1st turn</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Link summon Linkuriboh, very weak 2/10, can be handled by every deck</li>  	<li>Link summon Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess with 4 monster, not strong 4/10, can be handled by some deck</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir and ritual summon Drytron Meteonis Draconids, average 5/10, but hard to recovery if you banish too much Drytron monster</li>  	<li>Ritual summon Herald of Ultimateness, very strong 7/10, still some card like PSY-Framegear Gamma and Forbidden Droplet can stop this Ultimate being</li>  	<li>Link summon Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess, XYZ summon Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal and Ritual summon Herald of Ultimateness, perfect 9/10, only the chosen ones can get past from this perfect defense</li> </ol> &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Strategy in 2nd turn</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Synchro summon Black Rose Dragon, average 5/10, depending on the situation this can be an excellent solution</li>  	<li>Link summon Borrelsword Dragon, strong 6/10, only works in certain condition especially when dealing with Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Lyrilusc-Assembled Nightingale, direct attack, XYZ summon Downerd Magician, XYZ summon Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder, very strong 7/10, but it has limited material</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir and Ritual summon Drytron Meteonis Draconids or Drytron Meteonis Quadrantids depending on the situation, and use Cyber Angel Natasha effect, the best 8/10, if this doesn't work then nothing will be able to help</li> </ol> &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Deck Statistics</div></blockquote> Attack : 8/10  Defence : 8.5/10  Consistency : 8/10  Recovery : 8/10  Overall : 8.1"

Draw Rescue Ferret then Saryuja Effect to summon the Ferret. Shuffle back ferret for Giant Rex, Dotscaper, and Re-Cover. Synchro into Naturia Beast using Rex and Re-Cover, and Linguriboh from the Dotscaper. This takes care of spells and traps gg. Off of Block Dragon's search get 2 copies of Gigantes and summon both of them then summon Gallant Granite then detach 1 to search Block Dragon. This is better than searching Block Dragon off of Block Dragon as it basically is the same thing with a body on board. Feel free to take out the other Cherubini or the Knightmares for some other extra deck options. Generic Rank 4s could go well in their place. You can also play Deskbot 001 in the main deck and have Mecha Phantom Beast Aurodan and Halqifibrax in the extra deck from some more synchro options. The best end board I have gotten is Dingirsu, Zeroboros with 5,000 ATK, Nat Beast, Linguriboh, Fossil Dyna and Levair. This pretty much takes care off all monsters and spells as well as annoying first turn traps like Imperm and Evenly Matched. If anyone has a combo deck similar to this I would love to check it out, Block Dragon Burning Abyss is my favorite deck and probably will stay my favorite deck. I could definitely see this deck making a return if Block Dragon was to go to 2 copies but probably wouldn't work very well if he were to come back to 1. As for O-lion, he probably won't be coming back as long as Halqifibrax is in the game. But he can easily be replaced for a 2nd copy of Rhino Warrior, Edge Imp Sabres, or something of the sort. Anyway that is all I have I hope you like the build!"

Thank you, and let's go  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Introduction</div></blockquote> This is the first archetype that I see quite interesting, due to the ritual summon monster which is usually done using levels and now you can use monster attacks instead  Yap, this archetype is Drytron  Drytron is an archetype of light machine special summon monsters with level 1 and have 2000 ATK and 0 DEF  Anyways, let's just jump to the deck list  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Monsters</div></blockquote> 3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring  In my opinion it is mandatory for each competitive deck to have a hand trap, and the most favorite hand trap is Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. This card is really awesome because it’s capable to negate 3 effect which always happens in the opponent's game  3x Droll &amp; Lock Bird  This card is not only useful for stop opponent to add more card from deck also this is card is a monsters that have 1 level. Based on my experience, Drytron is amazing archetype that never use normal summon and often brick for no reason. In some case I use this card, normal summon it and XYZ summon Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir to continue the combo  3x D.D. Crow  This card is very helpful against deck that often use graveyard like Eldlich, and its also the same reason like Droll &amp; Lock Bird because its level 1  1x Vanity’s Ruler  I don’t lie if I say that this Drytron deck has a bad start in first turn, that's why I use this card to lock opponent combo and this card is searchable with Cyber Angel Benten effect  3x Drytron Alpha Thuban  3x Drytron Zeta Aldhibah  2x Drytron Gamma Eltanin  Alpha, Zeta and Gamma these 3 card are the main character in this deck, Alpha search ritual monster, Beta search ritual spell, Gamma being itself and special summon other Drytron from graveyard  1x Drytron Delta Altais  Reveal 1 ritual card and draw 1 card, fair enough for me  1x Drytron Beta Rastaban  Rarely used but it’s important, so here one copy of it  1x Drytron Meteonis Draconids  First big boss on this deck, banish monster card from graveyard and target face-up card send it to graveyard  1x Drytron Meteonis Quadrantids  Second big boss on this deck, cannot be targeted with spell/trap card or effect, also can destroy all spell and trap your opponent control  3x Cyber Angel Benten  Two word, tribute fodder and also great searcher  1x Cyber Angel Natasha  Hidden boss, steal opponent monster and win, always like that  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Spells</div></blockquote> 1x Meteonis Drytron  Just a small reminder, there is only one on this deck so be careful when using it, sometimes you will leave this card on graveyard and sometimes opponent with effect of D.D. Crow will take that card fly away to the banish zone  3x Drytron Nova  Special summon Drytron monster from deck to reduce the possibility of brick  1x Foolish Burial  Brick solution, can be used to send Drytron monster or ritual monster  3x Cyber Emergecy  Awesome Drytron searcher  3x Triple Tactical Talent  The best way to use this card is to take control 1 monster your opponent control and if it’s a XYZ monster, you know what I mean… it’s ZEUS time  3x Forbidden Droplet  Only used for counter Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Extra</div></blockquote> 1x Linkuriboh  1x Cross-sheep  Use it’s effect with ritual monster to draw 2 card  1x I:P Masquerena  1x Knightmare Unicorn  1x Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess  1x Accesscode Talker  Alternative boss, Yusaku Fujiki from Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS approve this  1x Borrelsword Dragon  Can be used to destroy Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon  2x Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir  XYZ monster which has the same vibe as Foolish Burial with extra protection for rituals  2x Lyrilusc-Assembled Nightingale  Direct attack, XYZ summon to Downerd Magician, XYZ to Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder  2x Downerd Magician  Material for Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder  2x Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder  Expensive boss  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Side</div></blockquote> 3x Nibiru, The Primal Being  Sometimes he is not the end of everything, however I believe that he will be the end for Drytron  2x Artifact Lancea  Stop banish card for a moment, and it’s fairy type  3x Skull Meister  Give him more love, he deserves it  1x Blue-Eyes Chaos Max Dragon  Alternative boss, Seto Kaiba from Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Dark Side of Dimensions approve this  3x Lightning Storm  Great removal  1x Harpie’s Feather Duster  Also a great removal for spell and trap  2x Cosmic Cyclone  Pay 1000 LP feel’s good  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Strategy in 1st turn</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Link summon Linkuriboh, very weak 2/10, can be handled by every deck</li>  	<li>Link summon Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess with 4 monster, not strong 4/10, can be handled by some deck</li>  	<li>Normal summon Vanity’s Ruler, strong 6/10, but still can be counter with Forbidden Droplet and Lightning Storm</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir and ritual summon Drytron Meteonis Draconids, strong 7/10, but hard to recovery if you banish too much Drytron monster</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir, ritual summon Drytron Meteonis Draconids and normal summon Vanity’s Ruler, very strong 8/10, the best first turn that can be happen to this deck</li> </ol> &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Strategy in 2nd turn</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Link summon Borrelsword Dragon, strong 6/10, only works in certain condition especially when dealing with Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Lyrilusc-Assembled Nightingale, direct attack, XYZ summon Downerd Magician, XYZ summon Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder, very strong 7/10, but it has limited material</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir and Ritual summon Drytron Meteonis Draconids or Drytron Meteonis Quadrantids depending on the situation, and use Cyber Angel Natasha effect, the best 8/10, if this doesn't work then nothing will be able to help</li> </ol> &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Deck Statistics</div></blockquote> Attack : 7/10  Defence : 6/10  Consistency : 7/10  Recovery : 6/10  Overall : 6.5"

This deck can often combo off to end up with Apollousa (with 4 counters) and 3 Infernity barriers with an Infernity monster out. This deck is pretty good but can brick sometimes. Overall just a fun deck using what the Infernity archetype has right now. Can't wait to make another version of this deck when the new support comes out to the TCG cause the cards look awesome.

The way this deck interacts with your opponent is so cool and I love decks that can play on your opponent's turn. This deck has a lot of potential and is a great rogue contender.</span> <h1><span><span>The Decklist:</span></span></h1> <h2><span>Main Deck:</span></h2> <h3><span>Monsters:</span></h3> <span>2x <a data-name=""Abominable Unchained Soul"">Abominable Unchained Soul</a>, This card is really strong interruption and a decent extender, it recursive effect is also really good in a grind game</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Unchained Twins - Aruha"">Unchained Twins - Aruha</a>, this card is one of your best starters / extenders in the deck, being able to pop a card to summon itself is just really strong</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Unchained Twins - Rakea"">Unchained Twins - Rakea</a>, this is the worst of the ""twins"", but it gets the job done as an extender, you play three because it's a name and has the mutual floating effect of the ""twins""</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Unchained Twins - Sarama"">Unchained Twins - Sarama</a>, this is the best extender in your deck, being able to set one of the traps for interruption on your opponent's turn is really valuable</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Lilith, Lady of Lament"">Lilith, Lady of Lament</a>, This is the best starter in the deck, being able to set a piece of backrow is just so good for this deck</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Skull Meister,"">Skull Meister,</a> This is a handtrap that is really good in the current meta environment, with all the graveyard decks running around, this hits those where it hurts</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> (and 1x Driver), This is just a really strong handtrap in the current format, and while you do have to run a brick, it isn't that bad</span> <h3><span>Spells:</span></h3> <span>3x <a data-name=""Abomination's Prison"">Abomination's Prison</a>, this just searches any piece of the deck that you may need at any given time, needless to say it's just really good</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Fury of Kairyu-Shin"">Fury of Kairyu-Shin</a>, this can search torrential which is insanely good in just about every board state for you.</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>, this is just a really good card, the extra is very loose so fitting this in is no problem</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>, this can insulate you from certain handtraps, honestly this has no real good reason to be limited (otherwise play more of it)</span> <h3><span>Traps:</span></h3> <span>3x <a data-name=""Abominable Chamber of the Unchained"">Abominable Chamber of the Unchained</a>, this can revive a card if need be and has the floating effect that makes it a main combo piece </span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Escape of the Unchained"">Escape of the Unchained</a>, This is another really good trap that floats into stuff, and it being an archetypal Icarus Attack (kinda) in a deck like this is just amazing</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>, This is a really strong trap right now, and with the payoff of the floating effects of the unchaineds, it's just amazing in a deck like this</span> <h2><span>The Extra Deck:</span></h2> <span>2x  <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>, This is in here for the Dogmatika match up, if you have to send these at any point then these are great disruption or extension at any given time</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</a>, This is a decently strong rank 8 you can go into if need be, but it's not all that good (seeing as it ""sends"" instead of ""destroys"")</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Topologic Zeroboros"">Topologic Zeroboros</a>, This is a good card for closing out games when the need be, but you won't need it that much and it has problems akin to Dingirsu </span>  <span>2x <a data-name=""Unchained Abomination"">Unchained Abomination</a>, This is a great boss monster for this deck, but summoning it is sometimes a hassle</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Unchained Soul of Anguish,"">Unchained Soul of Anguish,</a> This is really only good on the draw, but it's removal is so strong that it's worth playing anyhow, and the fating effect is good if you have something like Torrential Tribute set</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Unchained Soul of Rage"">Unchained Soul of Rage</a>, This is what you want to go into the most, it has in <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> like effect of letting you link summon during your opponent's turn, but it also allows you to do so by using one of your opponent's monsters</span>  <span>2x <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>, This is what you will want to link into with Rage, it spins a card back to the deck on summon so it is another layer of interruption</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>, You won't go into this much, but in certain corner cases this card can be useful</span> <h2><span>Side Deck:</span></h2> <span>1x <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>, this is really good on the draw as it can be removal against your opponent (play more if it comes off the list)</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a>, another going second card, this can just blow out most VW or Drytron decks running around right now</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Unchained Soul of Disaster"">Unchained Soul of Disaster</a>, This is a good card on turn 2, but otherwise it doesn't do enough to warrant how bricky it can be</span>  2x <a data-name=""Mistaken Arrest"">Mistaken Arrest</a>, this is a budget alternative to <a data-name=""droll and lock bird"">droll and lock bird, if you can afford that card, play it over this</a>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Dark Hole"">Dark Hole</a>, This is meant as an out to most cards as well as being able to trigger your cards' effects</span>  <span>2x Any Generic Backrow Removal, This can be whatever you wan't it to be in this case I'm using<a data-name=""Twin Twisters""> Twin Twisters </a>because that is what I have ATM</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier,"">Dimensional Barrier,</a> This card has gotten a lot better following the current meta game</span> <h1><span>Main Combo(s):</span></h1> <h2><span>2x Unchained Cards (Rekea + backrow, Aruha + any ""Unchained"" card):</span></h2> <ol>  	<li><span>Summon / set the first Unchained</span></li>  	<li><span>Summon (if need be) the second card</span></li>  	<li><span>Pop the first card</span></li>  	<li><span>use that card's effect to fetch an unchained from deck (Sarama is usually best)</span></li>  	<li><span>use that unchained's effect to pop a card</span></li>  	<li><span>float into another card (Soul or otherwise if you still have more extension)</span></li>  	<li><span>If you got Soul then you can make Rage, otherwise use your extension to get out Soul and then make the link</span></li>  	<li><span>set any additional backrow</span></li> </ol> <span>This combo can also work in a variety of ways depending on what you have in hand, but while this may not seem all that strong, it's the recursive and repeatability of this combo that makes it such a threat.</span> <h1><span>Tech Cards / Engines:</span></h1> <h2><span>Burning Abyss:</span></h2> <span>Since the BAs are fiends, they won't be locked out from your monster's effects, but honestly that is about all the synergy they have</span> <h2><span>Other ""Unchained"" Cards:</span></h2> <span><a data-name=""Wailing of the Unchained Souls"">Wailing of the Unchained Souls</a> is kind of situational, it's more disruption, but it can easily be a dead card in the hand and it mostly just comes up as a name for the floating effect.</span> <h2><span>""Evil Eye"" cards:</span></h2> <span>I'm going to be honest and just say that I don't like this engine simply because it is kind of invasive to your main strategy, but it is a popular option, so I felt like at least mentioning it.</span> <h2><span>""Plunder Patroll"" Cards:</span></h2> <span>These are also fiends and could potentially have some cool synergy with the deck, the only real problem is that the sequencing on the combos would need a lot of shopping around, but I would love to merge two of my favorite decks.</span> <h2><span>""Metalfoes"" Cards:</span></h2> <span>Metalfoes can help get your combos started for the deck, the pendulum effect to pop stuff to set backrow can be very useful along with having <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization </a>as another way to out problem cards. You won't be making much use of the ability to pendulum summon with this deck, but the metalfoes cards are strong enough on their own to be of great use</span> <h2><span>Other Tech Cards:</span></h2> <span><a data-name=""Charge Into a Dark World"">Charge Into a Dark World</a> could be a useful extender for the deck, however I find it doesn't come up enough after further testing</span>  <span><a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> is another useful card for outing problem boss monsters and board states agaist the current meta, however thanks to VW you can chain Chuche to it and then chain VFD to Chuche, so it does nothing at all right now.</span> <h2><span>Expensive Cards:</span></h2> <span>This deck is meant to be budget so these aren't included in the list, but I will at least acknowledge them.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Accescode Talker"">Accescode Talker</a> is a really good card that can win you games that you otherwise wouldn't, it's a great card bogged down by a massive price tag</span>  <span><a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a> is one hell of a card, but I don't know how well it really fits with this deck (it sends)</span>  <span><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet </a>is a better Forbidden Chalice, but it's also just really not cheap</span>  <span>___________________________________________________________________________________________________</span>  <span>I hope you all enjoy the list and try the deck out, any and all feedback is welcome.</span>  &nbsp; <h2><span>Edits:</span></h2> <span>- changed up the main and side deck to better deal with current match-ups and what I believe to work the best for this deck.</span>  <span>- fixed some errors in the main and side deck</span>"

I used this deck this past weekend (2/28/21) and finished 54th with an 8-3 record. Lu Feng makes this deck much better then before BLOV. Drawing any ancient warrior along with Lu Feng auto puts him on the field. Not only that but having a tri-brigade monster create double dragon lords also opens it up to summon easy plus with a 500 attk boost. You can also switch from a going second to a going first strat pretty easy with this deck. Just sub out the three Loyal Guan Yuns, alpha, and the lightning storms for the books, crackdowns, and either the barrier/ dark simorgh or one of the other plus another card. Going first you do have to worry about nib! If you can go full combo you should able to end on Simorgh + Barrier + Double dragon lord (bounce to hand) + Lu Feng (destroy quick eff during main 1). Also this absolutely punished any other tri-brigade builds I played. The fact that most of the ancient warriors are wind is just icing on the cake. Finally, a very under rated card that has a lot of synergy with tri-brigade is Sun Mou. His eff to send a card from hand or field to grave to add an ancient warrior monster opens the door to send kit or nervall thus openning up tri-brigade while you set up your ancient warrior plays as well.
