This is something I created as an improvement from my last deck, still allowing you to go first and gain even more advantage from cards like Max. I did need to put in Mekk-Knights to make this strategy work, however I don't think it deters from the strategy, rather improves it. Furthermore, I was able to establish a way to summon Lib effectively and link summon another max during your opponent's turn if you have the luxury of extra musket monsters. Is it perfect? No, not at all. One hand trap is sure to stop this deck in its tracks. However, I do think this is a fun take on Muskets that I think people will indeed enjoy."

Inspired by  the Yugituber crystlabndce.,The win condition is Crystal Abundance to OTK or OTK by activating Carbuncle.

Your main way to activate Abundance is to use Crystal Tree to summon 4 beasts to your spell zone and then clear the opponent's board.  More info to be updated.

It's time for a new Summoned Skull deck only this time, it's on a budget! None of that garbage Dragoon getting in the way. Savage Dragon? Pfft, thing of the past, that. The main strategy of this deck revolves around using cards like Archfiend's Manifestation to buff up your Summoned Skull monsters, and provide board presence through its floating effect to keep high level, high attack fiends on your side of the field.  Goal: Good ol' classic beatdown  Example combos:  Tour Guide -&gt; Rhino Warrior -&gt; Verte Anaconda = Heiress pitch to search Summoned Skull = Archfiend's Manifestation via Anaconda's effect  Special Summon two BA monsters for a similar combo, or go into Dante or a Link-2  With Manifestation on the field, tribute over it for Archfiend Commander to Special Summon it back, then overlay into Archfiend's Ascent, activate Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force to summon D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga  Similar effects can be achieved by destroying Archfiend Cavalry"

A true control variant focusing on disrupting plays, and removing monsters on the field is how the deck will be able to withstand combo decks.  The deck can OTK using Augoeides if an opportunity arises: <ol>  	<li>Send 2 Fusion monsters (Dragon Master Knight + Any Fusion Monster you prefer) to the GY using Nadir Servant/Maximus to the GY</li>  	<li>Fusion summon Augoeides using Aleister + Fusion monster (which can be easily done with set up using Maximus/Nadir Servant to send a fusion monster to the GY)</li>  	<li>Use Augoeides to banish Dragon Master Knight to gain 5k attack which equals to 7k atk. During damage calc, discard Aleister (which you'll get back by using Invocation effect from GY) to buff atk by 1k equaling to 8k.</li> </ol> The OTK looks like it needs a lot of set up however it can easily do it with a Nadir Servant + Aleister/Magical Meltdown.  Dragon Master Knight is also a nice target for Dogmatika Punishment to out high attack monsters such as UTC.  You can also choose to run 2 Maximus. You can replace any one of the hand traps of your choice.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Can cause a lot of decks issues trying to get around, also really good discard fodder for switchyard and redeployment  Fortress: Can summon itself with ease, it's also an inherent summon so doesn't start a chain. When destroyed by battle it pops a card, so you can crash it to get rid of problem cards with ease. When targeted by a monster effect you can pitch a card from your opponents hand for free, this is also a continuous effect so can't be negated by cards like Borreload savage or Apollousa. Finally it is a level 7, so when combined with Harvester it allows for rank 9 plays.  Redeployment: Gives you 6 copies of Metalcruncher and if you discard a Machina card you can also search the trap card which is a very underrated card in this deck.  Overdrive: Really brings the whole deck together. You can use it to either special summon Citadel, or if Citadel is already in the GY either of the other Machina monsters. If Citadel is already in the GY it will also trigger it's effect. Due to it being a summon and then if you do destroy effect, you can protect your target with Super Dora and get the summon for free. Due to it also being able to recycle monster banished or in your GY. it lets you either recycle the whole Inifitrack combo or the Citadel if your opponent banished it.  Infinitrack:  Harvester: It's the bhest normal summon in the deck every other turn, allows for rank 9 and rank 12 plays.  Brutal Dozer: One of the decks best extenders  Trencher: Same as Dozer, not a complete garnet as Dozer can summon a Harvester for you to tribute if you do draw it, but much better in the deck.  Heavy Forward: Either gets you to your normal summon or acts as an extender if you already have 1 in hand.  Trains:  Bullet Train: The best extender in the deck. Not only is it a free summon but during the end phase you get a monster back from your GY. Essential to any deck that can use it.  Derricrane: Another really good extender, as well letting you chain block. Pops a card when detached to help you control the game  Pegasus: You mostly want to be summoning this off Switchyard, but in the later turns it is a respectable normal summon.  Night Express: Due to this deck relying on having a normal summon to get started, Night Express is needed because it adds 5 more normal summons to the deck due to being searchable off Switchyard.  Switchyard: Either gets you to 1 of your level 10's or acts as an extender. With this an d Anger Knuckle, you can put up very good defensives on your opponents turn that will set you up to pressure for game.  &nbsp;  Reason For No Urgent Schedule:  In the current format, Trains can't really blind second anymore, as they can't make the most use out of cards like Nibiru as this will lock you out of the normal summon of metalcruncher as well as the summon of bullet train, and DRNM and Evenly will prevent you from OTK'ing which is you main goal when going second. Due to this urgent schedule is a total brick going first, and will likely just get negated going second.

Deck Breakdown:  Main Deck:  -<a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>--<a data-name=""&quot;Infernoble Arms - Durendal&quot;"">""Infernoble Arms - Durendal""</a>: These cards focus on getting Isolde up as consistently as possible. I included 3 <a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin"">Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphins </a>because you will want to use its effect as much as possible, to remove any hand traps your opponent may have, and it can make Isolde with any warrior that can be Special Summoned.  -<a data-name=""Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade"">Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade</a>--<a data-name=""Arcana Force XXI - The World"">Arcana Force XXI - The World</a>: These cards are part of the main combo, as detailed above.  -<a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>--<a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a>: These cards are used to counter anything that might threaten the combo.  They can be changed out based on the current meta &amp; personal budget.  Extra Deck:  -<a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a>: This is the best Warrior I could find that can be summoned with Instant Fusion., with the ability to flip an opponent's monster face-down.  -<a data-name=""Millennium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a>: If you have Instant Fusion but you can summon Isolde without it, use it to summon this card instead. You never have 5 main monster zones taken up at a time, so you can use this card to protect your entire combo. Can be replaced with something that is useful in more duels.  -Everything else: These cards are part of the combo. I have a second Isolde in case the first one gets negated<a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">.</a>  Side deck: These cards are useful against a variety of decks, and can be switched based on the meta &amp; your budget. More info on them below.  Support Cards:  -<a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>: Useful against <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">A</a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">sh Blossom</a> and <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>.  -<a data-name=""Prohibition"">Prohibition</a>: This card can stop any specific card that poses a threat to the combo, unless it is already on the field.  -<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>: Good for stopping other combo decks, or <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Gamma</a>. Will also be good to have when/if we get <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>.  -PSY-Framegear Gamma: Good for stopping an opponent's combo, or to stop <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich from being summoned</a>.  -<a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>: Shuts down combo decks, but relatively ineffective in other matchups.  Side Deck:  -<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>: Destroys opponent's entire backrow, staple against Spell/Trap based decks. You do not need to worry about the Eldlixer/Golden Land GY effects because your opponent will not have another turn to play them on.  -Book of Eclipse: This card works against Eldlich and Dogmatika by flipping the monsters face-down, preventing them from resolving the Golden Land continuous traps or summoning <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis the Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis the Knighted</a>  -<a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a>: This card works well against combo decks. May also work in the main deck.  -<a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>: Works well in certain matchups, but may be replaced.  -<a data-name=""Heritage of the Chalice"">Heritage of the Chalice</a> and <a data-name=""Super Quantum Red Layer"">Super Quantum Red Layer</a>: These cards can be sided in after losing a duel (so you know you're going first) because your opponent won't have any setup to counter. These increase your ability to set up the combo with Isolde.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

You guys thought Gouki was dead? Hell no. I've made this deck almost unbrickable plus the combos are ridiculous. The deck always wants to go first and if you go first you will most likely win unless you get handtrapped more than twice but the deck can go second because maining Dark Ruler is really good (trust me). I figured out how to ""bypass"" the banlist for the synchro turbo engine. <a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a><a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie""> does the job perfectly. As well as </a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Warbluran"">Mecha Phantom Beast Warbluran</a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Warbluran"">. I also came up with using </a><a data-name=""Attack Gainer"">Attack Gainer</a><a data-name=""Attack Gainer"">. This card is so good. Going second it makes your opponent constantly lose attack during your combos to allow for an easier OTK and since it is earth it can be used for </a><a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> with <a data-name=""Gouki Suprex"">Gouki Suprex</a>. Two Gouki monsters + any other warrior is full combo. Two warrior monsters is full synchro combo. <a data-name=""Heritage of The Chalice"">Heritage of The Chalice</a> is full synchro combo and possibly full combo in general depending on your hand because you add Durendal, then equip it to any warrior and search <a data-name=""Fire Flint Lady"">Fire Flint Lady</a> which gives you two warrior monsters. I will now explain full combo... First you want to have three (two works too, this is just the full power combo) warrior monsters, two Gouki monsters + any other warrior extender work best. Normal summon the Gouki monster then if its Suprex special summon another Gouki from your hand and use the other warrior extender. Go into Isolde using one Gouki and the warrior extender. Isolde chain 1, Gouki chain 2 (to chainblock ash and ogre). Gouki adds Headbatt and Isolde adds Riscorpio. Headbatt activates to send Riscorpio to summon itself targeting the other Gouki on the field. Isolde effect to send Divine Sword to summon Attack Gainer. Isolde into <a data-name=""Linkross"">Linkross</a>. Linkross summons two tokens, Attack Gainer + 1 token into <a data-name=""Formula Synchron"">Formula Synchron</a>. Formula with other token to make Metal Marcher. Metal Marcher summon Attack Gainer (only if Suprex is in grave, if not then summon Formula). Then Marcher and Linkross into Haqlifibrax. Effect to summon Plaguespreader. Plaguespreader + Headbatt into <a data-name=""Herald of The Arc Light"">Herald of The Arc Light</a>. Headbatt effect to search Rematch. Use Rematch to summon Suprex and any other Gouki (Headbatt for this example). Suprex + Attack Gainer into Nat Beast. Use Plaguespreader in grave, summon itself, Plaguespreader + Headbatt + Halqifibrax into Apollousa. I'm pretty sure your opponent won't be able to get over that... Also you can make Borreload Savage Dragon by making Auroradon with Formula Synchron + Haqlifibrax and then the two Phantom Beast tokens (without Nat Beast on the field) by using Auroradon to tribute himself and Plaguespreader (that was summoned from thee grave via its own effect) to summon Warbluran and use his effect to tribute a token to make him level two. Then Warbluran plus the other two tokens is Borreload Savage! Theres so many combinations and end boards with this deck its crazy. I hope you guys enjoyed and stick around for more awesome decks by yours truly."

Infinite Negates or Barrier stun, + a good grind game, and some truly unbeatable set-ups.","Harpie Lady deck. I think Elegant Egotist and Harpie's Feather Storm are the best cards so I built around them. Sidedeck plan includes a way to out Forbidden Droplets and Dark Ruler No Mores going first, by making Wynn the Wind Charmer and drawing 1 of 6 cards. Neither are perfect answers but I like it.  Remembered Imperial Order exists, so it got added to the anti-spell package. It's worse in some situations against Forbidden Droplet, but better when seen alongside Feather Storm, (because it leaves Harpie Lady on the field) and it doesn't need to use up the Linkuriboh if you don't have an extender. You can activate it at Spell Speed 2 before Dark Ruler No More, or in response to a Forbidden Droplet that didn't discard a trap, but mostly it is here to preserve Linkuriboh.  2 Harpies = Infinite Negates. Channeler adds Abyss Dweller or Cyber Slash Harpie into the mix. You can summon Barrier Statue game 2, or use Barrier Statue with Gizmek Uka, when you see combos that incorporate Martial Metalmarcher, Dragunity Romulus, or other wind bricks (Barrier Statue can even be made into Simorgh, opening up combo plays from this)  I'm onto Secret Village of the Spellcaster over other spell negation options now, because while it is vulnerable to random Magicians' Souls and Spellcaster archetypes (like Pendulums), it is still generally better than the other options against Dark Ruler No More and Forbidden Droplet. Since Simorgh can't be targeted by Impermance, Feather Storm protects from all generic hand traps, and your end boards are generally going to be either infinite negates or a Barrier Statue + Bagooska, this tech eliminates the remaining options to out you besides Sphere Mode (the big normal summon Kaiju. I'm glad a God Card is playable). Yes, this does require seeing the right specific cards for the counters your opponents has, but I just really like ""unbreakable"" locks."

How is it legal? Is it the best deck? The answers to those questions is yes this deck has 2 of each ruler and the baby rulers, it is legal in the Trinity Format a long with the other Dragon Good Stuff, and no funnily enough this deck is Rouge in the current format dominated by Chaos Thunder, Plants, and Dragma. The goal of this deck is to abuse the amount of grind the Rulers can provide on top of accuse to the Rank 7/8 and Synchro 8/9 toolbox. The deck wants to abuse power cards such as Chaos Ruler (can be made with 1 card by foolishing Absorouter)  to set up the GY, Eclipse Wyvern (All the Rulers can banish him) to search any Chaos Monster, REDMD just to summon big bodies, Spheres to set up turn 1 disruption on top of toolboxing the entire deck , and Number 95 just to net so much advantage. This is a Semi-Highlander deck that follows the Banlist and Rules of Trinity Format Link to Discord for more information on the Format https://discord.gg/zPdfWhM"

Your main focus is breaking the board with your Handtraps, evenly matched, and so on and summon your needed ship in your opponent's turn. You can also use the White Aura whale to nuke the board, also you can chainblock its effect with the graveyard effect of blue or whitebeard.  If you want u can switch Pride of Plunder Patrol and Ghost ogre for 3x desires and 2x Silent angler to get more combo options.  The side options are for special cases like Dragoon, the kaijus, in general, are really good at Plunder because they can give you access to your ships/ GHostbelle and cosmic cyclone are for GY reliant decks or backrow decks.  &nbsp;  Feel free to comment and improve the deck or to tell me if its good or not Pride of Plunder Patrol seems not that great but if u have it in hand and you are able to break the opponent's board, which should be possible in most of the cases, you can send it to the GY and send one Monster of their extra deck to the GY as well, so they cant combo again.  &nbsp;"

Basically, same strategy, except for searching for Block Dragon, you are looking for Red-Eyes Fusion while excavating cards with your Adamancipator engine to dig up materials and Fossil Fusions to hit big damage. The Koa'Ki engine also has some minor negation effects to help along the way! If anyone has any suggestions (other than not playing Adamancipator), please, feel free to comment! Let's chat!"

If there are 3 cards in either extra monster column (second left and second right) while Steelswarm Origin is in that column, special summon Tiamaton under Origin, and Origin's effect to be immune to destruction while linked will prevent it from being destroyed by Tiamaton.

Handtrap-heavy.,"As Jet-Synchron and O-Lion got banned, Orcust now has to rely on Crystron Rosenix for the first extender off Scrap Recycler, with Called by the Grave being limited, this combo is extremely fragile against hantraps, especially Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and D.D. Crow. Since I do not like luck factors, I've decided to not have Called by the Grave as a weird One-Of in this list and simply do not play it for the time being, instead I've decided to up the number of handtraps from Six to Ten, this way opening one handtrap is basically guaranteed and opening two is probable. I've also cut out Machina Fortress for the standard Danger!-package, as by being Dark attribute, they help making The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche and gain more advantage by drawing a card when accordingly triggered. With Bardiche obviously also comes The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots and two The Phantom Knight's Fog Blade. You could also play The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak and The Phantom Knight's Rank-Up Magic Launch to summon VFD over a Dingirsu if you want to play more of a blowout. This list also uses the Gadget-Combo for optimizing any hand with 2+ Starters with the exception of only drawing multiple Girsu The Orcust Mekk-Knight and no Scrap Recyclers, as Girsu has a hard OTP condition.  If uninterrupted, this decks optimized combo ends on four Apollousa negates, two set Fog Blades, a quick effect non-targeting spin trough Lib and I:P Masquerena, a quick effect non-targeting send trough the Dingirsu + Babel + Cymbal Skeleton setup and interruptions trough any handtraps you might have available.  Enjoy playing.  &nbsp;"

Not the inconsistent ""hoping-to-have-2-Crimson-Nova"", we're using Duza for double Crystal Wing w","Not your regular Aigami deck, Cubic is so inconsistent in OTK thanks to Crimson Nova ridiculous requirement and needs super specific setup to boost that buffoon to OTK. This deck is using <strong>Duza</strong> instead to establish board because it's a searchable Reborn Tengu, <strong>just add 1 random extender</strong> and we're good to go. So we need max copies of Duza, Summoner Monk, and Foolish Burial Goods (send Karma search Duza). To maximize the advantage, we need to use compatible extender like Summoner Monk (best, summons Duza from deck), Magicians Souls (super great, dumps your useless Cubic s/t on hand and draw), Apprentice Illusion Magician (same logic, but without draw), Danger Mothman (same logic, but the hand dump is random). Also we need to max Karma (for searching Duza) and Unification (combo piece).  Combo is summon Duza + 1 extender, use Duza dump Unification, make Barricadeborg (can use its effect to dump Unification in hand, so combo is still running even if we draw it), use Unification 2nd Duza, use Duza dump 2nd Unification, make Auroradon, use Auroradon ss 3 tokens chain 2nd Unification summon 3rd Duza, use Duza dump 3rd Unification, use Auroradon tribute itself and 1 token ss Warbluran, make Phonon Pulse, make Bureido, use Bureido chain 3rd Unification, ss Shinkuro and Vijam, make Martial Metal Marcher, ss Shinkuro again, make Garden Rose, use Garden Rose add Black Garden (save it for Tzolkin requirement), make Crystal Wing, make Tzolkin using Crystal Wing (now tuner cus Marcher) + Bureido, use Garden Rose GY eff ss Crystal Wing from GY, set Black Garden use Tzolkin ss yet another Crystal Wing.  You can use Black Garden to halve opponent's monster atk, but it makes Crystal Wing miss timing against on-summon effect because Black Garden activation is mandatory. The rest of the main deck is staple while extra deck is combo pieces and generic stuff, can use more Tzolkin target if you want.  <img src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/a/af/Aigami.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: New approach for Cubic, consistent, big monster, with staple too.

When you are about to summon him, it is mandatory to start playing Masaaki Endoh - Clear Mind at full blast.","Shooting Star Turbo. Go first, summon Red Supernova Dragon. Go second, summon Shooting Star and pray you at least reveal 2 or 3 tuners. Our synchro tuner is Shooting Riser Dragon.  Junk Synchron, some way to summon Psi-Reflector, and some way to get a level 4 on the field is one Shooting Star Dragon. Junk Converter and a tuner is one Red Supernova Dragon.  Normal summon Junk Synchron or summon a tuner and activate Starlight Junktion. Emergency Teleport or One for One into Psi-Reflector. Add Assault Beast to hand with Psi-Reflector. Discard Assault Beast to add Assault Mode Activate from deck to hand. Reveal Assault Mode Activate with Psi-Reflector to special the Assault Beast back and increase it's level by 3. Synchro Assault Beast and Psi-Reflector to make Stardust Dragon. Then, you need a way to summon a level 4 monster. Monster Reborn or Synchro Chase to bring back the Assault Beast or Junk Servant Special summon itself from hand. Synchro that level 4 and Junk Synchron into Shooting Riser Dragon. Shooting Riser send Quickdraw Synchron to decrease its level by 5. Now, if you synchro the level 2 Shooting Riser Dragon with Stardust Dragon, you get a Shooting Star Dragon or a Satellite Warrior.  Discard Junk Converter and a tuner to add Junk Synchron to hand. Normal Junk Synchron and special back the Junk Converter. Synchro those into Junk Speeder and special back the Junk Synchron by Converter's effect and then Special, Junk Synchron, Cyberse Synchron, and Quickdraw Synchron from deck (mandatory to summon as many). Synchro with the 2 Junk Synchrons, the Cyberse Synchron, and Junk Speeder. (3+3+1+5=12) This gets a Red Supernova Dragon which banishes your opponent's field and itself. Then, it specials itself back after your next turn.  The other Synchros in the Extra Deck are for the moments where you have not other options. You can take out something like Junk Destroyer, Quasar/Blazar, and Stardust Charge Warrior to add in some link monsters I'm lazy to do so.  The side deck gets you to your combo easier.  Desires is somewhat good and bad in this deck. You get to combo pieces easier, but you are banishing names that are Junk Speeder targets, you are banishing parts of the Assault Mode stuff, and possibly banishing your Quickdraw Synchrons that are your Shooting Riser Dragon targets. I just didn't want to put in random ""one of"" cards that are very situational for this deck."

Draitron can make Dragoon with frightening efficiency so long as they have access to Draitron Ban-Alpha, which they effectively have access to 13 copies of with all the searching they can do. from there, go off as hard as possible, setting up a graveyard full of Cyber Angel Benten (which you probably got off of Alpha) eventually summoning Cyber Angel Natasha, linking it away with something else for an Anaconda and viola! You have a graveyard full of snatch steals for link plays on your next turn, at least a Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and maybe a Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon (or insert your favorite ritual monster here, I just like big heckin' chonkers).  In the extra deck, there are probably three extra spots. Apollusa doesn't get made a ton, you probably don't need a second Verte, Cerberus is...fine at best, and Black Luster Soldier is pretty much only ever getting made by stealing stuff with Natasha, which is fun, but maybe not super consistent. Have some fun with it.  It probably wouldn't be bad to try 3 Where Aft Thou to find more Draitrons, so that might be a change I make going forward, but it is a bit more situational than the others. If you only have one other draitron and don't have a ritual, it's just dead. Nothing else is dead like that (outside of the obvious garnets). Then again, this could just be me justifying a bad decision after the fact.  This whole post has two caveats.  First, you may have noticed something about this deck, and you're right. There is not a single normal summonable monster in this whole thing. You will lose to someone putting up a barrier statue when you're on the draw in game one. I don't think that's a big enough problem to sink this iteration of the deck, but I could be wrong.  Second, I don't know if this is ever going to be a deck that you can actually put together. Draitrons are set to come out in Genesis Impact, which is in December. Dragoon centralizes power in a way that probably isn't healthy for the game, and might not make it much past when the main part of the deck actually comes out. Heck, the OCG just banned it this week. If the TCG follows their example, we might not have this toy much longer. After that, invoked does good stuff, but it's not anywhere near as consistent or as powerful. It's a lot of fun on simulators for the moment."

Archetypes are &lt;strong&gt;Bolded Black&lt;/strong&gt;. Extra Deck monsters are indicated with ⌈Half-Brackets⌋)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deck obviously heavily revolves around the &lt;strong&gt;Charmers&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Possessed&lt;/strong&gt; monsters, and obviously there's a lot of cards here. First thing to note is that there aren't very many multi-copy cards. In fact, the only Main Deck cards with multiples are &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Angraecum Umbrella&quot;&gt;Angraecum Umbrella&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(x3), and the &lt;strong&gt;Charmer/Possessed&lt;/strong&gt; Spells/Traps, although there is the option of swapping out attributes from the Side Deck based on your opponent's deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the main objective of this deck is to try and get out ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2), which is objectively the Deck's strongest card, especially while &lt;span style=&quot;color: #008080;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Awakening of the Possessed&quot;&gt;Awakening of the Possessed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is out, and also because it's the only Generic &lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady &lt;/strong&gt;monster, not requiring any other &lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady &lt;/strong&gt;cards to activate its effects. This takes a while at first and it will likely catch the opponent by surprise. The only Tuners in this deck are the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Angraecum Umbrella&quot;&gt;Angraecum Umbrella&lt;/a&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. However, the useful part is that they have the same stats (ATK/ 500, DEF/1500) as the &lt;strong&gt;Charmers&lt;/strong&gt;, so they can be easily summoned from the Hand/Deck/Graveyard by the effects of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Unpossessed&quot;&gt;Unpossessed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;T&lt;a data-name=&quot;eamwork of the Possessed&quot;&gt;eamwork of the Possessed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familiar Possessed - Lyna&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Eda the Sun Magician&quot;&gt;Eda the Sun Magician&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;Awakening - Nefarious&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Not only that, but its own effect can allow you to bring one of your &lt;strong&gt;Familiar Possessed&lt;/strong&gt; (Lv 4) monsters from the GY, allowing you to easily summon &lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every. &lt;/strong&gt;Since most decks run &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&quot;&gt;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, another way of summoning ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; involves getting out ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze&quot;&gt;Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Since &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ash Blossom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a (Lv 3, FIRE) Tuner, whenever your opponent uses &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ash Blossom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, try to prioritize getting out &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiita, Ablaze&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as quickly as possible. Then you can just summon any of the &lt;strong&gt;Familiar Possessed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Charmers &lt;/strong&gt;to bring out ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. You can also use ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;to help bring back your Tuners, so you can summon the other Synchros, or even bring back ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; without having to banish. Actually, another sort of situational technique is using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Spiritual Light Art - Miyabi&quot;&gt;Spiritual Light Art - Miyabi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, tributing ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to summon a Banished monster, and since ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; comes back, it's no real loss. You can make summoning ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; even easier by using &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;DNA Surgery&quot;&gt;DNA Surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Then if you have &lt;span style=&quot;color: #99cc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Ranryu&quot;&gt;Ranryu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Inari Fire&quot;&gt;Inari Fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Jigabyte&quot;&gt;Jigabyte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness&quot;&gt;Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (the &lt;strong&gt;Familiars&lt;/strong&gt;) in your hand, while the Tuner is out, you can just Special Summon the &lt;strong&gt;Familiars&lt;/strong&gt;, and since they'll automatically be Spellcasters, you can just as easily get out ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternate Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Synchro Monster to pay attention to is &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #99cc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&quot;&gt;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

It's not a Spellcaster, but it can be useful in conjunction with &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness&quot;&gt;Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to keep banishing your opponents' cards without having to banish yours. Just tribute &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #99cc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&quot;&gt;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to Summon &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nefarious&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;from the GY. That way you can use &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nefarious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for another Synchro, Xyz, or Link summon.

Since it has ATK/1500 and DEF/1500, many of your Spell/Trap effects will work in conjunction with this monster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt; 104:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt; Masquerade&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Like &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800080;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Alchemic Magician&quot;&gt;Alchemic Magician&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, requiring 3 Lv 4 monsters, although they don't have to be Spellcasters.

Also since half of your monsters are Lv 3, this card isvery easy to Summon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chocolate Magician Girl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Especially useful if you already have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;Unpossessed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;out. You can use this monster to not only get an extra draw, but if the card you discard is a &lt;strong&gt;Charmer&lt;/strong&gt;, then you can use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;'s effect next turn to bring that &lt;strong&gt;Charmer&lt;/strong&gt; back and potentially even deal some chip damage due to the &lt;strong&gt;Charmers'&lt;/strong&gt; decent DEF.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800080;&quot;&gt;Magical Broker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Very useful, especially since it has ATK/1500 DEF/ 200, so you can use &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800080;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008080;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Grand Spirit Art - Ichirin&quot;&gt;Grand Spirit Art - Ichirin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'s effect to swap &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800080;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dharc the Dark Charmer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt; out to get it. Since your deck would have a lot of Continuous Spells/Traps, this card could be very hard for your opponent to get rid of. Then you could of course use it to get an extra draw if you happen to have multiple &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008080;&quot;&gt;Awakening of the Possessed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpossessed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cards out, or if you already have &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teamwork or the Possessed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in your GY, you can just use its effect to bring that card you just sent to the GY back to the field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explosive Magician&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arcanite Magcian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;(Synchro Magicians)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Though not recyclable like &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800080;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #99cc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&quot;&gt;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot; data-name=&quot;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&quot;&gt; if either of the latter two get somehow Banished, or if they're already on the field, you can instead use the Synchro Magicians for sweeping.

The important thing is to take note of the dominant Attributes of your opponent's deck, then swap accordingly. There are less &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiita the Fire Charmer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cards, simply because FIRE monsters are the least common. You can also swap the &lt;strong&gt;Spirit Art&lt;/strong&gt; Traps, since all have useful effects. Since your Deck would have predominantly WATER monsters, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;Spiritual Water Art - Aoi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;is likely your go to swap, especially if you find that your monsters aren't getting Banished enough to need&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Spiritual Light Art - Miyabi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;. I would always leave &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Familiar Possessed - Hiita&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #99cc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familiar Possessed - Wynn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;Familiar Possessed - Aussa&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;in the Main Deck. Since WATER is the dominant Attribute in this deck, it's much easier to Link Summon ⌈&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3366ff;&quot;&gt;Eria the Water Charmer, Gentle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3366ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; than the other three Link &lt;strong&gt;Charmers&lt;/strong&gt;. Otherwise, swap out the other &lt;strong&gt;Familiar Possessed&lt;/strong&gt; monsters as you see fit. If necessary, you could also swap out &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #99cc00;&quot;&gt;Wynn the Wind Channeler/Medium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;with one of the &lt;strong&gt;Familiar Possessed&lt;/strong&gt; monsters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"">This deck obviously heavily revolves around the <strong>Charmers</strong> and <strong>Possessed</strong> monsters, and obviously there's a lot of cards here. First thing to note is that there aren't very many multi-copy cards. In fact, the only Main Deck cards with multiples are </a><span><strong><a data-name=""Angraecum Umbrella"">Angraecum Umbrella</a> </strong></span>(x3), and the <strong>Charmer/Possessed</strong> Spells/Traps, although there is the option of swapping out attributes from the Side Deck based on your opponent's deck.  <span><strong>Primary Strategy:</strong></span>  So, the main objective of this deck is to try and get out ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> (2), which is objectively the Deck's strongest card, especially while <span><strong><a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a></strong></span> is out, and also because it's the only Generic <strong>Fortune Lady </strong>monster, not requiring any other <strong>Fortune Lady </strong>cards to activate its effects. This takes a while at first and it will likely catch the opponent by surprise. The only Tuners in this deck are the <span><strong><a data-name=""Angraecum Umbrella"">Angraecum Umbrella</a>s</strong></span>. However, the useful part is that they have the same stats (ATK/ 500, DEF/1500) as the <strong>Charmers</strong>, so they can be easily summoned from the Hand/Deck/Graveyard by the effects of <strong><span><a data-name=""Unpossessed"">Unpossessed</a></span>, <span>T<a data-name=""eamwork of the Possessed"">eamwork of the Possessed</a></span></strong>, <span><strong>Familiar Possessed - Lyna</strong></span>, <span><strong><a data-name=""Eda the Sun Magician"">Eda the Sun Magician</a></strong></span>, and <strong><span>Awakening - Nefarious</span>. </strong>Not only that, but its own effect can allow you to bring one of your <strong>Familiar Possessed</strong> (Lv 4) monsters from the GY, allowing you to easily summon <strong>Fortune Lady Every. </strong>Since most decks run <span><em><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></em></span>, another way of summoning ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> involves getting out ⌈<span><strong><a data-name=""Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze"">Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze</a></strong><a data-name=""Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze""><span>⌋</span></a></span>. Since <span><em>Ash Blossom</em></span> is a (Lv 3, FIRE) Tuner, whenever your opponent uses <span><em>Ash Blossom</em></span>, try to prioritize getting out ⌈<span><strong>Hiita, Ablaze</strong><span>⌋</span></span> as quickly as possible. Then you can just summon any of the <strong>Familiar Possessed</strong> monsters to bring out ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span>. You can also use ⌈<span><strong>Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</strong><span>⌋ </span></span>to help bring back your Tuners, so you can summon the other Synchros, or even bring back ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> without having to banish. Actually, another sort of situational technique is using <strong><span><a data-name=""Spiritual Light Art - Miyabi"">Spiritual Light Art - Miyabi</a></span></strong>, tributing ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> to summon a Banished monster, and since ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> comes back, it's no real loss. You can make summoning ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> even easier by using <span><strong><a data-name=""DNA Surgery"">DNA Surgery</a></strong></span>. Then if you have <span><strong><a data-name=""Ranryu"">Ranryu</a></strong></span>, <span><strong><a data-name=""Inari Fire"">Inari Fire</a></strong></span>, <span><strong><a data-name=""Jigabyte"">Jigabyte</a></strong></span>, or <span><strong><a data-name=""Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness"">Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness</a></strong></span> (the <strong>Familiars</strong>) in your hand, while the Tuner is out, you can just Special Summon the <strong>Familiars</strong>, and since they'll automatically be Spellcasters, you can just as easily get out ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span>.  <span><strong>Alternate Strategy:</strong></span>  Another Synchro Monster to pay attention to is <span>⌈</span><span><strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian"">Datascape Fox - Xianxian</a></strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian""><span>⌋</span></a></span>. If you have 2 <strong>Charmers</strong> out along with <span><strong>Angraecum Umbrella</strong></span>, it's an easy Summon. It's not a Spellcaster, but it can be useful in conjunction with <span><strong><a data-name=""Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness"">Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness</a></strong></span> to keep banishing your opponents' cards without having to banish yours. Just tribute <span>⌈</span><span><strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian"">Datascape Fox - Xianxian</a></strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian""><span>⌋</span></a></span> to Summon <span><strong>Nefarious</strong> </span>from the GY. That way you can use <span><strong>Nefarious</strong></span> for another Synchro, Xyz, or Link summon. Then, before you end your turn, just bring <span>⌈</span><span><strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian"">Datascape Fox - Xianxian</a></strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian""><span>⌋</span></a></span> back from the GY with its effect. Then, even if you banish <span><strong>Nefarious</strong></span>, you can bring it back to the GY with <span>⌈</span><span><strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian"">Datascape Fox - Xianxian</a></strong><span><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian"">'s</a></span><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian""><span>⌋</span></a></span><span> other effect, making this, along with ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> both truly recyclable monsters.</span>  <span><strong>Other Useful Monsters:</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Blizzard Princess"">Blizzard Princess </a></strong><a data-name=""Blizzard Princess""><span>Due to its effect, it's a fairly easy monster to summon, considering the whole deck is Spellcasters, and it's also the strongest card in the Main Deck, so it's a plus to have either way.

Yes, this is a Burning Abyss deck, post-banlist.","  So, Konami put Tour Guide of the Underworld to 3, and Graff and Cir to 2 on the September 2020 TCG banlist. Since the two main characters of Devil May Cry are named ""Dante"" and ""Virgil"", I believe this is an appropriate name for a Burning Abyss deck.  And because I am a degenerate with no real concern for my opponent's enjoyment of the game, this deck uses 9 hand traps and Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon(Konami, PLEASE don't ban this card). My first turn-strategy would be to end on a board of Verte Anaconda, Dragoon, and Beatrice, which is a lot easier for Burning Abyss to do now that the deck is almost at full power.  &nbsp;  Personally, in my duels with this deck, I've done better going first. Maybe you'll have different experiences than me and do better going second."

This deck isn't for the faint of heart Monarchs have always lacked consistency but Pantheism at 3 gives bo,"I have always been a nostalgic person and I have always played monarch decks since I returned to Yu-gi-oh one year ago. I loved monarchs because it revolved around one of the oldest yugioh mechanics always excited me. I have only recently started back playing Yu-gi-oh but I have never been a fan of the tier-0 meta decks and I would only suggest this deck for those who like to win in style. There are several variants of this deck profile, but this version gives the greatest consistency with more than enough firepower to decimate your opponents. in an environment where you are likely to be blown up in an FTK or confront an unbreakable board in your first turn the ability to disrupt your opponents flow is critical that is what this deck focuses on. Be warned however- your success with this deck relies heavily on your knowledge of your opponents likely moves but picking the right time to intervene can completely disrupt their flow and give you an avenue to take complete control of the game from that point on. Your psyframes are your first line of attack disrupting their pesky cards- if you are lucky: you may have your field card in play to synchro summon into a boss monster - I personally prefer Omega and Draco however there are a quite a number of useful options the real beauty begins however if you have Ehther in your graveard or were able to set escalation- after tribute summoning Ehther and loading your graveyard with dynamite for your turn you can escalate into Erebus or my favorite Zaborg unleashing your extra deck unto the field. Elder Entity N'Tiss, zeta and omega are often my go to targets but the possibilities are endless. At the end you are left with a clear field to start the process all over again should they dare to play on their turn.  Monarchs are back... its time to take your throne."

The goal is to use the Thunder Dragon cards to break boards, gain advantage, play through handtraps, and summon out a Thunder Dragon Titan. The Predaplants are to search out fusion spells and get a plant on board for Crossrose Dragon. Titan gains advantage when protecting itself from Black Rose Dragon on the opponent's turn, and hopefully get a large amount of advantage from the board wipe. The artifact engine is to use any extra bodies to search Artifact Scythe, who can be popped by either Titan or Black Rose to lock the opponent out of the extra deck."
