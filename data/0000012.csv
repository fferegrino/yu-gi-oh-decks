After that, if Absolute Zero is killed it blows up your opponents monsters and if Nova Master  is attacked, send Honesty Neos to the GY to boost him to 5100 ATK (beating Utopia the Lightning if you activate it before the battle phase) and then you can draw a card.  If the facedown is a Change spell, you can also change Absolute Zero into Acid and wipe out your opponents board (It feels good)  Thats just one of many strategies. For draw power you've got Nova Master, Divine Wind, Legacy of a Hero &amp; Supply Squad. Its a fun deck, feel free to make any changes and have fun with it."

Monsters: <a data-name=""Night Express Knight"">Express Knight</a> &amp; Derricrane are your main combo pieces with Ruffian Railcar helping to support that combo.

Exodius is cool for recycling &amp; Cyber End Dragon for another level 10(can't forget Maxx C).  Spells: Switchyard is the field spell we need, you can special summon Ruffian off its 1st effect &amp; it changes to a level 10, but you can't deal battle damage to your opponent when you do so. The 2nd effect is what we want, you can pitch a card to the grave &amp; add one of your level 10 trains to your hand. Running 3 Terraforming is essential &amp; scapegoats for links. Now for the on-of list, most are self-explanatory. Raigeki, Kaiju Slumber, Upstart, soul charge, Limiter Removal for otk &amp; Foolish Burial for pitching Ruffian. Also running Skill Drain.  For the extra deck, you mostly go into Super Dora &amp; sometimes Gustav Max for burn. Skypalace is pretty situational. Galaxy Destroyer is hilarious if you get his effect off &amp; for wiping the back row &amp; popping pendulum scales. Number 35 &amp; 84 work great together&amp; we finish off with our Link monsters."

Sadly, <strong>El Shaddoll Construct</strong> is banned, so this is the best build in order to go around it, <em>in my opinion</em>. With this deck, there are multiple extra tech's that can help you out when things aren't going your way and your monsters are being destroyed quickly.</div></blockquote> The purpose of this deck is primarily to beat down your opponent so you can win with the powerful <em>Shaddoll's</em> and the multitude of <em>Synchro</em>/<em>XYZ</em> Monsters in the extra deck. All these can give you an out to many decks you may face.  The <em>Lightsworn </em>Monsters exist from the old deck in which I ran <strong>El Shaddoll Construct</strong>, but since its ban, I decided to add in<strong> Sephylon, The Ultimate Timelord </strong>to the mix. I know, replacing an Extra Deck Monster with a Main Deck Monster seems dumb, but listen on.  <strong>Sephylon</strong> needs to be special summoned from your hand by having 10 or more monsters in the Graveyard. Now luckily, <em>Shaddoll's</em> have a useful effect when sent to the Graveyard by card effects, so that helps us with him. In addition to that, the <em>Lightsworn's</em> <strong>Raiden</strong> &amp; <strong>Lyla</strong> &amp; the Spell Card <strong>Charge of the Light Brigade</strong> add some more spiciness to this deck because <strong>Raiden</strong> can help to get monsters in the Graveyard AND activate effects of the <em>Shaddoll's</em> if they get discarded this way, and <strong>Lyla</strong> can destroy Spells/Traps that the opponent has either face-down or activated (such as continuous spells/traps or field spells), then she sends more Monsters from the deck to the grave once the turn has ended, hopefully spitting out more <em>Shaddoll's</em>.  When the Lightsworn's send Monsters to the Graveyard, a mix of Light &amp; Dark Monsters may lay there, so, the BLS - EotB and the Chaos Sorcerer are there in order to benefit from these. They both have effects to just straight up destroy other Monsters, and they're tough to get by.  I've added <strong>Rainbow Kuriboh</strong> to stop your Opponent's Monsters from attacking, along with <strong>Vanity's Fiend</strong>, since <strong>Vanity's Emptiness</strong> is banned. These aren't only extra Monsters for<strong> Sephylon</strong>, but also extra Light &amp; Dark's for <strong>BLS</strong> &amp; <strong>Chaos Sorcerer</strong>."

It uses the Draco engine and metalfoes for support to pendulum summon the draco's or fuse them to provide support or small draw power. Metalfoes Mythriel is your ace fusion as it helps you recycle your metalfoes in the deck and uses you the opportunity to return a troublesome monster card back to the hand or extra deck. Other fusions are there for support and different options. A variety of different Xyz to help balance the extra deck and to use in sticky situations.  Ash Blossom can be used to stop the drawing of cards which could bring a problem going into other meta decks that use a lot of draw power. Metalfoes fusion stays at 2 just in case it gets banished and it can recycle itself for a draw so its never a bad choice. This deck has been used against all aspects of non-link meta and has done very well against them all. (Link will be added later on to update deck use)

When you have a good hand, this deck is capable of bringing out cosmic blazar dragon, in the only condition that you know synchro monsters very well and do know how to use a synchro deck. If cosmic blazar is not possible, always try to bring out crystal wing, clear wing, or shooting star. A few tips: 1. cosmic blazar is impossible to summon if there are no level eaters in the graveyard. 2: Stardust dragon is very weak by itself, so always use it to bring out shooting star. 3: Synchro is history. So don't be surprised if a meta deck beat you easily."
