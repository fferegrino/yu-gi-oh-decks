I think the decks biggest enemy is something like altergiest, as they have lots of ways to get the other cards out, and then put alot of negates on the board. ive played around altergiest only once, but it was a best of three match so i lost.... but this deck still puts up a fight.  iguess you should really consider this deck  charmer fur hire melffys deck, cause it runs more fur hire cards then it does shaddolls. i run fur hire mainly because most of the monsters have the attributes that are used by the spirit charmers (earth, wind, water, and fire). they do have really cool effects though, all of thm can ss anther one during your main phase. it helps to get more peeps on the board to link away for anything really.  i didn't add the side deck in, but you should put cards like ash and nib to help u out when you face something that gives the deck a real problem (a.k.a altergiest)  anyway though, have fun with it!"

However, you can replace one of the high level monster and run 1 copy of Desperado Barrel Dragon or run both them (the old and the new Barrel Dragon).  <strong>3 -</strong> I added 8 normal monsters and 8 effect monsters. Most of them are DARK machines because the Spider needs dark machine monster to activate it's effect. However, I thought it would be unfair to leave Robotic Knight, Bugroth and Guardian of the Throne out of this deck. They deserve a spot. Every single normal monster is an old school one. Bandit Keith didn't use a lot of effect monsters (if I'm not mistaken he used Barrel Dragon, Blast Sphere and Machine King, but that's it), so I added some.  <strong>4 - </strong>3 high level monster are classic ones (Pendulum Machine, Barrel Dragon and Machine King) Keith used in the anime. The other 3 monster I thought they'd fit the theme of this deck, since they're dark machine monsters, and one of them has an effect that is about tossing a coin. You can use Launcher Spider and/Slot Machine and replace the Pendulum Machine and/or other non classic monster if you want to.  <strong>5 - </strong>Spell and Traps are cards keith used in the anime. I'm not running 3 copies of 7 completed because I think it'd be too much. As you can see I tried to remain loyal to our machine theme here.  I hope you all enjoy this deck. It's not OP, but it has some power. I love these decks that use old and new cards together."

One of the best rogue contenders this format due to it's ability to play a lot of board breaking cards, as well as being able to play the arguably the best hand trap against the current meta without being hindered by it at all, in fact it benefits massively from it (read on if you have guessed what the card is).  There are ultimately 2 win conditions that the deck has. The first is simply banish enough cards and summon Gren Maju to swing for massive damage and the game. With cards like Gizmek, Golden Castle, Pot Of Desires and Eater Of Millions being such amazing mass banishing cards this is a fairly acheivable goal.  &nbsp;  The second win condition relies on being able to use the Rank 8 package as well as the board breaking cards to either force a win via Draglubion/Numeron Dragon, or put them in a position that they cannot claw back due to the immense resources they have exhausted. The main deck features 11 Level 8's (and 1 in the extra) to achieve this goal. The Danger package acts as a triple threat. They can act as big beatsticks, removal cards and pseudo draw cards. Hex Trude acts a beatstick and a removal card and Gizmek acts as a deck thinner, Gren Maju feeder and removal card all in 1. Combine the 11 main deck level 8's with Glife, Golden Castle and Pot of desires you effectively have half a deck of level 8's.  The hand traps are easy to explain. Ash is there as it's a generic hand trap that can hit anything I wish, and is particularly useful when preventing Eldlich from hitting field via Sanguine. Nibiru is there because combo decks such as Dragon Link and Tri-brigade have really cone back into being  with the banning of Calamaties. And finally Dimension Shifter..... If you're deck isn't particularly graveyard centric or benefits from banishing, you play this card. See how quick this stops the meta dead. Literally a game ender in it's own right.  &nbsp;  The remainder of the cards are simple. Raigeki is there to push through Tri-Brigade and Dino's (most players summon Dolka over Laggia due to 2 monster negates being arguably more effective on the current format) without sacrificing the OTK if using Dark Ruler and cards with Forbidden Droplets. It's also fairly useful against Zoodiac Drident, AA Sky Zeus e.t.c. Harpie's Feather Duster to blowout control decks, Super Poly is just nuts thus format and reborn to bring back whatever you want.  The extra deck consists of super poly targets, N'tiss because Dogmatika is still a thing, Rank 8 package of Dingirsu for non targeting removal, recovering a banished Gizmek and field protection. Sanaphond stops graveyard centric decks from special summoning from the grave snd Dragubilon, Numeron Dragon and Hope Harbinger for the OTK. AA Zeus is there if you cannot quite OTK and need something to disrupt an opponents attempt to fight back. A simple Knightmare package and BLS round off the extra deck nicely.  &nbsp;  Side deck. Phantazamay is there for Tri-Brigade/Dragon link, as i really do want to see my board breaker cards against these decks and Phantazamay by drawing extra cards and targeting protection too. Lightning Storm effectively acts as an extra 3 copies of Raigeki/Haripe's. The traps consist mainly of floodgates. TCBOO to really cripple predominantley monotype decks, Imperial Order to prevent Invoked/Shaddoll packages and also preventing floodgate removal via Twisters or Cyclone. Macros Cosmos banishes everything, so is highly effective against combo and control decks such as Eldlich alike. Dimension Ground is an additional nasty against combo as is not as vulnerable to S/T removal as TCBOO. Red Reboot to shutdown control decks for either an OTK or mass trap blowout.  Feel free to rate/comment.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Cyberdark cannon can help search for the cards that are needed to summon cyberdark dragon and cyber emergency/repair plant can be a staple in searching for cyber dragons to get to Cyber End Dragon. Be careful of using your spell cards a lot because Cyber Dragon Zwei needs a spell card to be shown to your opponent in order for its name to be Cyber Dragon. Cyber Network is another good card to search the deck for Cyber Dragons and eventually Cyber End Dragon. The available fusions cards are the newly released Greater Polymerization in which allows the fused monster to deal piercing damage but it can save the monster from being destroyed by card effects. Another powerful fusion card is power bond in which can boost Cyberdark End Dragons attack points to a whopping 10k.

SS are not a super competitive archetype, but are they fun? HELL YEAH!","This version mostly tries to stick to just SS with a few tech cards, such as the Kaijus to work with battleball. I run 5 of them as there isn't really a coherent way to get them into your hand, except by drawing them. The deck does lack some drawpower, so if that's your idea, maybe try the SS pendulum who lets you draw by tributting itself, or a geargia engine (3x Geargiauger 1x Geargiaccelator) that helps turbo into Gear Gigant X more often for consistency and good search (i say maybe cut 3 magnet and 1 soulfiresuit). I was thinking of adding 1 geargiano to allow X to get off his final effect (trust me, he's never around for long), but maybe that's a bit too much deviation from the deck's playstyle. I do like my protection, so that's why i play 2 flutist and 3 soulfiresuit. You ALWAYS want a soulfiresuit in hand to protect yo shit! Gotta sit on that thicc booty. Most of the time, big benki is only summoned out from the grave via scarecrow, or flutist if you're in that situation so i run just the 1 of him. I do like the 1 fist as it gives you a constant tuner that can keep coming back, granted you've protected your synchros, but it's only a once per turn, hence the 1 copy. Also, 3 scarecrows are a must imo, as there are many times when I've almost gone through all 3 in a duel, he never stays around that long either. Him and soulpiercer are the bets wombo combo starter in the deck, so u gota get the most out of em.  Any tips or advice on how to improve the deck further is always appreciated.

The Artifacts are actually an archetype and not JUST an engine? Impossible!!,"So, this is another non-meta fave of mine. It's good if you want to play a deck with unique mechanic and give your opponent a chance to play the game, then you both can have some fun. Shock horror, I know.  But aside from that jest, the deck itself is fairly decent. It can brick sometimes and the archetype itself does need more support, but the way it works right now seems fairly solid. Moraltech and Sythe are fairly self explanatory. I play the 1 Beagalltach to act as the 4th Vajra, and the main way your gonna get some solid recursion from the grave is with Failnaught and BTTF, which also pairs well with Trap Trick. I then play the Achilleshield and Aegis to protect yo shit when u summon em during ur oppenents turn. They aren't that beefy so u gotta protec those dudes somehow. I originally was playing an extra Achille, but had to cut it and an MST for 2 BTTF for the more late game plays. Speaking of MST, they act as your extra 2 copies of ignition. The deck needs more ways to pop off and trigger itself (a field spell pls Konami) as otherwise...you're pretty fucked. Aside from that, Breakthrough skill is a poor mans infinite impedance and BTTF I've already mentioned. Track trick just helps with consistency and getting a 1st turn sanctum and then go off.  To help with the deck, I recommend an engine that uses a strong normal summon, as you don't really use that at all during your turn. For draw power, you could use a spellbook one, but I prefer to be able to go into the Artifact Link monster, Dagda first turn. It helps u get the artifacts u need during ur opponents turn and revive a fallen one when it dies (which it probably will with that weak ass attack). Ideally the scrap engine is much better giving access to synchros and more cool combos with accesscode talker, but as scrap raptor does not exist in the tcg and trickstars are kinda dead right now with their field spell at 1, the next best thing is Evil eye. It works quite similar to the previous 2 engines and does help mill itself out of the deck with Basilius sending it's own field spell, so once you've used it, you're not running the risk of drawing them later which is kinda neat. Wish the field spell was as good as the Trickstar one, being able to lock down pesky traps/spells is always nice. Try experimenting with different engines and see what happens tho,  Welp, there u have it. My pure Artifact deck. As always, any feedback or tips you guys have is always appreciated. But I gotta dash, hope you guys enjoyed."

barrier (lv 4). normal summon revealer first and special summon speaker then activate revealer effect discard 1 card special summon defender of the ice barrier (lv 3) then synchro summon using those three to summon trishula, zero dragon of the ice barrier(lv 11). if you got the first turn then synchro summon white aura dolphine (lv 6) instead using revealer of the ice barrier (lv 4) to special summon cryomancer of the ice barrier(lv 2) or normal summon cryomancer then special summon speaker. white aura dolphine (lv 6) when destroyed and sent to graveyard can special summon itself from graveyard by banishing 1 water monster then this card is treated as a tuner so you can just normal summon lv 2, or lv 4 monster then synchro summon both of it to summon your  white aura whale (lv 8), or white aura bihamut (lv 10). there is a bunch of lv 5 or higher monster support monster in this deck the best way to summon them is  using zuijin of the ice barrier, normal summon zuijin then activate its effect tribute zuijin to special summon lv 5 or higher mosnter from your hand the best target would be general grunard of the ice barrier (lv 8) because it effect allow you to normal summon 1 card per turn (in addition of your normal summon) so you can normal summon more card to synchro summon your extra deck. next best target to special summon is general gantala of the ice barrier (lv 7) you can use its effect to special summon monster card from your graveyard allowing you to recycle your card which mean more synchro. for recycling card from your graveyard you can use effect of prior of the ice barrier to tribute it self to special summon card from your graveyard. you can special summon prior of the ice barrier if you control another ice barrier card on the field but do not do it because if prior special summoned this way you cant special summon lv 5 or higher monster for the rest of the turn which mean limiting your self. this deck dependencies on sychro summon is massive so there is bunch off support card included on this deck. you can use magic triangle of the ice barrier to special summon card from your hand. medallion of the ice barrier, wind over the ice barrier or moray of greed to search card from your deck to either special summon it, add a card to your hand or draw more card. last you can use freezing chains of the ice barrier, monster reborn or torrential reborn for recycling your card. you can use general wayne of the ice barrier (lv 5) to search spell or trap card you needed using its effect to special summon it self it you control another ice barrier card on the field then add 1 spell or trap card from your deck to your hand (you can also activated this effect by normal summoning it) . for extra deck card there is two type of card to use depending on situation for support glacial beast iceberg narwhal (lv 7) can negate trap card effect during battle phase, number 37: hope woven dragon spider shark (rk 4) and white aura dolphine (lv 6) can reduce enemy monster attack point, brionac, dragon of the ice barrier or gungnir, dragon of the ice barrier to either return card from your opponent field to hand or destroy them, or you can just use your low level monster to synchro tatsunoko (lv 3) to sychro summon monster using this card as a tuner and 1 monster in your hand as material. you can only use cryomancer of the ice barrier (lv 2) and ice barrier token generated by banishing speaker of the ice barrier (lv 4) in your graveyard. with this combo depending on lv material in you hand you can synchro summon lv  7, lv 8,or lv 10 monster from your extra deck. as an addition there if few beatdown stick card if you want to aim for otk like sea dragon lord gishilnodon (lv 5) atk 2300 (can up to 3000),  white aura whale (lv 8) atk 2800 can attack twice per turn dealing piercing damage, white aura bihamut (lv 10) atk 3300 can generate 1 divine dragon token (lv 10) atk 3300, or trishula, dragon of ice imprisonment (lv 9) atk 2700 you can special summon it from your extra deck by banishing 3 monster with different name (any level or type) this desk main weakness is vulnerable to enemy disruption and backrow card there is a few support card to help alleviate this weakness such as medium of the ice barrier (lv 7) limiting enemy to 1 spell/trap card per turn, general raiho of the ice barrier (lv 6) make enemy discard 1 card to activate effect monster otherwise the effect is negated, daisojo of the ice barrier (lv 6) proctect your monster from backrow , dance princess of the ice barrier (lv 4)

The ideal hand is as follows: <ul>  	<li>Opening of the Spirit Gates</li>  	<li>Dark Beckoning Beast</li>  	<li>Dark Summoning Beast</li>  	<li>Chaos Summoning Beast</li>  	<li>Awakening of the Sacred Beasts</li> </ul> First, activate Opening of the Spirit Gates to search for one of the Sacred Beasts (I suggest Raviel since it requires 3 fiend type monsters which is more restrictive than the other two).  Next, summon Dark Beckoning Beast to the field and activate its effect to search for one out of the two remaining sacred beasts (from this point I would suggest hamon since Uria needs continuous trap cards in the graveyard to determine its attack points). After that, use Dark Beckoning Beast other special ability to make an additional summon and tribute Beckoning for Dark Summoning Beast. Now, use Dark Summoning Beasts special ability to tribute itself and summon Raviel to the field. From the graveyard, activate Summoning Beasts ability to banish itself and add the last sacred beast.  Since you have Raviel on the field, which is a lv 10 monster, activate Spirit Gates other affect to search your deck for a continuous spell card (suggest: add Temple of the Kings to your hand in order to activate Awakening of the Sacred Beast the same turn). Next activate Spirit Gates final effect to discard Chaos Summoning Beast to the graveyard in order to summon Dark Summoning Beast from the graveyard. Activate Summoning Beasts special ability from the graveyard to add Fallen Paradise to your hand and activate its effect right away to draw two new cards. Use Dark Summoning Beast effect again to summon Hamon.  From then on, you should have the cards to summon Armityle the Chaos Phantasm and win the duel."

The Rokket package is also in theory the same as opening Regulator, but locks you out of the strongest end board the deck consistently has, but should be more then enough to shut down rough and low tier decks. This list can be trimmed back slightly to have more hand traps, or other potential starters or extenders.  &nbsp;  The 1 card full combo is simply Time Thief Regulator. Summon Regulator, using its effect to summon Winder, and Adjuster, sending Bezel Ship and adding Retrograde from deck. Making Force Strix, adding the copy of Singing Lanius, and reviving a copy of Bezel Ship from grave by detaching the other material from Force Strix. Making Wise Strix and summoning a copy of Raider's Wings from deck, then using the Bezel Ship and Raider's Wings to make the second copy of Force Strix, detaching to add Strangle Lanius from deck to hand, and causing Wise Strix to set a copy of Rank-up Shave Force from the deck, then using that Rank-up to revive the first copy of Force Strix, then stacking Cyber Dragon Infinity from your extra deck. Using the second copy of Force Strix and the Wise Strix, make Rusty Bardiche, using Rusty's effect to send a copy of Ancient Cloak to grave to set a copy of Shade Brigandine from deck. By banishing Ancient Cloak, add a copy of Silent Boots from deck to hand, giving you hand of Strangle Lanius and Silent Boots. Summon the copy of Strangle Lanius from your hand, locking you into DARK monsters. Use Strangle Lanius effect to revive the Singing Lanuis from the grave, then summon Time Thief Redoer. Revive the Raider's Wings from the grave by detaching a materiel from Redoer, then flip the Shade Brigandine, summoning it as a level 4 monster. Using the Shade Brigandine and the Raider's Wings to summon Time Thief Perpetua, and activating it's effect to attach a copy of Time Thief Chronocorder to the Redoer. Activate Redoer, detaching Chronocorder specifically, then reviving Chronocorder by it's own effect. Special summon the Silent Boots from your hand, then link off the Boots and Chronocorder into I:P Masquerena. banish the Boots from your grave, adding a Fog Blade or Phantom Knights Claw from your deck, and set it along with the Time Thief Retrograde. End the turn, returning the Redoer. During the opponents standby phase, attach the top card of the opponent's deck, then attach a copy of Time Thief Flyback to Redoer as well. As well, activating Perpetua's revive effect by detaching Raider's Wings to summon the Winder, and activate its effect, adding a copy of any Time Thief card from deck to hand.  &nbsp;  this combo ends on a +8, with a omni-negate from Infinity, a quick effect non-targeting spin to the top of the deck, as well as a spin from the Knightmare Unicorn that can be made with the I:P Masquerane, a spell/trap negate, that attaches the spell/trap negated to a Time Thief xyz, a monster negate, and a D.D.

Luego de eso, dependiendo de cuántos tengamos, nos decantaremos por una de las 3 posibles rutas (explicadas en el video).  <strong>Extenders para iniciar el combo:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Tour guide from the underworld:</strong> Vale x3. Trae al campo a Graff o al Edge imp (el otro lo envías al cementerio usando a Cherubini). En todo caso, es el mejor normal summon del deck.</li>  	<li><strong>Fiendish rhino warrior:</strong> Vale x2. Envía al cementerio el mismo target que la Tour guide, aunque no aprovecha el cuerpo extra. Necesita otro extender sí o sí.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk forward:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial desde la mano si no controlas monstruos, por lo que si lo robas, debe ser el primero en invocarse.</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha knight:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial cuando invocas otro monstruo de nivel 3 de modo normal. Ojo que puede perder timing.</li>  	<li><strong>Psychic wheeleder:</strong> Se invoca si ya tienes otro monstruo de nivel 3, aunque sólo es una vez por turno.</li>  	<li><strong>Psychic tracker:</strong> Igual que el anterior.</li>  	<li><strong>Gilasaurus:</strong> Se invoca casi gratuitamente. Ojo que el rival puede invocar algo del cementerio, aunque usualmente eso no es un problema.</li>  	<li><strong>Fossil dig:</strong> Trae al Gilasaurus.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish burial:</strong> Puedes enviar a Cloak para robar a Boots o Brigandine, o en su defecto enviar uno de los targets de la Tour guide.</li>  	<li><strong>Emergency teleport:</strong> Trae a uno de los Psychic gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Monster reborn:</strong> Extender por excelencia. Trae de vuelta algo que ya hayas usado.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck extremadamente consistente, tiene pocos bricks y/o garnets.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Se adapta a los recursos que tengamos en mano.</li>  	<li>Protegido constantemente por Apollousa, por lo que es difícil de contrarrestarlo una vez toca el campo.</li>  	<li>El Deck usa burn infinito, por lo que no importa cuántos LP tenga el oponente.</li>  	<li>No requiere demasiados recursos para realizar el combo, con 2 es suficiente para iniciar.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps tempranas con los extenders suficientes.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Aunque el burn es infinito, cartas como Ghost Sister que aumentan constantemente los LP arruinarán la estrategia.</li>  	<li>Aún teniendo protección, el Deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Impermanence y Called by the grave si son usados correctamente.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, si robamos 3 garnets, será gg.</li>  	<li>Si destruyen a Cherubini antes de activar su efecto y no hay forma de invocarlo del cementerio, también es gg.</li> </ul>"

Also you can use DDL  and the Spells to search for Zhang Yuan or Zhang De if you have Ancient Warriors on the fiel. Guan Yun combined with Liu Xuang is a good start to fill your field with at least 3 monster with 3000+. Remember to put the Ancient Warriors S/T always, you need them to trigger some effects. Tri-Brigade are here to help on putting more cards on hand, especially if you didn't get the better hand. Also, Omen can swipe for 3000 which is always good.  I'm still figuring out how to draw and search for more cards. The biggest problem of Ancient Warrior is you can get your hands tied very often, so run 2 Reload and 2 Avarice, which proved to be very useful on my tests, however idk if they are the best strategy to keep my hand full or search for something when a strategy go wrong.  Ghost Ogre and Gnomaterial (not sure if i'll keep this one) are good, as you need to stop your opponent to summon powerful monsters because of Lu Feng negative effect. Tenki is very helpful if you need to search not only Ancients, but Tri-Brigade too, not so sure about Tensu.  I'm still thinking about the Extra, besides Blosson, Omen and DDL, the others were not very useful. The Side Deck is also a work in progress."

Hand trap suite looks kind of weird but I don't really know a better way to split them. Ash is great but can clog your own plays, Lancea is great vs meta and also pitches to Herald. Could maybe cut Strike for more of these but Strike is really good when you have to actually play yugioh with your opponent.

They can Synchro Summon monsters such as Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon to lock down the opponent's field or help Summon stronger monsters and set up a Fusion Summon for a finishing move. ""The White Stone of Legend"" needs another effect to discard it and be able to use its Graveyard effect. Whereas both the Monster cards ""Master"" and ""Sage with Eyes of Blue"" have effects to Special Summon any ""Blue-Eyes"" Monster from the Main Deck by either ""Shuffles itself from the Graveyard to the Main Deck"" ('Spinning to Deck' for short) or Discards itself.  ""Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon"" can also can Tribute itself to Special Summon any LIGHT Dragon-type Synchro monster from your extra deck. ""Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon"" is a Fusion Monster that does not need a ""Polymerization""-like card to be Fusion Summoned. It cannot be destroyed by battle, can attack monsters twice during the Battle Phase and banishes any monster that it failed to destroy by battle.""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"" is a Ritual Monster that cannot be targeted or destroyed by card effects and can wipe out your opponent in a single display of doubled-piercing chaotic white lightning."

As you would expect, this heavily abuses Crystron Halqifibrax + Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon combos and can pretty reliably rip 3-5 cards out of the opponent's hand, even with negates at play. I think this deck is at least a rogue-tier strategy.  The main thing that makes this deck tick is Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince, as it sends Atlantean Dragoons for cost and thus isn't the type of thing someone wants to hand trap. You can get so much mileage off of that thing, it's insane. If you bring it out with Deep Sea Diva or One for One you're getting a full combo almost every time.  Your general opening will be Diva -&gt; Neptabyss, then climbing into Halq (bringing out Deskbot 001) and Auroradon, then using 001 + the tokens to bring out a Herald of the Arc Light. You can then destroy the remaining 2 tokens for Coltwing to bring out 2 more and revive 001, use that for a second Herald, then use both Heralds to go into Dugares. Detaching 2 Heralds and getting the draws with Dugares is a very big plus and you can often get significant mileage from it. You can alternatively run something like Nyarla or Daigusto Emeral with this, but I've found Dugares to be the most consistently good one.  Unlike quite a few Gishki builds I've seen, I think Deskbot 003 is detrimental to the deck. It's incredibly easy to hand trap and doesn't synergize with the deck's goals outside of going into Halq combos. It's a good engine card at a glance but it requires the opponent to just let you proc it and we all know that's not going to happen, and that can be the end of the turn right there. By cutting it out you're increasing the consistency by dedicating your normal summon to Diva or Neptabyss, both of which you're near-guaranteed to see thanks to all the search/draw options (Dragoons + Minstrel, Deep Sea Dria, One for One, Dugares draws, Talents draws). I also like not having to use two 001s, which the 003 combo really likes, which decreases consistency further...it's just a mess. If you want to run it though, cut out the Talents and Upstart and you can see what I mean in practice.  Anyway, onto the card reviews themselves.  <strong>Monsters (24):</strong> <ul>  	<li>1x Lapis Dragon <ul>  	<li>Great card to search off Dragoons to use as a combo piece. I like to do this with Minstrel + Dragoons since it's often a free Halq combo, but you can do it off the Neptabyss route if you really want to. If you get it in your opening hand it kinda sucks though.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Atlantean Dragoons <ul>  	<li>Broken. If you drop this with Neptabyss or Minstrel you're able to get virtually anything you want in the deck: Gishki Shadow/Vision for a ritual search, Minstrel, Diva, all of these are ways to get balls-deep into that hand loop. You're free to run 2 if you're afraid of bricking, but you're often selling yourself short and losing out on a few routes.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing <ul>  	<li>Summon it with Auroradon to go + one million, you get the idea. The destruction effect is nice if you're going second too, I guess, but you're playing it for the opening combo. It's a really fun card!</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Gishki Shadow <ul>  	<li>This is your Aquamirror searcher, and sometimes a way to guarantee the final hand rip if you're short of cards. Also, this can trigger Deep Sea Aria after use, which is super helpful. If you're in a really tight spot for whatever reason, you can also use it as a Dugares material. Don't actually do that, though.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Deep Sea Minstrel <ul>  	<li>I was running this at 1 until I started field testing this deck and man oh man is this card stupid. It's a perfect way to trigger the Dragoons in your hand while collecting data and helping secure your hand loop for the turn. It's just flat out insane and not maxing out will really hurt you in the long run. She also triggers Deep Sea Aria after use which is nice. I never find myself using her second effect though, it just kinda sucks?</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Gishki Vision <ul>  	<li>Gishki Shadow but it can be summoned with Deep Sea Diva for a Herald summon. Nifty little tech if you get Neptabyss out without her help.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Deep Sea Diva <ul>  	<li>Using this to get out Neptabyss is your full Halqifibrax combo, and as such, you should never run less than 3. The heart and soul of this deck's combo starting antics.</li>  	<li>Here is a good one card + <strong>junk</strong> opening from Diva you can use to start your combo routes; <ul>  	<li>NS Diva -&gt; SS Neptabyss -&gt; Neptabyss eff, pitch Dragoons -&gt; Add Dragoons, GY Dragoons eff, search Deep Sea Minstrel -&gt; Use Deep Sea Minstrel's effect to pitch Dragoons and rip out a card, proc Dragoons to search Gishki Vision -&gt; Link Neptabyss and Diva for Halq -&gt; SS Deskbot 001 -&gt; Climb into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens, trigger 001 in GY -&gt; Synchro 001 + token for Herald -&gt; Auroradon 2nd eff, destroy 2 tokens, summon Coltwing -&gt; Coltwing eff, summon 2 tokens, trigger GY 001 -&gt; Synchro 001 + token for Herald -&gt; Xyz both Heralds for Dugares -&gt; Dugares 1st eff, draw 2 discard 1, detach both Heralds, discard <strong>junk</strong> -&gt; trigger both Heralds, search Gustkraken + Aquamirror -&gt; pitch Vision from earlier for another Gustkraken -&gt; Summon your first.</li>  	<li>From here, continue your plays utilizing your Dugares draws and other parts of your starting hand.</li>  	<li>You have the option of stopping at Halq to go into Desert Locusts on the opponent's turn if you have enough to go into a 4-card hand loop. This can be further extended into going into Baroness de Fleur, Borreload Savage Dragon, or PSY-Framelord Omega depending on the materials you have on your board. Absolutely experiment with this, it's a very good route. The first sign you should try this route is if you have a One for One in hand since Neptabyss is largely what enables the route.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince <ul>  	<li>Ballbustingly good card, pitching Atlantean Dragoons for cost to trigger its effect while searching you another. This is a one-card way to trigger Minstrel while activating the Dragoons you searched, which leads to a +1 in card advantage overall. This doesn't interrupt your combo plays at all and you should never skip out on it.  If you don't have Diva, normal summon this and you won't be too impeded.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Deskbot 001 <ul>  	<li>For Halq and nothing else. Pray you don't draw it.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Evigishki Gustkraken <ul>  	<li>Literally a safer Topologic Gumblar Dragon.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>Spells (16):</strong> <ul>  	<li>1x One for One <ul>  	<li>Summons Neptabyss from the deck for what's basically free, giving you a possible route of fetching Deep Sea Diva w/Aria to go into more lengthy combos. You can also summon Deskbot 001 if you're on shrooms or something I guess.</li>  	<li>Including Beautunaful Princess + Gishki Abyss can make this a free search but it kinda sucks honestly, I wouldn't go for it these days but the option is there.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Three Tactical Talents <ul>  	<li>Great contingency plan against hand traps since they're absolutely going to negate your stuff. This'll normally be Diva. Collect your Draw 2 if you want to continue popping off, but the hand rip is also an acceptable option if you think the negate is going to stop the full combo. Look at what backup combo pieces you have before making the decision.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Extra-Foolish Burial <ul>  	<li>I'd run more but drawing 2+ of these fucking sucks, man. This is a hand loop deck so you really want to max out on the non-HOPT cards unless they're absolutely necessary, which this isn't. Anyway, pitch Herald and call it a day.</li>  	<li>If you're going to run 3, cut Photomirror and Upstart Goblin.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Upstart Goblin <ul>  	<li> 39 Card Deck, yup.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Deep Sea Aria <ul>  	<li>Effortless to proc since you're burying those Gishki Shadows and Visions like your life depends on it. You can also banish one of the Dragoons. This searches you more Gishki Shadows and Visions to continue the hand loop, which is insanely useful.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Preparation of Rites <ul>  	<li>With this, you can make an excuse to cut a Vision, since this'll be grabbing you Gustkraken while getting an Aquamirror back. This is basically Pot of Greed and it's not even OPT for some reason. God, why is that a thing?</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Gishki Photomirror <ul>  	<li>There'll be times where you're a material short when trying to release the Kraken, which this remedies. Plus, if you have a Preparation of Rites in hand after using this, that becomes a ""one-card"" Gustkraken without having to tribute the one you previously summoned. Thus, that gives you a Rank 6. I don't see many people running this, so maybe I'm using this for the wrong reasons. Very cuttable, I just like the flexibility.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Gishki Aquamirror <ul>  	<li>The main spell you're using to loop Gustkraken, don't think I need to explain that.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>Extra (15):</strong> <ul>  	<li>1x Baroness de Fleur (or Geomathmech Final Sigma) <ul>  	<li>You can bring this out with Diva + 2 L4s, Desert Locusts + 1 L4 or something, which is a free negate on the board for your torn-up opponent to get through. This often secures the win unless they got something real special. If using Geomathmech you can get that more easily with Desert Locusts + Gustkraken.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Borreload Savage Dragon <ul>  	<li>Good card to use after a Halq combo; again, this normally secures a win because of the negate.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x PSY-Framelord Omega <ul>  	<li>Another way to secure a hand loop at the end of a turn, can be summoned with Desert Locusts + an L2 as well, which few decks can pull off. If you're not able to hand loop for more than 3, try going for a Locusts + L2 play with this!</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Herald of the Arc Light <ul>  	<li>Your searchers and a funny negate + pseudo-vanitys if you can keep one on deck. Never run less than 3.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Constellar Ptolemy M7 <ul>  	<li>Straight from the 2013 build baby, this card still has it. Use this to get your Shadow back from the grave after proccing Aquamirror to continue the Gustkraken loop.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Virtual World Phoenix - Fanfan <ul>  	<li>You can also run Photon Strike Bounzer, but this deck is very weak going second and this has helped a lot in that regard. Detaches two Gustkrakens to banish a card from their hand and GY, which you can use to proc an otherwise dead Aquamirror too. Generally a really nice card.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Number 60: Dugares the Timeless <ul>  	<li>You're generally only using Dugares for his draw effect, but the SS from GY can be handy if you're willing to forsake a follow-up. Anyway, the draw effect is largely what keeps him here, so if you want to use Dweller or Nyarla then by all means do so. Nyarla is particularly nice alongside the Heralds since you're possibly getting 3 searches off it.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Accesscode Talker <ul>  	<li>Bonk.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Knightmare Unicorn <ul>  	<li>Use this when going second to make life easier, and then climb into Accesscode Talker to swing for game. No other reason for using it, but it's a very good reason regardless!</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon <ul>  	<li>Bonk but for going first.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>2x Crystron Halqifibrax <ul>  	<li>Running 2 to give this deck a better follow-up post-hand loop, but you can drop the second if you have any better ideas. This card should be banned sometimes though ahahaha</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"

I put several Insect cards with special summon and search effects to easily summon the deck's ace monster,  Metamorphosed Insect Queen. I have three main strategies for this deck: <ol>  	<li>Parasite Infection: Equip opponent's monsters with Parasite Paranoid, then activates Cocoon of Ultra Evolution to summon Perfectly Moth or Insect Queen. You can use it to get rid of strong monsters, even though it didn't work against Untargetable monsters.</li>  	<li>Switcheroo: Use Creature Swap to steal a opponent's monster, giving them a Worm Bait/Insect Queen token. It's more efficient than the Parasite Infection strategy, i recommend use it to do a Beatdown or get a strong monster to your side.</li>  	<li> Gozen Match: Many decks/archtypes have different attributes, so this can be a pain. This is a stall strategy, use this to hold the opponent's back while getting the right cards to do some of the other 2 combos.  Remember  the Deck is composed of Earth monsters, so think twice before use it.</li> </ol> Gokipon can search for Parasite Paranoid, while Howling Insect can summon Gokipole from the Deck, allowing you to use the Gokipole + Gokibore combo effect, and considering the Gokipole effect didn't target, you can get rid of stronger opponent's monster in a more efficient way. Use Pinch Hopper to summon Insect Queen from your hand (if you have it) destroying him or used it for a Link Summon, for example. Cocoon of Ultra Evolution it's the most important card of this deck, and if you didn't draw it on the first turn, you'll need to hold the game a bit until you draw Cocoon.  Your biggest problem will be the opponent's set cards. Feel free to add any other card to this decklist to supply this failure. I plan to update this on the future, but for now, is this."

Predap consists in put Counters, reduce level and fusion summon. The Main Deck star of this is Spinodionaea, who can put Predator counters on monsters when it's summoned. You can combo it with cards like Drosophyllum Hydra ou Banksiogre, to tribute your opponent's monsters-a-la-Kaiju. You can bring out Spino with Lonefire Blossom, Ophrys Scorpio or Predapratice. Darlingtonia Cobra can add Fusion cards to your hand if you special summon it with a Predaplant's monster effect.  The archtype Spells and Traps supports this strategies, adding more cards to your hand (Predaplanet), putting Predator Counters more easily (Predaplanning and Predaplast) and fusion summon (Predaprime Fusion). The Extra Deck Predap monsters are very useful and powerfull, with cards like Verte Anaconda and Triphyoverutum, together with Starving Venom."

And yes, surprise, I’m doing laval. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So here’s the list, the deck is a little pricy but it won’t murder you.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 laval burner</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Laval burner can special summon itself from your hand if you have 3 or more laval monsters with different names in your graveyard. It’s a level 5 monster with 1000 defense sadly, because most of the deck likes 200 defense but burner still gets 2 slots in my build for being a free body and is probably the only level 5 or higher laval worth playing in the game at the moment. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 neo-flamvell lady</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Neo-flamvell lady is one of the best cards to run in a laval deck like this one. It gives you a way to stop eldlich and other similar decks with a quick effect, and as an added bonus mills monsters directly from your deck to fill your graveyard with laval monsters! I gave it 3 slots purely for how well it works with laval in general.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 laval blaster</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Laval blaster can dump up to 5 cards off the top of your deck to the grave upon its normal summon provided you already have a laval in your graveyard. This is easily a common situation and laval archer can help you out with summoning it. Though it has 800 defense I still played it at three because of the sheer number of cards it can mill.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 laval archer</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Laval archer is super good. It can self revive for releveling, it provides another normal summon if you use it for a laval monster, and it has out magic 200 defense stat! I honestly love this card in general and I find it to be one of the best tools laval has at the moment, I gave it 3 spots for how helpful it is.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 laval lakeside lady</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card can destroy a set card but it’s main flaw is that it also ends up clearing your graveyard. You can mill this monster often enough that I only feel to play 1.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 ash blossom and joyous spring </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Ash blossom and joyous spring is one of the best handtraps in the format and not only that but it’s a fire monster! I gave it three slots because if ash is in your deck, it going at 3.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 laval coatl </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Laval coatl is similar to laval burner but it’s a level 2 tuner. Just for being a tuner that can summon itself it got 3 slots</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 laval forest sprite</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Laval forest sprite can make your laval gain huge amounts of stats but it really is only being played for being a level 2 200 defense fire tuner.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 laval volcano handmaiden</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Laval handmaiden is an inanely useful card who mills 3 laval monsters! It also has 200 defense so you can mass spawn it with rekindling</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 de-synchro</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">De-synchro is a spell that takes apart a synchro monster, you can use it to take apart salamander and make dawn dragster or even repeat synchro monster effects.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 molten construction field</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is an absolute 3 of in laval decks! It can fill out 5 laval monsters combined with handmaiden</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 rekindled rebirth</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Grave tunes 200 defense fire monsters but it is a little bricky over one, it’s a nice tool to have regardless though.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 rekindling</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Oh my god, this is toadally staying at 3 in this build, it summons a lot and is a great card in general.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 searing fire wall</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Summons as many tokens as you like. It’s a great tool in this deck.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 flamvell counter</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This can banish a 200 defense fire in your graveyard to stop a spell/trap, I play it because of the sheer amount of 200 defense fires I can mill.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 infinite impenitence</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Free negate</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I think the extra deck is mostly self explanatory except for my choice of “Laval Dragon” not “Laval Dragun” whose completely explanatory but dragOn. So why? Simply put its effect is actually super good. It can shuffle 2 laval monsters from your graveyard into your deck to return a card from the field to the hand, but it’s not a hard once per turn which means as long as you have the laval monsters in your graveyard to work with you can keep on doing it, and you mill a ton of laval monsters really quickly with this deck.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">None of the combos are exactly linear but you have multiple ways start things and alongside the drawpower this deck provides I’ll admit that in the right hands I feel laval can be a pretty good deck. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Things to consider when piloting this deck: </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1: always pick a target if any before summoning neo-flamvell lady and only use her if your opponent has a graveyard, sure she’s a quick effect and everything but you don’t have much protection for her.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2: when using molten construction field try milling handmaiden, handmaiden cane mill two mor handmaidens and then pitch another laval of your choice.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3: if you’re confident about being able to do it and still summon other synchros then summon T.G. hyper librarian when possible.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I didn’t pick out a side deck yet because I don’t know what will happen in the future but if you have any ideas for a side deck then feel free to tell me!</span></p>"

Searchable monster reborn, a guardian slime wall, sphere mode, and the opportunity to lay down a 12k atk chicken and just win instantly. Ra’s second effect isn’t bad neither.  It’s a lot better than it seems. It goes under combo and tries to crack the board, or it goes over control by having ways to plus to infinity."

The deck focuses on turning off hand traps by using Vendread Battlelord, and then setting up a board to synchro into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity during your opponent's turn, locking them out of all card effects. Then if your opponent sets cards, nuke their board with Bethor (5 pops). It's a gg if you successfully summon King Calamity, and can be done with a 2-card hand of only Alpha/Zeta.  The Alpha/Zeta combos are shown off in this video, along with some other cool ones: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVtRJAKwfOw  If you choose the route that allows for follow-up, there is no flexibility in the extra deck at all unfortunately.  There are lots of other crazy things you can do with this deck post-LIOV and also post-DAMA; this is just one of them. Let me know if you want to see more!"

XD</span>  <span>Anyway,, the goal of this deck is simply to simply mill your opponent's whole deck. You probably won't be able to deplete their life points, so this is really the only win condition</span>  <span>Main Strategy:</span> <span>-Getting 3 bone towers is relatively easy, just special summon one and then use your Inferno Reckless Summon to pull out all 3. Sometimes you won't be able to summon all 3, or you may not need all 3, however the more you have, the more cards you can mill.</span> <span>-Next up, you need a Chakanine. It requires 2 level 4 monsters, which is easy to achieve with the Uni Zombie card. (Don't be afraid to use a tower as material if needed. You can mill 12 cards per tower with this chain, so do the math and find out how many you need to win.)</span> <span>-Finally we have Zombie World. Now, ZW can sometimes be a pain to get out, however cards such as Necroworld Banshee and Terraforming should make it easier if you don't draw it :). Zombie World is arguably the most important card in this combo, without it, the Zoodiacs won't count as zombie types, and therefore will not trigger bone tower. Protect it as well as you can.</span> <span>After you pull off this and mill 12-36 cards of your opponent's deck, simply use your leftover Zoodiac and a tower to summon Vampire Sucker to mill another 4, and use Sucker's effect for yet another 4 cards, bringing the total number of cards milled to 44 (with 3 towers)</span>  <span>Side Strategy:</span>  <span>- If for some reason your Zoodiacs get stopped, there are other cards that could help mill a few more cards and earn that sweet victory :)</span> <span>- You can suicide your pyramid turtles (with bone tower on the field) in order to special another turtle from the deck, rinse and repeat 3 times to mill 6-18 cards.</span> <span>If done strategically, you can use the last turtle to pull out a Solitaire, who then sacrifices itself and specials yet another zombie. Use this to summon Uni Zombie, and hey presto, you have a gateway to another zombie, just use uni to grave a Mezuki, and then use Mezuki's effect.</span>  <span>All in all, this seems pretty good, there are many ways to special summon zombie monsters, but unfortunately I cannot go over them all :P</span>  <span>A few things to note before I go:</span> <span>- PSY-Framelord Omega, Burial from a Different Dimension, and Leviair the Sea Dragon's effect allows you to recycle Mezuki over and over, use it wisely :)</span> <span>- There is a smaller Utopia XYZ chain in the extra deck for incase the Zoodiacs fail. It is not as big but works well in a pinch.</span> <span>- A Mechquipped Angineer summoned in attack position can protect you for 2 turns if you need to stall.</span> <span>- Minerva the Exalted Lightsworn is able to mill 3 cards from your own deck. This can be favourable in some cases, but be wary that spells and traps are at risk too.</span> <span>- If your oponent has a 40+ card deck, choose to go second. Let your opponent play their turn, shorten their deck and make your job a little easier. If they have a 40 card deck then it doesn't matter so much since they'll only have 35 cards left for you to mill, perfect for an OTK with the right hand</span>  &nbsp;  <span>And yeah, that's about it :)</span> <span>If I come across any issues or updates to the deck I'll be sure to edit this post or even create a new one :P</span>  <span>Again, feel free to message my discord (Katsuki#8104) with any questions or suggestions, or just comment on the post (I check in on this site every few days, so Discord would be much faster if that's what you're after)</span>  <span>Goodbye and thanks for reading :)</span>"

I will quickly define what is being a budget player for me and then talk about the deck strategy and the choices i made.  &nbsp;  <strong>Budget</strong> : Is constructing a strategy to be as efficient possible with the least amount of money. I wouldn't for example pay 20 bucks for a card and the total price range of the deck should be around 100 €, but of course this can vary depending if I really like the archetype or not.

Then everything is normal ratio wise until you see that i play 6 traps. The 3 <strong>Tri-Brigade Revolte</strong> let's you have a free 3000 body who banishes somehting on the turn of your ennemy. It is not mandatory since it conflicts with the <strong>Barrier Statue lock</strong>, but i haven't had any issues with that throught the playtesting yet. The most important trap is <strong>Harpie's Feather Storm</strong>. This card is broken... and i'm really affraid to show it because this card alone let's you win games. It synergises very well with lyrlusc since they are wind winged beast monsters. You can set this card at the beginning of your plays to ensure you to go into your full combo since it shuts down handtraps. Or you could simply add an omni monster negate for the turn to your lock."
