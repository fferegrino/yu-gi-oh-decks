Well, using the power of one of my favorite cores to play in Trinity Format, I have got just the solution for you! Presenting: Shaddoll Monarch aka ""Dollnarch""

<strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Shaddolls</span>: Even without committing to a Fusion package, the Shaddolls in this deck are capable of cycling through the deck, serving as tribute fodder, establishing loops, getting around disruption, and being disruption and/or removal in the right circumstances. Due to their accessibility being so high, they also make the deck able to brick on big guys and eventually convert into them no problem just because of all of the ways to them!</li>
 	<li><span>Copiuous Revival</span>: The deck lives and dies by having tribute fodder and what better way to do that than to summon during the opponent's turn? Since everything tends to just be floaters or setting up for intricate combo lines, you're on basically all of the good revival, then all the playable revival afterwards. The GY is your best friend here, but you don't exactly want to mill to get there, you just want to reuse some of the playmakers from before.</li>
 	<li><span>Extra Deck</span>: While Domain and Erupt are banned alongside other floodgates like Majesty's Fiend and Vanity's Fiend, the deck will use the Extra Deck quite a bit as it's super resourceful, always there, and allows you to catch the opponent by surprise in a number of ways. The Crossrose package given for basically free courtesy of the Baobaboon package, Sheridan thanks to any normal Monarch + a steal, or just 2 Monarchs, and lastly, Omega to endlessly make use of Pantheism, Edea, and Eidos to the point where you probably will run out of targets for each of the former at some point.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Monarchs</span>: The major downside of the Monarchs is obviously the fact that due to their level, they can clog up the hand and brick pretty often. Fortunately, we are on Ultimate Offering and Escalation to try and get around that, alongside playing all that's required to get us the win; however, a Monarch can and should be expected to sit in the hand for a while. Most situations regarding them, especially in the case of Ehther, should be concerning how to navigate the gamestate to best make use of them in a way that spins the game in your favor, rather than just deciding to discard them for something like a Shaddoll Beast or Knightmare play. They are the powerhouses of the deck. This is the consequence of playing them. You knew what you were getting into.</li>
 	<li><span>Restrictions for Days</span>:Â  Keep track of the restrictions you'll find yourself under. The good effects of the Vassals will all lock you from the Extra Deck, just having Return up on field will prevent ED usage as well (though Kuraz can get us out of that pickle), and Glow-Up Bloom will prevent any special summons for the rest of the turn except for that of Zombie Monsters, which we're not really on here. Sequencing will matter a lot, so be careful and manage the restrictions appropriately. You will be rewarded for your approach.</li>
</ul>
Now with that out of the way, let's get into some of the demo setups you'll be wanting to aim for.

<hr />

<strong>OPENERS</strong>

The hand quality and/or number of extenders in the hand will always make the permuations of the gamestates more or less challenging to emulate; though, this much was obvious. That being said, in the 1st turns of the duel, you ideally want to get your engines rolling. This can be enabled by the following:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Enabling Return:</strong> You'll mostly just be grabbing Ehther here, but if you already have Ehther access, the next best target would be either Caius or Raiza. You don't want to commit to them unless you have to with the main reason being the chance of getting Tenacity. Your entire deck tutors itself, especially with the help of Ehther, so Return should mostly be used strategically more than it should be used to snowball and fill your hand with a bunch of bricks. Unless you have Mithra or Offering up, you aren't getting that many summons in the turn anyway. If Return ever gets in your way, you'll just clear it with Kuraz. Just make sure to order your chain link such that the search from Return always is later in the chain. You'll grab a Monarch and get the free draw.</li>
 	<li><strong>Shaddoor is Open:</strong> You'll start by sending Wendi and summoning Falco. The reason we go for Falco over Beast or Hog here is because during the opponent's turn, they're going to have to out the Falco anyway. If they don't, we start our next turn with two monsters in a deck that Tribute Summons, one of which is a tuner and tuners are <em>scary</em>. If they attack into the Falco, you get back the Wendi, then use the Wendi to get either Beast or Hog depending on your need. Usually I go for Hog just so I get Reshhaddoll Incarnation in rotation. You won't be looping it like you would in a Fusion Shaddol strategy, but it's a searchable Reborn that can also double as a reset for certain setups or making a Flip Effect happen at Fast Speed. This will mostly show its head with Dragon and Squamata, but drawing four cards with Beast isn't anything to scoff at either.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Classic:</strong> This one is purely based on the Monarch you've been given in the opening hand, but the typical Edea into Eidos opener is a fine play to use. We've got two Edea in the deck anyway just to make use of that line more often in addition to the resets from the banish effect. If you have any <em>Edea</em> how Monarchs work, you'll need to make sure you plan when to Tribute her and use Eidos' GY effect accordingly. It could be potentially game losing.</li>
</ul>
From the above lines, it's clear to see that the openings usually won't overlap that often outside of permutations granted by Ehther when she descends from the hand. It's for this reason that the deck will take some getting used to at first. Not every hand will play nicely into a starter you're familiar with.

<strong>MIDGAME AND BEYOND
</strong>

Since you'll be drawing cards, cycling through the deck, and searching just about every name in the dictionary, the midgame gamestates will mostly come down to your discretion. Be mindful of the things that you are in total control of. If your opener gave you Ehther or Return, there's next to no excuse to not be in a winning position.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Ehther the Heavenly Monarch:</strong> She has a lot of lines, so I can't really get into all of them here. Just remember, you can summon a second copy of her from your deck on your own turn to have for the opponent's turn to do this again but for a disruption Monarch like Kuraz or Seleglare. Ehther can also be used to grab your setup for next turn if the opponent can't keep up with your pressure.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vampire Grimson: </strong>Alternative target for Glow-Up Bloom. Not a Monarch in stats, but can be a very annoying Monster to deal with. It protects your entire board so long as you're willing to pay for its services. The ability to also just reap Monsters from the opponent's GY is quite useful too since there's a bit of recursion in Trinity decks (like this one) and you'll always take a free piece of tribute fodder. Just be mindful of the summon limit... and your remaining LP.</li>
 	<li><strong>Glacial Beast Polar Penguin: </strong>This card is a great target for Edea if you need it and if you revive it, can put up a very funny disruption.

 	<li><strong>Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star:</strong> Rare summon. Mostly just used for excess Ehther when she's exhausted her usefulness and Erebus if you'd rather not have him in GY. The protection effect is absolutely insane and the on-summon send often makes players panic because there's not very much you can do about it due to no target needing to be declared on activation. Use this to close out games or insulate plays.</li>
 	<li><strong>PSY-Framelord Omega: </strong>Shaddoll Falco is a tuner. People usually don't like to attack the Falco because it's bad news bears. Use this to your advantage and convert it into budget Redoer to snowball your advantage and refresh GY effects.</li>
 	<li><strong>Crossrose Dragon: </strong>Baobaboon + Any Monster makes it live. You'll just sit on it during the opponent's turn. Fire it as necessary and tag into the appropriate Rose Synchro. Be extremely mindful of Ruddy affecting both GYs as it could butcher your follow-up.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

Due to the general complexity that the GY and hand tend to afford you when not even taking into account your Continuous Spells and Traps, the deck is not very beginner friendly. It does lend itself well to immutability, especially when substituting the Shaddoll or Baobaboon portions for other strategies. That said, here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere:

<em>Floowandereeze &amp; Empen, Floowandereeze and the Unexplored Winds, Destiny HERO core, Familiar-Possessed/Charmer core, S-Force, Vampire core, Witchcrafter core, Graydle core
</em>

Thanks for reading, and I hope this has convinced you to give the deck a try! It's a lot of fun to pilot, theorycraft, innovate, and watch replays on. If you can put in the time to try and navigate those hand states, you'll be rewarded nicely during the games. Now, arise from your rank of Vassal and join me as a Monarch!"

D/D/D Divine Zero King Rage, and all three superdoom kings

Try to get out dark contract cards, if the penalty has more risk than you like, summon D/D/D oracle king darc, or place Go! D/D/D Divine Zero King Rage. Also if your opponent is at or below 4000 use Go! D/D/D Divine Zero King Rage, it's attack will equal their life points and you can tribute a monster so it attacks directly. Gilgamesh is useful to get cards into your pendulum zones and getting out your extra deck after destruction. Archfiend Palabyrinth and Dark contract with the witch are good for boosting attack, the 2 slime monsters are useful in fusion, and D/D Berfomet is useful in synchro. Also nighthowl can be used for some nice combos, just keep in mind all its effects."

Locks down Swordsoul Decks, can field 5+ negates on turn 1.
Options to handle every meta threat. Versatile build tha","Build and deck profile information below constructed by Ou Ki, Swordsoul Master from Nexus.

Definitive meta Swordsoul Deck. I've tested pretty much all the other swordsoul decks on here and frankly they either brick far too much/ lose out on hand traps (phoenix builds) or they end up screwing themselves over (Desire builds) by banishing their combo pieces/ bricking due to ratios. Even if you run 3x the standard copies of swordsoul monsters, you're often going to banish 2 of a combo piece (I've even had games testing that popular build on here where I banished all 3 of my mo-ye off of a mediocre turn 1 draw, effectively GGing myself before even playing the game.)

Prosperity build instead of Desires would be nice if it didn't kill any other draws, ruining the synergy available with mo ye + Qixing Long Yuan. Also, you don't want to run 3x of the swordsouls because you don't want to see taia turn 1 (unless your build is setup differently to specifically go that route first, but most aren't - and the desire builds do this because they have to, which often nets you dreadful hands due to lacking control over ratios.)

I've beaten every swordsoul deck I've played against with this profile because unlike the other builds on here, I actually have ways to achieve full lockdown and easy options for breaking a massive board if I go 2nd. None of the other builds on here run DRNM or Droplet either -- I can tell you right now they're not fighting through my field of 5+ negates without crossout or ruler (Which the most popular build on here doesn't run.) Phoenix is also worthless if you can't make it. Any of the games I played I either ash'd their destiny fusion or negated verte before he was even fielded. Often times too if you're running 3x destiny fusion you'll draw into two which can be back breaking, especially if it's negated. Those decks are fun if you're playing casually, but if you want to win and contend vs the meta they're unreliable.

Without further adieu, let me get into this profile.

First things first, the major difference between this deck and the other swordsoul builds is I want to end my turn 1 with 2 lv 10 syncros instead of just 1 + I wanted options for how I use those 10s in tandem with the rest of my syncro package (which the standard swordsoul build can't achieve and didn't have). The rest of my deck is constructed in a way where if I draw into crossout or am go 2nd DRNM, I don't need to go baronne for my starter combo off longyuan to play around nibiru and can make cheng ying -- this is a luxury the standard Swordsoul build on here doesn't have (Because they don't run crossout nor DRNM nor resonator).

On top of this, because we're running resonator it opens the door for a bunch of other combos that aren't in the other builds. Let me present a few of the combos below and explain why its so devastating. (I won't go into the standard combos because I feel like they're obvious and everyone knows them and for the most part it's the same here - I'm just going to discuss below some of the unique aspects we can do here with the right hands factoring in what resonator brings to the table.):

<strong><span>Combo 1</span></strong>: <em>Resonator + Mo Ye + Long Yuan + any swordsoul card ((4 card combo))</em>

<span>1A. This is if you have crossout in hand:</span>
<ol>
 	<li>Summon Long Yuan + token. (by discarding the other swordsoul card you have in hand. If its emergence, search taia then discard him instead.)</li>

 	<li>summon resonator + mo ye. Mo ye activates, make token.</li>
 	<li>Turn Mo ye + token into chixiao. activate both effects, search + draw 1. (Search swordsoul sacred summit.)</li>
 	<li>Â Draw another +1 since this activates Qixing Long Yuan's effect.</li>
 	<li>Turn Chixiao + resonator into Cheng Ying. (Field so far = Cheng Ying + Qixing Long Yuan)</li>
 	<li>Â Draw another +1 since this activates Qixing Long Yuan's effect.</li>
 	<li>Use Swordsoul sacred summit to revive Chixiao. Turn 1 field = Chixiao / Cheng Ying / Qixing Long Yuan + you've +3'd off the draws of mo ye + 2x qixing long yuan and had a search from chixiao. Off these draws I almost always draw into hand traps based on the structure of my deck.</li>
</ol>
<span>1B. This is if you don't have crossout in hand / get a sense your opponent is readying hand traps.</span>
<ol>
 	<li>Summon Long Yuan + Token.</li>
 	<li>Syncro into Baronne de Fleur. (We go baronne instead to protect from Nibiru.)</li>
 	<li>Normal resonator + mo ye. proceed same as combo above, make Chixiao and search sacred summit and draw 1.</li>
 	<li>Syncro resonator+chixiao into cheng ying.</li>
 	<li>Use summit to revive Chixiao. Field = Baronne + Cheng Ying + Chixiao.</li>
</ol>
<span><strong>Combo 2</strong></span>: <em>Going 2nd Board breaking Combo ( resonator + ecclesia + mo ye + DRNM) ((4 card combo))Â </em>

**This combo can be done with resonator+mo ye (2 card combo) but this is best case scenario I'm describing.
<ol>
 	<li>Use Dark Ruler no more to negate the field.</li>
 	<li>special summon ecclesia.</li>
 	<li>If you can manipulate swordsoul emergence to GY, special out taia from ecclesia &lt;&lt; if you cannot, then you'd special out mo ye and prefer to start with taia in hand instead.</li>
 	<li>Use taia's ability to banish swordsoul emergence to raise the token level to 5.</li>
 	<li>Syncro Shenshen.</li>
 	<li>normal summon resonator + mo ye.</li>
 	<li>Mo ye + token into white whale, destroy all attack position monsters (Due to Shenshen, they all get banished instead of going to GY). ((This is especially of note if your opponents monsters have GY activatable effects, like Shaddoll. You don't need to go this route if they don't, but if you can you should.)</li>
 	<li>From here we use resonator + white whale to make cheng ying (or baronne depending on what you feel works best at this game state.)</li>
 	<li>Field = Shenshen + Cheng Ying ( or Baronne.) Entire enemy field wiped, and if it isn't you can clear the defense position monsters with white whale before syncroing.</li>
</ol>
<span>Some other notable Resonator combos:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>resonator + taia can baxia, pop 2, pop resonator to bring back ecclesia for a mo ye combo, or instead after popping a useless card (like an unused crossout or DRNM that wasn't used) to revive you can syncro baxia + resonator into a 10. Also have the option of going into a fibrax play as well.</li>
 	<li>resonator + taia can also Crimson blader (taia+token into crimson blader), battle phase and lock them out of normal/specialing lv 5 or higher then after battle phase resonator + Crimson blader into a level 10.</li>
 	<li>resonator + white whale DRNM combo above.</li>
 	<li>This build allows for you to make Ruddy + Cheng Ying on the same turn, which can be an OTK in most late game scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<span>Some other notable comments:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>Fibrax+Syncron engine can be interchangeable with Dingirsu/Zeus or Draglubion/Number 100 however in my testing I've found it very useful in tandem with baxia combos (mo ye is typically in GY but without SS in hand he cant pyramid into combos) in these instances u can fibrax into syncron + baxia to make a 10. The draw often gets you an extra handtrap which is why I've liked it. Ding/Zeus is really nice but super situational, and the draglubion strat is overkill here especially with how easily we can OTK other ways.</li>
 	<li>We run 2x Cosmic Cyclone because it synergizes with Cheng Ying + banishing some of the meta spells/traps is a lot more useful right now especially against decks like Floowandereeze, Eldlich, Shaddoll, etc. Harpies feather duster isn't good enough here especially since we really struggle against these particular decks that CC actually is strong against.</li>
 	<li>Imperial Order is busted and if you need to use spells, you can pop it with baronne or baxia.</li>
 	<li>Called by also synergizes with Cheng Ying and activates his effect. It and Cosmic cyclone are a must in this deck.</li>
 	<li>2x Baxia &gt; 1x baxia 1x yazi in this build. The combos with resonator and the ease of access for GY revive's just gives them a lot more utility here. If you have to start the game going 2nd with 1, it's really nice to have a 2nd later for recycling combo pieces / rebuilding your board.</li>
 	<li>2x cheng ying because we get it out a lot turn 1 (Which the other swordsoul builds typically don't to get around Nibiru). If it gets outed, you really want to be able to make a 2nd one again. Not having it for a lengthy game can be troublesome to overcome, especially against decks with tons of GY recycling activatables.</li>
 	<li>DRNM Crossout and some of your other spells if unused at later gamestate may seem dead in some decks, but due to Baxia they often times are able to get discarded for a revive, saving you an extra body or monster card that is needed (like resonator)</li>
 	<li>You can play with the ratio's a bit. I liked dropping Ecclesia to 2x because it's dead if you go 1st and due to the structure of my build, I really want to see swordsouls / wyrms to playmake. Drawing into it on a turn 2/3 is ideal and exactly how it's worked for this build.</li>
 	<li>2x ash 2x veiler gets you to 40 but 3x ash imo has been ideal - You really want to see it especially if you aren't going 1st. If you want to trim to 40 and want 3x ecclesia, you can cut ghost bell and drop the ss trap to 2x.</li>
 	<li>Crossout absolutely owns the mirror matchup.</li>
 	<li>The only disadvantage on paper I have vs. the standard swordsoul build is I don't run psy omega, which isn't that big a deal if they go 1st, but in those instances Ill sub it in and replace ghostbell + the 2 cosmic cyclones with it (2x psy 1x brick) so its live for crossout (none of the standard builds of SS run bell.)</li>
 	<li>Qixing Long Yuan is underrated. 2 negates that banish can be incredibly useful depending on the matchup; for example, this card annihilates eldlich. Eldlich is banished / cant revive himself from GY + all his traps that try to activate are banished, can't use their GY effects. amazing vs. Shaddoll traps and their fusions. With how my field is structured, he's typically out there with Cheng ying and Chixiao which makes his field presence even stronger. The reason most standard builds don't run him is he isn't that good alone with Chixiao by himself. You'd much rather have cheng ying or even Baronne -- that's why I feel this deck is a lot more versatile especially with the potential draw combos he offers with the right hand.</li>
 	<li>If you want to trim from 41 to 40 you can cut ghost bell or drop ash to 2 (or replace 2x cosmic cyclone with 1x harpies feather duster.) In my testing though I've found these ratios to be as tight to my liking as possible and 3x ash is essential in this meta.</li>
</ul>
<span>Side deck comments:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>Droll for the fluffal / drytron matchup</li>
 	<li>psy omega reasoning mentioned above, for the mirror</li>
 	<li>token collector also for the mirror</li>
 	<li>lancea destroys dino / invoked, etc.</li>
 	<li>yazi a situational insert depending on how I feel matches are going. (Psy lambda can be slotted here as well if you run the omega package- in that case you'd want to run syncro 8 omega as well.)</li>
 	<li>Ding+Zeus insert for the Fibrax/Syncron swap out.</li>

Remus + 1 discard gets you into Crystal Wing and Heavenly Spheres via the Gae Durg Combo. This doesn't use your normal summon so use the Dragonmaid engine with that to get out Sheou. You can pitch Dragonmaids (especially Tidying from hand) with Ravine during the Remus combo to set up your Dragonmaid engine. With this, you can relatively consistently end on Crystial Wing + Spheres + Sheou, usually with 1 trap/handtrap (hopefully more) and the plus 2 on opponents standby phase with Sheou for the follow up. Without opening Remus you can usually do the same thing minus the Crystal wing and save resources for the crackback.

<span><strong>Techs:</strong></span>

<strong>Arma Gram</strong> midgame can be deadly, you can easily get it off of Ravine, and it fuses into Sheou.

<strong>Cataclysm</strong> is optional but I find the that the deck lacks an ability to pop cards and usually has little dragons laying around on the field as fodder for this card.

<strong>AreadBhair</strong> can be summed by normal summoning Remus with any level 8 Dragonmaid on board. It doesn't come up too often, but it's definitely let me come back from games I shouldn't have more often than you would expect.

<strong>I:P and Closed WorldÂ </strong>is one of the best techs this format if you play a deck that summons a lot and has the extra deck space. Remus locks you out of it, so arguably its better in the Dragon Link version, but this comes up in turns 3 and 4.

<span><span>Dado que este arquetipo estÃ¡ diseÃ±ado para la agresiÃ³n y el enjambre, un Deck se puede construir rÃ¡pidamente usando ""Sticky Shark"", ""Shark Cruise"" y especialmente ""Hammerhead Shark"" para llenar el Campo y con ""Hammerhead Shark"".

The difference is that the Dragoon package has been swapped out for the arguably better Destroyer Pheonix Enforcer package. Aside from being an auto-include in a lot of meta decks, DPE has great synergy with the deck; you can use it to pop your own Baby's, or if the DPE makes it through an opponent's turn without using its effect, attempt to pop the token on your opponent's side of the field and get a Lost World trigger.

The game plan is to end turn 1 on a board of Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, Destroyer Pheonix Enforcer, your choice of rank 4 (usually one of the Evolzars but Abyss Dweller is good too), a Solemn Judgement if you've drawn it, and a surplus Predaplant Verte Anaconda. You can do this with extreme consistency.

Turn 2, if all your monsters have survived you can use the Anaconda, the likely depleted rank 4, and your normal summon for the turn to go into Access Code Talker, via Knightmare Unicorn.

I prefer this build to the Scrap Dinosaur Deck. The end board of the Destiny build isn't as strong as the Scrap build, but I find the Destiny build is more consistent, plays more easily under an Artefact Lancea, and is a little more flexible.

You've got a lot of flexibility in the extra deck. Aside from DPE, Link Kuriboh and Anaconda you could change any card in the extra deck for whatever fits your taste. I've included Castelle as an out to Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops because this deck can do nothing else against that card. I like having the Tornado Dragon for Mystic Mine opponents (this deck is actually really good against Mine as you can use Lost World to gradually increase the number of monsters on your opponent's field.) I like having the instant fusion package as Millenium Eyes restrict can give you some cover from hand traps, until you get to Miscellaneousaurus, and you can later link it off for Anaconda."

&nbsp;

Anyway this is a normal evil twin deck that I've been using.

I would prefer to use Cynet Mining over Pot of Desires because it helps you start your combo much more consistently and doesn't grind your next search, but since you already have 15 cards (86% chance of having at least one at the starting hand) to add combo pieces Mining isn't so much necessary in the end.

Going first one card combo: the combo starts when you normal or special summon Live Twin Ki-sikil or Live Twin Lil-la(not considering Frost and treat). Normal summon Lil-la ~Lil-la special summon Ki-sikil Frost ~link summon Evil Twin Ki-sikil ~activate Evil Ki-sikil effect and special summon Lil-la from your GY ~link summon Evil Twin Lil-la ~activate Evil Lil-la effect and special summon Evil Ki-sikil from your GY ~Activate Evil Ki-sikil effect and draw one ~Link summon Evil Twin's Trouble Sunny ~end of the combo.

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series.

""Magikey"" (é­ã¾éµãã Maken) is an archetype introduced in Dawn of Majesty. The Japanese name is a combination of the kanji for demon/magic (""é­"") and key (""éµ"") which together form a homophone for ""Demon Sword"" (""é­å£""). The names of the ""Magikey"" Ritual Monsters and Extra Deck monsters are derived from the devils belonging to ""Solomon's 72 Pillars"".

Strategy for this deck :

1. You can use effect from ""Magnificent Magikey Mafteal"" to gain normal summon magikey monster after your synchro summon ""Borreload Savage Dragon"".

2. If your opponent activate Nibiru from their hand before your summon ""Borreload Savage Dragon"", you can still synchro summon ""Magikey Fiend - Transfurlmine"" by use ""Magnificent Magikey Mafteal"" and level 4 normal monster as synchro material.

Edit*

3 boots and 1 cloak seems optimal

added beetrooper descent and removed 1 psychic wheelder from deck

beetrooper descent is a free level 3 token generator for cherubini, downside is you can't xyz into zeus, zeus is rarely used in this deck since youll end up with dpe + backrows to win the game

so you dont have to play 2 junk forwarder or another psychic wheelder to guarantee your follow ups

in my opinion:

having 2 breaksword is not really optimal unless you got board wiped with breaksword xyz in your gy already summoned using the trap and survived a turn, or just use levianeer cause its an xyz

cut the 1 breaksword for dagda and add scythe is the optimal choice here, just gotta watch out for floowandereeze and trap based decks, make sure to set a backrow or two to stop their plays.

F0 is worthless, you can just use apolloursa instead of adding 1 more levianeer and 2 f0's for 3- extra deck slotÂ  just to fill some spaces for nerfed toadally awesome that only negates monster effect and have indestructible body.

if anyone of you complains that my side deck is just bunch of random cards, just change it yourself and grab your favorite hts

congrats for reading my pointless opinion, now go win some games, champs."

D shifter will stop droll lock and effect veiler.

Crossout will stop ash, droll and Impermanence.

Book of moon counters effect veiler.

&nbsp;

Deck isn't bad going second with the hand traps. your first 5 cards have a 72,10% of drawing a hand trap so possible stopping your opponent first turn. 32,32% drawing D shifter first turn and 37,80 if you draw from going 2nd.Â  52,80% first turn drawing a floowandereeze level 1 with pots or field spell potentially really pop off.

&nbsp;

Win condition for each meta deck

Drytron and Evil twins, Wind barrier first turn, they don't have anything over 1000 atk, so they will try to pop it.

PK, link dragon, tri-brigade or any link heavy decks, Empen will shut down these decks

Sword soul, hardest matchup Avian and Raiza, side in those token collector.

Virtual world, pretty hard but Avian and Raiza as well, side in Nibiru and Lancia."

With the release of the new Cyber Strike structure deck, I thought it would be a good purchase for this.

Because so much of it dealt with how I moved from Blue-Eyes into a more typical Dragon Link deck, inevitably I also received questions from Blue-Eyes players about my previous deck build discussed in the profile. That's more or less what I'm showcasing here. Like the first, this deck profile also turned out quite long. This deck worked pretty well for me at locals, taking fifth and just missing the top-4 in the second tournament I'd ever played. But I've also discarded this build for a more standard Dragon Link deck because I'm realistic about its overall competitive viability. In writing this deck profile, I've tried to highlight some of the theory behind it as well as the BEWD archetype as a whole.

Let's make this clear right off the bat:<em><strong> This is</strong><strong> absolutely not 'the best Blue-Eyes deck ever'. </strong></em>I'm skeptical of anyone even claiming that distinction.<strong>Â </strong>This is the Blue-Eyes Dragon Link deck I built and saw some success with at locals. But I've decided to profile it here in order to draw out some general theory about the game as a whole and Blue-Eyes in particular. The first half of this profile opens with these more general points on theory. The second half covers the deck itself, outlining some key combos, card choices and the extra-deck. Pay no heed to the side deck here--it's more or less a straight holdover from the list I actually ran a few months back.

<span><strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon &amp; its Contradictions</strong></span>

I started playing YuGiOh again in July 2021 after a nearly two-decade hiatus. Like countless nostalgic millennials re-visiting the game, I gravitated toward the familiar and set to work building a Blue-Eyes White Dragon deck.Â Blue-Eyes White Dragon may not be the ultimate creature of destruction, but there's no question it's the ultimate creature of <em>fixation</em> among a huge swath of YuGiOh players.

Naturally, Blue-Eyes players have developed countless builds and strategies to play the deck, even as it remains totally irrelevant to the competitive meta-game. Some prefer a purer Blue-Eyes deck that focuses entirely on the monster, its surrounding archetype and the sizable amount of support churned out by Konami over the years. More competitive-minded players, however, typically build Blue-Eyes decks that borrow from other archetypes and strategies to boost the deck's power, consistency and more. It should be said, none of these decks compete any higher than certain local tournaments--and even at that level, some cannot compete at all.

<strong><span>The Four Main Blue-Eyes Decks</span></strong>

At present, there are four generally accepted ways to build a Blue-Eyes deck: (1) Fusion, which is based around summoning Blue-Eyes fusion boss monsters like Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon; (2) Ritual, which aims to summon monsters like Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon for an OTK; (3) Rank-8, which uses the Blue-Eyes archetype and engine to make powerful rank-8 XYZ monsters; and (4) Dragon Link, which uses the Blue-Eyes engine alongside more common dragon-based engines to combo into a typical DLink end-board that includes negates and interruptions along with powerful boss monsters. These four deck builds are not always rigid and often overlap, incorporating some elements of one or the other. Most Blue-Eyes players, for instance, run some type of rank-8 XYZ package in the extra-deck, even if it's not the deck's main focus. But in general, these are the four major types of Blue-Eyes decks in the current format.

Among these four, the ritual build is generally accepted as stronger than the fusion build. Whether it runs an Impcantation engine to turbo out its ritual monster, works Chaos MAX into Drytron, or sticks to the typical archetypal support, the ritual build seems to have an easier time getting its win condition onto the field than the fusion build does--though I should add, this may change significantly with the release of the Battle of Chaos support cards in February 2022. Blue-Eyes fans tend to prefer these two, no doubt owing partly to their appearances in the Duel Monsters anime.

While both can reliably pump out their boss monsters, they do so at an enormous cost. Beyond running the BEWD normal brick at x3--or perhaps because they do so--the decks have to run a certain amount of support cards that mitigate the risk of drawing an unplayable hand. But they also have to run enough searchers to get their Blue-Eyes pieces from deck to hand, field and/or graveyard. This leaves relatively little deck space for defense and disruption if the player aims to keep their deck size at or around 40 cards.

More issues soon arise. Under the right circumstances, both Chaos MAX and Alternative Ultimate Dragon can OTK their opponent--and if not, they can rampage through opponent's boards with their powerful effects and high attack. Both have some level of built-in protection too. But in the present-day meta-game, these are easily worked around since neither creature has the ability to negate anything. If the opponent succeeds in disrupting their play, it usually means the end of the game due to the player having committed so many resources in summoning the Blue-Eyes boss monsters in the first place.

<strong><span>'Brick-Eyes' White Dragon &amp; Card Economy</span></strong>

Since its victory at the 2016 YuGiOh World Championship, which itself was not without controversy, Blue-Eyes decks have remained outside the scope of competitive play in all but the local level. On a fundamental level, the deck's consistency will always suffer due to the Blue-Eyes White Dragon itself. As a level-8 normal monster with 3000 ATK / 2500 DEF, Kaiba's ace monster is just a beat-stick--solid stats but hardly unique among boss monsters. It requires two tributes to normal summon to the field, meaning it's not capable of starting plays. It also has no card effect. Other cards canÂ <em>make useÂ </em>of BEWD to start plays or extend the player's position (Trade-In and Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon, respectively), but the vanilla BEWD is neither a starter nor an extender. It is an absolute brick that will simply sit in-hand if you fail to draw into the right card.

While YuGiOh has no direct analog to Magic the Gathering's mana economy, the game absolutely has a resource system. Resources in YuGiOh are the cards a player has access to using at any given time, whether in-hand, on-field, or in-grave. All other things being equal, the deck that generates greater card advantage than an opponent's deck is better situated to win. Card advantage generally represents more available options for making optimum plays and counter-moves. Pot of Greed is banned for this very reason. This concept is pretty YuGiOh-101, but it helps us understand the trouble with Blue-Eyes decks.

Running 3x BEWD equates to a more than 33% chance of seeing at least one of these cards in the opening five-card hand of a 40-card deck. In the likely event that a player draws into at least one unusable Blue-Eyes brick, they are beginning the round at a potential disadvantage (potential because the opponent can brick too). Drawing 1x BEWD in the opening five cards means that 20% of your available resources are unusable on their own as either starters or extenders. Perhaps the player draws into Trade-In, which upon activation essentially swaps 1x BEWD and 1x Trade-In for two new cards. In some sense, this generates additional resources in that seven (7) cards are now available in-hand or in-grave. It also thins the deck, boosting the probability of drawing into important extenders.

Trade-In is a good spell that Blue-Eyes decks consistently run at x3 for precisely this purpose. In another sense, however, both BEWD and Trade-In represent opportunity costs to the deck. For one, they both showed up in-hand rather than better starters or superior extenders. Trade-In essentially fixes a bricked hand by replacing an unusable card and itself with two new cards, one or both of which may be useful. Resolving Trade-In thus becomes a necessity for playing this hypothetical hand.

This highlights another opportunity cost more fundamental than the composition of the five-card hand. Blue-Eyes decks have an ever-compounding need to run cards that mitigate their decision to run 3x BEWDs in the first place. Any Blue-Eyes player who has ever drawn another copy of Trade-In from resolving Trade-In has experienced this principle firsthand. From jump street, running Blue-Eyes White Dragon forces the player to include cards that will 'fix' their hands in-place of other starters, extenders or defense/disruption like hand-traps. The rest of the deck bends in service of a (fairly useless) card, rather than the card serving the functionality of the rest of the deck. Generally this is a bad way to deck-build.

BEWD and Dark Magician stand out as anomalies in YuGiOh due to their immense ongoing popularity. Konami has built these vanilla, two-tribute monsters into entire archetypes with their own lineup of supporting monsters and extra-deck monsters, along with a suite of spells and traps. Both regularly receive new support aimed--with varying degrees of success--at bringing these Duel Monsters anime icons up to speed with the game's modern mechanics. Much of this support focuses on lowering the barrier to summoning these bricky, beloved boss monsters, while some has offered in-archetype cards that offer useful alternatives to work around the more fundamental weaknesses of these decks--like the aptly named Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon.

Debate rages on among the fanbase of both monsters as to what Konami would have to release to make these decks competitive in the meta. At the core, the question is, how does a deck running so many bricks--remember, cards like Alternative White Dragon are bricks in-hand too without an accompanying BEWD to summon--and dedicating so much space to mitigating the bricks become consistent and powerful enough to compete? My own thoughts fall outside the scope of this already-long deck profile. But the contradictions presented in this question are why I maintain that, at present, the Dragon Link build is the strongest, most consistent way to run a Blue-Eyes deck.

<span><strong>Dragons of Dr. Moreau: Crossing Blue-Eyes with Dragon Link</strong></span>

Here's how the deck primarily works:

The Blue-Eyes engine runs alongside the other two main Dragon Link engines: Rokkets and Chaos Dragons. Through exploiting the White Stone of Legend's mandatory search effect, which triggers when sent to the graveyard, the player simultaneously builds a board, adds the 3x Blue-Eyes White Dragon to hand and, by removing these bricks, boosts the deck's draw consistency. Once in-hand, the 3x BEWD bricks become part of the deck's resource system, generating even greater card advantage and thus overcoming a major obstacle facing Blue-Eyes decks. The watershed moment happens when Saryuja Skull Dread is summoned using four (4) monsters as link material, resulting in the player drawing four (4) new cards and placing three (3) at the bottom of the deck. In essence, the player draws just shy of a second opening hand and has up to 3x BEWDs to put back into the deck, allowing them to grab critical extenders and disruption to build and defend their board while lowering the probability of drawing into bricks on future turns.

<span><strong>The Core Combo</strong></span>

The ideal opening hand consists of 1x Sage with Eyes of Blue and 1x Melody of Awakening Dragon. Barring disruption, the combo looks like this:
<ul>
 	<li>Normal summon Sage with Eyes of Blue. Activate its effect to search the White Stone of Legend.</li>
 	<li>Activate Melody of Awakening Dragon, pitching the White Stone of Legend for cost. The White Stone should be arranged as chain link-2 and resolve first, adding 1x BEWD to hand. Melody is chain link-1 and resolves after by the player adding 1x Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon and 1x Chaos Dragon Levianeer to hand.</li>
 	<li>Special summon Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon by revealing BEWD in-hand. If going second, the player can activate Alternative's effect to pop a monster if appropriate since it will not be used in the Battle Phase.</li>
 	<li>Link off Sage + Alternative to link summon Crystron Halqifibrax.</li>
 	<li>Activate Halq's effect to special summon a second copy of the White Stone of Legend.</li>
 	<li>Link off the White Stone of Legend to summon Striker Dragon to the bottom-right zone beneath Halq. White Stone's effect searches and adds 1x BEWD to hand.</li>
 	<li>Activate Striker Dragon's effect to search Boot Sector Launch and add to hand.</li>
 	<li>Special summon Chaos Dragon Levianeer to the main monster zone furthest away from Halq by banishing three (3) light monsters from the graveyard.</li>
 	<li>On summon, activate Levianeer's effect to bring back one of the White Stones in the graveyard in defense mode.</li>
 	<li>Link off the White Stone to summon Guardragon Pisty to the bottom-left zone beneath Halq. White Stone's effect searches and adds 1x BEWD to hand.</li>
 	<li>Activate Pisty's effect to bring back one of the White Stones from the graveyard.</li>
 	<li>Link off Halq, Striker Dragon, Pisty and the White Stone to summon Saryuja Skull Dread.</li>
</ul>
From here, the player can arrange the chain links to fit the situation. If Saryuja's effect is chain link-1, the White Stone will have no valid targets to search and not resolve. If the White Stone is chain link-1, however, Saryuja's effect resolves first and the player will draw four (4) cards and then select three (3) to place at the bottom of the deck. If 1+x BEWDs are placed in the deck by Saryuja's effect, the White Stone's effect will resolve and add one (1) of the copies of BEWDÂ <em>that you just placed at the bottom of the deckÂ </em>back to your hand. This means that even if having a BEWD in-hand is useful for activating cards like Trade-In, you should still generally put them back and take advantage of the White Stone's effect trigger by arranging your chain links to resolve this way.

If all three (3) copies of BEWD are in-hand at the time of Saryuja's summon, the White Stone's effect will not resolve and cannot chain-block so you mind as well make it chain link-1. Occasionally, however, you may get to Saryuja with one or more copies of BEWD still in the deck, in which case the White Stone's effect can chain-block to protect Saryuja's draw effect from disruption.

Depending on the opening hand, Chaos Space can act as a partial replacement for Melody if one if drawn but not the other. After all, it can search and add either Chaos Dragon Levianeer <strong><em>orÂ </em></strong>Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon, and it can pitch any light or dark monster (White Stone of Legend) as cost. One of the handful of DLink mechanics that actually works a bitÂ <em>betterÂ </em>with the Blue-Eyes engine is searching monsters off Chaos Space. Typically, a Dragon Link deck runs two (2) dark and one (1) light monsters that cannot be normal summoned/set: Black Dragon Collapserpent and Chaos Dragon Levianeer, and White Dragon Wyverburster, respectively. Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon adds an additional light target to resolve Chaos Space, especially in later turns after the White Dragon Wyverburster has been banished or sent to the graveyard. Without a valid target in-deck, Chaos Space can sometimes clog a Dragon Link player's hand and prevent them from gaining the additional draw off its second effect in-grave. But Blue-Eyes Dragon Link will almost never find itself without a target to resolve Chaos Space.

<span><strong>Building the End Board</strong></span>

<span><strong>Rank-8 XYZ Dragons</strong></span>

With the hand replenished, the graveyard loaded up and a Link-4, 2800-ATK dragon with additional effects on the field, the player sets to work building a board consisting of powerful rank-8 XYZ and synchro dragons. In general, making some of these pieces takes priority over others. For instance, when going first, this deck almost never wants to make Number 97: Draglubion or use its effect--and in the rare instance it does, itÂ <strong><em>never</em></strong> wants to make Number 100: Numeron Dragon via its effect. Making Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy is a much bigger priority due to its spell negate and attack re-direction during battle, though I'll admit I've never successfully resolved the second effect in practice.

Number 97: Draglubion accesses one of two win conditions for the deck: Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon and Number 100: Numeron Dragon. When going second, Draglubion should make one of these two XYZ dragons via its effect, attaching the other as material. Numeron Dragon can detach material to gain ATK equal to the ranks of all XYZ monsters on the field x1000, meaning it will generally have 9000 ATK or more. In those rare instances in which deck can make Number 38 and Number 97 on the same turn, it will have 17,000 ATK. Whatever monster Draglubion summons by effect becomes the only monster that can attack for the turn, but if Numeron Dragon successfully attacks, it will OTK or nearly OTK the opponent on its own.

At 0 ATK / 0 DEF, Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon is less straightforward. It cannot be destroyed by battle, sure, but the opponent takes any and all battle damage incurred by this card. In other words, if the opponent has an 8000 ATK Gren Maju Da Eiza on the field and Heart-eartH Dragon declares an attack on it, it will OTK the opponent. But Heart-eartH Dragon has an equally broken effect in the end phase of the opponent's turn: it can detach a material to banish all monsters, spells and traps the opponent summoned or set that turn. If the opponent destroy it with card effects while it still has material, however, it just special summons itself from the graveyard with +1000 ATK for each card currently banished--meaning cards banished by both players. Bringing out Heart-earth Dragon is like activating a time-bomb, which your opponent must carefully disarm in one turn or face annihilation.

This deck can only make Numeron Dragon or Heart-eartH Dragon via Draglubion's effect, and since one must serve as material for the other, the player generally must choose one or the other. Numeron's a simpler OTK machine to operate but offers fewer options in the event of contingencies, while Heart-eartH works better in more complex situations with its equally devastating arsenal of effects.

In general, the rank-8 dragons are quite easy to make. Galactic Spiral Dragon (level-8) can special summon itself from hand <strong><em>orÂ </em></strong>graveyard, making it an ideal card to pitch as cost for something like Trade-In and an easy body to get on-board. Once summoned, it can activate its effect at any time to make all face-up monsters on the player's side of the field level-8 monsters. While activating this effect too early can screw up the synchro plays (discussed below), it makes summoning Hope Harbinger, Draglubion or both quite easy. And if it's attached as XYZ material and later detached, Galactic Spiral Dragon will return to the graveyard instead of banishing itself, setting up its triumphant return to the field on the next turn.

<span><strong>Synchro Dragons: Blue-Eyes &amp; Otherwise</strong></span>

When it comes to synchro monsters, on the other hand, the deck generally wants to make Chaos Ruler and resolve its effect to excavate five (5) cards and add a light or dark monster to their hand. Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss can then be synchro-summoned using Chaos Ruler and whatever level-1 tuner is available, giving the player an omni-negate and 3200-ATK body on-board--and one that special summons a tuner from the graveyard when it deals battle damage, at that. When in the GY, Chaos Ruler can special summon itself by banishing 1 light and 1 dark monster, which is a remarkably easy condition for this deck to meet. As a level-8 synchro, Chaos Ruler can easily become XYZ material for a rank-8. This move circumvents Chaos Ruler's restriction, which banishes the card when it leaves the field a second time, and when it detaches as XYZ material, it simply returns to the graveyard for the cycle to begin again next turn.

When I competed with this deck, I did not include either Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon or Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon in the extra deck. These cards simply do not do enough in the modern game to warrant space in an already-tight extra deck. Instead, I played a second copy of Hieratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres and 1x Borreload Dragon (link-4). Frankly, I don't think this was optimal either. If I had to pilot this deck again today, I'd play Baronne de Fleur instead, which is relatively easy to make off of Hot Red's battle effect.

However, I included the two Blue-Eyes synchros, both level-9, in this profile because of the common criticism that Blue-Eyes Dragon Link isn't a true Blue-Eyes deck. That criticism strikes me as begging the question since this deck runs all the key main-deck elements of a Blue-Eyes deck as we understand them today. Nevertheless, if I were to slot in extra-deck Blue-Eyes monsters, these two make the most sense. Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon, especially, can prove very useful in certain matchups. Spirit Dragon's prohibition on summoning two or more monsters simultaneously, for example, stops Tri-Brigade Revolt from resolving. Similarly, its graveyard effect negate--not a hard-once-per-turn, either--finds itself well-suited for the current format, in which a slew of meta-decks activate key parts of their engine in-grave.

Azure-Eyes is harder to make and generally less useful, offering very limited protection from card effects to other dragons already on the field when it is summoned. The two cards are generally played together for Spirit Dragon's tag-in, tag-out quick effect, since Azure-Eyes' effect prevents Spirit Dragon's restriction (the special-summoned light synchro-dragon is destroyed during the player's next end phase) from resolving. I cannot think of a situation in which one would make Azure-Eyes over Spirit Dragon if given the choice.

<span><strong>Linking Off</strong></span>

When I played this deck, blowout cards like Accesscode Talker had nary a reprint in sight. It goes to say, I'd probably play something like that as my link-4 boss monster over Borrelsword Dragon if I built the deck today today.

But Borrelsword is still a damn fine card. Typical Dragon Link decks don't make Borrelsword as often as they did in previous formats, but it remains a strong blowout card to bring out and end the game quickly. With the amount of rank-8 plays available to this deck, I think Blue-Eyes Dragon Link would make Borrelsword even less often. Nevertheless, it's the condom principle: I'd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it. Borreload Dragon works just fine too, albeit differently, and running both gives the player the benefit of choosing the best fit for a particular situation. However, the general consensus prefers Borrelsword and running both in an already tight extra-deck seems excessive and unnecessary.

Hieratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres is one of the best cards available to dragon decks in general. For one, it guarantees a follow-up play after getting Nibiru'ed. I don't think Blue-Eyes uses it very effectively on its own because so few of the monsters in the main deck search or add extenders on-summon. Thus, I ran the Dragonmaid package--1x Chamber Dragonmaid, 2x Dragonmaid Tidying. Chamber Dragonmaid is the best target to special summon off of Spheres' tribute effect and at just one (1) copy, you're unlikely to see it when you don't want to see it. When Chamber hits the field, it adds the Tidying trap to hand. While in-grave, Tidying can banish itself to special summon Chamber Dragonmaid from hand or graveyard, allowing another search/add for the other copy of Tidying. The trap itself offers great disruption in the form of a non-targeting bounce, making it a natural analog to Spheres' disruption effect. Blue-Eyes decks usually bank on the OTK attack, but Spheres and the Dragonmaid package add an easy-to-access, potentially devastating element of disruption to the deck.

<span><strong>'Do I have to run Rokkets?' : A Few Last Points</strong></span>

In a word, yes. This deck runs about as minimal a Rokket package as you'll find, but the benefits of a zero-cost starter like Quick Launch are just too great to give one damn about remaining faithful to the Blue-Eyes archetype. Since the basic combo requires going through Striker Dragon, too, better to plus off its effect by adding Boot Sector Launch to hand. If you make Striker with a Rokket too, he can recycle that same Rokket back to your hand to special summon again via Boot Sector.

Rokket Tracer's effect is equally outrageous, though it must be activated with care in this build. Tracer can pop any card on your field to special summon another Rokket from the deck, which allows it to singlehandedly make Chaos Ruler (Rokket Recharger) or set up extended plays requiring a level-1 tuner (Rokket Synchron). However, activating this effect locks the player into only summoning dark monsters from the extra-deck for the remainder of the turn. Considering dark monsters comprise only about half of the extra-deck, this should be activated only after making Hieratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres or whatever light monsters the player plans to summon.

This restriction is the single greatest breakdown in synergy between Blue-Eyes and Dragon Link as a deck. In typical Dragon Link decks, making Spheres is the only serious consideration before using Tracer's effect. Unfortunately, Blue-Eyes and its associated monsters are, with one or two exceptions, a light archetype--as are many of the staple rank-8 XYZ dragons, like Hope Harbinger. This means players will often be unable to optimally use Tracer's pop-summon effect. Other Rokkets, like Rokket Synchron and the recently released Rokket Caliber, have similar loyalties to dark-attribute monsters, making them uncomfortable fits alongside the ultimate creature of destruction.Â But while the partnership is uncomfortable, the Rokket engine and its ability to start and extend boards is just too powerful to excise, even from Blue-Eyes Dragon Link. There's literally nothing else quite like it (yet).

The contradiction between the Blue-Eyes and Rokket engines find its synthesis in the Chaos Dragon engine: the black and white level-4s, Chaos Dragon Levianeer and 3x Chaos Space. Starliege Seyfert--probably the best single starter in any conceivable dragon deck at the moment--rounds out the package with its incredible search capacity and extender-effect in-grave, which synergizes perfectly with the larger-than-average amount of level-8 dragons in this deck. The Chaos cards make use of the light and dark attribute dragons--and when they can't use one, they can swap them out for another they can use.

<strong>No Dragon Ravine? No Romulus?</strong>

It's Blue-Eyes Dragon Link. There's no space in the deck to run the typical Dragon Link engine card-for-card. One of the casualties here is Dragunity Knight - Romulus and the field spell it searches, Dragon Ravine. I found that making Rom before Saryuja ended with a fragmented, half-built board that ran out of gas before it could establish itself. Making Rom after Saryuja, on the other hand, was practically pointless--I had all the extenders I needed to build a solid board. Without Rom, Dragon Ravine becomes a one-of destined to get lost in the main deck and pop up at inconveniently inconsistent times. It's essential in Dragon Link, but I don't think it works with the Blue-Eyes engine.

<strong>No REDMD?</strong>

Originally I ran this deck with 1x Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon and 1x Black Metal Dragon, the latter searching the former when sent from field to grave. No doubt REDMD is a powerful extender that typical Dragon Link decks run as a staple. After enough rounds with this deck, however, it became clear that I'd almost never normal summon Black Metal Dragon and link it off to search the big boy. The deck has plenty of normal summons, most of which are far more essential to the core combo than REDMD. Black Metal Dragon's stipulation that it must leave the field for the grave for its effect to activate also makes it poor discard fodder. But without the search, REDMD never shows up consistently enough in-hand to make an impact on the match. I couldn't care less about fealty to the anime, which seems to animate (no pun intended) a bizarre amount of Blue-Eyes players. If REDMD boosts a deck's consistency and power, you should run it. Put simply, it didn't so I didn't.

<span><strong>When the 'most-competitive-possible' still can't compete: Final Thoughts</strong></span>

After building both the fusion and ritual Blue-Eyes decks, I'm certain that Dragon Link is the most competitively viable way to play Blue-Eyes in the current format. Purists who, bafflingly enough, still haven't gotten the memo that all the Eyes with Blue tuners--with the notable exception of Sage--are too situational to play, will often balk at running a DLink build. Over half the cards in here have no direct connection to the archetype--and some have no connection at all. But this deck isn't for players who mainly enjoy casual games against similarly powered, casual decks. I arrived here after building the other BEWD decks and learning through practical experience that they simply couldn't compete--and more importantly,Â <em>whyÂ </em>they couldn't compete. Casual play is fine. I wanted to play competitively, however. Shedding most of the Blue-Eyes cards was a slow process for me (documented in the Rank-8 Dragon Link deck profile from last month), but there's no doubt the deck improved--and crucially so did I.

That all being said, Blue-Eyes Dragon Link is still not a competitive deck beyond the local level. The core issue of bricks remains in place. Blue-Eyes Dragon Link works better than other deck builds because it converts the archetype's signature disadvantage--the 33% chance of seeing at least one (1) dead-brick, vanilla BEWD in any given five-card opening hand--into an advantage in the form of drawing more cards. If you can get this resource system online and working, it can generate very strong boards and win against decks out of its league.

There's the rub, though:Â <em>if</em> this resource system gets online. With Guardragon Elpy banned, Blue-Eyes Dragon Link has a far more linear combo path than typical Dragon Link decks, making it extremely fragile and open to disruption. I found that the deck played decently through one mid-level disruption, like Ash Blossom, if I had at least one superior extender in-hand. More than that, I'd have to try to scramble into a playable board before running out of options. Failing to make Saryuja with four (4) materials blows a major hole in the strategy, and the setup itself is requires at least two of the optimal combo-starters to show up in the opening hand.

This leads to another point: What's the optimum size for a Blue-Eyes deck? Conventional wisdom would say, decks are better and more consistent at 40-cards. But that isn't always the case. A deck like Blue-Eyes, any variety, that runs as many bricks--searchable bricks, at that--as it does will draw into those bricks at a higher frequency as the total card count drops. As such, I don't think any Blue-Eyes deck should run 40 cards. On the other hand, while a larger deck lowers the probability of drawing Blue-Eyes, it also lowers the probability of drawing any other particular card--let alone combinations of two different cards. These two elements of deck-building--consistency through lower card counts and consistency through diluting potential bricks--are in contradiction with one another.

The answer isn't necessarily a middle ground, although I found that to generally work in this case. 45 cards in the main deck lowers the probability of a Blue-Eyes opening draw--and especially a multiple BEWD draw--enough to actually boost the deck's mathematical consistency. However, going above 45 resulted in almost never seeing Sage + Melody in the opening hand either. I think 43-45 represents the ideal size of a Blue-Eyes Dragon Link deck, which leaves plenty of room in smaller builds for another set of hand-traps or other tech.

So long as YuGiOh continues, players will continue flocking to Blue-Eyes White Dragon and Dark Magician. We should expect Konami to continue releasing support, both to meet existing demand from fans and to draw former players like me back into the game. Frankly, I think both offer great re-entry points into modern YuGiOh for returning players--the outrageously high cost of Dark Magician support aside. All it goes to say is, 'the optimum Blue-Eyes deck build' is not set in (white) stone. The collective game experience of many thousands of players will determine what works best in practice.

Bird Up,baby.","Standard bird list. I do not use the Dogmatika engine because I don't like it,and personally this deck is better without it. If your opponent knows you're on Floo,Nadir is no longer Ash bait. if you don't open the field spell,which is half the time,you won't be able to even access the Dogmatika engine,or your birds. So I chose to run Cherries targets,and Harpie's Feather Storm. Cherries is sometimes an auto-win,and Feather Storm buys you a turn when things go wrong,or when you can't reach your win condition and your bird is negated. You can just snowball next turn after activating Feather Storm,since you mostly won't die."

All you need is <strong>Halq + 1 fusion spell/trap</strong>, while Albaz in GY/hand. But if we dont draw Necro Fusion/Trap Trick or 1 of the Branded in Red/White, we can only make 5 dragons. Also Branded in Red is worse than the 3, because it uses field and hand material only, means need more card to do the combo.

The cards missing are PUNK engine:

3 Foxy Tune

2 Seamin

1 Numeral Ogre"

This card counts as a Blue-Eyes White Dragon when it is on the field and/or the graveyard so it can unlock other cards in the decks effects when in either location.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon</a></strong> is a card that at base will always protect all other cards from destruction when it is on the field regardless of anything else. When you have a Blue-Eyes White Dragon on the field or in the graveyard it can also unlock all of its other effects, which includes a special summon whenever something is destroyed and a bounce before battle step. This card provides a lot of defense to your field. Blue-Eyes Alternative Dragon compliments well with this card.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a></strong> is a generic dragon extender that can usually help you make more plays depending on what the game state is.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Chaos Dragon Levianeer&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Chaos Dragon Levianeer</strong> </a>is much like Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon that it can extend plays with its revival, but it can also provide destruction if you need it, which can also proc Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon</a></strong> searches for Polymerization when it is summoned and can search basically any of the high level dragons on the end of your turn to set yourself up potentially for your next turn.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Dragon Spirit of White&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Dragon Spirit of White</strong> </a>is a targeting banish toward the backrow and bypasses destruction protection.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""The Tyrant of D"">The Tyrant of D</a>.</strong> can mill a <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</strong>, can send a card from your hand to the grave to revive a Blue-Eyes monster, and is one of the best starters in the deck. You can also pick what the opponent attacks if you have a Blue-Eyes monster on the field with it.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""White Stone of Ancients"">White Stone of Ancients</a></strong> can special summon out any of your Blue-Eyes monsters at the end of your turn. This can plant <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</strong> onto the field to enable effects, summon out <strong>Abyss</strong> to draw a Polymerization and a dragon, get out <strong>Jet</strong>, or summon <strong>Dragon Spirit of White</strong> to pop a card with its banish.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""White Stone of Legend"">White Stone of Legend</a></strong> has you draw a <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</strong> whenever it is sent to the graveyard.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Sage with Eyes of Blue"">Sage with Eyes of Blue</a></strong> can discard and target an effect monster on your side of the field to summon the same dragons listed for <strong>White Stone of Ancients</strong> or it can be normal summoned to search for<strong> White Stone of Legends</strong>, which <strong>Tyrant</strong> can then toss, <strong>White Stone of Ancients</strong>, <strong>Maiden with Eyes of Blue</strong>, and even <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> if you choose to run that. <strong>Sage</strong> works amazingly well with <strong>Tyrant</strong>.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Maiden with Eyes of Blue&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Maiden with Eyes of Blue</strong> </a>is mainly here for the potential utility she has with Sage for potential Xyz or link plays. She also works well with Apparition to get more cards onto the field.</li>

It can protect one or all of your dragons from immediate destruction, be it from battle or card effects, one time. Combine this with <strong>Jet</strong> and you could retain your protection on the field even if they manage to have had a pop on <strong>Jet</strong>.</li>
 	<li><b><a data-name=""Harpies Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> </b>is because you only have two other forms of backrow removal in this deck in the way of <strong>Dragon Spirit of White</strong> or <strong>Ultimate Fusion</strong>.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a></strong> flows well with <strong>Abyss</strong> as it can be searched by it and it can work in conjunction with <strong>Ultimate Fusion</strong> to get out more than one fusion for a turn.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Melody of Awakening Dragon"">Melody of Awakening Dragon</a></strong> is your main search that can search most of your high level dragons. It opens up a lot of your plays and opens up the engine along with Sage and the Stones.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a></strong> allows you to either potentially bait a negate, draw a card after you've expended your searches, and thins the deck so you can get straight to your engine.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong> is an extender that can revive legitimately anything from either graveyard. This can open up plays that may not have been possible before, recover a play that was negated, or simply revive a boss monster or key monster from your opponent's graveyard to enhance your field or disrupt them.</li>

 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Baroness De Fleur"">Baroness De Fleur</a></strong> works is an omni-negate that can revive anything lower level than her after her negate runs out to either be remade again, to revive a combo piece, or to perhaps retrieve another boss monster you had lost or used up.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon"">Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon</a></strong> protects all dragons from destruction and prevents your opponent from targeting your dragons.

 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon</a></strong> is a floodgate that prevents two monster from being summoned at once from either side of the field. This limits what an opponent can do already, but it can also negate an effect activated in the graveyard and can tag out to another light dragon, such as <strong>Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon</strong>.</li>

 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu</a></strong> is a non-targeting send and protects other cards from destruction much like <strong>Return</strong> does, but it applies to more than just dragons.

 	<li><strong><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Avramax&lt;/strong&gt;"">Mekk Knight Crusadia Avramax </a></strong>can overcome most boss monsters, particularly ones with protections from destruction or targeting.

 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a></strong> is a targeting bounce to get around floating effects when monsters are sent to the graveyard. It also can work with <strong>IP</strong> to activate on the opponent's turn to bounce back a combo piece from the opponent to disrupt their plays. The discard could also be used to send one of your stones from hand to the graveyard.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;I:P Masquerna&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>IP Masquerena</strong></a> can work on the opponent's turn.

 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Hieratic Seal"">Hieratic Seal</a></strong> tributes itself to bounce the opponent much like <strong>Unicorn</strong>. On top of the bounce it also can summon a dragon from your deck. (<strong>Jet</strong>)</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a></strong> is mainly here to transform your stones into a link and for its compatibility with <strong>Red-Eyes Darkness Metal</strong> because then you don't have to banish your Stones to summon it out.

<div><em><strong><span>Other potential considerations to keep in mind</span>:</strong></em></div>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Alternative</strong> being summoned if you either had <strong>Melody</strong> to search it or it was already in hand. You would use this instead of <strong>Jet</strong> for the <strong>Baronne</strong> play.</li>
 	<li><strong>Jet</strong> if you are playing on your opponent's turn because <strong>Alternative</strong> or another means could have proc'd its effect to jump in.</li>
 	<li>Any potential fusions plays depending on draws.</li>
 	<li>However many <strong>White Stone of Ancients</strong> you managed to manipulate into the grave via other means.</li>
 	<li><strong>Maiden / Apparition</strong> could get more monsters fielded. This generally opens up plays into Dingirsu or Avramax without many issues.</li>
 	<li><strong>Darkness Metal</strong> and <strong>Levianeer</strong> due to their basic functionality.</li>
 	<li>If you get <strong>Alternative</strong> and <strong>Jet</strong> out together, you can also go into <strong>Hieratic Seal</strong> and then play make into <strong>Needlefiber</strong> into the <strong>Spirit</strong> plays as necessary afterwards as well.</li>
 	<li>The times you make <strong>IP</strong>, you can use her with <strong>White Stone of Ancients</strong> to go into <strong>Unicorn</strong> plays for its bounce.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p><strong><span>Combo 2</span></strong>: <em><span>Melody + Tyrant + Tuner ( 3 card combo ).</span></em></p>
1) Special summon Tyrant by sending a Blue-Eyes White Dragon from grave. Field = Tyrant

2) Use Melody to search Blue-Eyes White Dragon + Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon.

3) Special summon Alternative White Dragon. Field = Tyrant + Alternative

4) Pitch the Blue-Eyes to summon one of the two in the grave to the field. Field = Tyrant + Alternative + Blue-Eyes

5) Summon Hieratic Seal. Field = Hieratic Seal + Tyrant

6) Summon tuner. Field = Hieratic Seal + Tyrant + Tuner

7) Make Needlefiber with tuner and Tyrant and activate its effect to summon White Stone of Ancients. Field = Hieratic Seal + Needlefiber + White Stone of Ancients

8) Make Striker Dragon. Field = Hieratic Seal + Needlefiber + Striker Dragon

9) Summon Jet/Abyss much like the previous combo and follow the same steps to Baroness. Field = Baroness + Hieratic Seal + Striker Dragon

*** = The main extension one would want here is Red-Eyes Darkness Metal because you could summon it on top of Striker Dragon to continue making more plays.

Use 'Astral Kuriboh' or 'Right-Hand Shark' to set up a 'Number 59: Crooked Cook' and ensure he's the only card on the field.

As soon as you have 'Creature Swap' or 'Mystic Box' in the clear use your remaining resources to summon 'Bahamut Shark' and cheat 'Number 30 Acid Golem of Destruction' onto your side of the field to use as the card sent to your opponent. This locks your opponent out of special summoning and burns for 2000 each turn, while keeping your field clear.

Whether burn damage, 'Final Countdown', or Exodia victory is soon to follow."

To do that we have batteryman solar and foolish burial to send him to gy, and we have mahunder/pahunder and photon sanctuary to summon some summer summoner, alowing you to special summon rai-oh you milled during your opponent turn. I also used ties of the brethren to bring him from the deck and lightning rod lord as an extra ties target. And also i used recycling batteries to recycle your smaller monsters as an extender/follow up. Other than that, the other cards are draw, defenses and toolbox."
