Otherwise, the deck follows the traditional HERO playstyle.  Play Guide  Search out <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Vision HERO Faris</a>(via Reinforcements/E-Emergency Call to search out Stratos, which can search any HERO monsters upon being summoned)  Summon Faris, also while dumping a HERO monster(preferably those with graveyard effects, like shadow mist, liquid soldier, etc.) then place a copy of Vision HERO Increase to the field as a continuous trap, release Faris, then summon Vision HERO Vyon, which then allows you to send a HERO monster to the graveyard(perferably shadow mist or Destiny HERO Malicious)(If you dumped shadow mist(provided that Shadow Mist wasn't used before), search Evil HERO Adusted Gold, then search out Dark Calling) then Banish a HERO from the grave to search polymerization, and link the two Vision HEROs for Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer to reveal Flame Wingman(If necessary, Neos Kluger) to search out Bustnatrix and Avian.  Fuse Bustnatrix and Avian for Elemental HERO Sunriser to search out a copy of Miracle fusion  If normal summon is still available, summon a HERO monster from hand to link summon Xtra HERO Wonder Driver, then summon a HERO to the bottom center arrow of Wonder Driver to retrieve an fusion/change spell card, and use Wonder Driver and an available HERO monster to go into Xtra HERO Dread Decimator(for this, preferably use Malicious, or an atm useless fusion monster). And then summon either Flame Wingman, or one of the omni HEROs(Escuridao or Absolute Zero).

Not that deck is not strong enough already xD, But for even more competitive play Deck can be edited using side deck cards such as ice dragon prison, infinite impermanence, harpie's feather nibiru, kaiju etc. For even more consistency you can add or replace some cardswith E-Emergency call, which i didn't add cause deck is already consistent , and with Isoldel effect i can add any hero card to my hand making E-Emergency call less required."

So the strat is simple sending your zombie monster to the GY with the Uni-zombie and the Samurai skull. you can also get rid of cards in your opp hand with Hand destruction while you can send your dead zombie card to the GY. Mezuki cuz we need to summon back either our rituals (once they have already been ritual summoned) or some folder to link on your Vampire sucker or Cross-sheep. We only use the 3 revenant and 3 houndhorde sinc they give the effect to banish monster or Spell/traps which is really good atm. Pre-preparation of rites due to the deck being a ritual based deck, but we can only get Revendread origin and Revendread slayer to our hand, but it's good enought combo to make the deck run quite well. The deck have lots of weaness, can't really play throught 2 handtraps or even 1 with a bad hand, but most of the time it's full combo. with 2 ritual monster on the board+ a link 2, you can even add an I:P masquerena so you can go for an apolousa during your opponent turn.  And.. that's it. not a lot to say it's a TCG exclusive deck with good artwork, good lore and mechanics but lacks a good engine and the endboard is not that sufficient nowadays but it's good enought for casual player, pretty cheap, exept for hand traps but you can easily go for sets of forbidden lances chalice and robe so no worries :)"

Then for this combo do the following:  skull dread summon belial  summon valk and wyverburster  make nyarla and use it's effect to make it rank 11  make reprodocus  use reprodocus to make nyarla a light  use astral force to go into iC1000  use burning bamboo and equip broken to anything  activate terminal world  set anti-spell and thunder of ruler  pass turn  opponent's end phase you win by iC1000's effect ( I think)(you don't)  instead equip xyz unit to numeronia and Kill them next turn (the other effect can still just be used to mess with them)  You won't deck out if you discard deep-seated for hand size."

Something not too hard to learn and no long combos to memorize? Well, I've got just what you need....  Paleo frog has been around in various forms for the past four or so years as a rogue strategy that always shows up in bigger tournaments. The deck revolves around traps and interrupting your opponent's lines of play. I feel this is the best way for a new player to learn the game as the more you play against different decks, the more you learn to counteract them. With combo decks you just focus on what you want to do.  This is a budget version of the deck so sadly you only get two copies of toadally awesome. Getting a third copy will be top priority as well as three copies of trap trick. Luckily, you can get those cards for perhaps 5 or 6 dollars more total. As it stands this will certainly hold you for a while at a locals level."

That being said, the Legendary Fisherman III is more like a ""bank shot"" and only comes out occasionally, its more often a Tatsunoko or Moray of Greed target when its around too early in the hand.  The build isn't 100% perfect. I'm pretty sure there are some better cards to employ than some of these. If anything, its meant to be a skeleton as you can add and remove cards as you please according to you and also give yourself ideas on how to make a Fisherman Water deck playable.  I am aware there is a better way to play Fisherman with cards such as the Combat Star cards, but meh, often has felt weird to me playing them like that and it not being a true Water deck like intended for the monster and being true to Mako Tsunami. But I also wouldn't mind hearing ideas for Legendary Fisherman and seeing what kind of deck you can build around it whether Water or not.  Main idea is simple enough regarding combos, one combo only requires you needing a Megalo and Deep Sea Diva in hand.  &gt;NS Diva &gt;Activate Diva effect, SS Neptabyss &gt;Activate Neptabyss effect, send Dragoon to  GY, add a 2nd Dragoon to hand &gt;Activate Dragoon effect in GY, add a 2nd Neptabyss to hand &gt;Activate Megalo, discard Nebtabyss and Dragoon, SS Megalo &gt;Activate both the 2nd Neptabyss's and 2nd Dragoon's effect, Neptabyss will SS a Dragoon from GY while the Dragoon you discarded with Megalo will add another Megalo to hand or something else if already have a Level 7 in hand. &gt;Link off Diva and Megalo for Needlefiber &gt;Activate Needlefiber effect, SS another Diva &gt;Synchro Summon Tatsunoko with 2nd Diva and Neptabyss &gt;Synchro Summon Bihamut with Tatsunoko and Level 7 in hand (Probably Megalo if you added him to hand earlier) &gt;Activate Bihamut effect, SS Token &gt;Link off Needlefiber, the Token, and Dragoon for a Apollousa (3 negates) Then opponent's turn, SS another Token with Bihamut."

We'll start by opening 1 Booster Box (24 packs) of the first five packs released during the 5Ds era: from The Duelist Genesis to Ancient Prophecy. I was very fortunate to open a good pool of the Blackwing cards and some versitial Synchro monsters with Red Dragon Archfiend as my deck's current ace. I also pulled some of the Assault mode cards including Red Dragon Archfiend/Assualt Mode so having that in the side could come in handy. For spell and trap removal I'll have to rely on Power Tool Dragon (to search Double Tool or Silver Wing) and Release Restraint. Initialy my strategy was to use Fane the Steel Chain's effect to deal damage through piercing with Bora the Spear or Armed Wing; however, as a level 2 non-tuner, it doesn't fit the roll of synchro material with what I have available: Gishilnodon requires a level 3 non-tuner which means I'll most likely use Blizzard to bring back a Kalut from grave to summon it and without a level 1 Blackwing tuner, I wouldn't be able to use a level 3 and Fane to summon Armed Wing. However, Blizzard + Kalut and Fane can make level 7 synchros or Gale + Kalut and Fane could make Red Dragon Archfiend, but that requires a little more setup. For now, Fane will be in the side deck along with my Assault Mode support, 3 copies of Fake Feather, and 2 copies of Gozen Match. The Arcanite Magician wouldn't be usable but because I have some Assault Mode support I thought I'd include it in the extra deck."

It won’t top any tournaments or anything like that, but it is a fun","<span>Welcome to my updated Abhyss list!! The new spell just dropped and it is really good. It is basically a foolish burial for any reptile and can also serve as a monster reborn if you have 5 or more reptiles in the GY. Getting the reptiles in the graveyard is fairly easy using snake rain, aka the painful choice of the deck. The new spell can also be searched VERY easily and can be used to summon the big level 8 Abhyss monsters from the GY without having to tribute monsters!! I am playing a level 8 (and kind of level 4) focused deck since all the abhyss monsters are either level 4 or 8. This deck is more focused on level 8’s than 4’s. For level 8 support (8-axis) we are playing 3 danger! Bigfoot!, 3 danger! Thunderbird!, 3 trade-in (staple), 3 alpha, 3 sea turtle kaiju, 3 sticky string kaiju and all of the level 8 abhyss monsters. This is a going 2nd OTK based deck purely focused on breaking boards and killing the opponent. Going 2nd you can use the various removal cards you have to break boards, the kaiju slumbers, all 6 kaijus, alpha (synergises well with kaijus since it can bounce a kaiju the opponent has back to your hand and then you can summon the kaiju back to your opponent’s field by tributing something else and alpha can bring itself back to the field as a rank 8 xyz target), bigfoot and thunderbird (have removal effects when discarded). Then your goal is to get 2 level 8 monsters on to your field and go into Number 97: Dragublion. Then you can use its effect to summon numeron dragon from the extra deck and you can otk using it since it will have 9000 attack after you use it’s effect. It’s attack will be 13000 if you have a rank 4 on the field as well (very likely) and that can hit over any monster the opponent controls with 5000 or less attack (I highly doubt they will have anything with that much attack so it is pretty much a win). If they put their monsters in defense - SLAP A KAIJU ON THEM!! The deck is not dead going 1st either. The plan going 1st is to set up your deity of the abhyss, a dweller and a hope harbinger (best case scenario) or the board can even be as simple as a Bagooska pass. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>I think overall this deck is very solid and is a good rogue tier OTK deck at best. It won’t top any tournaments or anything like that, but it is a fun deck to mess around with and also allows you to take a break from the meta and have some fun!! To me personally it is amazing to have a break from the meta, I post mostly meta decks but building and testing this deck for a change was very enjoyable indeed. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you are interested, I do an in depth deck profile and combo tutorial in my youtube channel, I recommend watching it since it can help you understand what I actually said on here and you will get a basic understanding of how the deck is played. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF1sTi69cQE</a></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Also make sure to answer the poll question down below!!

The amazement cards do not change how the deck is played,"<span>Hello all and welcome to my Amazing Zoodiac Eldlich build!! The deck is Amazing because it uses some cards from the Amazement archetype (LIOV). They synergie very well with this deck because of how many traps the deck plays. Amazement is also an archetype revolving around traps and combined with eldlich they are Amazing!!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Before we do the deck explanation, just a quick reminder that the deck explanation, All the combos and explanations on ways to best use your resources are ALL on my Youtube video. Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me and the channel!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the video - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESRWceGnH4o</a></span>  &nbsp;  <b>BANLIST NOTICE (IMPORTANT)</b>  &nbsp;  <span>If something in this deck were to get hit on the March 2021 banlist (very unlikely), it will not be something major. The worst thing that can possibly happen would be a sanguine semi limit or a eldland semi limit or a tenki limit. NONE OF THESE DO ANYTHING TO THIS DECK. If something were to happen, I’ll make sure to update the list after the banlist with the minor changes. If tenki were to get hit (unlikely - did not even get hit in the zoo format) - just play more zoo bodies. If sanguine gets hit, just play an extra white or black elixdir (depends on play style) and if eldland were to get hit, just play how many ever copies of it as possible and fill up space in the main deck with handtraps. I will update the deck when the banlist drops so do not fret. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Why administrator is OP (In this deck)</b><span> - </span>  &nbsp;  <span>The deck is not running the entire amazement package. It is running the absolute minimum to keep this deck in the meta tier. This is better than the basic zoo eldlich build because this can put up more interruptions. For the amazement cards we are playing 3 Amazement Administrator and 3 of the amazement attraction horror house (the one with the book of moon effect) and that is all. Administrator is OP because of how much it can disrupt the opponent, break boards and generate advantage. Yes, that 1 card can do all of that. Administrator can special summon itself when a trap is activated. Then, it can equip the attraction trap from the deck onto an opponent's monster to flip it face down. Now since the monster is facedown, the equip card goes to the GY (equip cards go to the GY if the target it is equipped to leaves the field or is flipped face down) so the trap will be in the GY. Then you can banish the trap from the grave to destroy a card on the field! It is any card on the field, monster or back row, face up or face down!! On top of all of that you have a monster on the field to link off into (depending on your situation) one of the knightmares or even Black luster Soldier!! When you draw it with imperm or if your opponent plays any kind of trap that can activate itself turn 1, making it a VERY high impact handtrap. It can also use it’s removal effect during your turn and be liked for more devastation. When you go first, since the deck has so many traps, it just adds up to your negates and makes it easier to OTK next turn with the removal and since it can be linked. This card literally brings the whole package. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Deck Ratios</b><span> -</span>  &nbsp; <table>  <tr> <td><span>Amazement! Cards </span> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3 administrator </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3 attraction horror house (the one with the book of moon effect)</span></li> </ul> </td> <td><span>For the amazement cards we are playing 3 Amazement Administrator and 3 of the amazement attraction trap card and that is all. The trap negates an opponent’s monster’s effect or flips a monster the opponent controls face down based on which monster it is equipped to. The monster (administrator) can summon itself when a trap is activated (when either player activates a trap) as a quick effect (can be done on opponent’s turn) and it can also equip a monster on the field with an attraction trap (quick effect). This makes it a handtrap essentially and can also cause more damage next turn by banishing the attraction trap you equipped from the graveyard to use administrators’ removal effect (assuming the monster you equipped the card to left the field). The trap (if drawn without the monster) is not a brick because it is basically a book of moon and can simply be set like any other trap. You can also resolve administrator constantly going 1st and second for an high impact negate. If the opponent is playing some kind of trap based deck that administrator can come in clutch. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Zoodiac Cards</span> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3 ramram</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2 whiptail</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3 tenki</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1 barrage </span></li> </ul> </td> <td><span>I am playing 3 Ramram (2000 defense and protects you against dangerous traps) and 2 Whiptail (can attach itself and has the removal effect that banishes) for the monsters. 5 is more than enough and there are plenty of ways to search these. For spells I am playing 3 Tenki (can search any zoo) and 1 barrage (can pop itself to special a zoo from the deck). In total that is 9 cards to search zoo monsters and that is ≈ ¼ of the deck. You should expect a zoo monster in hand in about 1 in 4 cards which is the ideal ratio. Tenki is really good with eldlich since it is a continuous spell. It can be sent to the GY to bring back golden boy with 3500 attack. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Eldlich Ratios</span> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2 golden lord</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3 eldland</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3 sanguine</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3 Haquero</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3 conquistador</span></li> </ul> </td> <td><span>I am playing 2 Golden lord for the monsters (Obviously the only eldlich monster). For Spells I am playing 3 Eldland (only good eldlich spell). For traps I am playing 3 sanguine (the best elixdir trap), 3 Haquero (can banish from the GY) and 3 Conquistador (can pop). This is just the standard eldlich ratio, no explanation needed there. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Non archetypical Traps</span> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3 Imperm</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3 solemn strike</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2 Dinomischus</span></li> </ul> </td> <td><span>By this I mean traps that do not go with eldlich or amazement. For this I am playing 3 Imperm (is a handtrap as well), 3 solemn strike (high impact negation, is also a counter trap) and 2 Dinomischus (great removal and can bring itself back from the GY to use as link material). All of these are to set and interrupt the opponent. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Handtraps</span> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3 ash</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3 imperm</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3 administrator (in some cases)</span></li> </ul> </td> <td><span>I am playing 3 ash (counter literally anything) and 3 imperm (is not only a real trap but a handtrap as well). Yes I know I included imperm in both categories. Imperm is a good option because if you activate it, it lets you bring out administrator turn 1 (opponent’s turn) and you can equip the attraction trap using administrator to an opponent’s monster later in the turn for a high impact disruption!! (Book of moon during opponent’s first turn)</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Bricks</span> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>none</span></li> </ul> </td> <td><span>BRICKLESS LETS GOOOOOOO</span></td> </tr>  </table> &nbsp;  <b>The extra deck</b><span> -</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The extra deck is just 2 of every zoodiac monster (except drident which is limited) and 2 zeus for the xyz (zoodiac) package. For the links you have Knightmare Phoenix (pops backrow), Knightmare Unicorn (shuffles), Black Luster Soldier (OTK) and Barricageborg Blocker (recycle). </span><b>Notice all the link monsters do not list effect monsters as materials so you can link the golden land traps into them as well. </b>  &nbsp;  <b>Conclusion</b><span> -</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The deck is very strong overall and is definitely a tier 1 contender in the current metagame. The amazement cards do not change how the deck is played, it is just an extra mechanic that the deck uses to make it more powerful. Amazement makes this deck better in a number of ways and that is why this deck is Amazing!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Remember that the deck explanation, All the combos and explanations on ways to best use your resources are ALL on my Youtube video.

Fairy Tail ensure you can get monster of different attributes on the field as soon as possible. Playing multiples of 'Awakening of Possessed' will give your Possessed/Familiar monster a huge stat boost and protection against card effect. Link summon as needed (based on the dominate attribute played your opponent.) Getting Dark Doriado into your pendulum zone maximizes attack power.

Ya que el uso de Alpha y Zeta es intercambiable, sirve para buscar a cualquiera de los dos.</li>  	<li><strong>Jack in the Hand: </strong>Debe ser usado primero por ser algo impredecible. Usualmente escogeremos a Alpha, Zeta y Gamma. Si el oponente toma a Alpha o Zeta, escogemos al otro. Si toma a Gamma, no hay problema, ya que llevamos otra copia, y además escogemos al Drytron que necesitamos.</li>  	<li><strong>Cyber Emergency: </strong>Literalmente trae a la mano cualquier Drytron.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish Burial:</strong> Cuando hablamos de Drytron, el cementerio y la mano son casi lo mismo.</li>  	<li><strong>Drytron Nova:</strong> Trae a cualquier Drytron al campo, el cual puedes enviar al cemenerio al usarlo para invocar a Linkuriboh.</li>  	<li><strong>Drytron Fafnir: </strong>Añade a Nova a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Preparation of Rites: </strong>Sirve para traer a Benten a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Ritual Sanctuary: </strong>Trae a Benten a coste de descartar una magia, que en este deck, hay de sobra.</li>  	<li><strong>Terraforming: </strong>Es el más versátil, ya que puede traer a Fafnir (si necesitas un Drytron) o a Ritual Sanctuary (si necesitas a Benten).</li> </ul> <strong>Ladrillos:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>The Agent of Judgement - Saturn: </strong>Con él rematamos al oponente, además que al invocarse, activa el efecto de Benten.</li>  	<li><strong>Soul of Purity and Light: </strong>Con ella tendremos los materiales necesarios para invocar a Chronomaly Atlandis.</li>  	<li><strong>Zeradias, Herald of Heaven: </strong>Descartándolo, tendremos The Sanctuary in the Sky.</li>  	<li><strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky:</strong> Es necesario para resolver el efecto de Agent Saturn.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente.</li>  	<li>No tiene garnets, y el único ladrillo verdadero es Drytron Meteornis, por lo que todo es útil.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear Impermanence y Veiler en Mu-Beta Fafnir si tienes un buscador extra para Gamma.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps tempranas con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil de añadir los requisitos al estar el Deck lleno de buscadores.</li>  	<li>Si todo falla, con los cuerpos en campo se puede hacer invocaciones Link poderosas (como Masquerena-&gt;Kurnugias en turno del oponente), ya que el combo no usa todo el extra deck</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, puede que toque puro Drytron o puro Benten/ladrillo, en cuyo caso es gg.</li>  	<li>El deck depende de que tú y el oponente tengan los mismos LP al inicio. Si el oponente consigue aumentar sus LP o quemar la tuya, el combo no funcionará.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>La prioridad para traer a los ladrillos es muy importante. Siempre es Saturn &gt; Soul of Purity &gt; Zeradias. Saturn no puede ser el último, ya que su invocación activa un Benten, si nos olvidamos de él, es gg. Soul of Purity es necesario para traer a Atlandis, el cual se activa antes que Saturn, y aunque es posible invocar a Saturn antes que a Atlandis, no es así si hemos baiteado un Veiler con Mu-Beta Fafnir. Zeradias sólo es necesario al final de todo, por lo que no es tan importante para realizar los combos.</li> </ul>"

As far as I'm aware, there are no Magician of Faith / Needle Worm decks out there in the same sense as this deck.</span></span>  <span>The aim of this deck is to make your opponent draw out. Easy, right? It may seem unconventional and does require some patience, however I can assure you that this deck is more than capable of putting up a fight against some tougher decks. </span>  <span>Let's talk strategy. There are 2 main parts to this deck: the mill power, and the protect/prevent part (PPP :P)</span>  <span>PPP - I was hesitant to include it at first, but Mystic Mine will be your main form of protection in this deck. I know how frustrating it can be to less experienced players, which is why I was on and off about the idea, however, I finally gave in; sorry Swords of Revealing Light, you just won't cut it. To back up the Mystic Mine we have Field Barrier. This protects the mine from being destroyed by opponents, but also by it's own effect. Get both on the field and you're pretty much set - just make sure to play MM <strong>BEFORE </strong>FB. This deck also features the classic Battle Fader. You could exchange it for Swift Scarecrow which would probably be better, but I prefer Battle Fader :) <span>I have also included 3 copies of Threatening Roar. I think this card works perfectly for this deck. It can stop attacks, but due to it's nature, it can also be used to allow <b>only a few attacks through</b></span>. This means that you can let your opponent clear your board a little to make way for new monsters, while also reaping the benefits of their effect and then preventing any further assault, should you find yourself in a situation without Mystic Mine's effect.</span>  <span><span>Now for the mill power - there is of course the Needle Worm, which is better for situations where you need to mill your opponent quickly before it's too late. Make use of the Book of Moon/Taiyou to gain the worm's effect more than once per turn, leaving devastating amounts of your opponent's deck strewn to the grave. However there is one more little loop if you will in this deck. It is a simple, 2-card combo that works really well in my opinion, the Magician of Faith and Book of Eclipse (Bare in mind this only works if your opponent controls at least 1 non-link monster). Basically, you'll have a magician on the field. Activate the book and flip all monsters face-down. At the end of the turn, your opponent's will be flipped up, and they'll draw a card for each. For maximum gain from this little combo, activate the book as your opponent enters their battle phase; it'll prevent them from attacking :) (Chain to their End Phase if they skip battle). Then, during your turn, flip your magician, recover the book and repeat. </span><span>By having other magicians or worms on the field as well as this, you'll also be able to trigger their effects every turn, essentially allowing you to reuse spells and mill your opponent's deck indefinitely. This comes in handy for cards like The Shallow grave, where you can constantly reuse them, giving your opponent more and more monsters to fuel your combo.</span></span>  <span>Cup of Ace in this deck is a win-win card. If you flip heads, you get 2 cards closer to fulfilling your combo. If tails, well your opponent has another 2 cards shaved from their deck</span>  <span>Other cards in the deck are mainly draw power to help get the cards you need. The extra deck is mainly fodder for Extravagance, and can consist of any cards you wish, but the cards I've listed can come in handy in particular situations. I would like to note that the underrated card Clara and Rushka, the Ventriloduo is also included. If you don't fancy suiciding your Sangan or WotBF, then this link monster can also do the trick. Unfortunately, it can only be summoned during MP2, although this deck doesn't require any attacking anyways, so it works out pretty well, and it can easily be taken off the board with a Phoenix or Cerberus. What else.. Metaverse is self-explanatory, and so is Ojama Trio (give your opponent more monsters to fulfil Mystic Mine's conditions)</span>  <span>Something I would like to mention when it comes to playing this deck is this: DO NOT BE AFRAID TO PASS THE TURN! Sometimes it is better to just wait for cards to be drawn rather than playing every single move possible. One thing I've found is that it is very easy to find yourself with an abundance of Threatening Roars and Battle Faders, so even if you haven't got the mine, you'll always have a backup :)</span>  <span>Potential weaknesses to this deck that I've found are archetypes such as Kaijus and Monarchs that are able to tribute your monsters. Unfortunately, I have not found a way around this yet, but I'll be sure to update if and when I do. I also saw a guy who was running Monarchs and had a trap that would put spells/traps from their grave back into the deck, which allowed them to stall to victory.</span>  <span>This is my first upload on here and I hope that someone will find a good laugh in my quirky little creation here. Good luck duelists! <span>Feel free to contact my Discord to discuss this or any of my future decks with me, or even just brag about a sweet win you got with it - Katsuki#8104 :)</span></span>"

It is a Deck for casual play, that i used to play with my friends.  The ""main"" play of the Deck is to make I:P, set Geargiagear and go into Apollousa during your opponents turn.  Normal a Geargiano -&gt; Link into Almiraj to trigger Parallel eXceed is another cool ""play"" in case you brick with the Geargianos.  If you survive until turn 3, rank 4 plays are the way to go. The Machina cards add an explosiveness and the ability to grind to the deck.  Vespenate is the budget option to AA-Zeus.  The Deck dies basically to every Handtrap, has not to many options going second and is sometimes bricky.  Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day everyone!"

This archetype is really good at disrupting your opponent while gaining more resources, it can also fit in handtraps without losing it's consistency, which is important in the current meta due to the fast paced playstyle of decks nowadays.  Like what people says, ""The deck is only as good as its user"" this deck certainly lives up to that phrase, it's deadly when it's in the hand of a person who knows how to utilize it. As a control deck you need to study the decks that will be used by your fellow duelists, knowing which card to disrupt is the key factor for you to achieve victory.  <strong><span>Deck Component Explanation</span></strong>  <span>Altergeist Cards - A standard ratio of altergeist cards. I think most of the altergeist decks have the same ratio as this one because adding or subtracting of these cards will lower it's consistency.</span>  Handtraps - Handtraps are important in this fast paced meta, allowing your opponent to complete their combo without disruption is like asking to lose. <ul>  	<li>Ash Blossom is a must have since it can stop adding cards to the hand.</li>  	<li>The PSY-Frame bundle is my second favorite handtrap in this deck since it can disrupt your opponent and at the same time it can protect you from your opponent's handtraps.</li>  	<li>The last but not the least is my favorite handtrap in this deck, Infinite Impermanence, it synergize well with altergeist because you can trigger multifaker after you activate it.</li> </ul> Solemns - At first I was planning to put 3 judgment, but after I analyzed the meta, putting striker would be a good idea and since we have Imperial Order, it can make up for the other judgment.  Imperial Order - It's a good card in this control deck since this deck doesn't have many spell cards.  Extenders - <ul>  	<li>One for one is a must in an altergeist deck because it's an additional meluseek.</li>  	<li>Running one Three Tactical Talents is a good idea since it's versatile, you can use it's draw 2 if your extravagance or meluseek has been negated by ash blossom, or you can use it's take control effect to steal one of your opponent's monster.</li> </ul> Pot of Extravagance - Your one and only draw power card (not considering Three Tactical Talents). You can use this a bait for your opponent's handtrap to chain psy-frame gamma.  Forbidden Droplets - Just in case you lose the dice roll, you can use this to break your opponent's board that takes them 10 minutes to make, only to be destroyed by a control deck.  Extra Deck - The extra deck cards are pretty handy depending on the situation. <ul>  	<li>PSY-Framelord Omega - After you successfully resolve psy-framegear gamma, synchro summon this card to do it's thing.</li>  	<li>Borrelsword Dragon - In some cases that you need to finish the game fast because you feel the you can't control the game if it goes longer, have no worry as you have this card. Just pray that it doesn't get banish by pot of extravagance.</li>  	<li>Accesscode Talker - BOARD WIPE!!!!</li>  	<li>Knightmare Unicorn - If there is a card that limits your movement on the field, return it to the deck using this card.</li>  	<li>Primabanshee - Can be used to summon multifaker.</li>  	<li>Selene - An easier way to get your link 4 monsters</li>  	<li>Knightmare Phoenix - Same as knightmare unicorn but replace ""return it to the deck"" with ""destroy""</li>  	<li>Hexstia - Your favorite extra deck monster. Use this card against monsters that is not affected by card effects and has a big attack. Negate the spell/trap of your opponent. And add an alteregist card from your deck to your hand</li>  	<li>Linkuriboh - To trigger meluseek effects and to waste your opponent's attack.</li>  	<li>Almiraj - To trigger meluseek and silquitous.</li>  	<li>Anima - To trigger meluseek and equip your opponent's monster to this.</li> </ul> Side Deck - <ul>  	<li>Nibiru - THE ROCK!!!!!! To stop combo decks.</li>  	<li>HFD - Sweep your opponent's backrow.</li>  	<li>DRNM - Part of the 2 card deadly combo.</li>  	<li>Cosmic Cyclone - To get rid of your opponent's backrow. It's more effective against eldlich</li>  	<li>Evenly Matched - Part of the 2 card deadly combo.</li>  	<li>Summon Limit - Effective to completely control swarm decks.</li>  	<li>Imperial Iron Wall - Effective against banish decks and ELDLICH</li> </ul> <strong><span>Budget Friendly Alternatives</span></strong>  Three Tactical Talents - Book of Moon, It can bait your opponent's negates and can be use to disrupt their combo.  Pot of Extravagance - Pot of Duality, It is what it is.  Forbidden Droplets - Water Kaiju and Wind Kaiju, the downside of using this is you're gonna have a hard time against drytrons.  Accesscode Talker - Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax, Instead of a board wipe, you can just summon this card as a boss card.  <strong><span>Reminders</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>As a control deck it's important to study other decks in order to know when is the right time to disrupt them.</li>  	<li>Do not rush to end the game quickly (unless you cannot control your opponent any longer), remember you're using a control deck.</li>  	<li>Know how to play around when most of your extra deck cards are banished.</li>  	<li>After you activate altergeist manifestation, you can chain personal spoofing to return altergeist manifestation to your deck, in that way you can special summon an altergeist monster in your gy without the trap card being sent to the gy.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

 <span>3 ROM cloudia (mainly for backup and converter, latency comes up, but rarely)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 lady debug (get converter or secretary to help start your main combo)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 cyberse gadget (I love this card for it’s ability to be 3 monsters in one, mainly to start combo)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 widget kid (two for one to start combo)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 backup secretary (powerful extender in this deck)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 defcon bird (graveyard setup and monster on the field)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 cyberse converter (quick body, extender or starter if necessary)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 swap cleric (none of the link monsters in this deck need their attack points because you’re giving them to clock dragons so it’s just an easy draw)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 stack reviver (extender, helped me out a lot)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 dotscaper (easy to get out on the field, it’s also a two for one so use it)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 latency (for the draw)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 cynet fusion (key card in the deck)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 cynet mining (search, sometimes clock wyvern, sometimes a way to get two monsters)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 fusion conscription (quick access to clock wyvern)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2 cyberse clock dragon (win condition, one swing for the kill)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 diplexer chimera (safey and latency)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 code talker inverted (extender)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 clock lizard (heart and soul of the deck, I couldn’t have made this combo work without it, also it’s banish effect is not a once per turn so you can stack multiple if you used extenders)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 security dragon (if you used an extender then this can provide clearance)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 secure gardna (fusion material, explained later)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 clock spartoi (cynet fusion search)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 link devotee (despicable-devotee)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 link despicable (despicable-devotee)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 linkguriboh (for the big dragon)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 linkuribloh (for the big dragon)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The combo: </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Materials: clock wyvern and a way to get two cyberses out (gadget also works in this spot), go second, it’s okay to have the clock wyvern in your hand because of fusion conscription.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Summon the two cyberses</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link cyberse one to make despicable</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link cyberse two to make devotee</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Despicable eff tribute devotee to draw one and put one on the bottom</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Devotee summons two tokens</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link one token for linkuriboh</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link likuriboh and despicable for clock spatoni</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Spatoni searches cynet fusion (whatever you do do not use spatoni’s second effect)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link other token for linguriboh</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link linguriboh to make secure guardna</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Activate cynet fusion to fuse guardna with clock wyvern for a cyberse clock dragon</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link clock dragon with spatoni to make clock lizard</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Lizard eff tribute self put clock dragon into extra deck then banish every link monster in your grave to make cyberse clock dragon again</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Clock dragon then chain lizard</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Lizard weakens all special summoned monsters your opponent owns by 400 points for every cyberse in the grave</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Clock dragon mills cards on top of the deck to the grave for every link rating (link 2 = two cards for example) you used to summon it, if the combo was done normally then you’ll send 9 cards, for every card milled you gain 1000 attack points (if combo done normally then this totals up to 11500), attack a weakened monster and win game</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Alt note, if you have two spare cyberses in your hand you can use cynet fusion to fuse them to summon your diplexer then have it tribute itself, lock the spells and traps out of the battle phase and recycle cynet fusion.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Alt note, use the extenders to help get more link monsters in the grave if possible to boost your clock dragon, clock lizard’s banished effect is not once per turn so you can use it multiple times in a turn allowing for you to stack a lot of debuffs and make it so that you to swing for game more easily.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>I love the deck, the combo took some time to get used to but overall it’s really good and I find I'm able to end games very quickly and consistently using this combo.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>(my record is 17500, if you use this deck then tell me yours!)</span>"

The ""Traptrix"" archetype features a small arsenal of Level 4 monsters which not only interact with their own archetype but also search an play ""Hole"" Normal Trap cards quite extensively. Together with their Extra Deck monsters in form of two Link and two Xyz monsters, they stop the opposing monster summons to create an opening for attacks. But let us take a look at what cards I have thrown together for better understanding:</p> <p>The Main Deck features of the following monster cards: Three copies of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Myrmeleo"">Traptrix Myrmeleo</a>"" and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Mantis"">Traptrix Mantis</a>"" work as our Normal Summons, with ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Myrmeleo"">Traptrix Myrmeleo</a>"" searching the deck for a ""Hole"" Normal Trap card on Normal Summon, while ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Mantis"">Traptrix Mantis</a>"" gives us access to a ""Traptrix"" monster from the deck when Normal Summoned. Both are also useful outside of being Normal Summoned with ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Myrmeleo"">Traptrix Myrmeleo</a>"" bringing an in-archetypal backrow removal effect while ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Mantis"">Traptrix Mantis</a>"" can bounce the own backrow and set cards from the hand as a Quick Effect, which has some interaction with archetypes like ""Artifacts"" but mainly serves to dodge targeting effects like ""<a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>"" in this deck. One of the targets for the search effect of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Mantis"">Traptrix Mantis</a>"" is ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Ginalloa"">Traptrix Ginalloa</a>"", the newest Main Deck monster and a solid member of the archetype overall. For the cost of sending one of your ""Hole"" Trap cards to the graveyard she can Special Summon herself from the hand, therefore giving you another body on the field if every works out without disruption while giving you another try at building a board if the Normal Summon was negated earlier that turn. She also can banish herself from the graveyard to recycle a Trap card from your graveyard which also help fighting the battle against the opposing summons. ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Ginalloa"">Traptrix Ginalloa</a>"" also helps the deck by sending a Trap to the graveyard by giving a solid start to the last two ""Traptrix"" Main Deck monsters in this deck in form of two copies of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Dionaea"">Traptrix Dionaea</a>"" and a single copy of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Genlisea"">Traptrix Genlisea</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Dionaea"">Traptrix Dionaea</a>"" is very useful since she offers more Trap recycling on Special Summon and can therefore bring the Trap back the ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Ginalloa"">Traptrix Ginalloa</a>"" used while ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Dionaea"">Traptrix Dionaea</a>"" is also the ""Traptrix"" version of a ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" on legs when Normal Summoned. ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Genlisea"">Traptrix Genlisea</a>"" has only one effect, but she is no slouch either since she can tribute herself to fetch two Trap cards, one from the deck and one from the graveyard, to put onto your field. The rest of the Main Deck monsters is made up of three copies of ""<a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>"", which can Special Summon itself as a Level 4 monster when you summon your Link-1 monster in form of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Sera"">Traptrix Sera</a>"" and then fetches another copy of itself from the deck which also enters the field as a Level 4 monster and therefore sets you up nicely to go into a Rank 4 Xyz summon. Lastly, I play three copies of ""<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"" for the obvious use as a handtrap against deck searching effects the opponent might try to pull off.</p> <p>The Spell card section, as you can see, is quite barren with only a single copy of ""<a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a>"" which is used for the ""Utopia Double"" engine and basically allows you to produce a 10000 ATK beater as a Rank 4 Xyz monster. There are a few more Trap cards though: I run two copies of ""<a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>"" as a solid Trap card searching option, and its effect is also the reason why so many of the Trap cards are in the deck as a pair. ""<a data-name=""Time Space Trap Hole"">Time Space Trap Hole</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">Bottomless Trap Hole</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare"">Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Gravedigger's Trap Hole"">Gravedigger's Trap Hole</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Floodgate Trap Hole"">Floodgate Trap Hole</a>"" all are in the deck at a copy count of two and all provide destruction, negation and/or control effects in various situations. The non-""Hole"" Trap cards consist of three copies of ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a>"" to gain additional bodies for Rank 4 Xyz summons and, more importantly, to trigger ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Sera"">Traptrix Sera</a>"" during your first turn without the delay you would normally have when playing Trap cards. An additional three copies of ""<a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>"" keeps the opposing effect monsters at bay.</p> <p>The Extra Deck looks as follows: Xyz-wise, there is one copy of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Rafflesia"">Traptrix Rafflesia</a>"" as field protection for your other ""Traptrix"" monsters and as a handy effect to fire off ""Hole"" Trap card directly from the deck, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Allomerus"">Traptrix Allomerus</a>"" for various summoning schenanigans, the ""Utopia Double"" package featuring one copy of ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a>"" and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a>"" to ram into your opponent for the aforementioned 10000 ATK, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a>"" as a stall option,  one copy of ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" as Quick Effect backrow removal, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>"" to keep the opponent from using the graveyard. The Link monsters feature three copies of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Sera"">Traptrix Sera</a>"", who is your main play-enabler which searches and summons/places monsters and Traps directly from the deck, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Utricularia"">Traptrix Utricularia</a>"" as a fun little gimmick and solid option in grind games, one copy each of ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>"", and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>"" to destroy backrow/frontrow respectively while having the big boy to send things back into the deck, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>"" for the usual beatdown/game-ending Link-4 play.</p> <p>While certainly not my favorite deck playstyle-wise, I do have to admit that these carnivorous girls can put quite a nasty board together, and the newest support cards helps them both in making the deck more viable while also providing the creative players with more tools and gimmicks to make use of. The times when ""Traptrix"" only really worked as an engine together with some other archetype are definitely over, they form a solid deck that rightly deserve the amount of fans it gathered over the years.

I don't know what you want out of me.,"So this was a deck I made that I don't exactly remember the why as to it's creation. It's a deck that is built on the very simple gimmick of sheep-based monsters, and what they can do. It's by no means a ""great"" deck, (honestly, I don't think really any of the decks I build are ""great"", but that's neither here nor there.)  The main strategy of the deck I find to be the most useful is utilizing the tokens of Scapeghost and Sheep Cloud to either go into link plays leading into ""Unchained Abomination"", a fusion summon of ""Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon"", or a synchro summon of ""Armades, Keeper of Boundaries"". But the funny enjoyment of beating your opponent with ""Token Stampede"" seemed to have been what the original build was created on before I attempted to make it... somewhat work consistently.  Overall though, it's a slow deck that isn't by any means ""competitive"" or ""good"", but it's still a weird gimmick that I wanted to show off as I try to backup the decks I've built on EDOPro."

This build definitely had ""Barbaroid, the Ultimate Battle Machine"" in mind, but summoning it has been the least consistent thing about it, so now I just kinda play it to attack into things with a beefed up ""Truckroid"" and kinda hope for the best. I think if I am to rebuild this deck ever, I'd probably have a different focus in mind when building so as not to have the main strategy be probably the worst one to go into."

I have cut the 2 copies of Kuribandit, as well as the Eldlich stuff and I wanted to with more of a pure Draco Route. I do play some Monarch cards and a spellbook engine. Domain got cut to 1 copy as I found it clashes with Diagram, which is the more important field spell. This build could benefit from a Set Rotation, but I decided not to include it because the space is tight. I wanted to go with a 40 card build and Upstart would be the 41st card kekw. Also, the inclusion of Metaltron because this deck needs a decent boss monster. I found that sometimes the deck has trouble getting that big push for game and Dinomight, Ignis and Maiden sometimes (and regularly) isn't enough to push for game. Metaltron helps out with the potential to be immune to everything but also being pretty big, and with Diagram/Dreith on the field it might take a turn or two before your opponent can out him. Overall I am much happier with this build overall, and in my testing has been a little more powerful as well with the help of Metaltron and some of the newer additions. Hope you like the update."

That was until I saw a Photon Change card, a trap with good effect that will almost always increase your resources and there I thought if I did a more Control version of the Deck and so we got to this beautiful deck, the truth is quite fun and I think it is very customizable that's why I brought it here.Monsters.  <strong>Monsters</strong>  <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon:</strong> Heart of the Deck at all, most of the cards synergize with him or his family, all 3 copies are necessary.  <strong>Galaxy Knight:</strong> At first I thought it was a bad card, but the ability to not use the normal summon from the Deck makes this card a great play.  <strong>Galaxy Soldier:</strong> Deck searcher which can summon Cyber Dragon Infinity.  <strong>Photon Trasher:</strong> Good monster to summon.  <strong>Photon Vanisher:</strong> Of the best cards on the deck, it is summoned almost always in addition to add a Galaxy-Eyes.  <strong>Photon Advancer:</strong> Reverse Trasher.  <strong>Orbital Photon:</strong> The true searcher of the archetype.  <strong>Photon Lizard:</strong> A copy is fine to add combo pieces, unfortunately it takes away the possibility of summon Knight.  <strong>Photon Sanctuary:</strong> Very good card, you can use it to summon Galaxy-Eyes, use Photon Change effect and the most useful, summon the Link.  <strong>Galaxy Expedition:</strong> Very good card to win a high monster.  <strong>Photon Stream of Destruction:</strong> A galaxy-eyes is easy to summon so it will almost always be usable, the gain of being used on the enemy turn gives a great bonus to this versión of the deck.  <strong>Photon Change:</strong> The card that started it all, is a trap yes but it is quite good it can take advantage of monsters that your opponent is going to destroy and gain more resources such as a Galaxy-Eyes that you need, and if you use the Galaxy-Eyes this card will give you double power, well in case you need it, the only bad thing is that it self-destructs for no reason.  <strong>Tachyon Transmigration:</strong> Negation of the archetype is like a Stream of Destruction but it negates, and with the plus of negating more than one effect, returning the cards to the Deck and being able to be used from the hand.  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  <strong>Full Armor Photon Dragon: </strong>Switch to a Galaxy Xyz, for destruction and 4000 ATK is pretty good.  <strong>Prime Photon Dragon: </strong>OTK Moment.  <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon: </strong>It can help ... I swear.  <strong>Hope Harbinger: </strong>Very good negation for the Deck in first turn.  <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon: </strong>It can help with some cheese games, I still take it for the tramp.  <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord: </strong>Second option to negation on first turn.  <strong>Cyber ​​Dragon's: </strong>Infinity is great and being able to summon it so easily with Soldier makes it mandatory for the Deck.  <strong>Starliege Lord Galaxion: </strong>Take advantage of Level 4 to summon Galaxy-Eyes from the Deck if it is not in hand.  <strong>Starliege Paladynamo: </strong>OTK Moment.  <strong>Starliege Photon Blast Dragon: </strong>Level 4 will almost always summon this to put the Galaxy-Eyes on the field, protect it and summon it again.  <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon: </strong>The link is easy to invoke with Sanctuary so it is always good to carry copies of it, it recovers resources and it can also destroy cards<strong>.</strong>  <strong>Union Carrier: </strong>Another good Link, can put Orbital.  <strong>Other Things</strong>  <strong>Impermanence and Warning Point</strong>: A few good traps help the deck, in my case Impermanence is possibly the best current trap and Warning Point is quite good, to negate effect, summon of various monsters.Other Options  <strong>Other Options: </strong>  <strong>Galaxy Monstes:</strong> Afterglow Dragon is easy to summon and gain recurse, sometimes brick, also is more  OTK that a control, Wizard is good, he changes levels and searches but he is like Lizard and almost always worse, Cloudragon is a good card that can revive Galaxy-Eyes and he is also a ""Galaxy-Eyes"" that can be Normal Summon, Neo Galaxy-Eyes can make “things”, Galaxy Satellite Dragon another link although it is not so good.  <strong>Galaxy Spell/Traps:</strong> Photon Hand is an interesting card it can steal Monsters although it blocks you if you do not have the Galaxy-Eyes so that's why they are not used, Galaxy Trance is a bit instaXYZ, Galaxy Zero is the reborn of the archetype.  <strong>Number 97:</strong> Draglubion is one of that cards that can do some interesting things with, Numeron Dragon and C107 but it’s not that good in this version, also with have Barian Force if you just want the C107.  <strong>Generics: </strong>Guardian of Order is sometimes good to have but not that good a 3, Not just Cosmic Cyclone you can use Twin Twisters, Space Typhoon or Galaxy Cyclone this are for destroy Backrow Because the deck is not that good in that, Zeuz is just to good.  &nbsp;  <strong>Thing you should Know</strong>  As I said before you can put the traps you want I put those because they are the ones I like the most but if you want you can put yours.  Learn how to use Photon Change, seriusly.  You should also know that Xyz to use at all times, using the right one can help a lot.  As I said before, the deck is highly customizable, there are several Galaxy, Photon, Cipher, Galaxy Eyes cards and these can give different touches to the deck.  <strong>Upcoming decks?</strong>  <strong>S-Force: </strong><strong>The newest thing in the trunk of ideas, it is not very special but currently I am really enjoying playing with this deck.</strong>  <strong>Abhyss:</strong> Well F, I had ideas but they did not work so well and I would not want to do something of the lot so I’m keep thinking.  <strong>True Draco Crystal:</strong> As I said before, practically ready, I will only think about uploading it this month or the next if I do not have ideas.  <strong>Remake of the Best Fusion Deck:</strong> A little bit the same, it is ready although I think it is more likely that this will upload it this month.  Also first day of March.  If you would like to see one of this deck, dont forget to comment."

The idea is that there are field spells that can help by special summoning from your deck, or adding a card to your hand, then using those cards to go into other plays. Alternatively, we can use certain field spells to slow down or stop some of your opponent's plays. This is definitely not the theoretical ""best"" build, moreso a proof of concept, and to a degree it works, but I feel like it can definitely be better with a bit of tweaking."

In any case, the deck, obviously, is built with the strategy of getting ""Morphing Jar"" on the field and just re-use its effect over and over with ""Book of Moon"", ""Book of Taiyou"", ""A/D Changer"", and ""Book of Eclipse"" to deck out your opponent as fast as possible. It's overall a fairly standard build and works about as well as you'd expect it to. Very susceptible to dead draws and having your entire deck stopped with a single Ash Blossom, downloader discretion is advised."

Forces and Command Knight. Fast forward two (or maybe three? I'm getting forgetful in my old age) and pendulum summoning is just being released and my little lizard brain goes ""no likey"" so I decide to take another hiatus from the game (until either the Valkyries or Backup Gardna are released) up until the Steam winter sale at the end of last year where Yu-Gi-Oh Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution was on sale so I decided to pick it up and give it a play rediscovering my love for the game (still hate pendulum summoning though) and with that we arrive to the current incarnation of what is now a seven year old deck.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The core tactic hasn't changed, you power up your weaker (and stronger) monsters through card effects while protecting them from battle with Marauding Captain. The original deck had Absolute Crusader, Sword Master and Dark Blade the Captain of the Evil World who have since been replaced (partly because I now have better options and partly because I actually forgot the actual contents of the deck) and obviously no link monsters, speaking of whichFerocious Flame Swordsmanis a big boon to the deck as it also powers up the warriors but can also resurrect fallen warriors if it's not in your extra monster zone while Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaosacts as yet another boss monster but for the most part you'll be relying on your level 3 and 4 monsters to do most of the heavy lifting.  &nbsp;  The Attribute Knights are just there to make Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning easier to access although there is a nice combo with an empty hand, Armageddon Knight, Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight and The Warrior Returning Alive where you summon Armageddon Knight, send Gaia then using The Warrior Returning Alive to then summon Gaia from your empty hand, not reliable by any means but a fun combo nonetheless. I will admit that I've not managed to test Dawn Knight in the deck yet but it shouldn't be too different to its dark counterpart."

I picked up Yu Gi Oh via Duel Links after a 10 year hiatus and so much has changed. Well, this deck was the only free to play one I actually enjoyed on the app. I was excited to learn that it has even more support outside of the limited format. I decided to give this archetype a competitive try and it fairs somewhat well.  This deck recycles very well (if you manage to keep all spell/traps on the field, hence running Ibicella for targeting) Maintaining high LP is key in order to ensure success. for monster that you find difficult to destroy via effect/battle Teardrop can tribute them for an attack boost and help clear the field.  &nbsp;  Edit: Well, looked up other Aroma decks and everything I've listed has been done before and there are similar decks... Apologies  With Aromaseraphy's Majoram, Rosemary, and Jasmine, Ibicella, and Teardrop on the field you have full control. Blessed Winds recycles all of your plant cards and A. Jasmine grants you the ability to re-add  a shuffled monster to the hand (works best for Angelica/Majoram)  This deck isn't full proof by any means, but it is definitely fun to use. It also requires a bit of patience as there are a lot of moving pieces however, with practice, it becomes easier to navigate. I'm not well versed enough to go into more detail about how to use the deck, but as I learn more of the meta I will be updating my decklist summaries. Thanks!"

Very fun to play and impcantations make it more consistent. Non-meta.,"Read the ''Important'' part  Black Luster Soldier is my favourite archetype so I have been trying to make a powerful BLS deck and here it is! Please tell me your suggestions so I can make this deck as good as it can be.  This deck uses no banned cards. If you can't get Twilight BLS replace it with sacred BLS and then add another card to the side deck.  <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: I was having problems putting cards in the side deck,<span><strong> after super soldier reborn is the side deck. </strong>This means that the monster to spells/traps ratio will be incorrect.</span>  Link Black Luster Soldier is purely optional; (If you own it though use it) because its very exspensive and you could accidentally banish by pot of extra's effect.  <strong>Impcantations: </strong>  I used them to increase consistency in the deck. There is no pencilplume, for syntheisis can special summon from the grave. 1x bookstone so you can add syntheisis from your graveyard to your hand.  Rest of the<strong> Main deck </strong>  x2 Super Soldier Reborn: Once you side in Sacred BLS you can use envoy as the target and sacred as the special summon, therefore triggering Sacred's effect.  1x<a data-name=""Envoy of chaos""> Envoy of chaos</a><a data-name=""Envoy of chaos:"">: </a>This card will probably only be used as link and ritual material but if your opponent is using monsters with 3100+ atk you can always add it to your hand with reinforcement of the army.  1x Foolish Burial: If you don't get Super BLS in your hand you can use it to send super to the grave and bring it back with synthesis. Also it can help you summon twilight and <a data-name=""envoy BLS."">envoy BLS. </a>  1x Impcantation Inception: if the only ritual materials available are impcantations add it to your hand with candoll.  <strong>Side Deck</strong> [15 cards]  The side deck is basically an arsenal of handtraps, 3x of the card you want to summon with Reborn (Sacred BLS), and Arisen gaia which is a target for Super BLS.  <strong>Extra deck</strong> [15 cards]  Mainly just so you can use pot of extra but Dark Rebellion and link BLS are summonable and powerful."

So, this was an idea I had looking at the anti-special summoning playstyle of both Shaddolls and Evilswarms and thought that maybe they'd be able to mix? It's easily not the best idea posted on this site, after all, Evilswarms are very exclusive, they were the hardest to try and mix, this definitely isn't even the best Shaddoll deck I have, but again, I haven't a clue as to how well it works, I put it together months ago and just left it there in my EDOPro."

I used this deck this past weekend (2/28/21) and finished 54th with an 8-3 record. Lu Feng makes this deck much better then before BLOV. Drawing any ancient warrior along with Lu Feng auto puts him on the field. Not only that but having a tri-brigade monster create double dragon lords also opens it up to summon easy plus with a 500 attk boost. You can also switch from a going second to a going first strat pretty easy with this deck. Just sub out the three Loyal Guan Yuns, alpha, and the lightning storms for the books, crackdowns, and either the barrier/ dark simorgh or one of the other plus another card. Going first you do have to worry about nib! If you can go full combo you should able to end on Simorgh + Barrier + Double dragon lord (bounce to hand) + Lu Feng (destroy quick eff during main 1). Also this absolutely punished any other tri-brigade builds I played. The fact that most of the ancient warriors are wind is just icing on the cake. Finally, a very under rated card that has a lot of synergy with tri-brigade is Sun Mou. His eff to send a card from hand or field to grave to add an ancient warrior monster opens the door to send kit or nervall thus openning up tri-brigade while you set up your ancient warrior plays as well. Overall very happy with how this deck performed!"

This is one of my all time favorite decks, so I hope you can all enjoy this list and have a good chance against the current top tier decks. The way this deck interacts with your opponent is so cool and I love decks that can play on your opponent's turn. This deck has a lot of potential and is a great rogue contender.</span> <h1><span><span>The Decklist:</span></span></h1> <h2><span>Main Deck:</span></h2> <h3><span>Monsters:</span></h3> <span>2x <a data-name=""Abominable Unchained Soul"">Abominable Unchained Soul</a>, This card is really strong interruption and a decent extender, it recursive effect is also really good in a grind game</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Unchained Twins - Aruha"">Unchained Twins - Aruha</a>, this card is one of your best starters / extenders in the deck, being able to pop a card to summon itself is just really strong</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Unchained Twins - Rakea"">Unchained Twins - Rakea</a>, this is the worst of the ""twins"", but it gets the job done as an extender, you play three because it's a name and has the mutual floating effect of the ""twins""</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Unchained Twins - Sarama"">Unchained Twins - Sarama</a>, this is the best extender in your deck, being able to set one of the traps for interruption on your opponent's turn is really valuable</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Lilith, Lady of Lament"">Lilith, Lady of Lament</a>, This is the best starter in the deck, being able to set a piece of backrow is just so good for this deck</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Skull Meister,"">Skull Meister,</a> This is a handtrap that is really good in the current meta environment, with all the graveyard decks running around, this hits those where it hurts</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> (and 1x Driver), This is just a really strong handtrap in the current format, and while you do have to run a brick, it isn't that bad</span> <h3><span>Spells:</span></h3> <span>3x <a data-name=""Abomination's Prison"">Abomination's Prison</a>, this just searches any piece of the deck that you may need at any given time, needless to say it's just really good</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Fury of Kairyu-Shin"">Fury of Kairyu-Shin</a>, this can search torrential which is insanely good in just about every board state for you.</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>, this is just a really good card, the extra is very loose so fitting this in is no problem</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>, this can insulate you from certain handtraps, honestly this has no real good reason to be limited (otherwise play more of it)</span> <h3><span>Traps:</span></h3> <span>3x <a data-name=""Abominable Chamber of the Unchained"">Abominable Chamber of the Unchained</a>, this can revive a card if need be and has the floating effect that makes it a main combo piece </span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Escape of the Unchained"">Escape of the Unchained</a>, This is another really good trap that floats into stuff, and it being an archetypal Icarus Attack (kinda) in a deck like this is just amazing</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>, This is a really strong trap right now, and with the payoff of the floating effects of the unchaineds, it's just amazing in a deck like this</span> <h2><span>The Extra Deck:</span></h2> <span>2x  <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>, This is in here for the Dogmatika match up, if you have to send these at any point then these are great disruption or extension at any given time</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</a>, This is a decently strong rank 8 you can go into if need be, but it's not all that good (seeing as it ""sends"" instead of ""destroys"")</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Topologic Zeroboros"">Topologic Zeroboros</a>, This is a good card for closing out games when the need be, but you won't need it that much and it has problems akin to Dingirsu </span>  <span>2x <a data-name=""Unchained Abomination"">Unchained Abomination</a>, This is a great boss monster for this deck, but summoning it is sometimes a hassle</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Unchained Soul of Anguish,"">Unchained Soul of Anguish,</a> This is really only good on the draw, but it's removal is so strong that it's worth playing anyhow, and the fating effect is good if you have something like Torrential Tribute set</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Unchained Soul of Rage"">Unchained Soul of Rage</a>, This is what you want to go into the most, it has in <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> like effect of letting you link summon during your opponent's turn, but it also allows you to do so by using one of your opponent's monsters</span>  <span>2x <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>, This is what you will want to link into with Rage, it spins a card back to the deck on summon so it is another layer of interruption</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>, You won't go into this much, but in certain corner cases this card can be useful</span> <h2><span>Side Deck:</span></h2> <span>1x <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>, this is really good on the draw as it can be removal against your opponent (play more if it comes off the list)</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a>, another going second card, this can just blow out most VW or Drytron decks running around right now</span>  <span>1x <a data-name=""Unchained Soul of Disaster"">Unchained Soul of Disaster</a>, This is a good card on turn 2, but otherwise it doesn't do enough to warrant how bricky it can be</span>  2x <a data-name=""Mistaken Arrest"">Mistaken Arrest</a>, this is a budget alternative to <a data-name=""droll and lock bird"">droll and lock bird, if you can afford that card, play it over this</a>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Dark Hole"">Dark Hole</a>, This is meant as an out to most cards as well as being able to trigger your cards' effects</span>  <span>2x Any Generic Backrow Removal, This can be whatever you wan't it to be in this case I'm using<a data-name=""Twin Twisters""> Twin Twisters </a>because that is what I have ATM</span>  <span>3x <a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier,"">Dimensional Barrier,</a> This card has gotten a lot better following the current meta game</span> <h1><span>Main Combo(s):</span></h1>

card</span></li>  	<li><span>Pop the first card</span></li>  	<li><span>use that card's effect to fetch an unchained from deck (Sarama is usually best)</span></li>  	<li><span>use that unchained's

have in hand, but while this may not seem all that strong, it's the recursive and repeatability of this combo that makes it such a threat.</span> <h1><span>Tech Cards / Engines:</span></h1> <h2><span>Burning Abyss:</span></h2> <span>Since the BAs are fiends, they won't be locked out from your monster's effects, but honestly that is about all the synergy they have</span> <h2><span>Other ""Unchained"" Cards:</span></h2> <span><a data-name=""Wailing of the Unchained Souls"">Wailing of the Unchained Souls</a> is kind of situational, it's more disruption, but it can easily be a dead card in the hand and it mostly just comes up as a name for the floating effect.</span> <h2><span>""Evil Eye"" cards:</span></h2> <span>I'm going to be honest and just say that I don't like this engine simply because it is kind of invasive to your main strategy, but it is a popular option, so I felt like at least mentioning it.</span> <h2><span>""Plunder Patroll"" Cards:</span></h2> <span>These are also fiends and could potentially have some cool synergy with the deck, the only real problem is that the sequencing on the combos would need a lot of shopping around, but I would love to merge two of my favorite decks.</span> <h2><span>""Metalfoes"" Cards:</span></h2> <span>Metalfoes can help get your combos started for the deck, the pendulum effect to pop stuff to set backrow can be very useful along with having <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization </a>as another way to out problem cards. You won't be making much use of the ability to pendulum summon with this deck, but the metalfoes cards are strong enough on their own to be of great use</span> <h2><span>Other Tech Cards:</span></h2> <span><a data-name=""Charge Into a Dark World"">Charge Into a Dark World</a> could be a useful extender for the deck, however I find it doesn't come up enough after further testing</span>  <span><a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> is another useful card for outing problem boss monsters and board states agaist the current meta, however thanks to VW you can chain Chuche to it and then chain VFD to Chuche, so it does nothing at all right now.</span> <h2><span>Expensive Cards:</span></h2> <span>This deck is meant to be budget so these aren't included in the list, but I will at least acknowledge them.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Accescode Talker"">Accescode Talker</a> is a really good card that can win you games that you otherwise wouldn't, it's a great card bogged down by a massive price tag</span>  <span><a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a> is one hell of a card, but I don't know how well it really fits with this deck (it sends)</span>  <span><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet </a>is a better Forbidden Chalice, but it's also just really not cheap</span>  <span>___________________________________________________________________________________________________</span>  <span>I hope you all enjoy the list and try the deck out, any and all feedback is welcome.</span>  &nbsp; <h2><span>Edits:</span></h2> <span>- changed up the main and side deck to better deal with current match-ups and what I believe to work the best for this deck.</span>  <span>- fixed some errors in the main and side deck</span>"

This deck can often combo off to end up with Apollousa (with 4 counters) and 3 Infernity barriers with an Infernity monster out. This deck is pretty good but can brick sometimes. Overall just a fun deck using what the Infernity archetype has right now. Can't wait to make another version of this deck when the new support comes out to the TCG cause the cards look awesome.

I use OCG card and keep using TCG ban list. I hope you all like it.  Thank you, and let's go  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Introduction</div></blockquote> This is the first archetype that I see quite interesting, due to the ritual summon monster which is usually done using levels and now you can use monster attacks instead  Yap, this archetype is Drytron  Drytron is an archetype of light machine special summon monsters with level 1 and have 2000 ATK and 0 DEF  Anyways, let's just jump to the deck list  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Monsters</div></blockquote> 3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring  In my opinion it is mandatory for each competitive deck to have a hand trap, and the most favorite hand trap is Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. This card is really awesome because it’s capable to negate 3 effect which always happens in the opponent's game  3x Droll &amp; Lock Bird  This card is not only useful for stop opponent to add more card from deck also this is card is a monsters that have 1 level. Based on my experience, Drytron is amazing archetype that never use normal summon and often brick for no reason. In some case I use this card, normal summon it and XYZ summon Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir to continue the combo  3x D.D. Crow  This card is very helpful against deck that often use graveyard like Eldlich, and its also the same reason like Droll &amp; Lock Bird because its level 1  1x Vanity’s Ruler  I don’t lie if I say that this Drytron deck has a bad start in first turn, that's why I use this card to lock opponent combo and this card is searchable with Cyber Angel Benten effect  3x Drytron Alpha Thuban  3x Drytron Zeta Aldhibah  2x Drytron Gamma Eltanin  Alpha, Zeta and Gamma these 3 card are the main character in this deck, Alpha search ritual monster, Beta search ritual spell, Gamma being itself and special summon other Drytron from graveyard  1x Drytron Delta Altais  Reveal 1 ritual card and draw 1 card, fair enough for me  1x Drytron Beta Rastaban  Rarely used but it’s important, so here one copy of it  1x Drytron Meteonis Draconids  First big boss on this deck, banish monster card from graveyard and target face-up card send it to graveyard  1x Drytron Meteonis Quadrantids  Second big boss on this deck, cannot be targeted with spell/trap card or effect, also can destroy all spell and trap your opponent control  3x Cyber Angel Benten  Two word, tribute fodder and also great searcher  1x Cyber Angel Natasha  Hidden boss, steal opponent monster and win, always like that  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Spells</div></blockquote> 1x Meteonis Drytron  Just a small reminder, there is only one on this deck so be careful when using it, sometimes you will leave this card on graveyard and sometimes opponent with effect of D.D. Crow will take that card fly away to the banish zone  3x Drytron Nova  Special summon Drytron monster from deck to reduce the possibility of brick  1x Foolish Burial  Brick solution, can be used to send Drytron monster or ritual monster  3x Cyber Emergecy  Awesome Drytron searcher  3x Triple Tactical Talent  The best way to use this card is to take control 1 monster your opponent control and if it’s a XYZ monster, you know what I mean… it’s ZEUS time  3x Forbidden Droplet  Only used for counter Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Extra</div></blockquote> 1x Linkuriboh  1x Cross-sheep  Use it’s effect with ritual monster to draw 2 card  1x I:P Masquerena  1x Knightmare Unicorn  1x Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess  1x Accesscode Talker  Alternative boss, Yusaku Fujiki from Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS approve this  1x Borrelsword Dragon  Can be used to destroy Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon  2x Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir  XYZ monster which has the same vibe as Foolish Burial with extra protection for rituals  2x Lyrilusc-Assembled Nightingale  Direct attack, XYZ summon to Downerd Magician, XYZ to Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder  2x Downerd Magician  Material for Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder  2x Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder  Expensive boss  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Side</div></blockquote> 3x Nibiru, The Primal Being  Sometimes he is not the end of everything, however I believe that he will be the end for Drytron  2x Artifact Lancea  Stop banish card for a moment, and it’s fairy type  3x Skull Meister  Give him more love, he deserves it  1x Blue-Eyes Chaos Max Dragon  Alternative boss, Seto Kaiba from Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Dark Side of Dimensions approve this  3x Lightning Storm  Great removal  1x Harpie’s Feather Duster  Also a great removal for spell and trap  2x Cosmic Cyclone  Pay 1000 LP feel’s good  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Strategy in 1st turn</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Link summon Linkuriboh, very weak 2/10, can be handled by every deck</li>  	<li>Link summon Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess with 4 monster, not strong 4/10, can be handled by some deck</li>  	<li>Normal summon Vanity’s Ruler, strong 6/10, but still can be counter with Forbidden Droplet and Lightning Storm</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir and ritual summon Drytron Meteonis Draconids, strong 7/10, but hard to recovery if you banish too much Drytron monster</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir, ritual summon Drytron Meteonis Draconids and normal summon Vanity’s Ruler, very strong 8/10, the best first turn that can be happen to this deck</li> </ol> &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Strategy in 2nd turn</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Link summon Borrelsword Dragon, strong 6/10, only works in certain condition especially when dealing with Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Lyrilusc-Assembled Nightingale, direct attack, XYZ summon Downerd Magician, XYZ summon Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder, very strong 7/10, but it has limited material</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir and Ritual summon Drytron Meteonis Draconids or Drytron Meteonis Quadrantids depending on the situation, and use Cyber Angel Natasha effect, the best 8/10, if this doesn't work then nothing will be able to help</li> </ol> &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Deck Statistics</div></blockquote> Attack : 7/10  Defence : 6/10  Consistency : 7/10  Recovery : 6/10  Overall : 6.5"

If all goes well, you'll have one beefy Zeroboros that you either sit on or win with, depending on how defensively your opponent decides to play."

Draw Rescue Ferret then Saryuja Effect to summon the Ferret. Shuffle back ferret for Giant Rex, Dotscaper, and Re-Cover. Synchro into Naturia Beast using Rex and Re-Cover, and Linguriboh from the Dotscaper. This takes care of spells and traps gg. Off of Block Dragon's search get 2 copies of Gigantes and summon both of them then summon Gallant Granite then detach 1 to search Block Dragon. This is better than searching Block Dragon off of Block Dragon as it basically is the same thing with a body on board. Feel free to take out the other Cherubini or the Knightmares for some other extra deck options. Generic Rank 4s could go well in their place. You can also play Deskbot 001 in the main deck and have Mecha Phantom Beast Aurodan and Halqifibrax in the extra deck from some more synchro options. The best end board I have gotten is Dingirsu, Zeroboros with 5,000 ATK, Nat Beast, Linguriboh, Fossil Dyna and Levair. This pretty much takes care off all monsters and spells as well as annoying first turn traps like Imperm and Evenly Matched. If anyone has a combo deck similar to this I would love to check it out, Block Dragon Burning Abyss is my favorite deck and probably will stay my favorite deck. I could definitely see this deck making a return if Block Dragon was to go to 2 copies but probably wouldn't work very well if he were to come back to 1. As for O-lion, he probably won't be coming back as long as Halqifibrax is in the game. But he can easily be replaced for a 2nd copy of Rhino Warrior, Edge Imp Sabres, or something of the sort. Anyway that is all I have I hope you like the build!"

Herald (Competitive and Balance) VS TCG World 7 Hand Trap (Ash, Herald, Lancea) 3 Support Spell (Droplet)","Hello, everyone  Back again with me, Kusari Hanzai  This time I will share my Drytron deck to you all  Just like yesterday I use OCG card and TCG ban list  I hope you all like it  Thank you, and let's go  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Introduction</div></blockquote> It seems that I have started to like this archetype  Not only unique, but his extraordinary ability to perform ritual summon in every match made me want to dig deeper into the potential of this deck  Yap, this archetype is Drytron  Anyways, let's jump to the deck list  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Monsters</div></blockquote> 3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring  Competitive decks always need hand trap to support them, and this is Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring.  No need to further explanation, I believe that all of you already know the power of this card. One of the best hand traps you can find in Yu-Gi-Oh!  3x Herald of Orange Light  This card shines again after a long time with quick effect to negate opponent monster effect, although it requires one other fairy card as a condition of using it but still useful for awakening the full power of the strongest Herald  3x Diviner of The Heralds  Other cards from Herald archetype, but did you all realize that she is not only a beautiful fairy, her abilities are also lovely. Send 1 fairy card from deck or extra deck to graveyard and her level also increase by the level of the sent monster. Amazing  1x Herald of Ultimateness  The strongest ritual monster from the Herald archetype with the ability to negate everything. Yap, he is one of the bosses on this deck  1x Artifact Lancea  Why only one copy on this deck? The reason is because this card can be searched using the effect of Cyber Angel Benten and Herald of The Arc Light. And this card is only useful for dealing with certain decks that often banish. But don't worry, there's one more copy on the extra deck. Based on my experience one to two copies in the deck is enough  2x Eva  This cute little fairy who looks like an alien will help you add a fairy card to your hand. Send this card to the graveyard and banish up to 2 other light fairy monsters to add the same number of level 2 or lower light fairy monster with different name. Use this effect to add Herald of Orange Light and Diviner of The Heralds.  3x Drytron Alpha Thuban  3x Drytron Zeta Aldhibah  2x Drytron Gamma Eltanin  Alpha, Zeta and Gamma these 3 card are the main character in this deck, Alpha search ritual monster, Beta search ritual spell, Gamma being itself and special summon other Drytron from graveyard  1x Drytron Delta Altais  Reveal 1 ritual card and draw 1 card, use this effect to reduce brick  1x Drytron Beta Rastaban  Rarely used but it’s important, so here one copy of it  1x Drytron Meteonis Draconids  Second big boss on this deck since the first one is Herald of Ultimateness, banish monster card from graveyard and target face-up card send it to graveyard  1x Drytron Meteonis Quadrantids  Third big boss on this deck, cannot be targeted with spell/trap card or effect, also can destroy all spell and trap your opponent control. Always be prepared for the worst.  3x Cyber Angel Benten  Tribute fodder and great searcher  1x Cyber Angel Natasha  Hidden boss, steal opponent monster and win the game, always like that. Treat her well, because she is the key of your win  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Spells</div></blockquote> 1x Meteonis Drytron  One is enough and treat this card gently  3x Drytron Nova  Special summon Drytron monster from deck to reduce brick  1x Foolish Burial  Brick alternative solution, can be used to send Drytron monster, ritual monster and fairy monster  3x Cyber Emergecy  Amazing searcher and help you reduce brick. Towards infinity and beyond  3x Forbidden Droplet  Use it well, especially when facing Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Extra</div></blockquote> 1x Linkuriboh  1x Union Carrier  Use this card effect to equip Union Carrier with Eva, and ritual summon Cyber Angel Benten using Union Carrier so Eva can be in the graveyard  1x I:P Masquerena  Best girl. If you all see something bizarre with your opponent like having a deck of more than 40 card, most likely they have Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon. You all better make this spicy girl instead of Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess in 1st turn. If Herald of Ultimateness has been defeated, you all can make Borrelsword Dragon by using I:P Masquerena effect, and that dragon will become immortal.  1x Knightmare Unicorn  1x Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess  Goddess of negate  1x Accesscode Talker  Alternative boss, Yusaku Fujiki from Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS approve this  1x Borrelsword Dragon  Link 4 monster that can be used to destroy Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon  1x Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir  XYZ monster which has the same vibe as Foolish Burial with extra protection for Drytron ritual monster, also can help you reduce brick  1x Lyrilusc-Assembled Nightingale  Direct attack, XYZ summon to Downerd Magician, XYZ to Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder  1x Downerd Magician  Material for Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder  1x Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal  Can be XYZ summon using Diviner of The Heralds and Cyber Angel Benten. Use her to send another Drytron monster if you having trouble with brick. Remember when using her effect send Diviner of The Heralds first. This strategy will be useful for deterring opponent from banish Cyber Angel Benten in graveyard. You also can use her effect to send Eva in opponent turn and add more fairy monster  1x Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder  Expensive boss  2x Herald of The Arch Light  Send this card to the graveyard and add 1 ritual card. Yap another brick solution  1x Black Rose Dragon  Synchro summon this card using Diviner of The Heralds and Drytron monster, this card will help you to wipe out opponent board  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Side</div></blockquote> 2x Nibiru, The Primal Being  Sometimes he is not the end of everything  1x Artifact Lancea  Stop opponent banish card  2x Skull Meister  Negate card effect in graveyard also give him more love, he deserves it  2x Droll &amp; Lock Bird  Stop opponent add more card  1x Blue-Eyes Chaos Max Dragon  Alternative boss, Seto Kaiba from Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Dark Side of Dimensions approve this  2x Lightning Storm  Great removal  1x Harpie’s Feather Duster  Also a great removal for spell and trap  2x Triple Tactical Talent  3 awesome effects in one card, use them wisely  2x Cosmic Cyclone  Pay 1000 LP feel’s good, it also banish a card  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Strategy in 1st turn</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Link summon Linkuriboh, very weak 2/10, can be handled by every deck</li>  	<li>Link summon Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess with 4 monster, not strong 4/10, can be handled by some deck</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir and ritual summon Drytron Meteonis Draconids, average 5/10, but hard to recovery if you banish too much Drytron monster</li>  	<li>Ritual summon Herald of Ultimateness, very strong 7/10, still some card like PSY-Framegear Gamma and Forbidden Droplet can stop this Ultimate being</li>  	<li>Link summon Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess, XYZ summon Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal and Ritual summon Herald of Ultimateness, perfect 9/10, only the chosen ones can get past from this perfect defense</li> </ol> &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Strategy in 2nd turn</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Synchro summon Black Rose Dragon, average 5/10, depending on the situation this can be an excellent solution</li>  	<li>Link summon Borrelsword Dragon, strong 6/10, only works in certain condition especially when dealing with Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Lyrilusc-Assembled Nightingale, direct attack, XYZ summon Downerd Magician, XYZ summon Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder, very strong 7/10, but it has limited material</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir and Ritual summon Drytron Meteonis Draconids or Drytron Meteonis Quadrantids depending on the situation, and use Cyber Angel Natasha effect, the best 8/10, if this doesn't work then nothing will be able to help</li> </ol> &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Deck Statistics</div></blockquote> Attack : 8/10  Defence : 8.5/10  Consistency : 8/10  Recovery : 8/10  Overall : 8.1"

This is a different approach to the Harpie strategy. I made this deck a while back after seeing just how useful the vanilla <a data-name=""Harpie Lady"">Harpie Lady</a> is. The monster summoned off of Elegant Egotist has been a controversial topic in most Harpie decks. Some people say <a data-name=""Cyber Harpie lady"">Cyber Harpie lady</a>, others say <a data-name=""Harpie Lady 1"">Harpie Lady 1</a>, but in this deck the default Harpie Lady is so good.  This deck's main focus is to turbo out <a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a> as most winged beast decks these days. If you haven't noticed there are only 11 cards in the extra deck. That's because those are the main cards needed for the combos. In the side deck are options for what you prefer to build. There are a few variants you could do based on the amount of bricks you want in your deck. I will go over those variants at the end.  The best normal summons in the deck are <a data-name=""Harpie Channeler"">Harpie Channeler</a>, <a data-name=""Harpie Lady"">Harpie Lady</a>, and <a data-name=""Harpie Perfumer"">Harpie Perfumer</a>. Whaaaaat? How is Harpie Lady a good normal summon??? The first objective of the deck is to get a normal monster on board to make <a data-name=""Imduk the World Chalice Dragon"">Imduk the World Chalice Dragon</a>. Along side the triple copies of <a data-name=""Elegant Egotist"">Elegant Egotist</a>, <a data-name=""Hysteric Sign"">Hysteric Sign</a>, and <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>, normal summoning Harpie Lady is a safe option to get a normal monster on board. Harpie Perfumer is a risky normal summon if you don't have <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Storm"">Harpie's Feather Storm</a> in hand. If it is hit with a Veiler or Imperm, its name no longer is Harpie Lady and you cannot activate Elegant Egotist. It is pretty good Ash bait though. Harpie Channeler is the best normal summon since you don't have to activate it's effects immediately as you summon it. This deck runs 16 ""Harpie"" cards so it can satisfy it's cost most of the time. A cool combo with it and Elegant Egotist is to normal Channeler, activate Egotist summoning Harpie Lady from the deck, link off the Harpie Lady for Imduk. Then activate the Channeler's affect by pitching a Harpie card to summon Perfumer from deck and since Imduk (a dragon monster) is on field, Channeler is a level 7. Since there is a level 5 or higher Harpie monster on the field when Perfumer's effect is activated you can add 2 cards from your deck to hand. Pretty nice huh.  <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Chalice&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Chalice""</a> is a nutty card. Once you get a normal monster on field and link it off into Imduk with this card in your hand you can tribute summon it using Imduk's double summon effect. Imduk also summons a World Chalice monster from your hand when its sent to the graveyard, its such a good card. When you tribute summon the Chalice, you can link it off using <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> to trigger its effect to summon a <a data-name=""World Chalice Guardragon"">World Chalice Guardragon</a> and <a data-name=""Lee the World Chalice Fairy"">Lee the World Chalice Fairy</a> from your deck. Very fragile to hand traps at this point so be wary when doing this (unless you have a Harpie on field with Feather Storm in hand then go off). You can then use Almiraj and Guardragon to go into <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> since there is a World Legacy card in the grave now. You can use her effect to set <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a> if you need material or <a data-name=""World Legacy Sorrow"">World Legacy Sorrow</a> if you have too many material that you can co-link (Sorrow is best in the Codebreaker version, you can take it out if you aren't using it). At this point you can banish Guardragon to summon Harpie Lady and link off into Simorgh.  This deck runs many different Link 2's because you never know which one you might need. Sometimes you dont have any World Chalice monsters in hand. Sometimes you have too many. <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Romulus"">Dragunity Knight - Romulus</a> is another fantastic card in this deck. You can use Imduk and Guardragon to make this since it takes both dragons and winged beasts. You can activate it's effect to search out <a data-name=""Dragon Ravine"">Dragon Ravine</a> which can be used if you need a way to get Guardragon to the grave. <a data-name=""Harpie Conductor"">Harpie Conductor</a> is nice if you need a winged beast to go into Simorgh. <a data-name=""Auram the World Chalice Blademaster"">Auram the World Chalice Blademaster</a> is such a cool card that can be very useful to bring something back from the grave or special from hand. Lib is the best if you have Chalice. The <a data-name=""Cyber Slash Harpie Lady"">Cyber Slash Harpie Lady</a> is basically another link 2 but the materials are any two Harpie monsters, it isn't the most essential card in the extra deck but its flavorful and can be used to out your own barrier statue if you need to. The most basic ending board this deck can easily make is Simorgh plus <a data-name=""Barrier of the Stormwinds"">Barrier of the Stormwinds</a>.  If you want to use the Codebreaker variant, add the two Codebreaker links and <a data-name=""Knightmare Gryphon"">Knightmare Gryphon</a>. You will also need to add <a data-name=""Codebreaker Zero Day"">Codebreaker Zero Day</a> to your deck which is a pretty annoying brick to draw but luckily its not a garnet as it can also be discarded and used from the graveyard if needed. This combo only works if you have 2 materials left after making Simorgh which isn't too difficult of a thing to happen. You will need 2 EFFECT monsters so if you have a Harpie Lady as one of those two materials you will need to link it off into a Imduk or <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> (if you decide to run it) before making <a data-name=""Codebreaker Virus Swordsman"">Codebreaker Virus Swordsman</a> and summoning Zero Day from deck. Then link off the Virus Swordsman and Zero Day into <a data-name=""Codebreaker Virus Berserker"">Codebreaker Virus Berserker</a> and use its effect to bring back the Virus Swordsman and Zero day. You now have a link 3, a link 2, and a level 4 monster to do what you want with. Use the Berserker and Zero Day to make <a data-name=""Knightmare Gryphon"">Knightmare Gryphon</a> right under the Simorg so its co-linked. The cool thing is if you used <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Storm"">Harpie's Feather Storm</a> to protect yourself from handtraps the turn you make Gryphon, you can use its effect to discard a card to place the Feather Storm back in your spell/trap zone for the next turn. If you went through the Lib route then you also have an active Sorrow set to protect your board from any board wipes. Then there is the classic infinite negate combo with <a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a> and the Mist Valley cards. That one is pretty basic and well known enough for me to not need to explain it. You could potentially use this with the Codebreaker variant but it is a lot of bricks you don't want to draw. You don't want more than 60 cards either since you want to. I discovered the Codebreaker Combo through SuperNix's profile here: https://ygoprodeck.com/world-chalice-harpie-post-september-2020-banlist/  The <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> and <a data-name=""Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior"">Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior </a>are not essential but cards I really like in this deck, especially going second. Ningirsu is World Chalice in name and a fantasic way to out certain problematic cards (DRAGOON) whereas Avramax is just a strong generic card that can be made with 2 link 2's and is hard to out. Other notable cards that can be run are included in the side deck. <a data-name=""Accesscode talker"">Accesscode talker</a> should definitely be in the extra deck if you have it. It is so easy to make in this deck and there are so many different attributed link monsters ran in this deck. I just don't own the card myself and will not until it gets reprinted. Instead run one of the Borrel monsters or just Avramax for a big link 4. <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>, and <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> are just great cards to have in the extra deck if you have them. You can also run any number of generic rank 4 xyz monsters to fill in any gap. Notable ones being <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> or <a data-name=""Lightning Chidori"">Lightning Chidori</a>.  On the ratios, I decided to only run 2 Perfumer. This is because I only have 2 of them and never bothered to get a third since I don't find myself needing the third whenever I play. Playing 1 or less definitely seems bad though. 1 <a data-name=""Harpie Harpist"">Harpie Harpist</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Harpie Oracle"">Harpie Oracle</a>, and 1 <a data-name=""Harpie Queen"">Harpie Queen</a> are just there for the extra names and their usage with <a data-name=""Swallows Nest"">Swallows Nest</a> and Simorgh summons in the grind game. They can be be discarded off of Channeler. Oracle can be an extender if needed. You can side deck more Queens/<a data-name=""Harpie's Hunting Grounds"">Harpie's Hunting Grounds</a> if you are facing more control players. I only run 1 of each since they are searchable easily. As for the World Chalice Ratios, 3 Chalices since I want to see it in my hand, 3 Guardragons since its actually a fantastic extender, and 2 Lee since if I only play 1 and draw it my Chalice is dead. Lee isn't a bad card to normal summon if used in combination with Unexpected dai or if you have nothing better to normal summon off of Imduk (its the only World Chalice in hand). I run max copies of Egotist, Sign, and Dai to get that normal monster. I run 11 Harpie monsters so there is a good chance that the Egotist is not dead in hand. You can bump up the Swallows Nest ratio if you want, its a great card against Imperm and Veiler. Also not a bad card to just set.  &nbsp;  Thank you for reading all this. I am definitely not the first one to mix these two archetypes but this is my take on the deck. I might make a video on this deck in the future. If you have any suggestions on what to change feel free. Its a very fun combo deck that usually ends on the same board but the way to build that board varies from game to game. It can play through hand traps pretty nicely sometimes thanks to Feather Storm and all the different extenders the deck runs. It has access to so many different cards you can tech. I think this deck can have competitive success in a future meta. We will just have to see."

And pretty che","<span><strong>The Budget-friendly Zombie deck of your dreams!</strong></span>  <span>I made this deck to be 1) budget-friendly, 2) as anti-meta as possible, and 3) consistent as can be.  Thankfully, the deck does all three <em>very effectively</em>.</span>  <strong><span>Budget-friendly</span></strong>  <span>The most expensive cards of the deck are the Eldlich package (cutting out Black Stone and Eldland to skim off about $100+), the Zombie World package (2 Necroworld Banshee, 2 Glow-Up Bloom, 2 Doomking Balerdroch, 3 Zombie World), and Shiranui Solitaire.  The rest of the cards are about $1 or less, even the Mayakashi cards now (they've dropped a lot in value recently).</span>  <span><strong>As Anti-Meta As Possible</strong></span>  <span>This deck <span>STOMPS</span> on a lot of other decks currently out in the meta right now, as well as a lot of other decks in general.  Anything that relies on tributing or a specific monster type on field or in grave is almost always at a loss as soon as the field spell <em>Zombie World</em> hits the field, which this deck can do consistently and often by turn 1.  Being able to side in cards like <em>Give And Take </em>and <em>Artifact Lancea</em> utterly destroy decks that rely on the Extra Deck and Banishing, respectively.  And because Zombie World makes everything in grave Zombie-type, a pitched <em>Artifact Lancea</em> can be brought back every turn with <em>Return of the Zombies </em>or <em>Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom</em> during your opponent's turn for more disruption (also works with other Artifacts as well, but the deck isn't the best at self-popping backrow outside of <em>Eldlich The Golden Lord </em>and a sided <em>Twin Twister</em>).  The deck has many starters and utilizes multiple Zombie engines to ensure you send to grave as many of your important cards as possible from deck to set up future plays.  <em>Mayakashi Hajun</em> + <em>Yuki </em>into the Link-2 Mayakashi + a revived <em>Yuki</em> = a send from grave, <em>Uni-Zombie</em>, <em>Gozuki</em>, and <em>Samurai Skull</em> also send from deck to grave, and <em>One For One</em>, <em>Mayakashi Return</em>, <em>Shiranui Solitaire,</em> and <em>Ghost Meets Girl - A Shiranui Story </em>all get these engines going.  A neat tech includes making <em>XX-Saber Gottoms</em> with <em>Uni-Zombie</em> + <em>Gozuki </em>and, with a bit of setup, equates to about 3-4 cards discarded from your opponent's hand in one turn, and at least an extra one every turn.  <em>Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom</em> is especially good if you can bring out the chain of Mayakashi synchros, since she can tribute any zombie during either turn to bring out the synchros from grave for more disruption.  <em>Return of the Zombies</em> is <span>non-targeting banishing removal</span> while Zombie World is out on the field, or an emergency Monster Reborn for yourself as needed (that used up <em>Dakki, </em><em>The Graceful Mayakashi </em>is often a good target).  Finally, <em>Glow-Up Bloom</em> has many targets in the deck for adding to hand or special summoning and is easily recovered and reused multiple times throughout the duel, allowing you to quickly get out a <em>Doomking Balerdroch</em>, <em>Eldlich The Golden Lord</em>, or <em>Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom</em> as needed.</span>  <span><strong>Consistent As Can Be</strong></span>  <span>Oddly enough, despite being a 60 card deck, <strong>The Horde<em> </em></strong>is a very consistent Zombie build that very rarely bricks.  At worst, you usually end on a <em>Zombie World</em> + <em>Balerdroch</em> combo, at best...you end on a lot, lot more.  The deck utilizes a lot of starters and engines to allow nearly every hand to have multiple options per duel, and most of those short, simple combos allow for deck dumping to set up current and future plays with ease.  </span>  <span>Weaknesses</span>  <span>Obviously, the deck isn't perfect.  The deck likes its field spell very much, and while it doesn't die like Lair of Darkness does when it disappears...it's a pretty important piece to the Zombie Horde puzzle.  Protect your field spell, and if you can, try to keep another <em>Necroworld Banshee</em> in GY just in case you need another!  The deck can be severely hurt if multiple starters are blocked.  If you opponent has a lot of negates on the field, try to bait what you can before activating <em>Zombie World</em> and using <em>Super Polymerization</em> to get rid of as much as your opponent's field as you can.  You may find other generic Super Poly targets being warranted depending on your locals.  Finally, this is a <span>graveyard</span> deck, so cards that hit the graveyard or stop banishing (i.e. for <em>Glow-Up Bloom</em>, <em>Mezuki</em>, <em>Necroworld Banshee</em>, etc) will affect this deck VERY MUCH.  Not much you can do about that, but the deck still has temporary options for it, like its Super Poly targets, the Golden Lord himself, etc.  </span>"

You say go big or go home? You like XYZs? you want to have 10k beat sticks? Then this deck is for you!,"This Deck uses Alternative XYZ Summoning Conditions to get the rare seen and strong bossmonsters on the board. I have added 1 Banned card in the extra deck since i wanted to see what happens, but you can just go ahead and put any XYZ in that slot that you like.  Basicly this is an Onomato &amp; Time Thief Deck. Why you ask? For the powerfull level 4 Engine of Onomato and Time thief shananigans to increase material counts.  The time thiefs are there if you want to go ""Number86: Heroic Champion"" or ""Super Quantal Mech King Magnus"" to increase theire material count to get the big effects going. (also some nice Protection!) The Onomato engines job is to shit out as many MAterials for XYZ plays as possible.  So the alternative XYZ turn and vocalpoints are:  Number27: Dreadnough Dreadnoid -&gt; Magnus  Number 39: Utopia Double-&gt;Number 93:  Utopia Kaiser -&gt;Special: Dark XYZ below Rank9 -&gt; Using Phantom Knights Rank up Magic for  &lt;Rank 10 plays (this is a quickplay and can be used in your oponents turn to stop him from plays!)  Other highlights:  Exciton Knight for Comebacks Double or nothing+Number 39: Utopia for 10k beatstick.  The hole point is to abuse XYZ, so all your utility lies within your extra deck. Thsi version is for the luls, but if you want to actually pack a punch you shouldt probably switch out some cards in the extra deck. (i.E. Utopia the lightning) or just focus on one of those XYZ things, like Time Theifs OR Rank-up-magic."

You use Guru with the field spell to get fiendess to negate things. The traps in the deck just help you stay in control of the game. Super Poly in this deck isn't as good in this format as it used to. Subterror Final Battle setting itself face down can constantly flip your monsters and can OTK at times. If you want to play a more budget version your can cut the Extravagance for any trap of your choice, and the Ash Blossoms for cheaper hand traps. If you are willing to spend more money you can take out the Ghost Belles and side the Super Poly. Then you can buy Dragoon and Verte Anaconda for the deck. Overall budget or not, Subterror Guru control can do very well, you just have to think right when playing."

Amazement Administrator sp himself when a trap is activated then when your opponent summons a monster you can equip it with an Attraction card. Which should be Horror House to set the monster and pop it's self. Then you can banish the trap on your turn to pop one card your opponent controls. so as you can tell a very powerful card."

Opcionalmente, si tenemos acceso a más Drytrons, ya no es necesario ir a por Mu-Beta Fafnir.  <strong>Searchers para buscar los requisitos</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Where Arf Thou: </strong>Sirve para añadir un Drytron cuando ya hay uno en el campo. Ya que el uso de Alpha y Zeta es intercambiable, sirve para buscar a cualquiera de los dos.</li>  	<li><strong>Jack in the Hand: </strong>Debe ser usado primero por ser algo impredecible. Usualmente escogeremos a Alpha, Zeta y Gamma. Si el oponente toma a Alpha o Zeta, escogemos al otro. Si toma a Gamma, no hay problema, ya que llevamos otra copia, y además escogemos al Drytron que necesitamos.</li>  	<li><strong>Cyber Emergency: </strong>Literalmente trae a la mano cualquier Drytron.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish Burial:</strong> Cuando hablamos de Drytron, el cementerio y la mano son casi lo mismo.</li>  	<li><strong>Drytron Nova:</strong> Trae a cualquier Drytron al campo, el cual puedes enviar al cemenerio al usarlo para invocar a Linkuriboh.</li>  	<li><strong>Drytron Fafnir: </strong>Añade a Nova a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Preparation of Rites: </strong>Sirve para traer a Benten o Phul a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Extra Foolish Burial: </strong>Con esto podemos enviar a Herald of Arc Light al cementerio y activar su efecto para traer a un ritual. En el peor de los casos, se puede enviar a N'tss para destruir algo del oponente.</li>  	<li><strong>Ritual Sanctuary: </strong>Trae a Benten a coste de descartar una magia, que en este deck, hay de sobra.</li>  	<li><strong>Terraforming: </strong>Es el más versátil, ya que puede traer a Fafnir (si necesitas un Drytron) o a Ritual Sanctuary (si necesitas un ritual).</li> </ul> <strong>Partes del combo:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Arcana Force XXI - The World: </strong>Con él nos saltaremos el turno oponente. Es importante invocarlo con Light Barrier en campo para no depender de la suerte.</li>  	<li><strong>Soul of Purity and Light: </strong>Con ella tendremos los materiales necesarios para invocar a Beatrice.</li>  	<li><strong>Minefieldriller: </strong>Destruyéndolo con Auroradon, recuperaremos a Light Barrier del cementerio.</li>  	<li><strong>Light Barrier:</strong> Es necesario para asegurar el efecto que queremos de The World.</li>  	<li><strong>Megalith Ophiel:</strong> Un target para Phul, además de brindar un cuerpo en campo, nos añade otro Megalith a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Megalith Bethor: </strong>Sirve más para deshacernos de cosas molestas del oponente.</li>  	<li><strong>Megalith Phaleg: </strong>Facilita el OTK al incrementar el atk de tus monstruos.</li>  	<li><strong>Drytron Meteonis Draconids: </strong>Al igual que Phaleg, ayuda a realizar el OTK, y da algo de versatilidad al deck.</li>  	<li><strong>Vanity's Ruler: </strong>Pega bien, además de ser un buen plan B si todo lo demás falla y no tienes los materiales para ir por The World</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente (73%).</li>  	<li>No tiene garnets, por lo que todo en la mano es útil.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a entornos cambiantes con cartas como Zeus, N'tss, Lyrilusc y Relinquished Anima</li>  	<li>Si todo falla, aún es posible ir por Vanity's Ruler y detener el turno oponente hasta cierto punto.</li>  	<li>El deck no depende del burn, por lo que no es afectado por incrementos de LP del oponente.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck depende de la Battle Phase para ganar, por lo que si no puedes armar un campo agresivo en tu segundo turno podrías perder tu oportunidad, aunque siempre es posible usar nuevamente el efecto de The World (no es una vez por invocación XD).</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, puede que toque puro Drytron o puro ritual/ladrillo, en cuyo caso es gg, aunque la probabilidad de eso tan sólo es del 27%.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck en sí requiere de muchos cuerpos en el campo que deben administrarse correctamente. A pesar de ser flexible con los materiales link, equivocarse con cuáles deberían usarse en cierto momento puede congelar el combo.</li> </ul>"

Pantheism is used as a draw engine and to search your monarch floodgates.  Stormforth lets you use the True Draco monsters to get rid of your opponent's monsters with destruction or targeting protection, and as fodder for Pantheism.  Inspector Boarder is Inspecter Boarder, it stops your opponent from playing Yugioh and can give you an extra turn to set up.  Pot of Duality is a free excavate three pick one, there's basically no penalty because you usually aren't going to be special summoning during your turn if at all.  March of the Monarchs is a bit questionable, but it gives your monsters targeting and destruction protection and is fodder for Pantheism.  &nbsp;  Now on to the side deck.  Lightning Storm helps you out if you're gonna go second, it sort of gives you a chance. You could probably also swap this out for DRNM.  Field Barrier stops your extra deck lock from dying to 1 destruction, and tells Mystic Mine troglodytes to shove it.  Macro Cosmos and Imperial Iron Wall screw over certain decks, Skill Drain is a slightly worse (for this deck) Monarchs Erupt.  Light-Imprisoning Mirror shuts down Drytron and Eldlich.  Mind Drain stops hand traps and Virtual World's hand effects.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Over all this deck is pretty good at cheesing out wins against stronger decks, without having to resort to the degeneracy that is Mystic Mine."

It's a pretty strong combo deck, as the Thunder Dragons banish themselves and then use their banish effs to rapidly gain more advantage and combo off. For these combo lines, I included the usual Thunder Dragon cards, along with Some Summer Summoner for combo extension, and Instant Fusion with Kaminari for more bodies on field. Since the deck doesn't really use it's normal summon, you can normal summon Aleister for it's amazingly consistent search. You can go into Mechaba for negates, or Caliga for a floodgate, both as turn 1 options when going first. Those are just things you can do with your own cards; there's always versatility with the opponent's cards. Aside from those two archetypes, I included Verte Anaconda, to make summoning Titan (unban collossusu) much easier and more consistent. I also included a ton of handtraps since this deck had so much space, meaning you can easily beat the opponent's shit in, control wise. This deck turns into more of a going first control deck, with Mechaba or Caliga for negates/floodgate and quick play pops using Titan. You also have a ton of hand traps, meaning they can't build a board or combo off. Afterwards, you can OTK easily with huge numbers. Also, this is a great way to make them meta again, smile. Also, i didn't add it in, but you could add in a Dogmatika engine."

There are two strategies to use here, and this deck is capable of OTK. You want to go second with this deck. Dimensional Shifter is there to disrupt your opponent on their first turn before you go. The main strategy is to have Golden Castle on the field to mill out cards to power up Gren Maju. Gizmek Orochi and Pot of Desires helps with this, as well as Eater of Millions. The Danger! cards are in the deck to increase your mill rate but to provide both level 8 monsters as well as quick strength to muscle down enemy monsters.  To OTK, you have to draw: Gren Maju, Eater of Millions, Gizmek Orochi, Golden Castle of Stromberg, Raigeki, and Danger! Thunderbird. <ol>  	<li>Play Raigeki to proc any negation cards your opponent might have and to clear the field on enemy monsters.</li>  	<li>Play Golden Castle, you want to use it to bring out Hexe Trude to destroy a backline.</li>  	<li>If you have Gren Maju, normal summon him and then use Eater of Millions to access cards you don't necessarily needs from the Extra Deck to increase the ATK of Gren. You can leave Starving Venom Fusion Dragon in the Extra deck in case you can't OTK and need to use Super Poly later. With 14 cards</li>  	<li>Use Danger! Thunderbird to discard itself to clear any final set spell/trap cards before attacking.</li>  	<li>If a monster was summoned as a reaction to you clearing the field, use Eater of Millions to remove it from play. At this point, Eater should have 2400/2500 ATK, Hexe Trude with 2600 ATK, and Gren Maju with at least 9600 ATK.</li> </ol> Sometimes you'll encounter an opponent with a high ATK monster that is immune to the effects of Hexe Trude and Eater of Millions. I've included Number 20: Lancelot and Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon to provide an option to finish an opponent off with Lancelot's direct attack or overpower a monster without targeting them by using Prim Photon Dragon's Xyz effect to buff itself."

","Okay so, yea, this deck is pretty degenerate. I regret nothing. It's a Myutant deck based around traps and floodgates, so I included a ton of various powerful floodgates and such. The core idea is to climb into the negation boss monster for constant negations, and set a ton of backrow, as to make sure the opponent can't advance. The deck has pretty good grind game in order to get several fusions and negations on field, as I included multiple negation monsters (Dragoon, Mechaba, etc). While normally, they couldn't be summoned, I included Cyberstein to turbo them out and layer on negations on the board. For the card list, I included the usual Myutant cards, as a fairly consistent way to get into the large negation monster and set up some of their traps for interruption, like the archetypal Pog Blade. To fill up space, as Myutants don't have a lot of cards, I included a large amount of stun cards. There's Inspector Boarder, which I can't even figure out, as a normal summon option along with Cyber-stein, and various popular floodgates, like There Can Only Be One, Gozen Match, Etc. The extra deck is mainly just a ton of Cyber-Stein targets, the regular Myutant cards for climbing into negates, and the Verte Anaconda for extra consistensy. So yea, this is just a run of the mill, degenerate control build. Pretty fun, consistent, and toxic. You're lucky I didn't include Mystic Mine."

Gemini Ablation summons Geminis from the deck with their effects. Carbo Crab is the main set up to get a Gemini in the graveyard and then one into your hand. Oxy Ox summons a monster from the hand and adjusts the level to allow for either Rank 2 or 8 XYZ such as Dingirsu, Cursed Javelin, Toadally Awesome, and Methydraco. First of the Dragons w/ Dragon Mirror helps get some minor protection. Titanocider &amp; Lost Wind I personally use to shut down extra deck monsters or at least slow them down. Burnout is a good way to set up your rank plays and Starving Venom I've never used but it does help get rid of pesky monsters when combined with Super Poly since Dark is pretty common. I also took the liberty of adding in a couple more Predaplants and Invoked Elesium. Plus, Super Poly fits with the chemistry theme.  Reduce, reuse, recycle! And like with any good chemistry experiment: blow things up! This was a fun deck to build and playtest. Enjoy!  PS, yes I like to run more than 40 cards :)"

I wanted to cut the deck back to a solid 40 card list filled with extenders and starters, and cut cards like Levianeer and Brotaur that are on the fringe, things you search out in specific hands and otherwise don't really start your combos. I also chose not to run Halqifibrax, saving us on putting in a tuner, since to make the Halq play you need to commit 2 extra monsters, at which point you might as well make the hard Apollousa anyways. Additionally, our basic combo requires pitching 3 cards (Dragon Ravine, Quadborrel, and Dragoon), so Plaguespreader doesn't appeal to me in Dragoon builds. 40 cards does mean we'll see out bricks more often, but we'll also see things like Chaos Space and Seyfert more often, so it pays off IMO.  The field spells and Dragoon packages are engine requirements. I chose to run 2 Red-Eyes Fusion so that seeing 1 copy in your hand just gives you a target to pitch, and doesn't deny you Dragoon. Absorouter is an engine requirement that also works as a good free extender in the Rokket deck. By now, this Rokket package is standard - it gives you good interaction and just enough bodies to play some grind game, but there's no reason to run Recharger anymore IMO.

A truly budget deck that (almost) copy from EDO bot's deck lol,"Final Version. This is the lowest prices DM that has highest hand consistency and come back capability. The side deck is quite expensive, though. But any less than this is not good enough to play lol.  !CAUTION!  If u use the effect of Dogmatika Maximus to send DM the Dragon Knight to GY, it cannot be revived by card effect. That because it is not fusion summoned properly, that mean it is not in the game by the rule! BUT! It can be use as fusion materials for Magicalized Fusion (Quintet Magician).  SO u must not use Maximus to send DM the DK to GY but use it on other cards instead. lol F--- the rules!  The goal of this deck is... if u had played with that DM bot in EDO before u will already know so no more explanation.  It is just that... I can build this deck entirely on TCG cards, that is.  Clara&amp;Rushka (or Link-1 Artemis) only purpose is to be link then get sent to GY for Maximus. You can reaplace Clara&amp;Rushka with Artemis. The reason why she is not in the main deck is because I'm poor.  I put Anaconda in side deck because that thing is by no means budget.  You may ask me: Why Mystic Mine?  The answer is: Why not?"

Main strategy is to open traps to control enemy and try to swing them huge damage with Raviel or Hamon. Try not to leave Chicken Game on field if you does not have lost paradise to replace it. Since skill drain only affect monsters on the field, your lv 1 and 5 monsters who tribute can still activate their effects. If you open There can be Only One, just use those summoning beast to special summon Hamon instead of Raviel. Use the cannon to clear off opponents remaining LP when necessary. The starlight road is to protect your magic and trap from feather duster, twin twister etc since all these cards can really make your whole board wiped in an instant. Sacred Beast Awakening act as a 2nd choice for skill drain (with better effects) which makes your deck have exactly 6 skill drain."

Not close to being competitive or anything. The main goal of this deck is to go first, get searches with XX-Saber Darksoul, hope you won't die on opponent's turn, get Faultroll loop going next turn and OTK your opponent. This needs 2 XX-Saber Faultrolls, 1 XX-Saber Ragigura. Plus usually some other X-Saber. Tri-Brigades help a lot to establish some kind of board presence for opponent's turn and to gain more card advanatage. I tried to make the deck be able to make Faultroll hand loop with gottoms but didn't succeed in making it consistent enough. It needs so much setting up and there are no fast and good ways to search Faultroll so I ended up just trying to make it more consistent and try only using Faultroll loop for link spam. </span>  Replays:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eXDz2bIdHA  &nbsp;"

Zoodiac known as twelve beasts is an archetype of earth beast-warrior monsters with level 4  One of the most popular archetypes in Yu-Gi-Oh!  Zoodiac has the extraordinary ability to make XYZ summon using one monster card  Anyways, let's just jump to the deck list  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Monsters</div></blockquote> 3x Nibiru, The Primal Being  The greatest meteor that can destroy everything, very useful for dealing with decks that rely on complex combos like Virtual World, Dragon Link, Drytron and several other rogue deck  2x Artifact Lancea  Stop opponent banish card  2x Skull Meister  Love him more often, he deserves it. Why? Listen carefully. He can stop the activation of Eldlich trap card in graveyard  2x Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion  Sometimes, quite useful for blocking enemy combo. So here 2 copy of her should be enough, since we have Skull Meister in deck  3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring  As usual the competitive deck has a hand trap to support its performance, and here comes 3 copy of Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring  3x Droll &amp; Lock Bird  This level 1 spellcaster that looks like a beast is very useful in dealing with meta decks that are hot right now, he stop opponent to add more card from deck  1x Zoodiac Raptier  Normal summon and send 1 Zoodiac card to graveyard, also can special summon other Zoodiac monster.

The strategy here is to defend against enemy monsters using the various effects of low level monsters until you are able to either synchro summon or XYZ summon a more powerful monster to go on the offensive, but Crystal Beast Amethyst Cat has been selected as the deck master due to the powerful combo of Spiritual Forest, Mage Power, and the cards own ability to attack the opponents life points directly for half damage as well as enter the spell and trap zone upon destruction in battle as opposed to being sent to the graveyard.

I've gotten into Yu-Gi-Oh from a couple friends over last winter, and after they weaseled me in and taught me the lowdown, it was my job to research a deck that caught my eye. Fortunately for me after some jumping around, I stuck around with the psychic type. Initially my build took large inspiration from JDGaming's various psychic profiles for <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/BEKwNLwXDgU"">Banish Psychics</a> and later <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/7MeXC3DB1ys"">General Psychics</a>, which I highly recommend checking out if my build isn't your style. Credits to him for a number of ideas this deck uses.  I personalized it with some additional Synchro utility and toyed with the extra deck to make it feel more uniform. This harps on its extent of damage but in exchange offers more removal tools and summoning materials to make up for your aggro effectivity. Don't shrug it off yet, though! Lets do a rundown on the vital aspects of this deck.  <hr /> <p><span>Main Playstyle</span></p> First off, a key tool to give psychics the upper hand is the one additional summon <a data-name=""Brain Research Lab"">Brain Research Lab</a> allows for all psychic type monsters. Your 1~4 star monsters in your hand can be applied in a single turn to lead to quick extra deck plays or you can bounce off your first summon for <a data-name=""Overdrive Teleporter"">Overdrive Teleporter</a> who can use it's effect for one psychic counter instead of 2000 life points. It's important to be wary if the opponent has field removal tools as overuse of Lab's effect could bite you in the ass, so your mileage may vary on how frequent you should rely on it.  Using <a data-name=""Psychic Wheeleder"">Psychic Wheeleder</a> and <a data-name=""Psychic Tracker"">Psychic Tracker</a> as Synchro tools together lets Riser, Jiujiu and Psyhemuth stand on their own feet more, or if you're summoning them from O.D. Teleporter, you can scrap him after use for Shenshen. Once he's on the field, Shenshen chucks all monsters sent to the GY to the banish zone instead, including your own. This is how you can modulate your discarded monsters to fit your needs.  While lower level monsters can be revived using <a data-name=""Telekinetic Power Well"">Telekinetic Power Well</a>, you can let your tuners and mid-level monsters (extra summons included) bleed into your banish zone so you can resurrect them using <a data-name=""Psychic Feel Zone"">Psychic Feel Zone</a> and <a data-name=""Psychic Tuning"">Psychic Tuning</a>. Omega benefits from the former the most since Gamma and Driver get banished anyway after quick effect, and his effect to trim the opponent's hand will let you reset his position to attack next turn.  The Assault Engine goes from <a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a> get <a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a> &gt; sack Beast &gt; get <a data-name=""Assault Mode Activate"">Assault Mode Activate</a> &gt; Reflector summon Beast to field. This deck contains no level 7 extra deck monsters, so be wary not to boost him to Level 6 if you're using Reflector as a tuner. See more in regards to side deck recommendations at the end. Patch up Reflector with <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> if the chain gets interrupted.  The psychic mages—as I like to call them—can banish monsters from your GY in order to special summon them. Cleric gets the most mileage out of this effect for his DEF stat and how you can also force the effect from a Synchro or Link summon using him as material. And using any of them to bring back <a data-name=""Esper Girl"">Esper Girl</a> is a good opportunity to make <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast;</a> A decent attacker but a fantastic multi-use negator that feeds your GY.  From there, with both discard zones at your disposal, you can shift them around depending on your use for them. The best use for all those monsters in your graveyard comes into play when you manage to make <a data-name=""Overmind Archfiend"">Overmind Archfiend</a>, with a whopping 3300 ATK without trackers can big dick the field for a bit while banishing as many monsters you can manage to special summon when he gets killed.  <hr /> <p><span>Other Features</span></p> <a data-name=""Risebell the Star Adjuster"">Risebell the Star Adjuster</a> is a jack-of-all-trades. Candidate for O.D. Teleporter, E-tele, GY revival, and can increase it's level or another monster's if you can't bring back beast.  Halq is in here to get out another tuner to use as materials or offer extra protection. It can summon <a data-name=""Martial Metal Marcher"">Martial Metal Marcher</a> with its quick effect, who can in itself summon a tuner with it's effect negated. Marcher itself works with Tracker and Wheeleder's effect to get them on the field.  <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Lambda"">PSY-Framelord Lambda</a> for using Gamma's effect even with monsters on your field, since they're your most valuable handtraps.  <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> is in for additional backbone for when you really need to kick a boss monster's teeth in. Can't be made using Marcher.  And <a data-name=""Virtual World Dragon - Longlong"">Virtual World Dragon - Longlong</a> and <a data-name=""Leviair the Sea Dragon"">Leviair the Sea Dragon</a> serve as situational flavor to the deck, and functional summons if you can't get a tuner out. Leviair acts as an additional banish search for any of your main deck monsters except O.D. Teleporter and Driver.  <hr /> <p><span>Side Deck Recommendations</span></p> I decided not to include a side deck since a lot of options will likely be situational for the current meta. My personal choices go as follows: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Psychic Lifetrancer"">Psychic Lifetrancer</a> and <a data-name=""Magical Android"">Magical Android</a> for stalling or regaining LP in a pinch. Lifetrancer serves as an applicable level 7 monster for Assault Beast to go into and Android could easily climb into Omega or <a data-name=""Thought Ruler Archfiend"">Thought Ruler Archfiend</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> for any Link monster substitutions needed to combat higher tier decks, like <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>, <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>, M<a data-name=""ekk-knight Crusadia Avramax"">ekk-knight Crusadia Avramax</a>, the Knightmares, etc.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a> whom I used to use back when my deck followed JDGaming's profile much closer. Much easier to get out than Crystal Wing with a diet variant of it's effects.</li>  	<li>Nibiru, Dark Ruler No More, and Forbidden Droplet as fundamental failsafes.</li> </ul>  <hr /> <p><span>Conclusion</span></p> If you try out my deck, feel free to comment your thoughts, or drop a like if you like it! Since I've only had a couple of months in the game, I'm open to critiques and recommendations to spruce this deck up! Deck is subject to change in the future!"

This deck took lots of playtesting and work to make so I hope you appreciate it! I'll still be open for suggestions!,"<span>So I put in all of my effort to make this build including a side deck and everything and this is my most detailed guide yet. I’m hoping that everyone likes this deck, before anything I just want to say thanks to all of those players who tolerated my 14 handtraps that I play when they were going against this deck during my test runs. Without further ado, let’s get into it!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>First I’ll explain what Crusadia is before anything else. Crusadia is an archetype from the world legacy lore that utallizes link monsters to link climb. All Crusadia main deck monsters can special summon themselves to the field for a spot a link monster points to and are either level 3 or level 4, they also have additional effects including layering protection, clearance, boosting, and so on. The Crusadia monsters in the extra deck share an effect where they gain attack points equal to the origenal attack points of the monsters they point to. Most of them also trigger an effect when an effect monster is special summoned to a zone they point to. The idea is to link climb to the link monster Cursadia Equimax as soon as possible and boost it with the cursadia effects of the main deck. Crusadia Equimax is a 2000 attack point monster who gains the attack points of monsters it points to, but it prevents those monsters from attacking. It also sports the ability to tribute a crusadia or world legacy monster it points to and then negate the effects of a monster on the field giving us standard contol.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>I’ll start the list now</span>  &nbsp;

 <span>1 Red Reboot (very helpful)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The main thing to do is link climb to accessscode or equimax and then let it carry you. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Acesscode combo: 2 Crusades with different names</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Normal first Crusadia (this one can’t be draco)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link Crusadia to Magius</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Special second crusadia (if draco recycle the first one with it’s effect)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Magius adds draco (or another crusadia with a different name if the second Crusadia is draco) from your deck to your hand</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link second Crusadia with Magius to make regulex</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Third crusadia summons self (if draco then return the first crusadia to your hand)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Regulex search a card (your pick depending on situation)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link Regulex and third Crusadia for equimax</span>  &nbsp;  <span>First Crusadia summons itself</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link Equimax with first Crusadia to make accesscode</span>  &nbsp;  <span>You now have a 5300 triple pop monster who’s immune to effects</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Equimax otk combo: Maxumis or Leonis and a Draco along with a third Crusadia that’s not a Draco</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Summon Maxumis/Leonis</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link Maximus/Leonis for Mangius</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Summon Draco to Mangius, then recycle Maxumis/Leonis and add the other one from your deck  to your hand, if the other one is already in your hand then get Arorbia</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Mangius link with Draco to make Regulex</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Summon third crusadia to Regulex’s zone</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Regulex search Revival</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link the third Crusadia with regulex to make Equimax</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Activate Revival</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Summon Maximus and Leonis to Equimax’s zones (this’ll make Equimax total at 5300)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Use Maximus, Leonis, and Revival’s effects and target Equimax, now it does double damage, piercing damage, and can attack all monsters your opponent controls. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Side tips:</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 You can use Spatha to move a Crusadia and get a second one that’ll allow you to overlay</span>  <span>2 As long as you have two Crusadias in your hand you didn’t brick</span>  <span>3 Only summon knightmare phoenix when you know there will still be a main monster zone on your side with an arrow or else it’ll end your turn</span>  <span>4 Halq can help bring out 3 crusadias, arabia and the two empty zones it points to</span>  <span>5 Pankratops can be used to make links if necessary, don’t be scared to use it for that</span>  <span>6 You can use Arorbia to save Reculsa or a Phantom Knight of Break Sword target</span>  &nbsp;

You must send Red-Eyes monsters as quickly as possible to the GY in order to trigger Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon's effect and start to summon multiple level 7 monsters to your field. While using Rokket strategy to summon guardragons in order to get those same monsters, and end up summoning Borreload Savage Dragon.  This deck is best suited for going first. Of course, there are two huge absents in this deck: Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, which isn't in this game, and Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, which is banned in this game for some reason.

If you don't know the drill, the main objective is to summon Crystron Halfquifibrax and a White Stone of Legend as soon as possible in order to have material to summon Guardragon Elpy and Guardragon Pisty to each of Halq's arrows, Special Summon Starliege Seyfert and use it to get Nebula Dragon or other level 8 dragon.  Then, you Link Summon Saryuja Skull Dread in order to dig through your deck and get the combo pieces to get your final board, which must have at least: Hieratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres (1 interruption), Number 38 (1 Spell Negate) and Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon (Pendulum Prevention, if relevant, an 1 GY Negate).  Since this is an early format for Dragon link, you can sometimes get away with some shenanigans, like summoning Photon Lord with Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon as material, in order to negate AND destroy whatever monster you negate. In real TCG you should remove that gimmicky stuff and change them with 3 Chaos Space, substitute CED with Chaos Ruler, the Dragon of Armaggeddon, add 1 or two Noctovision Dragon, remove Infinite Impermanence and add a couple more hand traps.

I freaking love Generaiders. Are they strong? Well, Harr is  surely not bad and technically they do have access to a very fun dragon who's name I won't say but getting it out during turn one requires either 2 specific cards or a wacky one card Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight combo that flees in fear at the sight of pretty much any handtrap. I guess that makes them decent, they have access to a lot of powerful draw spells if playing pure but very limited access to strong boss monsters.  So what <span>are they good at? <span>Communism</span>. That's right, com</span>munism. Generaiders turn their turn into OUR turn. Doing barely anything on your own turn you're playing in their Draw Phase longer than it takes a Sky Striker player to shuffle their deck. WHY IN THE WORLD ARE YOU MAKING TEN PILES, THERE'RE ONLY FIVE MINUTES ON THE CLOCK!! If you haven't noticed yet, I like to use these deck descriptions to proccess my yugioh trauma.  So as I was saying I was going through some Generaider decklists and found BorgarTimeYGO's latest list. And what I saw was eye opening. It was my epiphany toilet on the roof moment. What I saw was obvious and clear as day, yet completely new in every way. I saw a Red-Eyes Fusion.  You don't summon during your turn with the exception of Loptr but even without him you have 10 cards to access Generaider Boss Stage. So I thought if Gravekeepers and Subterrors can do it, why can't I? Or rather, why can't <em>we</em>?  I hereby present to you: The Boss Monster Archetype mixed together with what is probably the strongest boss monster ever printed, Generaider Dragoon.  To be fair I have not tested this deck much (as in I just made the decklist and wrote this article while at work in between calls) and some of the cards may be opted out for different ones but <em>that's</em> what a community is for *roll any sitcom outro*  And don't mind the two extra Jormungandr in the ED and the Loptr in Side. They represent the three Knightmares/Droll &amp; Lock Birds but the <em>lovely</em> new feature that automatically assigns the archetype descriptions apparently considers my deck to be too Knightmare and Machine centric so I'm trying to outsmart the system. Just in case the feature takes words into consideratiom: Generaider, Generaider, GeNeRaIdEr, GENERAIDER!!! (also Red-Eyes)"

I myself have never been a fan of meta decks, but Dino has caught my interest the past few weeks. This deck has all the things I want in a deck, handtraps, boardwipe, draw power, negates, and anti-negates, seeing all of it in one deck definitely made me make a version of my own. The deckbuilding process didn't take much as the deck itself runs a pretty standard ratio, the only thing that you'll tweak are the handtraps, extra deck ratios, and sides. The gameplay is pretty simple since you have a lot of cards that will protect you against disruption, you don't need to think much of any other routes unless your hand is complicated and at the same time, you have cards that will not let your opponent play.  <strong><span>2 Card Combo Going 1st (Miscellaneousaurus + Babycerasaurus) </span></strong><span><span>Note: You can search the missing piece/s by using Fossil Dig.</span></span> <ol>  	<li>Use <span>Miscellaneousaurus' effect, sending it to the GY to provide protection for dinosaur monsters against activated effect (Ash, Gamma, Nibiru, etc.)</span></li>  	<li>Use <span>Miscellaneousaurus' second effect banishing it to special summon Animadorned Archosaur.</span></li>  	<li>Activate Animadorned Archosaur's effect,destroying <span>Babycerasaurus to add Double Evolution Pill.</span></li>  	<li><span>Babycerasaurus effect will trigger since it's destroyed by a card effect, use it to special summon Oviraptor.</span></li>  	<li>Activate Oviraptor's effect to add another copy of <span>Babycerasaurus, normal summon it.</span></li>  	<li>Activate Oviraptor's second effect to destroy <span>Babycerasaurus to special summon the other Babycerasaurus in the GY.

We got fossil dig, it's basically another copy of a level 6 or lower dinosaur monster.</span></li>  	<li>Handtraps - Ash and Gamma is a must in today's metagame specially against zexal and VFD. Nibiru since there's a lot of combo decks in today's game.

But when it works, be it a quick Montage Dragon OTK attempt, focusing on the banishing plays through the Chaos Dragon engine, or just playing the Malefics to try and thin the deck, whatever floats your boat. Maybe one of these days, I'll update it to fit with the modern era. ^^;"

Her quick effect to link off into any of the other Sky Striker links helps her to dodge many hand traps such as Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermanence. In addition to her quick effect to link, she also has a constant reviving effect that allows for her to come back every time a Sky Striker link monster is destroyed, which makes her a very persistent and hard to out card.  Sky Striker Link Monsters: Kagari, Hayate, &amp; Shizuki all work hand in hand, helping you to obtain cards and advantage. Hayate is a foolish burial that helps to set up for Kagari which adds cards from the graveyard to hand. This basic combo helps to bring out certainly needed spells in the deck such as Widow Anchor or Multirole. Shizuku is a searcher for every spell that isn't in the GY, so it is important to know what spells to add back from the GY using Kagari, rather than just choosing a card that may only be situational. Finally, Kaina and Zeke, are the outliers that are only played as one-ofs. Kaina helps to stop any large attacking monsters and Zeke is a Link-2 which helps to remove any monster in your main monster zones.  Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor - The strongest spell in the whole Sky Striker Spell arsenal. Not only does this card negate effects, but can also steal the opponent's monsters. This card is played as a 3 of because it is never bad to open at least 1 and helps to protect your Sky Striker cards from any potential negates from opponent's monsters.  Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer: One of the strongest monsters in terms of both attack power and keeping your opponent in check, not only popping problematic cards but also reviving itself every turn.  Crystron, Selene, Accesscode: This simple combo is an easy game-ender, which allows for you to easily wipe out your opponent's board and attack over any large monsters your Destroy Phoenix Enforcer or Sky Strikers can not beat. Keep in mind, Accesscode is like a glass cannon, and this whole combo can be stopped by any monster or summon negation."

I opted for a going first control based strat, using the Magikey negation trap and Dogmatika Punishment as centerpices of this. The main idea is to get a usable board, and then set the backrow. I also included a strong floodgate as to make sure the opponent can't do much of anything. If anyone has any ideas as to what another engine would work aside from Dogmatika, it'd be appreciated. I plan on building this IRL but I can't afford Dogmatika, so I need a different engine. I feel like Magikeys have a lot of potential and can really pop off, given the right support."

Much thanks!  The idea of the deck is to get out <a data-name=""Lilith, Lady of Lament"">Lilith, Lady of Lament</a> and <a data-name=""Malice, Lady of Lament"">Malice, Lady of Lament</a> as quickly as possible, then use them and <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a> to tribute the opponent's monsters (as well as your tokens) during their turn for the ability to freely set and recycle trap cards. You're free to swap out any traps you'd like, so long as you have Normal Traps in their place. I picked cards that allow you to recycle <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a> and use it infinitely. That is, if Lair gets banished, <a data-name=""Paleozoic Leanchoilia"">Paleozoic Leanchoilia</a> will return it to the GY, where <a data-name=""Jar of Avarice"">Jar of Avarice</a> can recycle it. Also, <a data-name=""Dark Spirit Art - Greed"">Dark Spirit Art - Greed</a> can be used to speed the deck up as much as necessary, providing an additional two cards per turn.  Aside from this, you can also use <a data-name=""Chaos Hunter"">Chaos Hunter and </a><a data-name=""Chaos Hunter"">Barrier Statue of the Abyss</a> to prevent your opponent's actions. Both can be summoned with <a data-name=""Super Team Buddy Force Unite"">Super Team Buddy Force Unite</a> for a surprise effect, and both can be added to your hand with <a data-name=""Sales Pitch"">Sales Pitch</a>. (Their effects can be used because they are not *activated*. That is, continuous effects get a free pass with <a data-name=""Sales Pitch"">Sales Pitch</a>."

""A.I.dle Reborn"" can special summon an ""@ignister"" monster from the GY; if you don't control ""Pikari"" and have ""Backup Secretary"" ""Cyberse Converter"" or ""Catch Eve L2"" in your hand you can special summon one.  And with that you have all the materials needed to link summon ""The Arrival Cyberse @ignister"" and more than likely have some support cards (""Wind Pegasus,"" ""Gussari,"" and/or ""RA.I.te of Battle"" to ensure that you get a chance to use it."

Magikey also known as enchanted key is a new archetype revolving around a vanilla. The fusion/ritual spell even gains an advantage if you control a vanilla and the fusion monsters list a vanilla as one of the requirements. Does that sound familiar? Yes it does! Metalfoes is basically the same thing! </span>  <span>~Perfect~Synergy~</span>  <span>Both archetypes have normal monsters required on the field to use good effects to fusion summon. Both archetypes use level 4 monsters and in my eyes they have ~perfecto~sinergia~</span>  <span>Yes I’m aware I said that twice. (I love saying that idk why) </span>  <span>The Magikey archetype is not meta relevant or anything, it is rouge at best and can put up promising boards (I have combos for them in my video) consisting of a berserker (banish a monster), the level 4 ritual (monster negate during battle phase) and a counter trap (negates a backrow and has a DNA surgery like effect that kills decks relient on attributes) with only 2.5 cards and can also do this WITHOUT even touching the metalfoes part of the deck. The deck can do so much more (metalfoes can put up 4+ interruptions on it’s own). The field spell of this new archetype is REALLY good and it can search any monster AND it can search the fusion/ritual spell which is a brilliant fusion for the deck. I think it definitely has potential, but we will have to wait and see for future support coming out for this deck. If you want to have some fun and have a break from the meta, I recommend trying this deck out - But if you want to win, Just play Dragon link. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>YouTube video link (has combos as well) - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gO7nfLGqEJ8</a></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Thanks, and I’ll see you on the next one! :D</span>"

Sick of your deck being able to play through handtraps? Don't worry, I got you covered.  I've been trying to get my friends into the game, and they both like Blue-Eyes from the anime. So I got to cracking on making a decent Blue-Eyes. Initially, I said screw it. I threw in a bunch of broken traps and a bunch of Blue-Eyes cards. We're talkin' Dogmatika Punishment without any other Dogmatika cards. It was bad. Then I thought ""Huh, this deck doesn't need a normal summon."" so my monkey brain instantly went to the Invoked package. Then I realized, Mechaba is a <strong>Level 9</strong>. Then I thought, ""Huh, can't Blue-Eyes occasionally make <strong>Level 9</strong> Synchros?"". Like any war criminal, I saw the capacity of making 2 Level 9s to go into the <strong>Very Fun Dragon</strong> and tirelessly worked in a feverish haze to create the dumbest combo deck. Without any recollection of what happening during the building and testing, I woke up from a horrible nightmare and saw the monstrosity I created, <strong>Invoked Blue-Eyes VFD Turbo</strong>. Now you may be asking, ""Wouldn't just making it janky Dragon Link with a Rokket Engine be way better and more consistent than an Invoked Engine?"" The answer to that is yes, absolutely.  Basically this deck creates VFD. That's it. Using the Invoked Engine you get out Mechaba, which can kinda protect you from handtraps and gets your first level 9. Then you get out the other level 9 through absolutely ridiculous and obtuse combos to get out a vanilla Blue-Eyes or Alternative and a level 1 Tuner. Your ability to play through established boards is very limited, and so is your ability to prevent them from establishing those boards. Our handtrap of choice is <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Skull Meister &lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Skull Meister </strong></a>simply because can pitch it off <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Chaos Space &lt;/strong&gt;""><strong></strong></a><a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a> for the White Dragon. When it comes to synergy, we need to take what we can get. My side deck is just really broken cards that might help you break boards, I did not spent more than a minute making it.  Normal Combos are like Dragon Link, but way more fragile and inconsistent. <strong>Chaos Space</strong> pitches the useless cards out of our hands and can search our <strong>White &amp; Black Dragons</strong>, which need no explanation. Obviously we want our <strong>White Stones</strong> in the Grave with <strong><a data-name=""Dragon Shrine"">Dragon Shrine</a></strong>, but <strong>Foolish Burial</strong> also lets us get our <strong><a data-name=""Master With Eyes of Blue"">Master With Eyes of Blue</a></strong> in the Grave. If you're unfamiliar, he shuffles himself from the Grave, sends a monster you control to the GY, and gets a <strong>Vanilla Blue-Eyes</strong> or a properly summoned <strong>Alternative</strong> out of your Grave. This is really useful later in the combo when you need to manage your Link Arrows with the Guardragons, or when we can summon him off <strong>Halqifibrax</strong> to make a 9 Synchro. Another monster you probably won't be familiar with is <strong><a data-name=""Sage With Eyes of Blue"">Sage With Eyes of Blue</a></strong>, he pitches himself from the hand, sends a monster you control to the Grave, and grabs a <strong>Vanilla Blue-Eyes</strong> from the Deck. It's because of this card we don't want to abuse our <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;White Stone of Legend&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>White Stone of Legend</strong></a> to move all our bricks to our hand, which is a mandatory effect. In the case we don't want our bricks in hand, we use the <strong>White Stone of Ancients</strong>, which also allows us to add any <strong>Alternatives</strong> in our Graveyard to our hand. Anyways, back to <strong>Sage</strong>, opening him with <strong>Aleister</strong> is especially good, because we can use his effect to send the <strong>Secure Gardna</strong> we were about to banish anyways, and similarly he's useful later in the combo if you want to do some jank plays re-arranging the arrows.  As for our ridiculous Extra Deck options, we're running <strong><a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a></strong>, a legitimately terrible card that happens to fit a specific niche; a downward pointing arrow that we can make with <strong>Almiraj</strong> and any other card in the deck that we can make under a Dragon Lock. See, a lot of combos start with an <strong>Almiraj</strong> we made from <strong>Aleister</strong>, pointing down and to the right. Now let's say we have a <strong>Chaos Dragon</strong> combo going, let's say for example we use the <strong>Black Dragon</strong> to make an <strong>Elpy</strong>, then use the <strong>White Dragon</strong> we added with the <strong>Almiraj</strong> to make <strong>Crossrose</strong>, making our <strong>Elpy</strong> live and getting one of our <strong>White Stones</strong> out of the deck. From here we can go into whatever preferred Rank 2 for the situation, either <strong>Halq</strong> or <strong>Romulus</strong>. A better deck would make <strong>Seal</strong>, but we need as many extenders as we can get. <strong>Number 38</strong> is a flex card. Demonstrated in this flex combo with a test hand I definitely didn't mulligan 3 times to get the absolute nuts on. I also definitely didn't forget to add White Dragon from Black Dragon during it, then drawing 1 with Chaos Space, I simply decided I did not need free cards. Also <strong>Artemis</strong> is to get our shitty Spellcaster Tuners off the board if we get them with Halq to convert them into a Brick-Eyes White Dragon. I do not know why <strong>Avramax </strong>is in this deck.  For other Spells, <strong>One For One </strong>is fine I guess because we run a lot of cards that are just useless in hand so we don't care what we discard off it. <strong><a data-name=""World Legacy Guardragon"">World Legacy Guardragon</a></strong> is an obviously busted card with Elpy. It can be extremely awkward, and have situations where you can't actually use it's Reborn effect cause the dumb fucking X With Eyes of Blue cards are Spellcasters and not Dragons.  <a class=""anchor-3Z-8Bb anchorUnderlineOnHover-2ESHQB"" tabindex=""0"" title=""https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=117911-26424695"" role=""button"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=117911-26424695</a>  Overall this deck is really funny and worth playing just to hear the surprise in your friend's voice when you normal summon Aleister, then start going into Guardragon plays. Called By should probably be in the main deck, however I have opted to instead decide that my opponent will not draw any hand traps when I play this deck. If you're seriously thinking about playing this, <strong>just play Dragon Link instead. It is way more fun and versatile than this pile of trash.</strong>"

It relies on abusing the link-material generation from Scapegoat, Scapeghost, and Tri-Wight to activate Law of the Normal.  <span><strong>Main Deck</strong></span>  <a data-name=""Mokey Mokey"">Mokey Mokey</a> - Nothing in the deck actually requires Mokey Mokey, so it can be replaced. But if you do this, know that you have sinned greatly. Its LIGHT attribute allows you to summon Lyna the Light Charmer.  <a data-name=""Charcoal Inpachi"">Charcoal Inpachi</a> - Replaceable by Bunilla for the EARTH element. It has the highest defense out of all level 1 normal monsters.  <a data-name=""Ankuriboh"">Ankuriboh</a> - Extra defense for your deck and is also searchable by Where Arf Thou?  <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a> - An ideal card to set on turn 1. Protects you and sets up your next turn if any tokens survive.  <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> - Interrupts your opponent's combos and is also searchable by Where Arf Thou? You can also use it link material for Relinquished Anima or Linkuriboh in an emergency.  <a data-name=""Painful Decision"">Painful Decision</a> - Used to setup your graveyard for Tri-Wight plays. It also has the added effect of thinning out your deck of normal monsters, which tend to be weak draws. Keep in mind, if for example have 1 copy of Mokey Mokey in your hand and a Painful Choice, you should use it to search other copies of Mokey Mokey. You want to keep a future Painful Choice usable.  <a data-name=""Law of the Normal"">Law of the Normal</a> - This is one of your win conditions. The activation requirement can be easily met by having four tokens and one normal monster on the field. Keep in mind that it cannot be activated if either you or your opponent do not have a single card to discard. Your monsters are still left on the board after wiping the field.  <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a> - Your best token generator. It is best used at the end of your opponent's turn to bypass its monster summoning restriction.  <a data-name=""Where Arf Thou?"">Where Arf Thou?</a> - Searches level 1 monsters from your deck, including the important Scapeghost. You take 2000 damage if you don't normal summon the monster, but in most cases, this is a negligible penalty.  <a data-name=""Tri-Wight"">Tri-Wight</a> - Special summon 3 monsters with one card? Pretty powerful when it doesn't brick you.  The rest of the cards in the deck are additional cards to either accelerate the strategy or protect you. They can be replaced with alternatives should you see fit.  <strong><span>Extra Deck</span> </strong><strong> </strong><a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> - Three copies are needed to convert your normal monsters into effect monsters. They also provide you an additional summon if you have a normal monster in hand.  <a data-name=""Relinquished Anima"">Relinquished Anima</a> - If your opponent mispositions a monster, you can remove and steal its power with this card.  <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> - An additional card to convert your normal monsters. If you have this card in the graveyard and Topologic Zeroboros on the board, you can use this card to help create the activation requirement of Zeroboros's field nuke.  <a data-name=""Missus Radiant"">Missus Radiant </a>- Used to start the link plays for your Scapegoat tokens.  Charmers - Additional cards with attribute coverage to start your link plays with. If the conditions are right, you can revive one of your opponents monsters.  Knightmare Cerberus and Phoenix - Provides you generic destruction effects in a pinch.  <a data-name=""Topologic Zeroboros"">Topologic Zeroboros</a> - The main boss monster of the deck and is what you generally will try to aim to activate if Law of the Normal isn't in your hand."

VRAINS and this archetype is @Ignister.  @Ignister is an archetype of cyberse monsters with various attributes who rely on swarming and beatdown strategies and this archetype is capable of ritual, fusion, synchro and XYZ summon.  Why am I discussing this archetype? Because recently @Ignister has shown it’s fangs in the OCG competition.  Anyways, let's jump to the deck list.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Monsters</div></blockquote> 3x Nibiru, The Primal Being  I think this card is the right card to be used as a hand trap in this @Ignister deck. The reason is because @Ignister really needs enough space to execute the combo perfectly, especially when the opponent has taken the link zone position on the right which makes Dark Templar @Ignister unable to use it’s full effect (special summon 3 @Ignister monster from graveyard). With the right timing this card can stop the opponent combo and force them to end their turn.  3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring  This card is perfect for counter every archetype on Yu-Gi-Oh! Starting from stopping add card from deck to hand, special summon from deck and send a card from deck to graveyard. Three copies are needed to increase the chances of getting this card in opening hand.  3x PSY-Framegear Gamma  If you are wondering why I choose to use PSY-Framegear archetype as my hand trap in main deck. Before I upload this deck I always test it first by dueling with competitive decks that are often used in TCG ranging from meta to rogue. Many events like when I use A.I. First Meet You and Cynet Mining in 1st turn where the enemy will negate that card using Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring, so I can negate it back using PSY-Framegear Gamma and we also got free 2 monster on board (PSY-Framegear Gamma and PSY-Frame Driver). It also gives us a chance to fight back against True King of Calamities.  1x PSY-Frame Driver  A Psychic soldier that rides into battle against the Security Forces on currents of lightning, using an autonomic amplifier called ""PSY-Frame”, and he is a normal monster.  1x Danmari @Ignister  If this card in your hand, you can special summon this card and negate opponent attack. If this card in your graveyard, you can banish this card and negate 1 face-up card effect. We're going to use the Bururu @Ignister effect and send this card to from deck to graveyard so we have 1 negate in opponent turn. One is enough.  3x Pikari @Ignister  Pikari @Ignister is a amazing searcher that can search spells/trap and add it from deck to your hand. We use Pikari @Ignister effect to search When A.I. First Meet You/A.I.dle Reborn depending on what card we have in hand.  2x Doyon @Ignister  We use Doyon @Ignister effect to add back to hand @Ignister monster and spell in graveyard.  2x Bururu @Ignister  We use Bururu @Ignister effect to send 1 @Ignister monster to graveyard, the best part is to send Danmari @Ignister, also we use Bururu @Ignister to synchro summon and trigger it’s effect to special summon other monster which has been used as synchro material.  3x Achichi @Ignister  Achichi @Ignister also an amazing searcher like Pikari @Ignister, he search @Ignister monster and add it from deck to your hand. We use Achichi @Ignister effect to search other @Ignister monster to maximize our combo, depending on what card we have in hand.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Spells</div></blockquote> 3x When A.I. First Meet You  Reveal 1 cyberse monster and add 1 @Ignister monster with the same attribute, that is a very good thing, but there is another problem that we have to take 2300 damage if you didn’t special summon the revealed monster. Eldlich and Amazement only pay 800 LP while we burn 2300 LP, sort of mission impossible for me. The best way to use it is to search Doyon @Ignister and Bururu @Ignister, because in our combo we will definitely link summon Dark Infant @Ignister and synchro summon Wind Pegasus @Ignister.  3x Cynet Mining  Another spell for search @Ignister monster, but you need to send 1 card from your hand to the graveyard. It's quite risky, but we have no other choice at the moment, for now, maybe.  3x Three Tactical Talent  I choose Three Tactical Talent as supporting spell in this deck. This card has 3 effects that is draw 2 cards, take control 1 monster your opponent control and look at opponent hand choose 1 card from it and shuffle into the deck. I choose this card as a support over the Pot of Desires, Pot of Extravagance and Pot of Prosperity. This card is the safest choice because it will not interfere with the performance of this deck, like banish 10 cards from top of your deck or banish some monster from your extra. Other alternatives for Three Tactical Talent if you don't like this card is Pot of Avarice, since you only shuffle back to deck 5 monsters in graveyard and draw 2 cards, this is another great option to increase durability and recovery. I recommend this card more because I know TCG deck has a lot of hand traps in their main deck, and it will help to trigger this card effect with lots of options offered from this card.  1x Monster Reborn  Target 1 monster in either graveyard and special summon it. It's important to turn the tide and a nice spell to recovery.  1x Harpie’s Feather Duster  One of the best removal spell and trap in Yu-Gi-Oh! I choose to play this over Lightning Storm. The reason is because the @Ignister archetype really needs their field spells, which is quite the opposite of Lightning Storm requirement that’s if you control no face-up card you can activate 1 of 2 effect. Based on my experience it is quite rare for my opponents to choose to destroy field spells, they prefer monsters instead. Lightning Storm might fit in the 2nd turn but for the 1st turn it will be quite a hassle in certain situations.  2x Ignister A.I. Land  The most important thing from the @Ignister archetype, because with this card we can carry out the best combos. Sometimes many people forget the best effect this card has, if this card in your graveyard you can banish 1 @Ignister monster from graveyard and set this card. As long as we don't meet the Cosmic Cyclone, everything will be fine.  3x A.I.dle Reborn  This is a quick spell that can target 1 @Ignister monster in your graveyard and special summon it. If this card is in graveyard you can banish this card and 1 card from your hand then add back 1 A.I. spell/trap that’s banished or in your graveyard except this card.  3x Forbidden Droplet  Still the best card for overcoming Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and this card is a quick spell. You can use field spell Ignister A.I. Land instead of @Ignister monster to activate this card, because we can set back Ignister A.I. from graveyard by banish 1 @Ignister monster.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Extra</div></blockquote> 1x Wind Pegasus @Ignister  I choose Wind Pegasus @Ignister over the Cyberse Quantum Dragon, because Wind Pegasus @Ignister can destroy spell/trap your opponent controls up to the number of @Ignisiter monsters you control, and we can banish this card then target 1 card your opponent control shuffle it into deck.  1x Light Dragon @Ignister  XYZ monster that can destroy face-up monster and can special summon 1 link monster from your graveyard if another cyberse monster inflict battle damage, also this card is light attribute that can be used to trigger When A.I. First Meet You and add Pikari @Ignister.  1x The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister  Front line defense from this deck and also one of the boss monsters in this deck. A.I. from Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS approve this  1x Accesscode Talker  Second boss and Yusaku Fujiki from Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS approve this. You can combine this with The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister and make Accesscode Talker have 8300 ATK, this number is come from 2300 ATK as basic ATK of Accesscode Talker plus 6000 ATK from Link 6 that’s The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister have or you can use normal combo with Transcode Talker and Update Jammer so Accesscode Talker can attack twice.  2x Transcode Talker  We need it 2 copies, 1 for link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister and other 1 for link summon Accesscode Talker.  1x Decode Talker Heatsoul  Substitute for Fire Phoenix @Ignister, also he burn 1000 LP for draw 1 card. Amazing.  1x Dark Templar @Ignister  Let's fill the board with @Ignister monster. He is the beginning to summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister.  1x Update Jammer  Make Accesscode Talker can attack twice.  2x Splash Mage  Same like Transcode Talker we need it to link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister and Accesscode Talker, also it's a nice card that help in link climbing.  1x Cyberse Wicckid  Only used to search Bururu @Ignister.  2x Dark Infant @Ignister  1 Link monster, who can add Ignister A.I. Land from deck to your hand. 2 copy is needed, 1 for search field spell and 1 to trigger Dark Templar @Ignister effect.  1x Link Spider  Why spider links? Because we have normal monsters in this deck? Did you guys forget we have Nibiru, The Primal Being and PSY-Frame Driver. This card is quite useful if your opponent drops Nibiru, The Primal Being.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Side</div></blockquote> 1x Dinowrestler Pankratops  Hidden beater.  1x Artifact Lancea  With this card we can stop opponent banish cards for one 1 turn. In several duels VS Drytron, Drytron always drops this card when I finishes link summon Accesscode Talker, really annoying. So we're going to play defense with a Crossout Designator.  1x Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion  Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion is also a problem in itself when I using Dark Templar @Ignister and Doyon @Ignister effect.  1x Skull Meister  Eldlich used this card a lot in their main deck, so 1 copy for Crossout Designator.  1x Droll &amp; Lock Bird  With this card we can stop opponent add more card from deck to hand.  1x Called by The Grave  Virtual World used this card in their main deck, just in case, so 1 copy.  2x Cosmic Cyclone  The real problem is coming from Cosmic Cyclone since this card is banish and not send to graveyard, really bad for field spell Ignister A.I. Land, so 2 copy for Crossout Designator also this is a decent removal by pay 1000 LP.  3x Crossout Designator  Good under certain conditions, but because I tested this deck by dueling with the TCG deck, this card is better to be a side, because we can first observe in the first duel what hand traps the opponent has and prepare the counter. Also the thing to remember is this card only negate one card for 1 turn and not counter back and send it to graveyard, so in next turn opponent can use it back. This card only provides temporary protection. As an alternative you can play 3 Torrential Tribute and 3 Solemn Strike as a better defense in a slow game tempo.  1x Infinite Impermanence  Believe it or not this one is more troublesome than a monster hand trap, because this card is a trap card and we cannot trigger an effect from Three Tactical Talent since it’s need monster effect.  1x Solemn Strike  Pay 1500 LP.  1x Solemn Judgement  Pay Half LP.  1x Imperial Order  This is a troublesome card because it completely stops @Ignister, we can't use spell cards.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Strategy in 1st turn</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister with 3000 ATK, strong 6/10</li>  	<li>Link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister with 4000 ATK, very strong 7/10</li>  	<li>Link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister with 5000 ATK, almost perfect 8/10</li>  	<li>Link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister with 6000 ATK, perfect 9/10</li> </ol> Note: The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister is unaffected by other cards effect, it’s mean that Nibiru, The Primal Being, Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder, Borrelsword Dragon, Raigeki, Lightning Strom, Forbidden Droplet, Ice Dragon’s Prison, Solemn Strike and Solemn Judgement can't touch The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister  Note: The only thing that can beat The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister is Kaiju.  Recommendation: I recommend that you all link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister with atleast 4000 ATK, since Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder and True King of Calamities have 3000 ATK the opponent can carry out a suicide attack and destroy The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister by battle. Also Invoked Augeoeides can make his ATK over 4000 depending on situations and conditions in duel.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Strategy in 2nd turn</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Use The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister that already link summon in 1st turn, strong 6/10</li>  	<li>Link summon Accesscode Talker with 5300 ATK, very strong 7/10</li>  	<li>Link summon Accesscode Talker with 8300 ATK, almost perfect 8/10</li> </ol> Recommendation: You all better not rush to make Accesscode Talker by sacrifice The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister because you will waste the only one of the strongest defenses in this deck.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Basic combo using Achichi @Ignister in 1st turn to make The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister 5000 ATK</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Achichi @Ignister and search Pikari @Ignister</li>  	<li>Link summon Dark Infant @Ignister and search Ignister A.I.

This really solidifies your position on the board.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Another combo is the nephthys rebirth, a level 2, conductor, and two spare cards in your hand. Ritual summon conductor using the level 2, use her effect to summon devotee, use devotee to summon disciple, disciple effect to destroy the spare hand card and search sacred phoenix, link devotee and disciple to make preserver, preserver effect search cerulean phoenix and recycle ritual spell in graveyard, devotee effect destroy other spare hand card and summon it, play ritual spell and tribute sacred phoenix to summon cerulean. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Three rituals summoned for the main event... sacred flame, at this point you might wonder why you would do this with killing so many resources. To put it simply, two things, the first thing is that the materials are able to be fished out of the deck really quickly and the second thing is that the cards you sacrificed from your hand may also trigger effects and extend your combo to make even more threats (like the true kings to make a VFD as well).</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Another little thing I found out is that you can ritual devotee, summon a nephthys, link both for cross sheep, then devotee can summon herself from the graveyard to trigger cross sheep’s draw 2 discard 2 effect.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I really like using this deck and I hope you guys might enjoy it too!

It's pretty versatile, draws a lot, OTKs often, and have good defences for brick hand situations. I rarely lose if I have Infinite Light active but I'm not a big fan of Infinite-trio either as I believe it takes too much space (5 to have 3-1-1 ratio) that can be dead draws too if drawn in the wrong order. And you don't always get to the final step of it anyway or you get it started too late. I prefer using 5 slots for better synergy and draws.

Once summoned activate Hajun's effect to special summon Dakki the Graceful Mayakashi from the deck. Then you should go into the level 3 Mayakashi synchro, activate Dakki's graveyard effect to special summon itself to go into the level 5 Mayakashi synchro monster using Dakki and the level 3 synchro monster to do so. Then you just keep synchro summoning using Dakki and a Mayakashi synchro monster until you go into your level 11 Mayakashi synchro monster. Now you have milled out a large chunk of your opponents deck and have a level 11 synchro monster. You can use the many revival cards to revive Dakki and the level 3 Mayakashi synchro to summon until you have the level 9 and level 11 synchro monsters on the field. As you special summon opponents deck gets thinner by the effect of Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower and with zombie world on the field all monsters they summon also count as zombie monsters to make it even easier to deck your opponent out."

The main strategy of this deck is field control. Use your resources to control the field until you can bring out your more powerful monsters the level 7's. Combined with Sea Stealth Attack, the level 5 &amp; 7 monsters are a nuisance. An ideal field is to get A Legendary Ocean, Sea Stealth Attack, and 2 water monsters on the field doesn't really matter which.  I would recommend at least 1 or more Gameciel in the main deck if you can figure out what to take out for it."

Your main goal is to either stall your opponent/break their bo","Very much on the expensive side, but this is a work in progress. So it's best to copy this to a dueling site/game (I use duelingnexus.com), then adjust it there for your liking. Even though it has 52 cards in the Main Deck it's been incredibly consistent so far.  I won't write down any combos, because  Shaddolls in my opinion (this build at least) are intuitive. I will say say though that you can use Nadir Servant  to send Apkallone to the grave  to search for your Shaddoll cards, which is why I run so many-- you could however replace one with  Titaniklad or Elder Entity N'tss if you want to search more Dogmatikas/pop more cards. You can use  gravity controller to get rid of troublesome boss monsters. In the Side Deck I haven't personally used the Galaxy Eyes monster, Mekk-Knight Crusadia and Nightmare Gryphon yet, but I'm sure they'll be useful in some match-ups (can use Construct to make the Galaxy Eyes). Lastly the generic traps can be swapped out with what you want like Solemn Strike instead of Torrential Tribute(I like Torrential because it triggers the Shaddoll effects too), which makes the deck a bit flexible (just keep in mind the traps that discard obviously really  help the deck)."

Una carta. Una travesura. El más grandioso FTK en la historia! OwO It was about time it was born. A card. A mischief. T,"Deck creado por: Darklab  <strong>Objetivo:</strong> Ganar con el efecto de Ghostrick Angel of Mischief para ganar de la manera más gloriosa! (y consistente) OwO  <strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://youtu.be/Jl1JScrbN_o &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  <strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>  Para iniciar el combo sólo necesitaremos invocar a Isolde. Para eso hay muchísimas cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo. Si tenemos suerte, sólo hará falta 1 carta!  <strong>Extenders para invocar a Isolde</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Neo Space Connector: </strong>Con esto no hará falta nada más, adicionalmente, al traer a Dolphin, podremos encargarnos de una handtrap.</li>  	<li><strong>Marauding Captain: </strong>Sirve junto con otro guerrero en mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk Forward: </strong>Se invoca gratis si no controlamos monstruos.</li>  	<li><strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin:</strong> Es una Normal Summon bastante decente (ver Connector)</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha Knight: </strong>Ya que la mayoría de nuestros guerreros es de nivel 3, al invocar uno de esos, éste se invocará gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady: </strong>Se invoca gratis si controlamos otro guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Shien's Smoke Signal: </strong>Nos busca un Six Samurai.</li>  	<li><strong>Six Samurai Mizuho: </strong>Se invoca si tenemos a Shinai, si no, puede hacer de Normal Summon.</li>  	<li><strong>Six Samurai Shinai: </strong>Se invoca si tenemos a Mizuho, si no, puede hacer de Normal Summon.</li>  	<li><strong>Six Samurai Kizan: </strong>Se invoca si tenemos a cualquier Six Samurai. Muy útil.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente. Incluso si roba un garnet, es posible devolverlo con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>  	<li>Hay dos Isolde, por lo que si uno falla, aún queda otro.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene acceso a protección como Sauravis y Dragged Down into the Grave.</li>  	<li>El deck no depende del burn, por lo que no es afectado por incrementos de LP del oponente.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck depende de conseguir contadores con el loop de los Six Samurai, por lo que hay que calcular dicha cantidad de contadores antes de acabar con el loop.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, tiene varios Garnets.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck requiere de varios pasos específicos para lograrse, si alguno no se realiza correctamente, uno puede bloquearse.</li> </ul>"

That (and 3 cans of beer) made my mind clear like a blank paper. Why should I follow the meta when my oldest waifu haven't hit the field even once? I once owned Cosmo Queen OCG card, the original one with small description border and I love it so much.  Cosmo Queen alone is worthless normal monster. Her only (not so) specific support card is Cosmo Brain and that is not enough. While other spellcaster-engines such as Witchcrafter, Magistus, Spellbook and Pendulam can bring her on the board quickly enough, the Dark Magician is more potent on Normal Spellcaster Monster and Cosmo Queen can play along nicely.  &nbsp;  How to play.  1. Use Dark Magician engine to Summon Ebon Illusion Magician(EIM asap.  2. Use EIM ability to summon Cosmo Queen.  3. Attack with Cosmo Queen.  That's it. If u can bring Cosmo Queen out that mean your board is already good.  &nbsp;  I do not care much about comboing because all I care is to bring Cosmo queen on the board as quickly as possible and the only achetypes I love is Spellcaster. If u have more potent cards to bring Cosmo Queen on the board please tell me.  PS. Kawaita Sakebi is an amazing song."

There is a card which is called DMZ dragon which can equip a level 4 or lower dragon monster to any dragon monster you control and it's effect is not even a HOPT.  With other words we just have to get buster dest. sword into the gy and dmz onto the board. And the easiest way to achive this is by using the buster link and striker dragon into recharger to get dmz back onto the board.  And the good thing about dmz is that he isn't HOPT, so we can just use divine lance again do get access to phalanx, then get dmz through elpy and loop dmz a couple of times to get free link/synchro material.  So yeah that's basically the new d-link varient, thx. konami for buster lock reloded.  And btw. my decklist is just an example, Im sure there are better ways to build it.

You can replace Avramax for just about any good generic Cyberse Link.  &nbsp;  <strong>CAUTION:</strong> This Deck plays like a house of cards.

The thing about Synchrons is that they lack playable cards that replace themselves and you have to open certain combinations of cards to be able to play and combo, so this list aims to remedy that with the support that we have at the moment.  The deck will still open kind of unplayable hands, but thats what the Halq-Auroradon line is for.  DO NOT GO FOR THIS PLAY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SPELL /TRAP TO SET. This will result in Tzolkin Pass.  Combo: Turbo out speeder, any way you can and summon it to the extra monster zone, If you open any of your Synchron Garnets, and Junk connector, resolve junk connector to bring the garnet back, whether that be a Hyper Synchron, Fleur, and so on. Summon Quickdraw, Hyper, Junk, Fleur, and Cyberse Synchrons from your deck with Speeder. Then contact your Quickdraw Synchron and Junk Speeder into Tzolkin (summon it to one of the main monster zones). Then set a card from your hand to trigger Tzolkin, then summon Power Tool Dragon with Tzolkin's effect to the extra monster zone. Search for a copy of Living fossil from deck with Power tool. Then make Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon using Cyberse Synchron and Power Tool Dragon, summon it in the extra monster zone.  After that, use living fossil to bring back a level 2 monster from the graveyard (the one you used to summon Speeder) and Make Garden Rose Maiden with Junk Synchron and the Level 2. Then Synchro summon Dawn Dragster using Fleur Synchron and Garden Rose Maiden. After that, Make Geomathmech Final Sigma using Hyper Synchron and Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, and summon it to the extra monster zone. Then you can activate the graveyard effect of Garden Rose Maiden to bring back Crystal Wing. You end on a Board of Geomathmech Final Sigma in the EMZ, a Crystal Wing for a monster negate, F.A. Dawn Dragster for a Spell negate, and Tzolkin.  For the Halq Line, just make Halq with any tuner plus any monster or any 2 tuners. When you summon Halq, use its effect to summon Deskbot 001 from deck, Then Link them into  Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon. Then summon 3 tokens, this will trigger the Deskbot in grave, summon it using its effect. Then summon Herald of The Arc Light using one Mecha Phantom Beast Token and the Deskbot. After that activate the second effect of Auroradon to destroy the two remaining tokens to summon Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing from deck. On summon, the Coltwing will summon 2 more LVL3 tokens. This will trigger the effect of Deskbot 001 again, summon it again. After you, Synchro Summon Power Tool Dragon using 2 tokens and the Deskbot. After that search for a copy of Living Fossil from deck. Then activate the Living fossil to bring back the Deskbot one more time. Now you synchro summon Borreload Savage Dragon using the Deskbot and Power Tool. Equip the Halq from graveyard to the Savage Dragon.  &nbsp;"

Halq is 4 negates with the new Magikey?! They float too as follow-up. Board is DRNM/Zeus proof with tons of handtraps.,"https://youtu.be/Ch662tTwTHI  mAgiKeY Lel. Full combo is <strong>Halq+field spell</strong> (4 negates, Borreload Savage, Clear Wing Fast, Magikey lv8 ritual, and counter trap), <strong>minimal combo is Halq only</strong> (3 negates, minus the counter trap). Both endboards are Zeus proof because with VFD gone, simple multiple negations cannot block Zeus. Watch the combo in the video.  The gameplan is to dump different attribute to the GY (light is the most important) while combo-ing so the Magikey lv8 ritual can negate more stuff. Avoid using lv1 monster (Effect Veiler, Tenyi Adhara), because it cant reach lv8 ritual fodder.  To make Halq with Nibiru proof, you can use Atlantean/Deep Sea engine from <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/absolutely-fair-abhyss/"">ABSOLUTELY FAIR ABHYSS</a>, but it comes with more bricks (deck is already bricky enough with normal monsters as fodder for the ritual/fusion) and Magikey needs normal monster to function. Psy-Frame Driver is kinda useful too here, as it is a high level light normal monster for ritual fodder.  &nbsp;  Pros: Legit consistent board with great meta matchup and bis staple slot.  Cons: Fragile (can be made Nibiru proof as mentioned above)."

XYZ into Draglubion, then summon numeron dragon for 9000 to face  Else we also can use Fortia and the useless level 4 for stall with the tapir or just by being warocks.  Other strategy is crashing Fortia, summon Bashios and Abo to clear board and swing for 6000  Not sure were to get the missing 2k there  We also have the accescode talker package for being assholes  So we stall or try to otk basically, trying to ignore our opponent as good as possible as we dont want to read what their cards do  Also if we get a xyz 4 out Numeron would be at 13000"

(ANOTHER ONE!) I made a build a few weeks ago and I have been testing it out in duelingbook rated and I have made quite a few changes to the deck and I have updated combos, new card additions and replays of a few duels. With Drytrons and Virtual worlds’ win condition VFD gone, there is literally nothing that stops dragons from being the BEST deck of the March 2021 format. Not even Zoo Eldlich is as good as this deck (it is also tier 1 but In my opinion dragons are the better choice). I have even made a vow to not play any duels on rated this format except with dragon link. If I were to make any edits to this decklist, I will post an updated one in the future so stay tuned!! I really hope you enjoy this article Since I went all out typing all this :)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Just a quick reminder that the deck explanation, All the combos, test hands, deck explanations and ways to best use your resources are ALL on my Youtube video. Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me and the channel!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the video -<a> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBnD5AZVUB4</a></span>  &nbsp;  <b>Why this is One of the best decks to play this format</b><span> -</span>  &nbsp;  <span>This deck is really good for the current format because it is so good at playing through handtraps and well established boards. The deck has just so many extenders that it can keep going. Even my arch nemesis (nibiru) cannot stop this deck for performing a well established board (sometimes it does - those are times we do not speak of). It can play through droll as well (ends on seals + tidying + savage AT LEAST). It can also set up a variety of high impact disruptions during an opponent's turn like OMNI negates, Bounces (not targeted removal) and even multiple monster effect negations. Seals and tidying do a good job countering zoodiac and for eldlich you have a bunch of side deck options. Dragon link is the best deck of the format as of now not because of how many negates it sets up, but because of its consistency and being able to play through hand traps and negates. What it does, it does consistently and with ease. Unlike a deck like zoo eldlich which gets hard countered by anti- control cards (get rid of the normal summon is usually gg to the zoo engine and any kind of backrow removal can deal with eldlich) dragon link has little weaknesses. Dragons are back, you’ll see what I mean after the deck explanation.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Deck composition</b><span> -</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The deck is obviously a 40 card deck for consistency reasons and it must stay that way. If you want, you can play the deck with 42-43ish cards but I do not recommend playing a deck with anything more than that amount. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Notice</b><span>: some cards are in more than one category, this means that they have multiple uses depending on your situation.</span>  &nbsp; <table>  <tr> <td><b>Starters - </b><span>cards that you use to get your combo going, usually your normal summon but there are exceptions. </span></td> <td><span>For the starters of the deck I am playing 3 Chamber Dragonmaid (my personal favorite), 1 black dragon, 1 white dragon, 1 black metal, 1 darkness metal, 2 seyfert and 3 chaos space. The ratios are almost the same from my last build but for this updated version I am including the 1 black metal and cutting seyfert to 2 copies. (Was at 3 in my last version) I did this because variety is always good and playing black metal gives us access to darkness metal which is a VERY good extender that I did not include in my last build. Black metal can also be used as an alternative monster to summon off of elpy if you draw a broutar or lavineer. The baby chaos dragons also count as starters since chaos space and seyfert are basically used to search them out. If you draw one of them with a normal summon of the opposite attribute or have a monster with the opposite attribute in the grave you have more than full combo. The same applies to darkness metal dragon. Chamber Dragonmaid unlike the other starters does not bring out 2 dragons to the field but searches the very high impact Dragonmaid tidying. This is by far the best starter (my opinion) since the deck plays so many extenders and since tidying adds to your negates (very high impact and is effective against the metagame).</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Rokket engine</b><span> - cards that support the rokkets and cards from the archetype in general</span></td> <td><span>For the Rokket engine, I am playing 2 tracer (explian this in a second), 2 synchron, 1 recharger, 1 absorouter, 1 boot sector and 3 quick launch. I decided to cut down tracer to 2 copies rather than 3 because I wanted the deck to be strictly 40 cards and because I am playing 2 synchron I figured that the ratio would work fine. Absorouter is mainly to mill off of ravine to search a rokket (the one to search depends on the situation) or if you draw it you can simply discard it with something like chaos space or you can even use it as an extender to special summon it out. Boot sector is a soft brick because drawing it will mean a -1 since you will search it for free with striker dragon and NOBODY throws away an ash blossom on a striker dragon (even if they do they wasted their ash and you can probably combo safely and dish out a multiple negate board). Quick launch can summon tracer or synchron (or recharger, not sure why you would do that though) from the deck and is a great extender as well, no explanation needed there. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Extenders</b><span> - cards that help you make a better board and help out of you get hand trapped or play through well established boards</span></td> <td><span>For extenders we have 3 quick launch, 3 World legacy gaurdragon, 2 dragonmaid tidying, 3 noctovision dragon, 1 absorouter dragon, 1 broutar, 1 lavineer, 1 black dragon, 1 white dragon, 1 darkness metal dragon and even 3 chaos space (this might never come up but you can search lavineer with this as well if you used the baby chaos dragons). The baby chaos dragons and darkness metal are extenders if drawn since they do not require the normal summon to bring out. Chaos space is an extender because you can search lavineer with it (you will almost never do this) and can then use broutar to search something like noctovision with broutar OR you can search one of the chaos dragon with it. This is useful in a number of ways. Let's say you use chamber dragonmaid as your starter. Then you can use chaos space to search the chaos dragons (white and black) and use them to extend your plays and set up more negates or you can use them as backup if you get hit with lets say something high impact like nibiru or gamma. If you draw seyfert as your starter and have chaos space in hand as well, then you can either simply discard space to recycle the chaos dragons and get card advantage or you can search lavineer with it (if you have a light monster in your hand to spare - unlikely since the deck runs minimal light monsters). World legacy is a monster reborn like card and is basically like 3 extenders in 1 because it can reborn a monster, it can change the zone of elpy to help gaurdragon combos go on with 1 less monster and it can also be popped using tracer to summon a rokket!! So many uses for 1 card!! There is also a combo with this I show in my video, make sure to check it out! The rest of the cards I think are just plain extenders and I have mentioned them before, no explanation needed there. Another great thing about extenders is that if you draw an extra one, you can end on an extra negate since elpy can summon chamber instead of broutar which means an extra tidying!! Tidying is also an extender because if draw it can be discarded, and then it can reborn chamber from the grave or this effect can be used for the turn after you used it’s negation effect as a good follow up. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Combo Extenders</b><span> - these are cards that if you draw, that will help you set up more negates / interruptions in your end board. They however do not always help you if you get hand trapped (in some cases they do help) like regular extenders.</span></td> <td><span>I have all the things that are in the “extender” section in here as well but I will not mention them here. The combo extenders are - 2 rokket tracer, 2 rokket synchron, 1 rokket recharger, 2 dragon maid tidying and (in some cases) chamber dragonmaid. Chamber is the best starter in my opinion but it is also a combo extender. It helps search tidying (extra negate) when summoned and if you use your starter as something that does not normal summon, chamber becomes a combo extender as well. All the rokkets if drawn can be summoned off of boot (boot can summon up to 2 from hand). Tidying is just a negate on it’s own (just set it) and it is also an extender since it can banish itself from the GY (follow up turn) to reborn a chamber which can be used to link into something like borrelsword to OTK and chamber can even search an additional tidying to play the grind game!! </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Handtraps</b><span> - to prevent the opponent from doing way toooooo much stuff </span></td> <td><span>I am playing 3 ash (standard) and 3 PSY-gamma. Gamma is good to protect seyfert and chaos space from getting hit with ash blossom from the opponent and can also help to make an earlier savage dragon to protect from nibiru. This deck can play through handtraps and negates of well established boards really well so I decided to minimize on handtraps. If you want, you can throw in more handtraps and cut some extenders but with much testing, I think more extenders is the better call.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Soft Bricks</b><span> - cards you don’t always what to draw, drawing them usually means a -1 since you search them anyways</span></td> <td><span>There is boot sector launch and dragon ravine. Especially boot sector since striker will never be negated and drawing it means you get a -1 basically. Romulus gets negated sometimes so ravine is not that bad of a draw. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Big boy brick</b><span> - NEVER want to draw this card, if you do I’m sorry</span>  <span>Btw drawing PSY-driver also means a -1, nothing too big</span></td> <td><span>Only 1 brick.</span>  <span>“A Psychic soldier that rides into battle against the Security Forces on currents of lightning, using an autonomic amplifier called PSY-Frame.”</span></td> </tr>  </table> &nbsp;  <b>Changes to the Extra and side decks</b>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li> <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>No longer running Number 62</b><span>: Since Konami completely exodia obliterated Drytrons with the banlist, there is no longer a need to even play this and it is irrelevant to play this just for eldlich since they have other ways to win and other ways to get golden boy onto the field. </span></li> </ol> </li> </ol> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>I’m not running abomination and Dill: <span>These were just not needed and I decided to kick them out of the decklist.</span></b></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">I’m running borrelsword<span>: It is a better OTK card and a better version of unchained (unfortunately requires 3+ monsters) BUT getting this onto your field turn 2 will (most to the time) be an auto win.</span></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">I’m running seal at 2 copies: <span>this was needed since there are always chances your opponent can play through the disruptions and also seals in an AMAZING card so 2 is better.</span></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">Striker dragon is at 3: <span>I was really dumb to not do this in my last build since I did not have space.

I prefer to play the control version since it is less susceptible to handtraps. <blockquote><div>Monsters</div></blockquote> 1x Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted - Searchable negation+ has a neat interaction with Buster Blader, The Dragon Destroyer Swordsman  1x Dogmatika Maximus - Mass milling  1x Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous - A searchable searcher  2x Buster Blader, The Destruction Swordmaster - Buster Blader retrain.  3x Buster Whelp of The Destruction Swordsman - The best normal summon. the Aleister of buster blader  2x Dragon Buster of the Destruction sword - Konami made a mistake unbanning this  3x Psy Framegear Gamma- Protects Nadir <blockquote><div>Spells</div></blockquote> 3x Nadir Servant - Best spell in the deck.

First off, this isn't perfect, but it works well for me. I've researched many versions of this deck, and in a way, this is a combination of various strategies I've found. I was looking to build a version that is consistent and fast, so I came up with this. You can say that this is a turbo/combo variation of the deck. I do have my own criticism with it because it requires running a bit of bricks, but I can say for the most part that it is pretty clean. I have been able to summon Magnus with 9 materials a few times which I was never able to do in other versions I've seen. But that isn't the point here. Usually, you can summon him within a turn or two. If all else fails, you can play the long game and clutch, but this is susceptible to disruptions. Anyways, I hope to hear anything constructive or helpful to tweak this to be even better!"

Ignister Deck 2021 using the new support cards. Summon The Arrival @Ignister with 6k attack and unaffected by card effects, or do an ","Hello,  I've built a A.I. deck recently and tested it on A LOT of games... I play yu gi oh since years, and really it's just the best deck I did.  The new support Dark Infant @Ignister is just amazing and give A.I. decks a new breath. I tested and with this deck I succeed to beat easily Eldich decks, Drytron decks and all meta decks....  <strong>There is two options with this deck : </strong> <ul>  	<li>The 'Unbreakable' board : by doing the combo in order to summon (easily !) The Arrival Cyberse atIgnister, which is a card with 6000 attack, non affected by card effects and the effect to destroy 1 card and summon 1 token each turn.... If your opponent doesn't have Kaiju it will be a little tricky for him... Even if he has monsters like Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon or Mekk-Knight Crusadia because we have in this deck Forbidden Droplet or TA.I Strike which can protect him during battle phases.</li>  	<li>The OTK : by doing the combo in order to summon Accesscode Talker and Transcode Talker by using Update Jammer in order to allow them to attack twice ! Then with this combo we can have Accesscode with 5200 attack which can attack twice and has the faculty to destroy up to 3 cards using this deck without the possibility for your opponent to respond AND Transcode Talker with 2300 attack which can also attack twice... Hey hey boy.</li> </ul> <strong>The hand traps and counter cards : </strong>  So... We have 12 cards that are used to counter combo decks or ""full traps boards"" : <ul>  	<li>Nibiru : which is of course amazing against combo decks. And then we can use Nibiru with Pikari @Ignister to have A.I. Land and after that summoning Barricadeborg Blocker and then doing our combo. Or we can use Nibiru with Achichi @Ignister with can then be used to summon Hiyari @Ignisrer or Doshin @Ignister. After that we can then summon Dark Templar @Ignister and summoning The Arrival @Ignister or doing the OTK combo, as we want.</li>  	<li>Lightning storm : at the beginning of the game, everytime very usefull.</li>  	<li>Forbidden Droplet : to protect The Arrival @Ignister or to allow them to do our combo.</li>  	<li>Evenly Matched : at the beginning of the game, everytime very usefull.</li>  	<li>Red reboot : to prevent the opponent to play traps card during our turn. It is very usefull at the beginning of the game if we want to do the combo in order to summon The Arrival @Ignister. Because in fact, he is unaffected by card effects :).... So we don't care about another trap card.</li> </ul> <strong>The combos : </strong>  To summon The Arrival @Ignister with 6000 attack : <ul>  	<li>We need to have Pikari and Achichi in our hand and other Ignister. If we only have 2 Ignister in our hand, The Arrival will have 4000 attack instead of the maximum of 6000 attack.</li>  	<li>Summon Dark Infand using Pikari or Achichi</li>  	<li>Use the field card to spam Ignisters. The goal is have 3 Ignisters with different name on our board in order to summon Dark Templar @Ignister in the <span><strong>right (not left) </strong></span>extra zone AND to still have in our hand one of this : <ul>  	<li>2 Ignister including Doshin @Ignister or Hiyari @Ignister in our hand</li>  	<li>Doshin @Ignister or Hiyari @Ignister + A.I.dle Reborn</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>After that, we can summon 1 Ignister from our hand or GY (by using A.I.dle Reborn) in a zone which is not one of the zones Dark Templare @Ignister points to.</li>  	<li>After that we need to summon Dark Infant @Ignister in the left zone pointed by Dark Templare.</li>  	<li>Then we can use the effect of Dark Templare @Ignister and then chain with the effect of Dark Infant in order to move him to the left zone and change his attribute. The attribute needs to be Earth if the other Ignister in your hand is Hiyari @Ignister or it needs to be Water if the monster in your hand is Doshin @Ignister.</li>  	<li>After that, summon 3 different monsters from your GY using the Dark Templare effect. These monsters need to have different attributes AND need to not be dark (because Dark Templare is already a dark monster)</li>  	<li>Then summon the last monster from your hand. Now you will have 6 different monsters on your board with different attributes. You can then special summon The Arrival @Ignister with 6000 attack !!! But before that don't forget one last step : summon Wind Pegasus @Ignister from your extra deck using Pikari @Ignister and Bururu @Ignister, then summon from your GY the Pikari that was used for this synchro summon. By doing it, you can clean all spells / traps on the opponent board and you will have The Arrival with 6000 attack and Pegasus @Ignister in your GY, which can be usefull because of his effect.</li> </ul> The OTK combo : <ol>  	<li>It is the same combo. Instead that you only need to summon Dark Templare and having 1 monster in your hand.</li>  	<li>After that, summon Dark Infant by using the monster from your hand, use the same logic of the first combo to have on your board 5 monsters including Dark Templare.</li>  	<li>Summon Update Jammer by using 2 monsters that you want BUT not Dark Templare</li>  	<li>Summon Transcode Talker by using 2 monster including Update Jammer BUT not Dark Templare</li>  	<li>Use the effect of Transcode Talker to summon from your GY Update Jammer</li>  	<li>Summon Accesscode Talker by using Dark Templare and Update Jammer</li> </ol> <strong>The little tip </strong>  If your opponent negate the effect of Dark Templare, we can still use him with Dark Infant @Ignister to summon the Link 4 Mekk-Knight Crusadia !

This due to the fact that I feel people are prepared for trap-heavy builds in the TCG with decks like guru being a threat. my cybers rations are pretty standard in my opinion but I do like Backup Secretary at 2-3 for my cyber's decks. I went with two Accesscode because this is a control deck and you might have to pull out a second one after your first one gets destroyed. (because really pulling two out is a stupid flex you should not do)  basic combo for beginners.  normal Lady Debug add Backup Secretary sp Backup Secretary go link 2 Splash Mage, splash mage sp debug link 3 Transcode Talker transcode sp splashmage link 4 Accesscode Talker add 3000 atk.

(Your field should have Cherubini, Archfiend, Torn Scale, and Shade Brigandine. In the hand, there should be Infernity Necromancer)</li>  	<li>Activate the effect of Proxy F Magician to fusion summon Starving Venom Fusion Dragon using rest of the monsters on your field, to a zone which Proxy F Magician points to.</li>  	<li>Activate the second effect of Proxy F Magician (Special summon a monster with less than 1000 ATK from your hand when a fusion monster was special summoned to a zone this card points to) to special summon Infernity Necromancer from hand.</li>  	<li>Activate Infernity Necromancer's effect to special summon Infernity Archfiend from graveyard, and activate its effect to add Infernity Patriarch to hand.</li>  	<li>Link summon Cross-Sheep using Infernity Necromancer and Proxy F Magician and special summon Infernity Patriarch to a zone Cross-Sheep points to, using its own effect. (Cross-Sheep should be pointing at Starving Venom and Infernity Patriarch)</li>  	<li>Then, use Cross-Sheep's effect to special summon Necromancer back from the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Overlay Patriarch and Archfiend into Dugares, and use its effect to special summon its own material, Archfiend.</li>  	<li>Use Archfiend's effect to add Infernity Launcher to hand, and just put it on field.</li>  	<li>Link summon Saryuja using all monsters on your field, except the Necromancer. (Still hasn't used the effects yet)</li>  	<li>If you want to take the chance and try using the 3rd effect of Saryuja, (Draw 4, put back 3) you can try, but I am not going over that since that is based on luck.</li>  	<li>Activate Necromancer's effect to special summon Archfiend, then its effect to add Infernity Mirage to hand.</li>  	<li>Activate second effect of Saryuja (Special summon from hand) and summon Mirage to the field.</li>  	<li>Link summon Apollousa using Saryuja, Archfiend, and Necromancer. (To empty the field a little and send archfiend and necromancer to the graveyard)</li>  	<li>Use Mirage's effect of special summon Archfiend and Necromancer from the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Use Archfiend's effect to add Infernity Avenger to hand, and discard it using Infernity Launcher's first effect.</li>  	<li>Activate Necromancer's effect to special summon launcher.</li>  	<li>Link summon Halqifibrax using Avenger and Archfiend, and activate its effect to summon Infernity Wildcat from the deck.</li>  	<li>Overlay Necromancer and Wildcat into Rebarian Shark. (Material of Z-ARC)</li>  	<li>Link summon Verte Anaconda using Halqifibrax and Rebarian Shark.</li>  	<li>Activate Launcher's effect to special summon Necromancer and Avenger.</li>  	<li>Special summon Archfiend from the graveyard using Necromancer's effect, and search Infernity Paranoia.</li>  	<li>Activate Paranoia on Necromancer to summon Infernity Conjurer from the deck.</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Hundred Eyes Dragon using Archfiend, Conjurer, and Avenger and activate its effect to banish Mirage from the graveyard and gain its effect.</li>  	<li>Use Hundred Eyes Dragon's effect (Infernity Mirage's effect) to tribute itself and special summon Necromancer and Avenger.</li>  	<li>Special summon Archfiend using Necromancer's effect and use its effect to search Infernity Barrier or Suppression.</li>  	<li>Use Conjurer's own effect to special summon itself from the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Shooting Riser Dragon using Avenger, Conjurer, and Necromancer.</li>  	<li>Activate Riser's effect upon summon to send Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm to the graveyard, and Riser becomes level 3. (Which doesn't matter if you're not planning a Calamity)</li>  	<li>Activate Verte Anaconda's second effect to pay 2000 LP and send Miracle Synchro Fusion to the graveyard, and banish Number 71: Rebarian Shark (XYZ Dragon monster), Hundred Eyes Dragon (Synchro Dragon Monster), Starving Venom Fusion Dragon (Fusion Dragon Monster), and Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm (Pendulum Dragon Monster) to the graveyard to summon Supreme King Z-ARC from your extra deck, obliterating your opponent's field while getting at least 4 negates.

Sometimes you'll have to link summon a monster to use it as link material so it can be used for Invocation in grave. If you are not able to do a good Fusion-Summon in first turn, equip one Magistus-Monster through its own effects and/or Spells (fo.e.

Had a hard time letting go of Archfiend Eccentrick from the main deck as it was in the first pendulum deck I used after watching one of Trif's videos, but having it in your starting hand is Death. I also underestimated the field spell's ability as a combo extender if I draw into since it just collects counters and has a built in protection effect. It makes recovery possible if the rest of my board gets cleared while my hand is empty.</em>  <strong>I explain my logic behind all of the cards below, but here's a description of the combos before getting into all of that if you aren't familiar:</strong>  Most of the combos revolve around using <a data-name=""Servant of Endymion"">Servant of Endymion</a>, <a data-name=""Reflection of Endymion"">Reflection of Endymion</a>, and <a data-name=""Chronograph Sorcerer"">Chronograph Sorcerer</a> to special summon monsters from the scales while saving your pendulum summon for the end, along with <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a>/<a data-name=""Jester Confit"">Jester Confit</a> as special summons, so that you can link into Crowley for the Spellbook engine **<em>if you still have targets**.  </em>Usually you will use Servant to special summon Jackal King so you can start build Spell Counters, and also to protect yourself against a potential Nibiru/Gamma, but there might be instances where you can think of a better monster to summon, like, for example, Magical Abductor to search for Magicians' Souls for your Restage engine. Remember that there are only 5 spellbook cards in the deck, as well as 4 potential targets for Crowley. If you used Pot of Desires, check the banished stack to make sure that there are not 2 or more targets in there or else Crowley will be useless.  If you don't go into Crowley, then try to go into Selene if you have the desired monster in your graveyard, or Saryuja if you have 4 disposable monsters on the field (generally don't use Jackal King/Mighty Master to go into Saryuja unless you can still use your pendulum summon to bring them back out, but do that ASAP).  Use <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One and Magicians' Souls with Selene in mind. If you don't have the desired negates in your hand, or, for One for One, if you have to choose between a negate boss monster and a scale that plusses, send that negate to the GY, because you can use Selene to bring them back. Also remember that if you send Reflection to the GY, you can summon her on the opponents turn to bounce back one of their cards.</a>  <a data-name=""One for One"">Try to avoid normal summoning unless its </a><a data-name=""Spellbook Magician of Prophecy"">Spellbook Magician of Prophecy (Blue Boy), because that allows you to choose him as a viable/non-dead target for Crowley, because you thin 3 cards from your deck and get a guaranteed Draw 2 if Crowley resolves.</a>  If you have to, normal summon Magical Abductor to build counters to search for Souls. This way you can pitch a negate to the GY, but then if/when you summon Crowley: <em>don't use Blue Boy as a target</em>. Use Spellbook of Secrets, Knowledge, and Power. Worst case scenario: you can still get another spell counter and 1000 attack on a monster (this is explained below).  I say ""ash bait"" a lot, but remember that, since you have a few avenues to try and get to your end board, the role of ash bait tends to shift around depending on which engine is the most easily accessible with your starting hand  <strong>Main Deck:</strong>  The core monsters for all of the Endymion decks I've posted on here have mostly been the same, although I reduced <a data-name=""Cerberus"">Cerberus</a> to 1 again since I only mostly use it to bait ash, and if I don't start with it, I usually draw into Jackal King easily enough anyways, in which case I sometimes use it to search Garuda. Another questionable choice I might have made was Magister, which I'm running at 1, because even though its not high priority I use it for recovery if I get board-wiped with Zeus and all my pendulum monsters are in the extra deck, its also nice to summon reflection on the opponents turn to bounce back their summons if I'm unable to draw into my negate-heavy monsters.  <em>Restage Engine:</em>  Pretty self-explanatory stuff here. I'm running 3 Restage and 1 Right Hand in the main deck. I'm keeping Left Hand in the side deck against trap-heavy opponents.  With the Restage engine, I'm actually running 2 souls and 1 confit instead of 3 of either. Obviously I feel like Souls should be mandatory for the Restage engine, but I'm giving priority normal summon to Magical Abductor to build counters to search for Souls, and I'm also running One for One to summon Souls and potentially set a target for Selene in the GY from my hand. One for One is also just another spell to build counters that's rarely ever dead and adds to my field while also giving me counters, which I really like. The single Jester confit is there instead of a third Souls as a free special summon if I ever start with souls in hand, or if I'm deliberately avoiding a normal summon so that I can use Blue Boy as one of my targets for Crowley. This is one of the reasons I'm running the Chronograph engine (free spell counter, free special summon, and if I have a second Chronograph in hand, then its *another* free special summon if not just a free target for One for One).  **edit: I actually reduced the Chronograph engine from 3 to 2 to add in Reasoning, with the reasoning (lol) that its still usually special summon for the most part as well as a spell counter either way, therefore still usually accomplish the purpose of Chronograph Sorcerer for me, but also because, if I draw into Reasoning, vs the 3rd copy of Chronograph, and I had already used Chronograph's effect, or banished Timegazer with Desires, then Reasoning is still live in my hand (I'm really trying to eliminate dead cards as much as I can without affecting the versatility of my monsters)**  <em>Spellbook Engine:</em>  My spellbook engine used to be 2 Blue Boy, 2 Secrets, 1 Knowledge, but *because* I'm giving priority normal summon to Abductor, I wanted to reduce Blue Boy. I didn't want to eliminate him entirely, because he's nice ash bait, but also is one of the preferred targets for Crowley alongside Secrets and Knowledge. Secrets is still at 2 because with 3 targets in the deck its rarely dead, but at 3 I feel like it wouldn't help that much. Spellbook of *Power* may seem like an odd inclusion in the deck (and honestly it might be, if you guys know a better Spellbook spell that has a better chance of being live in my hand lmk), however, my reasoning for this is that, if Blue Boy gets ash'd, I want to give myself the option to still go into Crowley, without drawing chance giving me a dead card (another blue boy would run the risk of me grabbing a dead blue boy in my hand with Crowley's effect if I already normal summoned blue boy), and most of the other Spellbook cards seem to be pretty reliant on having Spellbook spell cards already in my hand. With Power, however, if I can still search for a Spellbook spell if I just destroy another monster in battle, and it will also still give me counters (it's pretty low priority though with respect to Crowley's effect and in this would be a worst-case scenario for me). Of course there's Upstart, Instant Fusion for spell counters and also handtrap protection with Millennium Eyes and 2 Pot of Desires instead of 3, because I'm normally getting enough draws and thinning out my deck with both the Restage and Spellbook Engines, and I can even go into Saryuja with little difficulty without pendulum summoning.  <strong>Extra Deck:</strong>  In terms of the Extra Deck, its usually the same every time I post it, but I made a few changes and I'll just explain all my decisions here: there's Underworld Goddess for that ""extra deck kaiju"" business, which I can summon on the opponents turn using their monster if I have Masquerena on field (kinda like unchained except it doesn't target which is really nice and probably my favorite play with Masquerena). It also has a nice protection effect and can negate a summon from the GY. I have Accesscode for the OTK and high ATK. Selene to climb into Accesscode but also for counters to extend my plays-- its also nice to summon Reflection from the GY to bounce and opponents monster (really any card but usually monster), and its also a really nice stall card if nothing else, especially if I summon it with Masquerena. I only really use Apollousa if my hand is just really shit, I've used the spellbook engine and I don't have enough material to draw 4 off of Saryuja, and then I also have Knightmare unicorn for non-destruction removal on the opponents turn. Knightmare Phoenix if the opponent does something like Anti-Spell/Imperial Order/TCBOO etc., the Odd-Eyes package, Cross-Sheep with the Odd-Eyes Package so I can climb into Selene, Artemis if I start with a normal summonable pendulum monster and Knowledge and so I can still draw 2 if I don't start with souls/blue boy/confit as well. There's also a nice combo with Artemis and restage, where I can special summon either souls or confit, link into Artemis, re-summon souls/confit with restage and link into Crowley to still have all my preferred Spellbook targets usable.  <strong>Side Deck:</strong>  For the side deck, theres Pankratops, which is another one of my answers to Anti-Spell/Imperial Order, and of course red reboot. My blind second card that I usually side in is Evenly Matched, and I'll normally side out Cerberus, Spellbook of Power and either Right Hand or Left Hand depending on the match up.  **Didn't think I'd have to do this but: The reason I'm running Evenly vs Lightning Storm or Harpie's or Raigeki/Dark Hole is because: It doesn't target, it doesn't destroy, and it isn't once per turn. So if it resolves, worst case scenario you have to play through 2 disruptions (one on field and one in hand), best case scenario you can basically OTK. If it doesn't resolve, its because the opponent negated it, which means they would have negated any of the other above mentioned spells, which means: best case scenario they used their one spell/trap negate and you can still do full combo with Mighty Master to blow up their board, or worst case scenario they still had 50 billion spell/trap negates and you couldn't do jack anyways**  **Edit: I used to have 3 Nibiru because of Dragon Link, and that ridiculous Deskbot/Halq/Auroradon combo, but I realized that, not only can nibiru be negated, but that if I don't start with Nibiru in hand, its better to draw into Sphere Mode to break the opponents board rather than Nibiru**  Against monster heavy decks, I'm using Dark Ruler No More instead of Droplet, because I don't want to reduce my hand at all for follow up plays. The 2 Cosmic Cyclones are for match-ups against Eldlich."

Are you tired to see your opponents plays the game? Your prayers were heard!!  Today I come with one of the most disgusting  list: Zoodiac Kaiju, The infamous  KAZOO!! This is a totally control build that prevents you opponent to build his own board.  Zoodiac is a formidable engine because it is  a lair of one card combos, vary recursive and a small (but strong) engine. Zoodiac  Trident can pop up any card on the field, also becoming a good card to going first (disrupt any plays in the opponents turn), or a going second card  to get in the Vespenato. This engine is so amazing that if you want to go in more agressive way, you can also use Megaclops to deal a massive damage.  Kaiju are notorius to disrupted big boards ( Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess, Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and similars) and with a help of  Interrupted Kaiju Slumber , our job  become incredibly easy.  Ah... and here we have a lot , A LOT  of hand traps  to deals with draws ( Droll &amp; Lock Bird), effect of the field (Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit), or GY in general ( Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion and Skull Meister). The main engine is effective and small , so handtraps can fit perfectely in this control build.  &nbsp;  For the final words, I know that Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder will be perfect and logical to add in this deck  but... I don't have it =/ however , if you have, feel free to use it and be happy with it. I hope you like it my crazy idea."

Sunrise can fetch a Miracle Fusion from your deck to your hand,gives all your monster 200 Atk for each attribute you control and, once per turn, you can destroy a card on the field when another Hero monster you control declare an attack. From Sunrise you can then fuse the Omni Hero you need in that situation.  Blazeman can get you a Poli when summoned,Dark Mist a Mask Change (only when special summoned), Solid Soldier can special summon another hero when it's normal summoned (and special summons a Hero from the graveyard when sent there from the field by a spell card) and Liquid can let you draw 2 cards then discard 1 when used for a fusion (also special summons a Hero from the grave when norma summoned).  The Hand Trapa can be varied.  concerning the Extra Deck:  -I recommend at least 1 copy of each Omni Hero so that you can use Super Poli on whatever your opponent may summon  -Dark Law can be a pain in the ass by distrupting grave setup and destroyng a card in the hand when the opponent add a card from the deck and Acid destroys the backrow when brought out (so I like to use it with Zero since he destroys all opponents monster when sent from the field to the grave)  -Predaplant Anaconda is there for when you don't draw any fusion card.  Well,I think that's all; remember it's a deck I made for fun because it's my favourite archetype but if you have suggestions on how to make it competitive please let me know. Have Fun!"

I also included a small Darkwurm package to get an extra body on board, as every body matters.  The extra deck is mainly just various generic Links and a few XYZ to use with the Dangers! in specific situations.

Fire kings work very well with this because both are decks centered around destroying cards, and Tri-brigade is useful for making big link pushes and also getting out the simorgh link to get stormwinds during the end phase. Impcantations help with searching for the parts of the nephthys engine and then can be tributed as to get around their extra deck lock. I chose ghost ogre as a good handtrap because not only can you trigger some fire king effects off of it, but you can also use e-tele to get more link material on board, and gamma is an all around good handtrap. Wicked eraser is in the side deck because it could be cool, but I couldn't make the space for it.  Hope you all enjoy, and feedback is welcome as always."

Maybe you can special summon ""Swap Frog"" and ""Prior of the Ice Barrier"" instead to go for ""Toadally Awesome"" but it would be better if you can do a Synchro summon in the same turn.  If you go 2nd you hopefully can go for trishula (wich one you can reach) to break the opponents field.

The Fire Kings suck. Arvata is the only decent one because every other fire king either has a ridiculously handcuffed effect that wont make an immediate impact. This is mostly due to the fact that you have to wait until the next standby phase. Now onslaught is also bad because it has far too many restrictions and is actually a genuinely well balanced card. Circle of the Fire Kings could be good as it can cycle stuff with Kitt, but that's really unnecessary and overall almost never going to be impactful enough to warrant the slot.  &nbsp;  Now. The synergy is actually pretty good. Arvata destroying Kitt and giving the ability to negate handtraps is very cool and good. Rendezvous and Garunix are awesome for being able to establish tempo and make pushes for lethal. Wolfbark is very cool and good and never a bad card to see in your hand.  You can ABSOLUTELY play the Simorgh + Stormwinds combo because setting up: Simorgh + Statue + Arvata + Rendezvous in grave, is very easy and very strong.

It's an aggressive combo deck designed to swarm the field with graveyard special summons in order to combo off into the boss monsters and create interruptions. If you're going second, the side deck is covered with ways to out the more common boss monsters that have destruction protection, and also a way to turbo into Kali Yuga, one of the best ""going second"" boss monsters you can land on imo.  Like any other D/D/D deck, consistency issues can appear once in a while, but in play testing against even the grindiest control decks, I've found ways to survive and end on strong boards."

(Note: All of my decks are labeled ""Meh"" in to help with the understanding that these are not by any means competitive decks. Secondly, all of these decks upon initial completion are untested and purely made by using other decks as reference along with a basic understanding of the archetypes core ideal. Thirdly, All of these decks upon completion are made to be around or below 60$ including shipping, and yes i do use these decks hence why sometimes they are updated to make them better as they get playtested. Fourthly, these decks are generally not a mix of archetypes as its what i prefer.

Lots of Fire monsters and fun combos. Easy to learn for new players and does,"Good for both going 1st and 2nd  The goal is to set up an OTK with Rekindling summoning 5 monsters from the GY including Totem Five which will wipe the opponent board and inflict tons of damage. Then you can direct attack the opponent for the kill.  Other fun combos : <ul>  	<li>Norm Red Resonator, use its effect to spe Firebrand Hymnist, fill up your GY and summon Horse Prince + another monster from the deck (that's the ideal T1 scenario)</li>  	<li>You have many cards to send to GY cards from your deck (Flamvell Lady, Kirin, Foolish...) your main target is Totem to set up the combo, but if you already have it go for a tuner (Red Resonator or Ashe) instead to have the target for Rekindled Rebirth</li>  	<li>After using Extravagance you can use Rebirth to summon Sunsaga (Red Resonator + Hazy Flame Cerberus) and destroy cards your opponent controls with its effect (theoretically up to 9 cards but I never managed to get more than 4)</li>  	<li>Circle of the Fire Kings can trigger the Fire King effects (no s*** Sherlock)</li>  	<li>If you can't OTK with Rekindling combo, you can still try to summon Crimson Blader to block your opponent's next turn using Rekindling monsters as material</li> </ul> Changes that can be made : <ul>  	<li>3x Hand Destruction can be too much if your opponent doesn't have 2 or more cards in their hand often</li>  	<li>Royal Decree can be included against certain decks</li>  	<li>Any other suggestion you may have, I built this deck for fun in less than an hour and I wasn't familiar with the archetypes so it probably has a lot of room for improvement ! :)</li> </ul> Strenghts : Versatility (OTK, Burn and some defensive options), Stability (there is no real main combo so you're always able to set up an OTK in like 3 turns) and a lot of draw power  Weaknesses : Too many to list! This is a fun deck after all  Hope you enjoy playing with this deck! :)"

Nephyts mainly destroys their own cards for it's combos, and at the end of the combo lines it summons either large rituals or can link into the archetypal link monsters. To make this a bit more interesting, I included Simorgh and the wind barrier statue, so you can do the barrier statue lock on your turn if you manage to get out enough materials , which hopefully you should. I also included 9 handtraps, so this is incredibly control focused and really obnoxious. You're lucky I didn't include Dragoon.  We need a Bird Up tag."

It  went from 53 to a much more manageable  40  cards. i had  to cut  cards  like Torrential tribute and Trap Trick, but i feel that it was necessary. you can however replace the hand traps and  traps for  whichever you'd like. I just like using  Skull Meister and Nibiru because they not only stall my opponent, but are also targets of Construct and Winda. The Dogmatika cards add consistency and give you extra pops, but you have to be careful because after you use them you can't special summon from the extra deck."

First turn follow the combo lines to get out a Fog Blade, Requiem dragon, IP, Verte with Dragoon, and any other advantage you can to have mass negates.

Plus they are some of my favourite monsters in the game. Servant is still in simply because they are.  •Magistus Dropped entirely from the Main Deck. Only serving as a Link-1 for aiding in the Special Summoning of Dogmatika monsters and a way to recover key Spellcasters from the GY for when they almost inevitably end up there (Same as with ""Dwimmered Path"").  •Largely, this deck's most severe weakness is to GY disruption and, as with most decks, is only weak to search disruption on turn 1."

Transmodify is a spice tech to trigger  tehe effects of any ABC parts and summons the  Union driver  Forbindden Chalice and  Forbidden Lance  are a poor man protection and hand traps, that can be replaced with any  card you desire.  Bunjinki Ahsima  is gem of a card, you can use to  go deep in a XYZ line of plays , taking advantage of the fact that all abc parts are level 4, summon Time thief or  Tonado dragon.  &nbsp;  This deck, nowadays , is suboptimal that was in the past, however it still is a extreme fun deck to play, being a otk and control in just one deck.

I still don't know how to link very well yet because I could have 3 monsters with effects and I still can't get some of the links on the field and then with Underworld Goddess of the Closed World I have 3 monster and one opponent monster with the effect but I could only get her out when I have 4 monsters with effect and the one opponent monster( wired) it didn't well again Marco until I change it to this version and the new magician deck run through it if I don't get the right card. but it does alright to just about everything if I play it right. *shrug* IDK see you in the Nexus."

Favorite combo play:  &nbsp;  Overlay for number 23 using grapha and a danger monster  Activate a danger monster from the hand  Number 23 negates it by dethatching grapha and the danger monster returns to the hand  Summon another level 8 danger monster and summon grapha again  Overlay for Felgrand  Detatch grapha to target itself  Special summon another danger level 8 and grapha one last time  Then overlay for whatever negation xyz is best for your current opponent until you can't anymore or the field is full  &nbsp;  If you get multiple grapha and enough danger level 8 monsters, you can do up to 5 overlays in a turn before the field is too full. My favorite lockdown is with these cards:  Number 23  Felgrand  Number 38  Number 90  Evilswarm Nightmare  &nbsp;  This board means your opponents first effect of the turn is negated, you can negate 1 spell, you can negate 2 monster effects in two ways, and you can flip two special summoned monsters face down. Also number 38 can redirect attacks to itself, protecting the weaker parts of the lock. This should be difficult for a lot of decks to overcome. You can also sub other monsters for Number 90 and number 38 depending on your opponent, like number 68 or dingirsu. Finally, when you have this lock, you have over 8k attack on board and ready for next turn. If somehow they stop your otk next turn, use your empty XYZ monsters and whatever else you like to summon Aollousa for 4 monster negations on their next turn. If you know they run battle fader or a similar hand trap, summon apollousa and build up the field to otk first. You can negate battle fader, but it returns to the hand. However, you can negate it 4 times with apollousa, ensuring your OTK will land.  &nbsp;  If going second, summon removal if needed, or just do the lock down play to OTK. Favorite play going second is:  Dingirsu to remove a backrow  Pain gainer to clear front row (Summon a second rank 8 first if needed to boost the def for the effect)  Seven Sins to beat down and remove next turn if needed  Then keep summoning until I can OTK"

It's a really fun deck with a lot of options.,"<b>I made 2 previous versions but realised the deck lacked something. I switched around some cards and put some backrow removal and kaijus in it.</b>  This deck has 2 goals. Summoning high level xyz with the trains, the Flying Pegasus and the Anchor Drill. And getting your Chaos Ancient Gear Giant out. Ancient Gears on their own are not that good in my opinion so a little support from an archetype that can frequently summon is nice.  &nbsp;  <strong>Monsters</strong>  <strong>Ancient Gear Golem: </strong>You don't really want to draw this card. You can't special summon it and tribute summoning this thing gets countered very easily which ends up with you losing 2 or three cards (if geartown is on the field only 2). It's why I put them at 1. I don't think you will even use more than 1 Golems in a duel. The longer the duel lasts the harder it becomes to win.  <strong>Ancient Gear Gadjiltron Dragon: </strong>I can hear you thinking to yourself; ""Why Gadjiltron Dragon? Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon is much better!!"" True the card is better, but for what we are trying to do here Gadjiltron Dragon suits this deck better with it 8 star scaling. With this card you can get very easily into Seven Sins and banish your oponnent's monsters often locking them out of their effects in the process. This card is searchable with Urgent Schedule, Ancient Gear Wyvern and can be returned from the graveyard using Bullet Express Train. So only 2 as well.  <strong>Ancient Gear Wyvern: </strong>This card is basically the Elemental Hero Stratos of this deck. It searches out any Ancient Gear cards in your deck. You can extend the combo searching for Ancient Gear Box first and then using the effect of Box you can add an Ancient Gear Frame or Infinitrack Anchordrill to your hand. You go plus 2 for no cost so run three at all times.  <strong>Ancient Gear Box:</strong> This the garnet in the deck so you really don't want to draw it. I run the card at one because it is recyclable so you can just use it from the graveyard again. Running at 2 could be possible too but I would not recommend it at three. The risk of drawing it increases substantially.  <strong>Ancient Gear Hunting Hound: </strong>A walking polymerization. When summoned it does 600 damage to your opponent but We use it for its ability to fusion summon any Ancient Gear monster. Often we fuse into Ancient Gear Howitzer to get an Ancient Gear Golem on the field. Use 2 or 3  <strong>Ancient Gear Howitzer:</strong> In my opinion a very underrated card. Unaffected by card effects and it can inflict 1000 damage to your opponent... Every turn. Your opponent probably wants this card destroyed. But if for some reason he doesn’t and you don’t really care for the burn effect you can always destroy it yourself to get Ancient Gear Golem out to fusion summon a Chaos Ancient Gear Giant. If you have Ancient Gear Golem out in the field and you use Ancient Gear Fusion you can use material from the deck to complete the summon instead. So Howitzer is a powerful card that opens the path to an even better card. We run 1 or 2.  <strong>Super Express Bullet Train</strong>: A rank 10 train card that is very easy to bring out. All you need, is to have only earth machine monsters on the field. Usually the plan is to bring out this card together with Heavy Freight Train Derricane and possible Flying Pegasus and Anchordrill to xyz summon your bossmonsters. Downside is that it can’t attack without sending 2 cards you control to the graveyard. This however poses no problem for us because we only use it as xyz fodder. A nice extra is that it lets you take back a card from the graveyard to your hand if Bullet train is in the graveyard that turn. I run 2. I wouldn’t use three to prevent bricking.  <strong>Infinitrack Anchordrill:</strong> Has enormous synergy with the Ancient Gear archetype. It is usable for Ancient Gear Box because it has 500ATK and it can summon another card from the hand. Besides that it can combine the stars for both cards making lets say Gadjiltron Dragon and Anchordrill fodder for the rank 12 xyz Seven Sins.  <strong>Heavy Freight Train Derricane: </strong>Just like Bullet Express Train it is so easy to bring out. Use this card for xyz fodder too. Ideally we run 2.  <strong>Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede: </strong>Lets you summon a card from your graveyard in defense position but without its effect. Nice effect but we will use its secondary one more often. It lets us copy the level of another face up card to either Flying pegasus or the other way around. Best used with the trains or level 8 monsters. I use 3.  <b>Gameciel, The Sea Turtle Kaiju: </b>When testing this deck online, I often see cards like Red Eyes Dark Dragoon or other cards with negates and protection. For now it is in the main deck. But if it is not to your liking you can always change it for an extra Hunting Hound, AG Fusion or Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord.  <strong>Machina Citadel: </strong>we use it as xyz fodder and sometimes you can use its effect to destroy your opponent's monsters. One is enough.  &nbsp;  <strong>Spells/Traps</strong>  <strong>Ancient Gear Catapult: </strong>We use Catapult to pop Geartown and summon Ancient Gear golem and Wyvern to get into Chaos Giant. Only way to really summon Golem aside from tributing and using Howitzer. Run three at all times, it is the foundation of the Ancient Gears.  <strong>Geartown:</strong> Used in tandem with Catapult this can give you a Chaos Giant and more. Like Catapult, run three at all times.  <strong>Ancient Gear Fusion: </strong>If used with Ancient Gear Golem you can search the deck for materials too. Chaos Giant can be out in one turn this way. I would runtwo or three.  <strong>Urgent Schedule:</strong> This card lets you summon 2 monsters from the deck. One lvl four or lower and one level five or higher. This used to be quite an expensive card but is more affordable nowadays. Getting 2 free summons when your opponent controls more cards is very helpful for your xyz and fusion plays. I recommend running 3.  <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster: </strong>Good for backrow removal but limited, so one.  <strong>Twin Twisters:</strong> Good for backrow removal and to pop Geartown. also one.  <strong>Solemn Strike:</strong> Just nice to negate an effect or special summon. Run one.  <strong>Solemn Judgement: </strong>To negate cards that would otherwise break your board. Run one.  <strong>Unending Nightmare:</strong> Nice for backrow removal and to pop your own cards like Geartown. we use 2.  &nbsp;  <strong>The extra deck</strong>  <strong>Double Headed Anger Knuckle:</strong> This card is good for getting those level 10 cards on the field. We use only one.  <strong>Ancient Gear Ballista:</strong> This card is a godsend for Ancient Gear players. It synergizes immensely with the trains and earth machine monsters in general. It only requires 2 earth machine monsters to summon it. Ballista can add one Geartown to your hand or any Ancient Gear Monster in the main deck. Usually what you want to do with this card is to add a Geartown to your hand, you play it and then activate Ballista’s secondary effect to reduce an opponent’s monster ATK/DEF to zero and send the Geartown to the graveyard as cost which in turn activates Geartown’s effect.  <strong>Chaos Ancient Gear Giant:</strong> The one card I’ve been talking about so much. With his 4500 atk and powerful effect it’s a force to be reckoned with. Unaffected by spell and trap cards and the option to attack every monster your opponent controls once. If that wasn’t good enough already it does piercing damage too. Run 1 or 2, it depends really.  <strong>Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem: </strong>Sporting an attack of 4400 this card this card is quite the powerhouse too. Its effect isn’t as good as Chaos Giant but it can get an Ancient Gear Golem on the field when destroyed, giving you the chance to get another Chaos Giant. We run 1 or 2.  <strong>Megaton Ancient Gear Golem:</strong> Essentially a weaker version of Chaos Ancient Gear Giant. When fusion summoned with more than one Ancient Gear Golem it can attack multiple times in your battle phase. When destroyed by card effect you can get your Ultimate Golem out and that way you could get an Chaos Ancient Gear Giant too.  <strong>Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe: </strong>A rank 11 xyz easily summoned using Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora. Can attack up to the number of attached materials plus one. You can boost the attack of this card by 2000 by detaching one card which makes Liebe a powerful beatstick. 1 is more than enough.  <strong>Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora:</strong> Can detach one card to make another unaffected by card effects. When used on Chaos Giant it makes the card nearly invincible.  <strong>Number 77 Seven Sins:</strong> Out of all the rank 12 cards this one is the easiest to summon. There are 3 ways to summon it and they all have their merits.. We can summon it the normal way by using 2 rank 12 monsters, this has the advantage that we can use its effect immediately and banish your opponent monsters. The only downside here is that seven sins has only 1 card to protect itself when targeted for battle or by card effects unless you don’t activate the effect. The second way involves xyz summuning Rank 8 Dingirsu Orcust of The Evening Star to your field. You then overlay Pain Gainer on it and then into Seven Sins. Last way to summon it is to xyz summon Ravenous Tarantula into Sevens Sins or first into Pain Gainer and then Seven Sins. We run only one, the resources needed for this card are substantial enough that you probably won’t get another one on the field.  <strong>Number 84 Pain Gainer</strong>: Also 2 ways of summoning it but doing it the normal way  is not really possible in this deck. We mostly use Dingirsu or Ravenous Tarantula to summon it instead. Usually this card is just a stepping stone for Seven Sins or if you can summon Seven Sins the normal way and still have room for Pain Gainer it can be a good card on its own. We Also run one.  <strong>Number 35 Ravenous Tarantula:</strong> If used a bit further down the duel this card will turn all your monsters into beatsticks on steroids. It adds the difference in life points as attack and defense to face up cards you control. This in combination with a Chaos Giant will completely destroy any monster. We mostly use the rank 10 trains or a Flying Pegasus to Xyz into it. If you decide to not go further the xyz chain and keep it as it is you can punish special summoning with it too. Every time your opponent special summons a monster they lose 600 lifepoints. And if that wasn’t enough you can detach one monster to destroy all monsters your opponent controls that have attack less or equal to this card. You could run 2 but I run one.  <strong>Dingirsu The Orcust of The Evening Star:</strong> Really a good staple as well. I am actually inclined to use Dingirsu more then Harbinger in duels. You can use this card for Pain Gainer too. Aside from that it can protect cards from destruction by detaching materials. Run 2.  <strong>Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid: </strong>Can be used as material for Dora when you destroy a monster by battle. It has build in protection as well. I would run 1, it’s a good card but I don’t use it all that often.  <strong>There is no side deck in this profile. I leave this to your imagination. </strong>"

Synchro summon Junk Speeder with them (if you have Carrier on the field, summon Hyper Librarian instead and follow up by using Converter to revive your synchron and summon Speeder with it and Carrier, either way you want HL on the field) and summon Cyberse Synchron (preferably) and some others like Steam Synchron.

Siempre la idea es ir por Romulus y los Guardragon para acceder a sus efectos de spam y tener en campo a Spiral Dragon, junto a un tuner y un no tuner.  <strong>Extenders para iniciar el combo</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Absorouter Dragon: </strong>Se invoca solo si controlamos un Rokket, lo cual es sencillo. Aún así, siempre se puede enviar al cementerio para añadirnos un Rokket a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Noctovision Dragon: </strong>Se invoca solo si invocamos otro dragón de modo especial.

Y es tuner!</li>  	<li><strong>Black Metal Dragon: </strong>Excelente Normal Summon.

Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck depende del Spiral Dragon, por lo que si no podemos acceder a él o su efecto es negado, será gg.</li>  	<li>Por la naturaleza del deck, éste no tiene acceso a protección.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck depende del burn, por lo que es susceptible a cartas que aumenten los LP del oponente.</li> </ul>"

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. ""Rokket"" is a play on the word ""rocket"". Its Japanese name, ""Vullet"", is a corruption of ""bullet"", playing on the tendency of Japanese to replace ""V"" sounds with ""B"" ones. It may also reference the archetype's user in the anime, Varis, who shares a similar gun and ammunition theme in his original Japanese name and the design of his mask. The ""Borrel"" archetype uses the same play with the word ""barrel"".

Thunder Dragons have always been a favorite of mine (after dragon link of course!) and it is very unfortunate that Colossus is STILL on the banlist (WHY KONAMI WHY??). I also noticed that I have not uploaded a single thunder dragon deck on this site and a bunch of people have been requesting this build. For these reasons, I have decided to upload one!! This deck is a full 60 deck and I would give it a solid rogue tier in the current metagame. It won’t win an LCS or anything but it is a very fun deck to play and I guarantee you that you can even win duels sometimes. I have once again gone all out on a deck explanation (sigh, this is 60 cards) so I really hope you enjoy it!!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Just a quick reminder that the deck explanation, All the combos, test hands, deck explanations and ways to best use your resources are ALL on my Youtube video. Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me and the channel!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the video -<a> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQnrpwVoLAw</a></span>  &nbsp;  <b>Deck Ratios</b><span> - </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Note: some cards may be in more than 1 category </span>  &nbsp; <table>  <tr> <td><b>Thunder Dragon engine</b><span> - Thunder Dragon cards and cards in the deck that support them </span></td> <td><span>For this engine we have 3 Vanilla Thunder Dragon, 3 dragondark, 3 Dragonroar, 2 dragonmatrix, 1 dragonhawk, 1 fusion and 1 Gold Sarcophagus. We are not playing lupine or solar since this is not a pure build, it also involves a lot of other engines. Fusion is usually a 2 of but we are only running 1 because we only need 1 titan, same reason as for not playing solar and lupine. Dragondark is the best thunder dragon in my opinion since it searches and Dragonroar is good because it gives you access to dragondark and dragonmatrix. The vanilla is played for extra pops with titan and for graveyard and card advantage. Matrix is a solid card which also adds to the pops. Notice all the thunders can be recycled with fusion and The chaos creator. Fusion is usually not a card you want to draw, it is one that you mill using verte (the reason we only play 1 copy). Sarcophagus is great since it can banish any thunder directly from the deck to trigger it’s banish effect. Hawk is just a great searchable extender and can be used to bring back titan from the grave as well (if needed). That is basically all for the thunder engine, who’s main purpose is to generate card and graveyard advantage and turbo titan. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Chaos engine</b><span> - cards that can be search with chaos space basically</span></td> <td><span>Oh my god we have a lot of stuff for this! Here we go - 3 Valkaria, 2 lavineer, 1 black dragon, 1 white dragon, 2 emperor, 3 creator and 3 chaos space. Chaos space can search any of these so it is a really good card to open. It can also recycle and generate SOOO much card advantage. Valkaria and the baby chaos dragons are your best chaos monsters (to draw) because they only require 1 light or dark in the grave, they are level 4 and because they generate some sort of advantage (the baby chaos dragons search each other and Valkaria can mill when banished). Lavineer is also amazing since it can be used to hand rip OR pop 2 cards on the field OR even monster reborn a monster from the grave!! It also requires 3 banishes which can be useful if you have multiple thunders in the GY. Emperor can recycle any of your banished dragons by destroying itself (this puts it in your extra deck), and then it can be summoned from the extra deck by banishing a light and dark from the grave and can also clear the field if needed. It generates a lot of advantage especially since both effects will be used to the fullest. Creator is also making since it can special back from the banish zone (thunders!!) and recycle which is really really good and is the reason I am maxing out on this. The main reason this in in the deck is to swarm the field, go into rank 8 plays and link plays, and to banish the thunders in the graveyard to generate all sorts of advantage. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Lightsworn engine</b><span> - cards that search raiden and mill basically</span></td> <td><span>We have 3 charge and 2 raiden. Charge is the best opener since charge + level 4 extender = mill 9 + chaos ruler + search a light or dark (see combos in video for more info and how to achive that). Raiden is just a 2 of, great tuner as well. Main reason this in in the build is because raiden is your main normal summon (alongside tracer) and because you need to mill cards to generate advantage. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Rokket engine </b><span>- cards that support the rokket archetype </span></td> <td><span>The rokket engine is - 3 quick launch, 3 rokket tracer, 1 rokket recharger and 1 boot sector launch. The main reason this is even in the deck is to turbo out chaos ruler from the extra deck. Very self explanatory and can also be used to go into romulus and fetch a ravine if you have another dragon out. Rokkets are a solid and splashable engine. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Pendulum dragon engine</b><span> - You will NEVER actually pendulum summon but this is basically good dragons that can be searched using revolution dragon. </span></td> <td><span>For this engine we have 3 Revolution, 2 emperor and 1 darkwurm. Revolution can search both emperor and darkwurm since they are pendulum dragons and can also reborn something like hope harbinger from the grave (does not require materials to negate). Revolution is just such an amazing draw and it also serves as an additional body in the GY if you use it’s discard effect. Emperor is just SOOOOO good!! It recycles any of your banished dragons by destroying itself (this puts it in your extra deck), and then it can be summoned from the extra deck by banishing a light and dark from the grave and can also clear the field if needed (also level 8)! What a card!! Darkwurm is good because it is a free special summon and is just a solid pick in general. It is really good if opened with ravine and can also be milled with ravine. The main purpose of this engine is to generate advantage and swarm the field. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Danger! Engine - </b><span>literally danger cards</span></td> <td><span>We have - 3 mothman, 1 Nessie, 1 jack and 1 thunderbird. These ratios might sound weird to you but there is a specific reason these are the ones I chose. I chose ones that generate some kind of card/grave advantage if discarded (except thunderbird which is there just to summon off of jack). Moth is also a level 4 which synergies with the rokket and lightsworn engine (to turbo out ruler) and it can also be linked off or used to summon Douglass which generates more card/grave advantage. No snake because if discard it brings itself back, which is good but it does not put a danger in the grave (all the others that have good discard effects stay in the grave as chaos banish targets). Dangers main purpose in this is to spam monsters, go for rank 4 palys, dig deeper into the deck, draw cards and to help get stuff into the grave. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Dragon Ravine Engine</b><span> - cards that go with Dragon ravine</span></td> <td><span>We have - 3 Dragon Ravines, 1 terraforming, 1 foolish burial, 1 black wing elite, 1 galactic spiral and 1 seyfert. We are playing maximum ravines because we will not always have access to it and because the card is literally fire. Opening multiple copies is also AMAZING! Keep in mind that ravine is not a hard once per turn so the blackwing can bounce ravine to summon itself and then you can use ravine again! Sadly the blackwing is once per duel :( foolish burial can mill anything in the entire deck so why not run it? Seyfert and Spiral are mill targets for ravine to recycle and go into rank 8 plays respectively. We are not running seyfert as a normal summon to search the baby chaos dragons because we cannot afford to waste our normal summon on it. If opened, it should (in most cases) just be discarded. Ravine is definitely a 3 of, you cannot cut down on it. This idea of playing 3 ravines I stole from Jesse Kotton, so credits to him :)</span></td> </tr>  </table> &nbsp;  <b>Extra deck cards</b><span> - </span>  &nbsp;  <span>All of these cards are 1 of btw. </span>  &nbsp; <table>  <tr> <td><span>Thunder Dragon Titan</span></td> <td><span>Thunder dragon’s boss monster that can cause interruption during opponent’s turn, 1 is more than enough. (Rip Colossus)</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Chaos Ruler</span></td> <td><span>The best card in the entire extra deck, is a +1 and also mills 4 cards and can also come back from the grave for more advantage!!</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Borreload savage </span></td> <td><span>Omni negate, a card you can make sometimes if you draw an extra quick launch</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Striker Dragon</span></td> <td><span>Link 1 for rokket and baby chaos dragon combos. Can be recycled so just 1 copy.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Seals</span></td> <td><span>You can make this if you open the baby chaos dragons, amazing interruption during opponent’s turn. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Romulus</span></td> <td><span>Searches ravine - all you need to know.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Verte</span></td> <td><span>You summon Titan using this</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>I:P</span></td> <td><span>Great to make unicorn/Phoenix during an opponent's turn or for even making apollusa during an opponent's turn if dark locked or if you used verte. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Pheonix</span></td> <td><span>Backrow removal</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Unicorn</span></td> <td><span>High Impact Removal </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Apollusa</span></td> <td><span>Negates monster effects and can be made with I:P </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Accesscode</span></td> <td><span>Otk and removal card</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Douglass</span></td> <td><span>For those times when you have 2 level 4 monsters but no tuners. It can draw 2 and make you discard 1, great card and graveyard advantage. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Hope harbinger </span></td> <td><span>Spell Negate and can be monster reborned with revolution dragon (does not need materials to negate)</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Lancelot</span></td> <td><span>GREAT card!! It is literally sooo good! It can pop (only useful if going 2nd) and can also serve as an Omni negate during an opponent's turn. Best of all it is dark, meaning you can summon it even if you are tracer locked. </span></td> </tr>  </table> &nbsp;  <span>Jesus Christ it took forever to type all that up but alas I am done! I really hope you enjoy the deck explanation and I recommend you try this deck out. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Again, deck explanation, All the combos, test hands, deck explanations and ways to best use your resources are ALL on my Youtube video.

Just build going first focused deck at that point. oh wait HERO boards are super breakable? ok then put in three e for baits, and make it so that your wincon for going first dark law which percentage is not too bad i think. I tried to calculate it but i got the wrong calculations, anyway for going to second build a board with stratos. Cool little trick you can do is mailcous bane on board effect into mask change, epic board clear, unless you're playing aginst dragon link in which case you can attack in the first place. take trinity out because we are breaking boards with super poly. easy fix to all of this is to play droplets then you don't have to spend any slots  on superpoly targets and it is easy street, plus helps discard le brick."

This is by far the best ratio I found. (In-depth strategy.) MAKE SURE YOU GO SECOND. The goal of this deck is to draw a revealer and either speaker or Wayne. If you don't draw but draw Wayne or speaker then don't worry, there is still hope. Summon one ice barrier monster, then special summon Wayne, or speaker, or prior. Just slowly grow your board until you have enough for Trish Zero. In case of emergency use both defender and necromancer to lock you, enemy, out of attacking. Use any of the protectors to just protect yourself. If you want you can splash some hand traps or other cards. The only way to otk is to not let the opponent play, restrict them until your ready. It is even possible to synchro summon 3 times a turn. But is requires some set up."

I think BB has a lot of potential, so here's what I think could be a pretty good meta build. It includes a Dogmatika engine, using Punishment to up the control aspect and increase pressure on the opponent. I leaned heavier into a trap focus for this variant, as I went for a large line up of traps and floodgates. Of course, this is a going 1st control deck. I feel like this has a lot of potential for the new meta. Also, let's not forget the good old Buster Lock which destroys a ton of decks. This deck is naturally capable of pulling it off."

In order to counter your opponents side deck swap, toss in your whole side deck which is a Mystic Mine burn engin","SO, this is by far my favorite deck. Even with ZEXAL banned Numerons still work very well. It's just a matter of how you do it. The main deck is a Numeron Kaiju engine. If you can get Numeron Network, and your opponent has 1 or 2 monsters it is an OTK. Replace a monster with a kaiju (or both with lava). One other note, is if you can USE THE KAIJUS ON DRAGOON. It is by far the best counter, and you need to do it before you use Numeron Networks effect because you can only summon 1 monster after you use it's effect. All the hand traps are for interrupting, and then you have all of the searches. Interdimentional Matter Transport isn't a good card, normally, BUT in this deck if I clear my Infinitrack or Mekk knight, I can activate my Numeron Network.  Extra Deck: All the Numeron monsters work off of Calling/Network, Infinitrack and Mekk knight are to clear off your Numerons so you don't have to have an empty board. Linkuriboh is there to counter tokens and to drop off your extra Numeron XYZ monster.  Side deck: This is when the whole deck gets fun, toss your whole extra deck into the main deck and drop the following cards from your main deck: Numeron Wall (3), Numeron Network (3), Numeron Calling (3), Memories of Hope (2), Interrupting Kaiju Slumber (2), and Interdimensional Matter Transport (2). Now your deck is a Mystic Mine burn deck.  As cheesy as this deck is, it works very very well and can counter cards like Nibiru, which your opponite will add after the first round. I do believe that this deck can be used in a competitive format. Let me know what you think of this deck!  ~Lt. Banger"

I got the idea of splashing some of these monsters from my previous deck which functions similarly as they both are discard heavy. How I play this deck is very aggressive, and the main idea is to break boards (hence the Kaiju package). The Knightmares are staples, and they benefit from Brann's ATK boost. Most Plunder decks use Bahamut and Toad, but I use it mostly as a backup. Dragite is kinda the star in ways since it's very easy to summon, and you have access to an easy negate. My favorite card in here is Draco Berserker because it's an OTK enabler and disruptor. The easiest way to understand this deck is to try and summon as much as you can to go into the ships to banish or negate monsters and to gain tremendous ATK boosts for an OTK. This deck going 2nd works extremely well, and you have options to summon a few different monsters other than Plunders. However, some of the Plunder monsters may lock you into only summoning their archetype, but it's not that big of a problem. Just note to always equip the Plunders to their ships if you can. The deck is a bit fast and you might accidentally drop your hand while building a board. Another thing is to try learning every Plunders' full effects. They do a couple of different things. I hope this deck helps some of you guys out if you are looking into building this. Feel free to ask any questions too."

Uses the same strategies as in 2012, so have fun playing it. <h2>Overview</h2> For those new in the archetype, your job is to have your <em>Gladiator Beasts</em> fight <strong>and</strong> survive those figthts. During the end of the Battle Phase (any player's), you can return them to the deck and Special Summon another <em>Gladiator Beast</em> monster with a different name (hereafter refered as <em>tag-out</em>) to activate their effects, which are triggered when they are Special Summoned by the effect of a <em>Gladiator Beast </em>monster. Furthermore, by returning to the deck, you can Fusion Summon (hereafter refered as <em>contact fusion </em>or simply<em> contact)</em> several strong monsters that can also <em>tag-out).</em> In order to <em>tag-out</em>, you need to survive fights, which wou will be able to do with some support, cards like <strong><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a></strong>, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Vespasius"">Gladiator Beast Vespasius</a></strong>, <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Gladiator Beast &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heraklinos&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Gladiator Beast </strong><strong>Heraklinos</strong></a>, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a></strong>, <strong><a data-name=""Shrink"">Shrink</a></strong>, and <strong><a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a></strong> will aid in prevention of effects, manipulating battle positions and increasing-decreasing Attack stats to have your beasts fight and survive, and even if you are to take Battle Damage, you'll get in return field control as will be discussed below. <h3>The Combatants</h3> <strong><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>:</strong> Not a beast, but a great hand trap that aids in prevention of your main monsters' destruction by battle. She can be swapped with any of the other hand traps in the Side Deck, depending on your needs.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attorix"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a>:</strong> Her main use will be to send <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Bestiary"">Gladiator Beast Bestiary</a></strong> to the GY to <em>contact </em>for <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a></strong>, although due to her effect changing her level, you could send a level 5 or higher <i>Gladial</i> to <em>contact</em> <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a></strong>.  <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Gladiator Beast&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Augustus&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Gladiator Beast</strong> <strong>Augustus</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This beatstick has a good attack stat (above 2500 which helps against a lot of common threats), but his primary use will be to Special Summon a level 5 or higher <em>Gladiator Beast</em> from your hand to <i>contact</i><em> summon </em><strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a></strong>, or <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Gladiator Beast &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bestiary&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Gladiator Beast </strong><strong>Bestiary</strong></a>, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Laquari"">Gladiator Beast Laquari</a></strong>, or simply <em>contact</em><b> <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andabata"">Gladiator Beast Andabata</a></b>. You could also Link Summon <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Dragases"">Gladiator Beast Dragases</a></strong> or <strong><a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a></strong> if in need of more board options.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Bestiary"">Gladiator Beast Bestiary</a>:</strong> One of the most important <em>Gladials</em> in the archetype, for both its ability to clear enemy backrow, and to <em>contact summon</em> <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a></strong>. You could run 3 copies, though I feel you can recycle them easily enough via <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Darius"">Gladiator Beast Darius</a></strong>, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Equeste"">Gladiator Beast Equeste</a></strong>, and <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast's Comeback"">Gladiator Beast's Comeback</a></strong>.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Darius"">Gladiator Beast Darius</a></strong><strong>:</strong> This guy's job is to revive his teammates to swarm the board, or simply to <em>contact</em> an useful Summon. Because he negates their effects, brought-back monsters won't activate their effects, but still helps in cycling strategies.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Equeste"">Gladiator Beast Equeste</a></strong><strong>:</strong> Another recycle card. This one is useful because it targets a <em>Gladiator Beast</em> <strong>card</strong>, so you can bring to hand spells and traps, namely, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast War Chariot"">Gladiator Beast War Chariot</a></strong>, which is a strong defensive option.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Laquari"">Gladiator Beast Laquari</a>:</strong> Laquari's there to establish an ofensive board, bringing 2100 Attack when Summoned by another <em>Gladiator Beast</em>, and serving as main <em>contact </em>material for <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"">Gladiator Beast Heraklinos</a></strong>.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Murmillo"">Gladiator Beast Murmillo</a>:</strong> This fish is a destroy option, being the counterpart to Bestiary. However, he is slightly weaker due to reduced stats.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Noxious"">Gladiator Beast Noxious</a></strong><strong>:</strong> This beast is a great defensive option, and depending on how you play him, you can establish board during your opponent's turn, by allowing a clean board to spam beasts, depending on how or what you bring: for example, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Darius"">Gladiator Beast Darius</a></strong> helps with an early contact next turn, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Sagittarii"">Gladiator Beast Sagittarii</a></strong> for card cycling, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Augustus"">Gladiator Beast Augustus</a></strong> for readying a play next turn by returning a monster to your deck, etc.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Retiari"">Gladiator Beast Retiari</a>: </strong>GY removal tool. Simple yet so useful.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Sagittarii"">Gladiator Beast Sagittarii</a>:</strong> Strong draw option, which the deck can get some help with. Also establishes GY that can be used with <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Darius"">Gladiator Beast Darius</a> </strong>for easy <em>contact</em> or Link.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Vespasius"">Gladiator Beast Vespasius</a>:</strong> A great ofensive option, Special Summoning himself from the hand when battling, granting 500 Attack to all your monsters, which will surprise your opponent. He also <em>contacts</em> <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a></strong>, if you need to do so.  <strong><a data-name=""Test Tiger"">Test Tiger</a>:</strong> Not a <em>Gladiator Beast</em>, but a really strong support. Its effect is to bring another monster and activate their effects due to <em>tag-out</em>. Summons itself, so you can also Link with him, though simply <em>tagging</em> is more efficient most of the time. <h3>The Tools of Battle</h3> Spells are pretty straightforward in this deck, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beasts's Comeback"">Gladiator Beasts's Comeback</a> </strong>is a revival/summoning tool from hand or GY for <em>tag-out</em>, Link or <em>contact fusion</em>, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Proving Ground"">Gladiator Proving Ground</a></strong> is a search option/deck thinner, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Rejection"">Gladiator Rejection</a></strong> is an interesting defensive/ofensive tool, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast's Respite"">Gladiator Beast's Respite</a></strong> is strong card draw, <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Raigeki&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Raigeki </strong></a>and <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Harpie's Feather Duster&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong></a> are just self-explainatory, and <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Shrink&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Shrink </strong></a>is a powerful and unexpected removal tool that has great synergy with this deck.  On traps, you won't use that many, being an aggresive deck, there's no time for waiting. <strong><a data-name=""Defensive Tactics"">Defensive Tactics</a></strong> prevents destruction and allows to go all-in without taking battle damage, plus it self-cycles to the deck, and <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast War Chariot"">Gladiator Beast War Chariot</a></strong> prevents handtraps, several monster effects and disrupts a great deal of monsters, as it does not target. <h3>The New Challengers</h3> <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andabata"">Gladiator Beast Andabata</a>:</strong> Its main use lies in its attack stat, and summoning <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a></strong> easily enough (being the only Level 7 or lower in the Extra Deck).  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a>:</strong> Great defensive tool with monster effect denial. Also has great presence due to its high stats, and can be brought with ease. Have fun.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a>:</strong> One of the best <em>contacts</em> since early stages of <em>Gladiator Beast</em>'s life as a deck. Destroying up to two <strong>cards</strong> is just too strong, and bringing two gladiators when <em>tagging-out</em> is just too good. He is also Summoned way too easy, having several options to bring him in.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"">Gladiator Beast Heraklinos</a>:</strong> His greatest strength lies in both high stats and good effect that is not activated once per turn, though costs a card to be discarted. He also <em>cannot tag-out</em>, which limits his versatility, but bringing both him and <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a></strong> will be a big enough board to have your opponent think as their options will be thinner.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Nerokius"">Gladiator Beast Nerokius</a></strong><strong>:</strong> Nerokius has an ancient gear-like effect, so <em>tagging</em> with him will be easier, as he has a strong Attack stat, and by doing so, you'll bring another two monsters to control the board even easier.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a>:</strong> A big powerhouse of the deck, which is one of the newest and strongest fusions, as its effect of Special Summoning fusion monsters from the Extra Deck will aid in a lot of control, bringing in <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"">Gladiator Beast Heraklinos</a></strong> for spell/trap negation,  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a></strong> for effect denial, or maybe <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a></strong> for destruction. Simply great to have.  <strong><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>:</strong> Great monster for swarming decks, and this is one of those. Effect denial and big attack is something you want when using this deck.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Dragases"">Gladiator Beast Dragases</a>:</strong> Prevents effects with an <em>Ancient Gear</em>-like effect, plus destruction by battle denial on your attacking monsters. He won't last long on the field, as <em>tagging-out</em> will bring two companions, so that effect should be used fully.  <strong><a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a>:</strong> A stronger <strong><a data-name=""Test Tiger"">Test Tiger</a></strong>, as it won't tribute itself, and on Link Summoning will give you hand to toy with, best when used with a current Gladiator Beast on your field, as you can bring <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Vespasius"">Gladiator Beast Vespasius</a></strong> or <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Noxius"">Gladiator Beast Noxius</a></strong> to your hand, then <em>tagging-out</em> into <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Augustus"">Gladiator Beast Augustus</a></strong> so you can Special summon one of the former, so you can quickly <em>contact</em> into <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a>.</strong>"

I played this build at locals in Bulgaria during my recent visit pre march banlist, i went X-1 in a 16 man tournament, played mostly rogue although i was expecting a lot of drytron and VW, I have now change this deck a lot recenlt playing a trap version going X-1 at a 25 man tournament that profile will be up soon as I felt I performed well winning 4 out of 5 matches.  I would appreciate people checking out my youtube channel im a relatively new player playing my first loacls August 2020, and growing my youtube channel as i learn is pretty fun and interesting so any support is always appreciated, link will be below to the deck profile and in turn my youtube channel.  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYK_tUbzRng</a>"

Testing out the Artifact package. Rusty can destroy Scythe during opponent's turn to lock them out of their extra deck.  Forbidden Droplet and Access Code Talker are expensive cards.

I play zoodiac for some time now so i wanted to shar with you my deck inspired by OCG. Unfortunately we dont have powerhouse known as Number F0: Utopic Future Dragon who dominate in OCG zoodiac variants. This variant rans a lot of hand traps and traps because you dont have a good turn one ( preaty much drident pass).

I hope everyone enjoys my first deck list feedback is appreciated and let me know if everyone has as much fun with this deck as I do."

Also it's funny banishing all of your opponent's monsters.  The main strategy is to recycle Crystal Girl enough until you get the Legendary Fishermans you need, while also doing invoked stuff. There Can Be Only One was added as a floodgate to slow the game down while you do that and it works because this deck uses different types.  I've found Crystal Girl &amp; Aleister to be a good opening hand. Use Invocation for Cocytus and then activate Crystal Girl to get a search in the End Phase.  All TCG except Crystal Girl and The Ice-Bound God (Side-Deck).  Side Deck is comprised of possible addition cards. Tips are welcome and encouraged. I really want to find a way to make Legendary Fisherman III work efficiently."

If there is no disruptions from opponent and you didnt draw a dead hand, this deck can make ridiculous boards (they do get countered by droplet or dark ruler no more). main focus is to abuse thunder dragons (and other cards) as much as possible and extract it all via link sumoning (or synchro summoning). it is recommended to 1st summon appolousa to counter nibiru, or just any link 4 with arrow wich points down vertically so you can possibly abuse knightmare link 2's etc. while cracking your opponents board. I have made 4 link 4's and a dragoon all in 1 turn 2 test hand, given no disruptions."

Once again ill go over the main combo and a side combo.  Main Combo- If you start with Genex Undine, your perfect. Summon Genex Undine and uses the effect to send rosenix to the grave and you add a genex controller to your hand, next banish rosenix to summon a token then link the token off for a link spider uses link spider to summon controller and don't syncrho yet. Link off Spider and Controller to summon halqifibrax. Uses halqifibrax to summon out pengiun from your deck. then if you have a Silent angler or white stingray special summon them (note: if you have both try to summon stingray first because angler locks you out of special summoning from the hand) Now syncrho into Shooting Riser dragon if able or into White Aur dolphin. Then end your turn, if your going second feel free to atttack. On your opponets turn uses halqifibrax and bring out Shooting Riser dragon. Synchro into White Aura Bihamut (Another thing to note: White aura can revive itself as long as the token it summons is on the field but it can't revive itself if destroyed by battle.  &nbsp;  Side combo- Do the same as above but instead of going in to White Aura Bihamut go into White Aura Whale since Whale destroys all attack postion monsters.  &nbsp;  The Main Idea of The Deck  You want to synchro into as White Aura Bihamut as fast as possible and maybe try to get two of them on the field  &nbsp;  Once again this deck is not supposed to be a Meta or Competitive deck and I'd love some advice in the comments but lets not be to harsh, If you have question on how the deck works just comment below and ill try to answer.  &nbsp;  Thanks,  Sparko  &nbsp;"

Still has a one card combo. Budget alternatives to certain cards in the description.,"Union Carrier getting banned hurt the consistency of the deck somewhat. We were able to make Cyber Dragon Infinity and ABC Dragon Buster off of one card. With the hit there are different ways and there is still a one card combo using Crystron Halqifibrax.  The combo goes like this: <ol>  	<li>Search or Activate Hanger (2 card combo if you have a machine plus unauthorised activation). Use hanger to search B and summon it.</li>  	<li>Equip B with Driver, then banish driver to equip Torque tune gear, then special summon it.</li>  	<li>Link Summon the B and Toque Tune Gear to summon Halqifibrax. Chain link 1 Halq, Chain link 2 B.</li>  	<li>Summon Deskbot 001 with the effect of Halq (plus search another piece with B for follow up plays)</li>  	<li>Link Halq and Deskbot 001 to summon Mehca Phantom Beast Auroradon.</li>  	<li>Activate Auroradon when summoned, thus summoning 3 tokens, this will trigger Deskbot 001 form grave and it will special summon itself.</li>  	<li>Synchro Summon Deskbot 001 and one of the tokens to summon Herald of the Archlight.</li>  	<li>Activate Auroradon effect to destroy 2 tokens and summon Coltwing from deck.</li>  	<li>Activate Coltwing effect summoning 2 tokens, this will again trigger Deskbot 001 summoning it from grave.</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Phonon Pulse Dragon using Deskbot 001 and one of the tokens. When summoned change it's level to 1 using it's own effect.</li>  	<li>The Coltwing will be level 7 because of the token and use it along with Phonon Pulse Dragon to special summon Borreload Savage Dragon and equip it with Halq.</li> </ol> This will leave you a board with 2 negates (Savage and Herald) plus Auroradon and a token.  Different plays can be done depending on the hand but this is all off one Union Hanger.  &nbsp;  BUDGET OPTIONS  Some cards can have alternatives.  If you don't want to run Ash and Nibiru, you can swap them out for D.D Crow, Effect Veiler or Solemn Judgement.  If you don't want to run Halqifibrax, then remove it along with Auroradon, Deskbot 001, Torque Tune Gear, Coltwing and all the synchros and replace them with the Symphonic Warrior engine. This means adding 3x Symphonic Warrior Guitaar and 1x  Symphonic Warrior Miccs, this can give you an extra normal summon on activation. In the extra deck add Gear Gigant X, this will allow you to search Symphonic Warrior Guitaar. Plus Miccs is a level 5 so could be used to summon Infinity. Other than that the other extra deck spots can be replaced with cards such as Daigusto Emeral, Apollousa, the Knightmares or Bujinki Ahashima (allows for an xyz summon) from which you'll summon Gear Gigant x  &nbsp;  The Deck is very consistent and can end on powerful boards, you can still equip other ABC pieces and trigger their effects to summon Dragon Buster easier instead of other combos. But it has the same drawbacks as before, it's very susceptible to hand traps. The deck could potentially play through an Ash Blossom depending on your hand, but an Imperm, Veiler or Nibiru will pretty much end any plays."

The synergies between Paleozoic and Pacifis allow this deck to keep up in advantage and beat down on your opponent after disrupting their plays  <strong>Pros: </strong> <ul>  	<li>It's different, no deck is preparing to play against this one</li>  	<li>Forces your opponent to change their gameplan to hope to deal with it.</li>  	<li>About as dense on draw power as you can get, running many strong draw cards in 40</li>  	<li>Surprising burst kill options with Gren Maju and Phantasm Spiral Grip</li> </ul> <strong>Cons:</strong> <ul>  	<li>The deck is over 50% traps, you can end up with no engine, and having to use what you opened to force a topdeck war.</li>  	<li>It can be outpaced by most strong engines, if you don't snuff plays, you end up behind.</li>  	<li>Almost completely reactive, if your opponent opts to do nothing your only pressure is attacking with relatively small monsters.</li> </ul> <strong>Points - 4:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Pot of Extravagance - 1/2 Point</li>  	<li>Pot of Prosperity - 1/2 Point</li>  	<li>Card of Demise - 1/2 Point</li>  	<li>Sea Stealth Attack - 1/2 Point</li> </ul> <strong>A Note on Chains</strong>: <p>Piloting this deck properly requires a good grasp of chaining and priority.  Whenever you activate a trap, your opponent always has the opportunity to respond before you continue to build your chain. What this means is that if you are trying to summon out your Paleozoic monsters, you need to be aware that your opponent can block this from happening by responding to your trap with a Monster Effect or Quick-Play Spell, since Paleozoics need to chain <em>directly</em> to the activation of a Trap Card.  Somewhat related is the inclusion of Accumulated Fortune in this Deck, which can be triggered easily if your opponent starts the chain (e.g. Cl1 Opponent's card, Cl2 Your trap card, Cl3 Your opponent can respond but if they don't this is a Paleo, Cl4 Accumulated Fortune regardless of your opponent's response.) Another thing of note with accumulated fortune is that in can be used in chain with your own Pot of Extravagance, circumventing Extravagance's restriction and drawing 4 cards.</p> <strong>A Note on Pacifis:</strong> <p>Pacifis the Phantasm Spiral City is a card with some wacky rulings, I can't cover everything, but here are some things to keep in mind.</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Pacifis' effects always activate on a new chain, in contrast to the Paleozoics.</li>  	<li>Pacifis' effect to search is mandatory, and applies it's Summoning restriction whenever it activates, even if you have no search targets.</li>  	<li>Pacifis cannot ""see"" anything activated before it on a chain, this is relevant in the case of Metaverse.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p></p>"

The danger package is really good but the problem is that you do not want to discard ""<a data-name=""Chaos Daedalus"">Chaos Daedalus</a><a data-name=""Chaos Daedalus"">""</a> or ""<a data-name=""The Chaos Creator"">The Chaos Creator""</a> and they are very important for the strategy of the deck.  &nbsp;  You want to go first with this deck and set up a well protected board. If you draw ""<a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>"" you almost always want to search ""<a data-name=""Chaos Daedalus"">Chaos Daedalus</a>"" if you have a light monster to discard because he is a very good boss monster for your end board which gives your monsters targeting protection. But you can also search combo extenders that cannot be normal summoned or set like ""<a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a>"". She is very good for the deck because she can dump ""<a data-name=""Doomking Balerdroch"">Doomking Balerdroch</a>"" from the deck if she gets banished. If you have no way of getting ""<a data-name=""Zombie World"">Zombie World</a>"" you can even dump ""Necroworld banshee"" but remember that you cannot use the effects of those cards in that turn so Doomking is always the best choice. Valkyria can also banish ""<a data-name=""Shinobi necro"">Shinobi necro</a>"" in the GY to get a free tuner on the board and there are a lot of cards that banish valkyrie to activate her dumping effect like ""<a data-name=""Chaos Daedalus"">Chaos Daedalus</a>"", ""<a data-name=""The Chaos creator"">The Chaos creator</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>"" or even ""<a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Vendread core"">Vendread core</a>"" if you have Zombie World on the field.  &nbsp;"

I still play them from time to time in a very casual format. I was so hyped when the Abhyss support was announced and overjoyed when we got this unexpected alien support. Pincer Lord and Buster are really good and synergize very well with the old alien strategies.  Here's my take at Alien Abhyss. The aim is to have Pincer lord and another alien monster on the field (most of the time alien buster) with virus set. You have a trap raigeki coupled with a very good stun. The deck has a surprisingly good grind. Recombination and Buster both have nice eff in grave and the abhyss package allows you to keep putting board presence in the late game.

Dark Hole! (Nani!? *music intensifies*)  Ok, so to make this short and simple, Lightning Storm is very powerful if you're going second. You could side it, and it would fit in well with this deck, but Dark Hole has been way more effective for me. I would have played 2 earlier and 1 Raigeki, but my perfectionism was getting in the way. Even in this meta, I've seen a surprising amount of second and third turns where you still have cards on the field, whether it be a fog blade, or a face-down Orcust Knightmare which you've tribute summoned... (What? Am I the only person who's been forced to do that?) Even though lightning storm hits spells and traps, too, I feel like the Dark Hole has still been more useful for me. So yeah. Fight me.  Combo 1: (Starting with <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> in hand) <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Girsu, send <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> from deck off his effect</li>  	<li>Since you don't control any other cards, activate Girsu's effect and create a token to both player's fields--I love this effect, because it shuts down PSY-Framegear Gamma, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, even <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence, since they now have something on their field</a></li>  	<li>Banish Orcust Knightmare from the GY, send World Legacy - ""World Wand"" from deck to GY. If you opened with Wand, send Orcust Cymbal Skeleton instead off this effect. Banish World Wand from GY to special summon your Banished Knightmare. Use Girsu and the token to link summon <a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automaton"">Galatea, the Orcust Automaton</a> (if you sent Cymbal Skele instead, you'd summon Galatea first, then banish Cymbal Skele from GY to special summon Girsu)</li>  	<li>Activate Galatea's effect, shuffling the banished World Wand (or Cymbal Skeleton) into deck, then setting <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel (or really any Orcust spell/trap, depending on your playstyle)</a></li>  	<li>Use Galatea and Orcust Knightmare to Link summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche, activating his effect to send </a><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak (or torn scales) to GY to set Phantom Knights' Fog Blade from deck; banish Ancient Cloak from GY to add another Fog Blade to hand, then set it.</a></li> </ol> That's the combo. yeah, I know, not very combo-y since you only end on 2 negates; you do have a loaded GY that you could potentially mess around with on your opponent's turn, but in truth and honesty the original combo I had in mind went down the drain when I realized <a data-name=""Gravity Controller"">Gravity Controller</a> can't be used as a link material first turn it's on the field. There are some alternations for this combo I'm still working on, so if anybody has suggestions, feel free to share them (and no, unban Harp does not count as a suggestion)  Alternations for this Combo (that do exist because yes) <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Girsu, send <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> to GY, then create your token</li>  	<li>Banish Knightmare to send <a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">Orcust Cymbal Skeleton</a> to GY; use Girsu and your token to summon Galatea</li>  	<li>Banish Cymbal Skele from GY to special summon Girsu back from the grave.. Activate Galatea's effect, shuffling Knightmare into deck and getting out <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a></li>  	<li>Use Galatea to summon <a data-name=""Dingirsu, Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, Orcust of the Evening Star, using his effect on summon to equip the banished Cymbal Skeleton</a></li>  	<li>Use Dingirsu and Girsu to Link summon <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena, then pass turn</a></li> </ol> --On your opponent's turn, you can banish Cymbal Skele form GY to special summon Dingirsu back from the GY, sending a card your opponent controls hopefully mid-combo. Then, after you've done that, you can use him and I:P to link summon Knightmare Unicorn, shuffling another card they control (hopefully also mid-combo)  Second Alternation: (if you open with Girsu and some other extender, like <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a> of <a data-name=""Fiend's Sanctuary"">Fiend's Sanctuary)</a> <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Girsu; do the thing where you send Knightmare and create a token. Then summon your extender</li>  	<li>Use Girsu and your extender to link summon <a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automaton"">Galatea, the Orcust Automaton. Banish Knightmare from GY, send Cymbal Skele from deck to GY; banish Cymbal Skele from GY to revive your Girsu</a></li>  	<li>First, use Galatea's ability, shuffle the banished <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> into your deck, bringing out <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel from deck. Then use Galatea to summon Dingirsu, equipping your banished </a><a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">Orcust Cymbal Skeleton</a><a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">.</a></li>  	<li>Use Dingirsu, your token, and your revived Girsu to link summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche, do the thing from the first combo to get 2 fog blades.</a></li> </ol> The difference between this and the original combo, is that now you have Dingirsu, along with Cymbal Skele in grave. Since you have Babel on field, you can activate Cymbal Skeleton on your opponent's turn, banishing him to special summon Dingirsu--use his other effect to send a card your opponent controls to the GY, plus since he's a dark XYZ monster, you can get an additional pop off of <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche if you summon Ding into a zone Rusty's pointing to. So 2 negates, 1 pop, and 1 non-targeting send.</a>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Second Combo: (starting with <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a> in hand) <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Torn Scales, activate it's effect, discarding a card to send <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak from deck to GY</a></li>  	<li>Use Torn Scales to link summon <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj; Banish Ancient Cloak from GY to add Silent Boots to hand--chain Torn Scales's ability to special summon him back from GY</a></li>  	<li>Since you control Torn Scales, special summon Silent Boots from hand. Use Silent Boots and Almiraj to link summon I:P Masquerena --simply because you need the Dark attribute-- then use I:P and Torn Scales to link summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a></li>  	<li>Activate Rusty's effect, send Ancient Cloak from deck to GY to set Fog Blade from deck to field. Banish Silent Boots from GY to add a second Fog Blade to hand, then set it.</li> </ol> So yeah, it ends pretty similarly except now your Rusty can't be destroyed by your opponent's card effects. Not as rad as the last combo, in my opinion, but I'm still working on it--I'm sure there's some random PK card hidden in my collection that does something cool...  &nbsp;  Third Combo: (starting with <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> and <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a> in hand) <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Torn Scales, discard Girsu to send Ancient Cloak to GY</li>  	<li>Use Torn Scales to link summon Almiraj, banish Ancient Cloak to add Silent Boots; when Ancien Cloak is banished we can Reborn (Rebirth?) Torn Scales from grave</li>  	<li>Since you control Torn Scales now, special summon Silent Boots from hand; use him and Scales to link summon Cherubini in the zone Almiraj is pointing to. Activate Cherubini's effect, sending Cymbal Skeleton to the GY</li>  	<li>First (this is important) Banish Silent Boots from grave to add Shade Brigandine to hand, then set it under Almiraj's zone (this is also important) THEN you can banish Cymbal Skeleton to special summon Girsu from GY into the zone between Almiraj and the set Shade Brigandine; since it has two cards in its zone, it becomes a tuner. On summon, activate Girsu's effect and send Orcust Knightmare from deck, do the cycle (banish Knightmare from grave, send World Wand from deck, banish Wand to special summon Knightmare)</li>  	<li>Use Knightmare and Almiraj to link summon Galatea, shuffle the World Wand into deck to set, then activate Orcustrated Babel (&lt;very important, I've forgotten before and it sucks) then use Galatea to xyz summon Dingirsu, equipping banished Cymbal Skeleton</li>  	<li>Use Dingirsu and Cherubini to link summon Rusty Bardiche; activate Rusty's effect sending any PK card to GY (I prefer Ancient Cloak, but it doesn't really matter at this point, since you've already activated Cloak, Boots, and Scales' abilities) then setting Fog Blade directly from your deck.   ---(Credit to the many Orcust players before me:) on your opponent's turn, you can banish Cymbal Skeleton from GY (quick effect, because of Babel) to special summon Dingirsu to a zone Rusty Bardiche is pointing to, which allows you to both pop a card (Rusty) and send a card on the field (Dingirsu)---</li>  	<li>Then you activate the still face-down Shade Brigandine, using him and your Girsu to Synchro summon Borreload Savage. Equip Cherubini to him from your grave, giving him 2 negates and 250 additional attack--note, you could use Galatea to give him more attack, but unless you're playing dinosaurs or trains or something, it should be fine at that, in addition to the fact that Galatea is better to have in grave. Feel free to use her, though.</li> </ol> So we've got an omni negate, a monster negate, and two pops. Not ridiculously amazing, but should be able to shut down your opponent. Now yes, a nibiru or an ash, or even a ghost ogre could damage this, (i admit it) so chances of this combo going off are small. Even if they hit it partway through, though, it wouldn't be too hard to set up an acceptable end board (something similar to the first and second combo)  You could go into Dragoon if you're willing to play more bricks and take up a couple more extra deck slots (instead of Savage) but honestly I find myself drawing too many bricks already, not to mention the fact that I feel like a terrible person every time I summon him. On that same happy note, there's not really an excuse to play Mystic Mine in this deck since Babel's going to be taking up the field spell space, so there's still hope for your soul :)  --I've actually slowed down on the pure PK Orcust style, and started adding Shaddoll cards--being able to send <a data-name=""Reeshaddoll Wendi"">Reeshaddoll Wendi off of Cherubini is actually pretty broken, plus there are some sweet 2-card combos where you can end on Rusty and Winda. (I have a nasty tendency of turning any control deck into a combo one) Anyway, if any of y'all have suggestions for that, or just this deck, please feel free to say something.</a>  Anyway, if you read all that I'd be very surprised. Peace out, lads"

AKA the worst deck possible.,"So, I've been binging 5d's now and I think Greiger's a cool character, so here's a deck utilizing Reactors. I decided to add in a Machina engine to make plays easier to do, mainly getting a body on field to summon Summon Reactor because level 5 go brrrrrrrrr. If you can't tell by now, Reactor's are horrible. They don't even negate. To make them as ""playable"" as possible, i added a few bandaids of sorts. I added Machina's to get more bodies on board, so you can go into more links and such or tribute for Summon. I also added Mystic Mine in case you're in a situation where you're just sitting on 1 monster against a spam combo deck, and Double Summon, to get multiple Reactors or normal summonable Machina's on board along with Reactors. I made this deck in more of a going 1st control focus, so I added a good few traps for that. I wanted to include more, but I had no space. You can include more in the side deck tho. This deck sucks but, it was the best I could think of. Also, this made me realize Machina's are a great engine. I think i'll try them out more."

I focused the main board for going first, the schism play catches a lot of people off guard turn 1; I have sideboard extra deck cards when you need to go second because winda is only viable going first and you want extra plays for Zeus going second. The ideal end board turn 1 for this deck is Drident, Maximus, Winda floodgate, a monster negate, and 2-3 pops with eldlich and punishment/n'tss. Omega is the mvp of this deck, you want to constantly send him off with maximus to recur your extra deck. I have ash blossom in place of gamma because I found that gamma wasn't live nearly as much as I would have liked it to be, but you could opt to side out ash for gamma because it protects a lot of your starters like nadir or eldland. I focused the sideboard on blowouts for going second, as well as a couple of answers to the current meta. It isn't a cheap deck but if you have the cards I would highly recommend trying this out, the deck plays really well."

He actually turned into a pretty cool dude over the course of GX ngl. Anyway, this is a going second OTK styled deck around Ancient Gears. This deck is mainly centered around summoning out the fusions as fast as possible, the main one being Megaton golem, as it's the most generic and accesible of the fusions. I also included a small Cyber Dragon package with Chimeratech, to remove bodies from the board and get a beater on the field.  Limiter Removal is also there to make OTKs way easier, but it is unsearchable sadly. Additionally, this deck is pretty consisent due to the huge amount of searching S/T and on summon searching monsters, but if going first you could potentially brick on Anchient Gear Golem and/or Cyber Dragon so be wary of that. Cyber Dragon can be sided out for Dark Hole, as Dark Hole triggers your own monster effs. Fun fact: The reason Heavy Storm is still banned is because it would make Ancient Gears tier 0 : )"

What Cubics like to do is bring out their boss monster Crimson Nova the dark Cubic lord who basically there once they have him out tries to go for an otk. They bring him out by showing 3 Cubic cards from your hand with different names so that you can special summon him, this is not a once per turn effect and he can reveal a second copy of himself to bring him out. You do need to search him out tho which you can do that by sending their spell cards to the grave. What their spell cards like to do is banish them selves from your graveyard in order to add a cubic monster from your deck to your hand or a Cubic monster from your graveyard to your hand. How will you send them to the grave though you may ask. the easiest way is by using foolish burial goods but there are more ways than just that. You can also use reasoning in order to get a special summon and mill some cards though unlike most cubic decks mine has more monsters that can be normal summoned so its a bit less useful than others but still great if u get lucky but usually u just want it for the summon and a chance to get some spells milled. We also have summoned monk though probably the best way to get the spells in the graveyard. When you normal summon him he goes to defense mode but by discarding a spell you can special summon 1 level 4 monster from your deck which you will want to summon Duza. What Duza does is when he is normal or special summoned you can send a Cubic card from the deck to the grave. Also if that spell you discarded was cubic karma then you can get 2 free searches off of the 1 summoner monk. You can also use the danger monsters to discard spells into your grave. If you did look at the list though I bet you are wondering why I have Zoodiac Drident in there. Well if I were to use mind control or crackdown on a Zoodiac monster I could use it. If that were the only use though I probably wouldn't use in in here. That is why I also like to take the monster to go into Verte Andaconda and if u wanna add Dragoon then you can use it for that but I use it in here so that I can special summon a free starving venom or another super poly target but its most likely gonna be venom dragon cause you can use the effect to also change one of your opponent's monsters into a dark. Since you used an opponent's monster for that summon as well though you just took out 2 of their monsters and still have your 2 monsters in case you also wanna go into a unicorn and remove more stuff and get a cubic spell discard for a search. We also play accesscode talker just cause it's a great card same with Apollousa. Underworld goddess in case we already used super poly. The knightmare cards we play just because they are great as well. Other than the Zoodiac and Superdreadnought though the rest of the monsters in extra can be whatever. I just put in some rank 4s that can deal with a lot of stuff depending on the situation. Dark Rebellion if I need to beat over something real quick, Number 41 if I need to stall for just a minute and Castel if I need to bounce a monster. Now that I say it though why would I want to use Superdreadnought? We use him so that we don't accidently lose from our own cards let me explain. Our boss monster Crimson Nova the Dark Cubic lord has an effect where any time we end our turn he will deal 3000 damage to both players. Sometimes though you wont have that life to spare but he doesn't care. So you can use Superdreadnought so you dint die and deal 2000 damage plus that can win games for you if you somehow brought out 3 Crimson Nova and your opponent is still not dead that will seal the deal. What do you guys think about this deck though. If you guys want more deck profiles like this though you can check me out on youtube as Kuriboh Gaming and when I hit 100 subscribers I'm going to start making deck lists daily. If you have any decks you want me to try to make comment on a video and I will be happy to post a video on it with a side deck as well."

Aleister core:  3x because you can fusion everything in your hand, if you wanted to, if you posses the required materials in hand of course. The sole purpose of this build is making everything as effeciently as possible.  Eldlich core:  Kinda standard playing, but i opped for the triple eldlich because getting idp sucks:).  The trickstar engine:  Thats your verte anaconda turbo and sacky materials for the mechaba.  If everything plays out, you have a extra disruption (lightstage) in your turn and play 6 cards less in your deck which boosts consistency.  Red eyes engine:  Its dragoon why not play him..  Disclaimers:  i added some disruption trap cards but feel free to play around with this. It works great for myself, baiting out negates from a opponents dragoon or/and clearing troublesome cards for example etc etc.  Extra deck:  Caliga, mechaba and dragoon are your priority but the rest of the invoked monsters and artemis, invoker of madness are crazy good aswell.  Elysium is mental when you need to get rid of troublesome monsters in the grind game.  The generic xyz package for eldlich with zeus for extra spice.  Anaconda because anaconda  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This and other things have became a passionate hobby to me so in this context the  Paleozoic Frog deck appear to me the most.  The Paleozoic card are almost an ideal representation of  animals that once lived on Earth( on the  Cambrian Period), so well detail  which got me in love. So enough about boring stuffs and let's get into the deck.  &nbsp;  <span>One to rules them All</span>  The paleozoic  Frog  is a strategy  based in a control type of deck using traps ( and occasionally handtraps) as the main resource of such action. The majority of Paleozoic archetype are trap <span>cards</span>  with a variety of effects, while having a gimmick to summon themself as a monster (AQUA levEl 2 , 1200 ATK/ 0 DEF) in a CL1 with a trap. Frogs are leval 2 AQUA monster which have the abillity to sworm the field fast as they can, while aiming to go for the big guy of their archetype Toadally Awesome (what a goof name), a Rank 2 aqua monster with a totatlly awsome omni negate effect.  Both engine were born to be together, they are so complementary for each other that makes a fearsome rogue strategy.  <span>Who is who on Cruj (a silly brazilian joke)</span>  <span>Frogs everywhere</span>  <span> 3x <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a>: Our silly boy , swap frog is the heart and soul for the frog engine. First of all , the first effect ( a frog's  Foolish burial when it's summoned) is not  once per turn, so you can bounce itself for a additional Gy set up,  like  a <a data-name=""Ronnintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a> and a  <a data-name=""Dupe frog"">Dupe frog</a>. You can even use<a data-name=""Toadally Awesome""> Toadally Awesome</a> effect to summon Swap frog from deck  to extend you plays to go in a second Toadally Awesome.</span>  3x <a data-name=""Dupe frog"">Dupe frog</a>: A control's  graduated, this cute little frog is our food for <a data-name=""Swap frog"">Swap frog</a> and<a data-name=""  Ronnintoadin"">  Ronintoadin</a>  to work well. It has a second major effect  to add a frog monster to your hand from deck which is good also because you can use it to go in a link monster  (<a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> or <a data-name=""Mista boy"">Mista boy</a>)  2x <a data-name=""Ronnintoadin"">Ron</a><a data-name=""Ronnintoadin"">intoadin</a> : This wanna-be samurai can be summon fron your  Gy banning  a  frog card and that's not a once per turn effect. The sworm ability  of this card are incredibly.  3x <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>: A XYZ monster with so much power. These little bastards can detach  a material to summon a frog from deck , tribute an Aqua monster to negate ANY effect and  if  they go to Gy , can recover a  water monster( itself or  other another frog). The scariest part is that none of theses effects are ""hard"" once per turn ( in other word, if you have more the one on field you can use  this effect again), making this card a fearsome entity. If  you have<a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder""> Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a>, this card becomes  even more Scariest.  &nbsp;  <span>Honorary Frogs</span>  2x <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a>: An Idol makes an apperance in this deck. She is a brillant extender, you can  use <a data-name=""Swap frog""> Swap frog </a>to send <a data-name=""Dupe frog"">Dupe frog</a> to GY , bounce itself to send a <a data-name=""Ronnintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a>  to Gy, use the <a data-name=""Ronnintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a> to summon it  and go into  Marincess Coral Anemone summon again <a data-name=""Swap frog"">Swap frog</a> from Gy. using another time it effect  to send another  dupe frog to bring Ronintoadin once more to go into <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>... phew... <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> is insane...  1x <a data-name=""Mista boy"">Mista boy</a>: one of the elemental links , it can boost <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> and if goes to gy , recover any water monster.  1x <a data-name=""Cat Shark"">Cat Shark</a> : A rank 2 XYZ cute fellow can boost even more the atk of <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>.  &nbsp;  <span>Cambrian period</span>  2x <a data-name=""Paleozoic Pikaia"">Paleozoic Pikaia</a> : <i><b>Pikaia </b></i> is an extinct, primitive  animal known from the Middle Cambrian that looks like a Eel.

Our  Canadia is a Bool of  moon in a trap card form, flipping any non link monster as you like  to stop our disturb any link, synchro ou XYZ plays. This is not as impact outrageous as a  Solemn Strike,however it breaks the  tempo of you opponent and this is the most importat thing.  3x <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a> : <i><b>Dinomischus</b> </i>is a rare fossil animal from the Cambrian period, looking like a  actinia or  a Jellyfish offspring. Our Dinomischus is a insane card that can banish any face-up card of the field and, like  Pikaia,  can set hte  Gy with any card. Removing from play an  Eldlich or a Zoo is what makes this deck scare.  3x <a data-name=""Paleozoic Olenoides"">Paleozoic Olenoides</a>:<i><b>Olenoides</b></i> was a trilobite(<b>Trilobites</b>  means ""three lobes"" are a group of extinct marine artiopodan arthropods, looking like <span>Woodlouse</span>) from the Cambrian period. Our Olenoides will destroy any spell/trap card on field. No flood gates like mystic mine or  There can be only one, just perfect  2x <a data-name=""Paleozoic Opabinia"">Paleozoic Opabinia</a>:<i><b>Opabinia regalis</b></i> is an extinct, <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Stem group"">stem group</a> arthropod found in the Middle Cambrian ,was a soft-bodied animal, averaging about 5.7 cm in length (excluding proboscis), and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail, looking like a alien crab or a giant shrimp. Our Opabinia, a XYZ monster can add any paleozoic card  from deck to your hand and also makes any Paleozoic trap carda an hand Trap.

Powered Jersey can easily otk  <strong>2x U.A. Blockbacker - </strong>Though powercrept by Link Monsters, it is a 1 time use bagooska. Can be cut to 1  <strong>2x U.A.

I decided to make an Ancient Gear OTK version because I love them and i'm a Crowler simp. Anyway, this is a IRL build so it's missing some stuff like Verte. It's as budget friendly as possible and just desgined to use cards that are A) cheap or B) that I already own. This is a variant focused towards blind second  OTKing, using big beater fusions and some really annoying to out Machina's. The Ancient Gear part of it is incredibly consisent with on summon searchers and such, and the Machina part helps a ton with field swarming. I also included generic hand traps and Dark Ruler No More for blind seconding. Have fun!"

Even though I did catch up, I'm still pissed because I could have gotten literally anything else done besides this, like going outside and living a life. Anyways, lets get into to it:</span>  <span>I couldn't stand the thought that Calamities being banned meant that pure scraps were unplayable. ""Level 9 Synchros were their whole thing! What now?""</span>  <span>Then I remembered that I can summon the Simorgh link in Scraps thanks to Scrap Searcher</span>  <span>Before we talk about that let's start off with the basics:</span> <p><span>What Do Scraps do exactly?</span></p> <span>If you don't know what they do already despite being a well known engine in machine decks, soon to be even more well known when Scrap Raptor comes along, I really don't know what to say. To some it up, they are basically the older synchro brother of Unchaineds and Fire Kings, except some of the effects only go off when they are destroyed by other Scrap monsters. Of course, they make up for this by having one card that Fire Kings, Unchained, and every other self-destruct archetype wish they had, Scrap Searcher</span> <p><span>What is Scrap Searcher?</span></p> <span>Scrap searcher is not a searcher, but it is a really good card that summons itself from the grave when a Scrap monster is destroyed, besides Scrap Searcher. The good thing about this effect is that it is not a hard once per turn, so if you have 2 of these in your grave, you can get off this effect up to 6 times a turn, which is funny when you do it. It also helps you avoid ash sense you can use it to chain block some effects that would summon monsters from the deck. Not to mention the fact that it is also a winged beast monster, so we can use it summon 'Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty' for cards like Apex Avian and Wind Barrier Statue (That's right, Bird up 2! Electric Boogaloo)</span> <p><span>How will you protect the barrier statue?</span></p> <p><span><span>Well, their are two ways:</span></span></p>  <ol>  	<li><span>We summon Drident and use its effect (Daniel)</span></li>  	<li><span>We can use Cloudcastle's second effect (the cooler Daniel)</span></li> </ol> <span>Cloud castle is a level 9 synchro well known for being used in Virtual World decks because it is able to reuse XX-Saber Gottems to hand loop your opponent. Scraps can do this as well, but they also make use of Cloudcastle's forgotten second effect: being able to prevent level 8 or lower monsters from attacking the turn they are normal or special summoned. This makes it so unless our opponent can normal summon a level 9 or higher monster Or special summon a level 9 or higher wind monster, they will be unable to attack wind barrier statue, thus the lock is safe. Plus, we can rip two cards from their hand with Gottems which can sometimes help us avoid things like Dark Ruler No More.</span> <p><span>What if the Opponent is actually playing a Wind Deck?</span></p> <span>Every deck needs a back up strategy in case their stun fails. Unless you're playing Evilswarms and Monarchs, in which case, your back up plan is 'even more stun.' Scraps back up combo gives you up to 3 negates in the case that your opponent is running an actual wind deck, so it is very adaptable. The board will have Admancipator Risen - Dragite, Borreload Savage Dragon, and Apex Avain. I'm pretty sure that will be enough to deal with all the pure wind decks we currently have out there.</span> <p><span>The Deck's Playmakers</span></p> <p><span>(skip if you're already know how scraps work)</span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>Scrap Golem: Poster boy of the deck. Your goal is to summon him as many times as possible to abuse his No-HOPT revival effect. Sadly The last place you want him is in the hand sense two of our cards can summon him from the deck. We run three begrudgingly because if we ran 2 and draw into even 1 of them, our combos are severely hampered.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Factory: the field spell. When a scrap monster is destroyed by a card effect, you can immediately summon another. You will almost always be summoning Scrap Golem. If not, then probably raptor or scrap searcher.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Wyvern: every now and again Konami releases a single, bloated card for a random, old archetype that no one remembers. This either does nothing for the deck cause it needed way more than 1 card (Cloudians) or raises the deck to rouge/local status for a time (Volcanics). This card is the latter. It revives a scrap monster in exchange for a card and acts as a scrap factory in exchange for a card (including your opponent's). This card feels like Sunlight Wolf in a way. On one hand, it's attack and link rating are way too low for it to be a boss monster, but Just like a boss it screams at your opponent ""If I go off, your probably dead."" If you're running out of wyverns in the extra deck, pop a Scrap Goblin and recycle one.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Raptor: Remember that random, single card I was talking about? Scraps got that card twice. It gives you an additional normal summon while setting off cards like factory and searcher, then searchers a card. Scrap raptor is your starter and not opening with it means your turn may be slightly awkward, which is perfectly fine sense Scraps an awkward archetype already.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Chimera: Zero to Hero, just like that. Scrap Raptor being a tuner that gives you a second normal summon is exactly what was needed for this card to be good. If you don't open up with Factory/Raptor, Chimera/Raptor will do just fine sense Raptor searches Factory.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrapyard/Fossil dig: Searches Raptor. That's it, simple and efficient.</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Why I run:</span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>Tri-brigade Fraktall: Scrap searcher is able to be sent to the grave through Fraktall. Doing so before you play any of your scraps will force your opponent to use their ash blossom if they have one, otherwise we can chain scrap searcher's effect as the final effect in most chains of monsters with in our deck, so our cards like Scrap Wyvern, Scrap Factory, and Scrap Raptor will be safe. </span></li>  	<li><span>Fire formation Tenki: Searches Fraktall and can be popped with scrap wyvern instead of factory or a monster. </span></li>  	<li><span>Infinite Impermanence: a literal hand trap is great thing to have. In emergencies we can set this card and pop it with wyvern, which will help save a monster to ensure our plays can continue.</span></li>  	<li><span>Phantazmay: we don't like to see quite a few cards in our hand with this deck. Luckily this card can shuffle those monsters back in to the deck so we can summon them later while giving us better cards to play with.</span></li>  	<li><span>Wynn the wind charmer, Verdant: so you can link away the barrier statue when it's time</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Why I don't run:</span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>Scrap Recycler: Scraps have no good machine monsters. The only way I could add good machine monsters in here without bricking it up any worse is by making the deck less synchro based, which is something I don't personally want to do. Also, Scrap Raptor is searchable by two unlimited spells. That's 9-8 starters practically, any more than that is overkill.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap dragon: You can replace Drident and Chakanine with Scrap dragon and Bagooska if you want. Bagooska is sometimes a nice back up option if wyvern is negated and makes the wind barrier statue much more of a pain to deal with. Drident, however, can allow us to combine both main end boards occasionally, so the deck ends up having a higher ceiling.</span></li>  	<li><span>Rank 9/Second cloud castle: Overkill and too much extra deck devotion.</span></li>  	<li><span>More hand traps: If you feel the absolute need to main 2 more handtraps or the 2 Forbidden Droplets you 'borrowed' from your friend, you can replace One for One and Monster Reborn. They aren't as important as one might think.</span></li>  	<li><span>Accesscode: Borrelsword feels like a much better card in this deck. With 1 scrap golem on your field and your opponent's field empty, you can inflict 8300 damage. With Accesscode, only up to 7600 lp, not enough to otk. Plus if you plan to build the deck IRL when raptor comes out, it's much cheaper, and the deck already has pretty decent board breakers in the form of Scrap Twin Dragon and Wyvern. That's my opinion though. If you prefer Accesscode, well go ahead and run it then, no ones stopping you.</span></li>  	<li><span>Supply squad: Bro wake up, it's 2015 again. In all seriousness though, Grind game decks that destroy monsters during every turn, including their opponent's, can turn this card into a pot of greed, so Fire Kings and Machinas can use this. This is a combo deck that only destroys during their own turn, and they are no longer as good as a grind deck sense they don't have many consistent control options. As result, this card is just to slow for it to be any use.</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Cards I wish I could run:</span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>Trishula</span><span>: </span><span>It is very easy to summon this card in this deck, but sadly XX-Saber Gottoms is just so much easier to use.</span></li>  	<li><span>Adamancipator Signs: Scrap golem is a rock monster. Before scrap raptor was announced I could summon Golem with signs, allowing the deck to somewhat function properly. But with Scrap raptor, we can use scrap factory consistently, so there is no longer a reason to use signs.</span></li>  	<li><span>The tricky: I tested it in the deck, and it was a very interesting card. It could summon itself by sending a monster to the grave, which allowed cards like Searcher, Golem, and Goblin to be brought back later. Plus it was level 5 so I could easily use it for synchros. If scraps do get an additional card soon, I would love for it to be similar to the tricky except with destroying a card instead of sending one</span></li> </ul> <p><span>The Niches each card has</span></p> <p><span>(skip if you want to regret losing to sacred beast that one time)</span></p> <span>Scraps have some weird interactions, so here's a small guide on them:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Scrap storm: if your opponent is about to use Effect Veiler or Impermanence on your monster, this card will be your saving grace. It can target a Scrap monster you control and destroy it, saving them from effect negation, and it draws a card while putting a Scrap Searcher in the grave. On top of that, you can use it on your opponent's turn in combo with Scrap Wyvern by targeting another Scrap monster you control, allowing you to go plus three by using Wyvern's effect and pop a card your opponent controls, but this is a much slower strategy we don't normally use.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Orthros: If your Chimera or Raptor get's hit with a Impermanence or Effect Veiler, You can summon this card while Searcher is in the grave and Scrap Factory is on the field to set off their effects and continue your plays. We run one sense it's searchable by Scrapyard</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Searcher's second effect: Scrap Searcher has a second effect that blows up all your monsters besides Scrap monsters when it's summoned. This may be painful for us, but with Scrap Golem, we summon it to our opponent's field and nuke it. This also get's around cards like I:P Masquerena or Marincess Battle Ocean because Searcher is on their field so it's technically their own card.</span></li>  	<li><span>Scrap Goblin's second effect: It can not be destroyed by battle, but if it is attacked in defense position, it will be destroyed at the end of the battle phase. By summoning it to our opponent's field in attack position, we can attack it as though we're attacking directly. This effect can also come in handy when our opponent uses cards like summon limit or majesty's fiend. For summon limit, because it blows itself up with an effect, we can then summon Scrap Searchers from the grave for tribute fodder next turn for Scrap Golem and then up their field with the Searcher combo from earlier and you can add chimera back to the hand to resummon goblin. As for majesty's fiend? Scrap Goblin's effect is a forced activation, but is an activation none the less, so it won't even blow itself up at the end of the battle phase. I know these are very small niches, but they give the deck some hope it can stall out until you top deck a miracle.</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Mind Set </span></p> <p><span>(also known as the pep talk)</span></p> <span>Listen, if you're looking for a deck that always has some easy pathways, this is not your deck. You will get hands that look terrible. You may just have to tribute summon Golem. You may have to dump Goblin to the grave instead of Searcher just to use Chimera. It's painful when in it happens, but the fun in this deck is overcoming those moments and using those janky plays to your advantage. And the best part: you can constantly evolve this deck. If you don't like the objective of this deck, that's fine, you can run Scrap Recycler and add in stuff like Machina Colonel or the Kaiju engine to make it much more aggressive. Insert Topologic Bomber dragon Along with the Gizmek Orochi for a quick field nuke. Maybe try mixing it with another archetype and see how well that does. There's no 'right' way to build a Scrap deck, this is just my preferred method. So, if you find some interesting tech that gives this deck the 'edge' that it needs, don't be shy to test it. </span>  <span>With that in mind, h</span><span>ere's a video that shows off a couple of decent combos to get you started because I can't be bothered to write them out (sorry for bad sound quality):</span> <p><span>2 Card Combos</span></p> https://youtu.be/5z7qInHse7s"

I think that I will likely be playing BA for the rest of this format now. <h1>About the Deck:</h1> Burning Abyss is a very interesting deck seeing that it has been fairly relevant for it's entire life since back in the duelist alliance era of Yugioh. The BA monsters all work by being able to either special summon themselves from the hand if you control no backrow, or they can gain an effect upon being sent to the graveyard. This along with all the main deck monsters being level 3 dark fiends has lead to the deck being able to be played in a great variety of ways, some opt to use these cards as combo pieces in 3-axis style combo decks (decks that combo using primarily level 3 monsters) such as Phantom Knights and a variant of the current best deck of the format Dragon Link. The BAs have also been used as a very strong control engine, by being able to constantly generate and maintain card advantage by using the ""floating"" effects of the BA monsters to be able to have a constant resource loop in an attempt to out-grind your opponent, this second version of the deck is what the focus of this list. <h1>The Decklist:</h1> <h2>Main Deck:</h2> <h3>Monsters:</h3> 2x <a data-name=""Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This is one of the best cards in this deck, it allows you to revive another BA when sent to the grave, this can be used to great effect as a resource loop alongside their rank 3 monster which we will get to later.  3x <a data-name=""Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This is one hell of a card, being able to float into a BA from deck is just so strong for furthering your plays as well as making just getting you off to the races to begin with.  2x <a data-name=""Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Scarm, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This can search a level 3 dark fiend during the end phase of the turn it was sent to the graveyard, this can allow you to set up plays for the next turn, or give you fodder for some of your trap cards.  2x <a data-name=""Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This is pretty great removal for the deck because sending this off of some of your traps can gain them extra mileage, it's weakness being that it does target.  1x <a data-name=""Alich, Malebranche of the Burning Abys"">Alich, Malebranche of the Burning Abys</a>s - This is a similar card to farfa, but it negates instead of banishes.  1x <a data-name=""Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This can float into summoning a BA from hand, it's not all that great, but good enough to run at 1.  1x <a data-name=""Calcab, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Calcab, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This isn't all that great of a card, but because of the the other control deck running amok in this format, it's good to be running one for when you need it.  3x <a data-name=""Tour Guide From the Underworld"">Tour Guide From the Underworld </a>- This is the best level 3 fiend support card in the game, it just fetches you a level 3 from deck, this can be the most useful card in your deck.  3x <a data-name=""Fiendish Rhino Warrior"">Fiendish Rhino Warrior</a> - This card is mainly used for it's second effect to send a fiend from deck to grave, but it's first effect can be useful at times if you don't want your BAs to blow themselves up.  1x <a data-name=""Absolute King Back Jack"">Absolute King Back Jack</a> - This card is a very useful card in trap heavy decks such as this, seeing as it can stack your deck as well as set a trap from the top of your deck. <h3>Spells:</h3> 1x <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> - This card is really strong since it can insulate you from handtraps as well as be a very good source of interruption on your opponent's turn, but it's at one so you play as many as you can, but right now that's one. (please bring this back to three)  3x <a data-name=""Mask Change II"">Mask Change II </a>- This is a kinda instant win button against most decks that you resolve it against, Dark Law is one hell of a card.  3x <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force</a> - This is really funny in combination with some other cards to make a really funny VFD. <h3>Traps:</h3> 3x <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> - This card just looks at your opponent's card and say boldly and loudly ""NO!"", it's life point cost does not matter much in the modern game, and being able to negate key cards such as a feather duster or the summon of a major combo piece of a deck is just really strong.  3x <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike </a>- This is for the combo decks that Judgement can't handle, mainly monster effects, this along with the next card are also good at securing some plays against big bosses  3x <a data-name=""Fiend Comedian"">Fiend Comedian</a> - This is a very interesting card, most coin-flip cards are just awful, but this one is very interesting seeing as both of it's effects are actually beneficial to you; either you get to banish your opponent's entire grave, or you get to mill cards that could give you advantage in other ways.  3x <a data-name=""Fiend Griefing"">Fiend Griefing</a> - This is kinda similar to the above card, but toned down and without the coin-flip. Sending a BA to the grave to then banish a card in your opponent's grave is very strong right now.  3x <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> - This card can be a great equalizer against decks that like to overextend, just slapping this down and watching as your opponent's whole board disintegrates into nothing is just so good.  3x <a data-name=""Needle Ceiling"">Needle Ceiling</a> - Similar to torrential due to how it can just evaporate a board, this one can be used at any time so long a there are 4 monsters on the field. It is certainly not quite torrential, but it's very good.  3x <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus </a>- This is a very good versatile removal card, the discard can trigger your BAs and getting it  back from the grave has many uses  3x <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick </a>- This is like Back Jack in the way that it lets you set a trap from deck and use it that turn, so it's basically three extra copies of every other trap in the deck. <h2>Extra Deck:</h2> 2x <a data-name=""Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss</a> - This is the key rank 3 of the deck, being able to mill a bunch of cards and float into a recycle is very nice and it what enables most of your plays.  1x <a data-name=""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss </a>- This card is also just amazing; being able to send a level 3 to the grave as well as protecting your BAs is a very useful card to have.  1x <a data-name=""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"">Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal</a> - This is the main ""boss monster"" of this deck if it really had one, the ability to quick effect mill any card is just so good, and so is floating into a BA from the extra deck.  1x <a data-name=""Dante, Pilgrim of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Pilgrim of the Burning Abyss</a> - This is an okay card, the best option to float into with Beatrice's effect and that's about it.  1x <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dark Law"">Masked HERO Dark Law</a> - You summon this with Mask Change II and get free wins against most of the meta right now.  1x <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a> - This is a strong negate that can also protect you from handtraps.  1x <a data-name=""Number 48: Shadow Lich"">Number 48: Shadow Lich</a> - This is useful for a detach during your opponent's turn as well as giving a token for link plays.  1x <a data-name=""Mechquipped Angineer"">Mechquipped Angineer</a> - This is a stepping stone to use astral force on for the next card  1x <a data-name=""Number 67: Pair-a-Dice Smasher"">Number 67: Pair-a-Dice Smasher</a> - This card is VFD, but really funny. I honestly love this card and with a PK deck topping with it, I just had to make it fit.  1x <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> - This is used to close out games as a finisher to go in for lethal.  1x <a data-name=""Topologic Trisbaena"">Topologic Trisbaena </a>- This can be used with some other cards to get rid of your opponent's backrow.  1x <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> - Strong generic removal/interruption.  1x <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> - Can be used to link off the dinomisc or to get rid of tokens your opponent has given to use with <a data-name=""Lost World"">Lost World</a>.  1x <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena </a>- You use this to go into unicorn during your opponent's turn to get an interruption. <h2>Side Deck:</h2> <h3>Monsters:</h3> 3x <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> - This is a good handtrap to combat most of the meta right now <h3>Spells:</h3> 1x <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> - This is a blowout against any other backrow focused deck, and should really be in any side deck. <h3>Traps:</h3> 1x <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order </a>- This is another blowout card that can win you the game on the spot against the right deck.  2x <a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance</a> - This is to help you not get blown out by HFD or anything like that.  3x <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a> - More generic backrow outs, but this can also get rid of/play under order.  3x <a data-name=""Witch's Strike"">Witch's Strike</a> - This is typically considered a bad card, but as of late it seen some play and been kinda great when you can resolve it.  2x <a data-name=""Broken Line"">Broken Line</a> - It's an ok card for going second against decks that play big boss monsters. <h1>The Sacrifices:</h1> Some cards are just too expensive for a more budget focused deck, and some I simply don't really like.  <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a> - This is the best xyz monster in the game, but it's not cheap as a result.  <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> - This is one of the best link monsters in the game, also very pricey  <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity </a>- This is also an insane card that happens to be really expensive  <a data-name=""The dragoon package"">The dragoon package</a> -<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon""> Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> is an insane card, but not only does that come at a cost, it also makes you run quite a few garnets  <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison </a>- Is one of the best traps in the game, however it's not cheap in the slightest. <h1>Potential Techs:</h1> <h2>Predaplant engine:</h2> <span>(3x <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a>, 3x <a data-name=""Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio"">Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</a>, 1x <a data-name=""Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra"">Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</a>, 1x <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>, &amp; 1x DARK LV3 Fiend fusion monster)</span>  This engine gives you a bunch of level three bodies to work with seeing as you have 6 ""starters"" for the engine with one brick and a generically good extender. The problem I face with this is just that it takes your normal summon, and takes up too much space to be really worth it in a slower BA variant. <h2>Phantom Knights Engine:</h2> (1x <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a>, 1x <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a>, 1x <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>, 2x <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a>, &amp; 1x <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a>)  To be honest I love PK Fire as a deck, but seeing as this is a more pure variant, alongside the fact that you are making the deck a fair bit less consistent, you also are running a lot more high impact traps that just do more than fog blade under most cases. <h2>Other BA Cards:</h2> <a data-name=""Barbar, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Barbar, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> - This was used in the topping decklist, however I don't like it simply because it's only real use is to burn your opponent in time, I'd rather just run a name at that point honestly  <a data-name=""Fire Lake of the Burning Abyss"">Fire Lake of the Burning Abyss </a>- This is an okay card, but it does take two BAs to use and it also is just a less generic less powerful torrential or needle ceiling in most cases.  <a data-name=""Virgil, Rock Star of the Burning Abyss"">Virgil, Rock Star of the Burning Abyss</a> - This is also a pretty good card, but it is outclassed by Knightmare Unicorn under most circumstances, the best use for this card would be to use in the tzolkin engine maybe <h2>Other Random Tech Pieces:</h2> <a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a> - This card is very good due to the great amount of disruption, but also play extension it can bring, however, it also can proc BAs at the worst possible time, and if that happens it's not so good.  <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>  - A really strong blowout handtrap against most combo decks, but it doesn't do much else, nor does it completely end the turn of those decks always.  <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter </a>- It's a very good card, but after some testing I think lancea is better  <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> - Another big blowout card against some decks, it is very good, but alongside not being the cheapest (but still doable) a lot of the top decks either don't care about it, or can effectively play around it  <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment </a>- Playing this alongside some choice extra deck cards could be very good, but I'm not sure how good it would be.  <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops </a>- This is a great going second card, but with it at one you don't see it enough for it to matter.  <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a> - Great against dragon link, but I'm not too sure how good a free body and cycling you hand really is. <h1>A Small Playing Guide:</h1> Mostly the play this deck makes aren't super substantial enough to need a combo guide, however there are some card interactions you should know for reference. <h2>Dante and Cir, the Heart &amp; Soul of the Deck:</h2> One of the most basic interactions that the deck makes the most of, for this you need to at first have a cir attached to Dante as material. When Dante is sent to the grave for any reason, you can use cir to bring back Dante and Dante can put cir back in hand. This allows for a resource loop that can gather a ton of advantage over the course of a game to really grind out your opponent. <h2>Fiend Griefing, an Example of Pure Utility:</h2> Fiend Griefing is a card the provides a ton of utility for the deck, being able to mill any fiend to the grave as well as ridding your opponent of valuable grave resources is a very strong thing. The cards you can mill off of this can create either massive swings in advantage for you, or can create additional pieces of disruption that your opponent will then have to deal with. If you want more setup, you can mill graff to fetch any BA from deck, cir to get something from the graveyard, scarm to get a tour guide during the end phase, or in some cases libic to get something out of your hand. To go for the disruption route you can send farfa to banish, alich to negate, or back jack to tutor out a trap from the top of your deck that you can use that turn. <h2>Must Outs! Cards That Create Big Problems:</h2> Some cards in this deck can create massive issues for you opponent, forcing them to use their outs on it, these are cards like Dark Law. With how strong effects that can lock your opponent from the graveyard are, if you drop one of these you basically get to say ""If you want to play this turn, use your removal to out this"". If your opponent doesn't have an answer for these cards, they can be huge problems, but these can also be used to bait out any negations or other outs that may be otherwise used on other pieces of your deck. <h2>Big Tempo Swings with Gossip Shadow:</h2> Gossip Shadow is another great utility card, being able to negate monsters from the hand or field can lead to some devastating pushes in tempo a fair amount of the time. However, be aware that this negation comes at a disadvantage in being able to let your opponent draw a card, meaning that you should not use this on one for one trades, you basically have to use this against big haymaker cards, or cards that go into an inherent minus to either gain a large tempo swing or to set plays up. This draw effect does have some upsides too, such as not negating the activation itself meaning it will waste any hard OPT effects, the draw also applies for you too, so that can also be a big swing for you. <h2>Against The Meta:</h2> Any deck worth it's salt has to at least be aware of how it stacks up against the current heavy hitters in the format, so that is what we will be exploring next. <h3>Dragon Link:</h3> This deck is currently the king of this format, but this deck's playstyle is something that dragons aren't fully equipped to deal with, yes they can hit some of your monsters and maybe a single trap, but set five pass is just something the deck can't always deal with.  Cards to side in: <ul>  	<li>Lancea</li>  	<li>Witch's Strike</li>  	<li>order</li> </ul> <h3>Eldlich:</h3> This deck has a fairly reasonable match-up against this deck, because of all the graveyard hate you play it can steamroll Eld in several cases, but you will never out grind eldlich it's the best control deck for a reason, to win this match-up you HAVE to use one of your unfair haymakers like Dark Law to stop their recursion all together.  Cards to side in: <ul>  	<li>lancea</li>  	<li>anti-spell</li>  	<li>waking the dragon</li>  	<li>order</li>  	<li>all backrow removal</li> </ul> <h2>Dogmatika/Invoked/Shaddoll:</h2> I'm grouping these decks together because they have a lot of the same weaknesses as each other, as well as all three being blended in with each other frequently. These decks do rely a lot on the graveyard, as well as key cards they have to resolve throughout the course of their plays, if you can hit those two aspects of the deck, then you are in good shape.  Cards to side in: <ul>  	<li>order</li>  	<li>backrow removal</li>  	<li>anti-spell</li>  	<li>Witch's strike</li> </ul> <h2>Dino DNA:</h2> Misc is a broken card, but this deck does have ways to still try to interact with dinos, for instance misc does not also block effects from the graveyard, so bread and butter traps like griefing and comedian still can give your opponent trouble, also gossip shadow can hit the as it activates from the hand if need be. Misc also only protects from activated effects, this means anything continuous can also get the job done.  Cards to side: <ul>  	<li>lancea</li>  	<li>order</li>  	<li>anti-spell</li>  	<li>waking the dragon</li> </ul> <h1>How to Make Budget Work:</h1> I should start with the standard definition of budget for Yugioh decks, the price range for a budget deck is around $100 to $150 for both main and extra deck (not incuding side deck). This deck does meet those criteria. The main point I wanted to touch on is that budget deck are going to be worse than decks without those same price limitations if they try to do the same thing, so instead of trying to find alternatives for those really expensive cards, it's better to try something different that maybe not as many decks are prepared for. <h1>Edits &amp; Why I Made Them:</h1> Back Jack to one - I did this because I never felt like it really came up at more than one  Cherubini to one - I did this because I almost never actually go into it and I needed more extra deck space  Cutting fortune tune - I never once actually went into it, on paper it's a really good card, but it just never came up.  Cutting cicada king - this card never once came up at all, so I cut it.  Adding rubic and the synchro package - I'm trying something different, and if it does not work out as I hope, I'll probably cut it.  cutting the synchro package - tour guide doesn't let you synchro summon with the card you summon off of it, so I was stupid and dumb  added back cicada king and put in some more rank threes - I suddenly have more extra space, soooo I added some more rank 3s.  Side deck overhaul - So the reason I changed the side so much is that after some testing, most of it never came up, so I changed things around.  Cutting Broken Line out of the main deck - I needed space for my new funny engine, so I cut one of the less impactful cards I play.  Cutting Karma Cut - I wanted to play three of each of the solemns and needed to cut a few cards.  Pair-A-Dice stuff: I love this card so much and now that it has been proven to work with decks that work with rank 3s I just had to play it. <h1>Conclusion:</h1> I'm really happy to see BA being a successful deck in the current meta. Seeing one of my favorite decks duke it out with the likes of Dragon Link and Eldlich is just such a great thing, but I wanted to bring a version of the deck that you can reasonably buy. Forgoing some strong staples is tough, but the deck still is very good. BA is one of the decks that keeps me playing this awful game and to see that it can still hold up after all this time is just amazing."

The Sky Galloping is there for the ultra poly then spiral fusion when you draw it. One overlooked interaction is that if you give your opponent ""Gateway to Chaos"" with ""Set Rotation,"" they will not be able to activate it and field spells will be shut down for the rest of the duel. Feel free to take out the link 4s. I think I went into borreload once, but I just needed spots in the extra, so maybe stuff for the Dogmatica match up. Constructive feedback is greatly appreciated (keep in mind I'm playing to a budget still + the hand traps I own and want the deck fairly pure)."

It gives more consistency for distributing A-Counters and it solves the main problem the deck initially had involving cards like <strong>Alien Ammonite</strong> and <strong>Alien Mars</strong>. If there were better reptile starters in the game, then this deck would be a solid casual deck. I mean at this point it already is but you don't always open a hand that immediately does something. This deck aims to go second, but there are cards in the archetype that makes going first a good choice also.  <strong>Alien Mother</strong> is a solid choice going second. She steals anything she destroys which means you have free link material for things like <strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong> and <strong>Underworld Goddess</strong>. <strong>Alien Overlord</strong> is another solid card going second due to how easily it can spread A-Counters, but you might want to side 1 out going first if you don't see yourself able to make explosive link plays. 3 <strong>Nihil</strong> for grave set-up and it can search <strong>Snake Lily</strong>. 1<strong> Alien Telepath</strong> since its a good form of Spell/Trap removal for the deck. 3<strong> Alien Buster</strong> which gives more removal and A-Counters. 3 <strong>Alien Kid</strong> since he fuels <strong>Ze'loor</strong>. 1<strong> Alien Mars</strong> for continuous effects I guess. 3 <strong>Alien Dog</strong> which is an extender and more A-Counters. 3 <strong>Ammonite</strong> which gets you to<strong> Gol'gar</strong> or <strong>M-Frame</strong>. 1 <strong>Yamoimori</strong> which is simply a way to pop <strong>M-Frame</strong> and set-up for <strong>Echidna</strong>.  Spell and Traps are simple. 3 <strong>Code A Ancient Ruins</strong> since its a source of A-Counters and it can be looped due to being a soft opt with multiple <strong>Gol'gar</strong> which gives more link material. 3 <strong>""A"" Cell Recombination Device</strong> for consistency and A-Counters and grave set-up. 3 <strong>Mysterious Triangle</strong> for removal and extension. 3 <strong>Snake Lily</strong> as grave set-up and extension. 1 <strong>Snake Rain</strong> which could realistically be replaced with something like <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> or even <strong>Reptilianne Lamia</strong> if you're that kind of person. 2 <strong>Droplet</strong>. 3 <strong>Prosperity</strong>. 1 <strong>Mass Hypnosis</strong> which is<strong> Mind Control</strong> for 3.  Extra Deck. 1<strong> </strong><b>Zeus</b>. 2 <strong>King of the Feral Imps</strong>. 2 <strong>Gol'gar</strong> which is removal and he can loop <strong>Ancient Ruins</strong>. 1 <strong>Underworld Goddess</strong>. 1 <strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong>. 1 <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>. 2 <strong>Ze'loor</strong> which is <strong>Bagooska</strong>, a searcher, and an additional normal summon for <strong>Ammonite</strong>. 2 <strong>Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame</strong>. 1 <strong>Reptilianne Echidna</strong> as something to link into and for maybe 1 or 2 searches. 1 <strong>Clara &amp; Rushka</strong> if you desperately need to link off 1 normal summon.  Side Deck. 2<strong> Nibiru</strong>. 3 <strong>Phantazmay</strong> which is back in the format due to <em><strong>Dragon Link</strong></em> and <em><strong>Prank-Kid</strong></em>. 2 <strong>Dark Ruler</strong>. 3 <strong>""A"" Cell Scatter Burst</strong>. It is not your best option for A-Counters, but it does set-up things like <strong>Mass Hypnosis</strong>. 3 <strong>Planet Pollutant Virus</strong> which is interruption and free A-Counters. 2 <strong>Mass Hypnosis</strong> to side in going first."

All to the banish realm! This deck has the potential of ridiculous HP and damage with minimal e","This entire deck built around banishing your own cards to build up insane damage and HP, but to also banish the opponent's cards and ultimately their entire deck.  Banishing your own cards for crazy damage through Necroface, Eater of Millions and Gren Maju. And a ridiculous amount of HP with Soul Absorption. Soul Absorption helps to alleviate the necessary damage from taking 3k damage to activate Inferno Tempest. You can use Battle fader (BF) and Swift Scarecrow (SS) and Kaijus to force this, with the stronger kaiju on their side (Try to use one 3k damage kaiju on their side and one on your side as well). With this, you can attack with 0 attack from either BF or SS and take 3k damage to activate Inferno tempest from your hand. PLEASE NOTE, that if you want to activate Inferno Tempest by taking opponent damage during their turn, Inferno Tempest needs to be set, which will still activate and work during their turn.  Inferno Tempest and D.D. Dynamite is the crux of this build, as once you have activated Inferno Tempest first and then D.D. Dynamite, most opponents will be at your mercy, with no monsters and possibly decked out with the addition of Necroface ability. Generally don't set D.D. Dynamite until u activate Inferno Tempest and then set it, as it will activate at the beginning of the very next turn (which is hella nice), just to be on the safe side.  The main con with this build is that you have the possibility of banishing essential or necessary cards, and or decking yourself out. But don't fret as there are many ways to win with this deck, that has the potential of crazy high damage and HP with Gren Maju and Soul Absorption.  Another con, could be that your stuck with either less or exactly 3300 HP left, depending whether u want to use Kaijus or not. In which u won't be able to activate Inferno Tempest, so hopefully, Soul Absorption comes in handy then. And finally, there is the main con for having 60 cards, is that your hand can completely brick or in my experience for some reason, u get 3 of the same god damn card (For me its 3 Inferno Tempests or Keep getting Kaiju when I actually want Kaiju Slumber).  All the other cards are just fodder but help keep you alive and clear the field whenever needed until you get what u need.  In my experience in using this deck, is to just activate Inferno Tempest as earliest as possible, and then just hope that Necroface ultimately decks out the opponent out. Having at least one monster in hand or on the field first is important too, plus if you have actually nearly decked yourself out, just hope to god to pick up a Necroface and go for a full restart ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Since banishing is what this deck works around, having 60 cards is kind of necessary. you can bring it down to maybe 50, but you only increase decking yourself out before being able to achieve anything  I hope, that if you do give this a try, it works out. As this is the first deck that I have published, open for legitimate criticism, and welcome new ideas. I have built 7 versions of this deck and this one has had the greatest success.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

I love their artwork and concept that they only gain their effects when they are special summoned by the effect of another GB monster.  You cant play GBs like in the 2008s however, it is possible with cards like Mystic Mine. Yes I know, Mystic Mine bad but you don't stall out your opponent to death in this deck and it is more being used as a dark ruler. Also, you have access to pop your own Mystic Mine with Gladiator Beast Gyzarus.  Defensive Tactics in the side deck because I like the artwork.  &nbsp;  <strong>The Ancient Warrior Engine</strong>: Because this deck wants to go 2nd and because Ancient Warriors are my favorite Archetype in the history of Yugioh, I felt like that this is a good addition to Gladiator Beasts. You play<strong> 2x Guan Yun</strong>, who is bascially a Pankratops and <strong>1x Lu Feng</strong> who is the Garnet of this deck, however it is not the end of the world if you draw him (similar to <strong>speedroid taketomborg</strong>). Lu Feng is a free extender, as you want to search him with the link Monster <strong>Double Dragon Lords</strong>, however if you end up on the link monster and Lu Feng (which is not hard at all) that is still a good board to end on. I didnt include cards like <strong>Sun Mou</strong> because Gladiator Beasts need their normal summon.  &nbsp;  <strong>Some cards I didnt include on purpose: </strong>  <strong>Gladiator Rejection:</strong> Bad if you draw multiple copies of, isn't searchable and wanted to play a more slower version so....  <strong>Gladiator Beast's Respite:</strong> Did include it in my deck, however the deck size with this card was at 42, so cutting all three of them cards and add an Upstart gets its job done, too.  <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>: <em>Defensive Tactics</em> better than Dark Ruler ( no debating)  <strong>Gladiator Beast Andabata: Useless</strong>  <strong>Harpie's feather duster</strong>: Im budget friendly, also <em>Evenly Matched</em> is already in the main  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

A casual fun deck.,"<span class=""style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"">With this you really want to go first and set up Rafale and Wiz negates and preferrably also have some handtraps. The most important handtrap of the deck is probably Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit as it ran trigger Folgo's effect on your opponent's turn and get you 1 or 3 draws, which can be some further hadntraps to disrupt opponent. Such as Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. The deck is really vulnerable to disruption. If you don't have Rookie Fur Hire, infinite impermanence alone can just prevent you from being able to do anything. It was hard to fit any other archtypes into this deck because the basic first turn Fur Hire combo needs you to have basically two fur hires + Beat in hand to search Rafale, then link summoning Folgo and special summoning Wiz from deck. That's why I also have Pot of Extravagance even though it prevents me sometimes from drawing with folgo. I need more cards n hand to pull of the combo more consistently. I tried to find any good one card combos that could get folgo out more easily but couldn't think of any. So I just made a pure Fur Hire deck. I tried Tri-Brigades for example but didn't really like them. Non-Fur Hire cards just take too much space in hand and cause bricks.</span>  Replays:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ2AnzuQVsI"

The strategy is to use negate effects to deter your opponent from playing their game... sort of like control. The main card of this deck is <img src=""file:///C:/Users/ryker/Downloads/red_eyes_dark_dragoon_by_kraus_illustration_de9ldiq-fullview.jpg"" alt=""Red Eyes Dark Dragoon"" />, you would want to get him on the field as soon as you can. His effect must be used wisely since it is once per turn. The spells in this deck allow you to draw and that is a side purpose. Mystic mine and field barrier protect you from attacks since the current meta that focuses on swarming. The Nobleman helps banish traps and spells and banishes all traps named like it. Judgment of Anubis helps protect your spells and traps, and so does Ultimate Providence; The card is beastly since its a speed 3 and a counter. The side deck is self explanatory, hand traps and backboard destroyer. The Solemns' are for further negation and destruction. Card destruction and Pot of Benevolence are there to aid and are semi necessary if you'd like. The extra deck has Number 39: Utopia to negate attacks. Bujinki and the rest of the knightmares are fillers but one of each are still good if you plan to use their effects. Link Kuriboh helps and Dark Dragoon. I am constantly changing this deck to play better. My main goal is to attack the current meta and people's playstyle. Honestly, I am fed up with decks that rely on combos. Its become a little annoying to see people memorizing combos instead of building their own deck and succeeding that way. Call this deck what you want, but It has some thought put into it. Sadly, this deck will not appear in the Meta-Boards."

The Field Spell negates the effects of monsters on either side of the field if they don't have the same ATK &amp; DEF, as long as you have Special Summoned 10 Machine monsters with the same ATK &amp; DEF. I found that Deskbots are extremely good at swarming the field so you can easily get 10 Special Summons, and (thankfully) all have the same 500/500 ATK &amp; DEF. This is a way I found to get to the win condition but is in no way the best way, so if you have any other way to get the 10 counters, please share the combo line so that this deck can be fine-tuned.  The best combo line I found is Deskbot 003 summon 001 go into Halq, Halq summon 001, go into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens then summon both copies of 001 from GY and turn 1 001 and all tokens into Deskbot Jet. Jet pop a Deskbot monster to Special Summon 1 from Deck and from there try to get the last 1-2 counters you dont have by whatever you have in yout hand or field. This all has to be done while having the Gizmek Field Spell face-up ON YOUR FIELD."

Plunge your opponent into an endless spiral of pain! OwO Los dragones han creado su arma definitiva. ,"Deck creado por: Darklab  <strong>Objetivo:</strong> Invocar a Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons y Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon para crear un loop de burn infinito! OwO  <strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong>  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  https://youtu.be/_1ARtuZ6qDU  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  <strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>  Al final se necesitará varios dragones, pero éstos son fáciles de spamear en la baraja. Siempre la idea es ir por Romulus y los Guardragon para acceder a sus efectos de spam y traer a Black Metal Dragon para obtener a los Red-Eyes.  <strong>Extenders para iniciar el combo</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Absorouter Dragon: </strong>Se invoca solo si controlamos un Rokket, lo cual es sencillo. Aún así, siempre se puede enviar al cementerio para añadirnos un Rokket a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Noctovision Dragon: </strong>Se invoca solo si invocamos otro dragón de modo especial. Además, cuando se va del campo, nos da un robo!</li>  	<li><strong>Black Dragon Collapserpent: </strong>Se invoca gratis removiendo un monstruo de luz, además nos trae a Wyverburster.</li>  	<li><strong>White Dragon Wyverburster:</strong> Se invoca gratis removiendo un monstruo de oscuridad, además nos trae a Collapserpent.</li>  	<li><strong>Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm:</strong> Se invoca gratis del cementerio, por lo que es el target preferido de Foolish Burial y Dragon Shrine.</li>  	<li><strong>Starliege Dragon Seyfert: </strong>Una invocación normal excelente, ya que con su efecto tendremos en mano a Collapserpent o Wyverburster.</li>  	<li><strong>Rokket Tracer: </strong>Normal Summon de último recurso, además de tener excelentes interacciones con Section Boot y Absorouter. Y es tuner!</li>  	<li><strong>Black Metal Dragon: </strong>Se usa de Normal Summon. Nos añade un Red Eyes, lo cual nos permite usar el Rokket Tracer como extender.</li>  	<li><strong>One For One: </strong>Nos trae a Black Metal Dragon.</li>  	<li><strong>Dragon Shrine y Foolish Burial: </strong>Ver Darkwurm.</li>  	<li><strong>Monster Reborn: </strong>Nos da un cuerpo adicional.</li>  	<li><strong>Chaos Space: </strong>Efecto similar a Seyfert, pero sin gastar la Normal Summon.</li>  	<li><strong>Quick Revolve: </strong>Nos trae a Rokket Tracer gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Guardragon of the World Legacy: </strong>Efecto similar a Monster Reborn, pero además nos permite mover a un dragón (por lo general un Guardragon).</li>  	<li><strong>Borrel Regenerator: </strong>Nos permite reciclar a Rokket Tracer, por lo que se le puede usar antes como extender.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene un burn infinito, por lo que no importa cuántos LP tenga el oponente, igual perderá.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene tan sólo 1 garnet (Red Eyes Fusion), que incluso es posible devolver con Unicorn.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene extenders muy poderosos, por lo que es posible que sobren recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck depende de varias adiciones específicas a la mano.

You should really read the further description by clicking th","Hi! I made a new deck.  You may look at this decklist, and perhaps scoff (lol), or at least think this deck is sub-par, but, I believe I can show you how this can be an incredible and powerful deck.  Or it may be crap, in which case, screw me.  If you don't know me <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/best-of-blue-eyes-re-make/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/best-of-blue-eyes-re-make/</a> and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/amazing-ancient-gears/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/amazing-ancient-gears/</a> are some of the better decks I've made. Please, check them out (or do not, I am not a beggar)  As for this deck, let's get into it for real.  Your end goal is to cause Armageddon or just the plain old end, with any of your chaos emperor dragon's. Now, I don't like archetypes, I'm not sure why, so there are plenty cards in here that are just here, some people don't like that, but I hope some of you can appreciate that. It's not just a decklist copied and pasted from the internet, and it's not using the same 4 words or same 2 monsters. Two other monsters you can use to take out you opponents, are Ma'at, and Mythical beast master Cerberus. Now, this deck was gone for sort of an Egyptian theme (vaguely mind you), I picked out some more Egyptian themed powerful monster's, without going Egyptian god or Exodia, or even the creator route. Ma'at is summoned using a light dragon, and a light fairy, for the dragon part of that, we have Radiant Vouirescensce (perhaps spelled incorrectly) which will also come in use for other monsters. For the fairy we have out Parshaths, not counting the dark counterpart, and Honest, again, dismissing the dark version. Honest can be moved back and forth between the hand, and onto the field once per turn, so you can have it attack you opponent if given the chance, then in your main phase two, bring it back to your hand if you have a stronger monster on the field as well, and you don't want honest to be vulnerable. On top of that, a monster of the Light attribute, can absorb it's enemies attack, using honest's effect while in the hand, and this is all the same for dark honest as well. Both honest and dark honest work well with the strongest members of this deck, the chaotic kings, Ma'at, and even the mythical beasts, powering them up, and being the right attributes to help summon at least some, if not most of them. Airknight and Darknight parshath as well, although to a slightly smaller extent, and they get better with neo parshath. While were almost on the topic of mythical beasts, let's jump all the way there, because some people might be confused as to their addition to this deck. Why are they here? Because their cool, powerful, easy to summon, and one of them is a jackal, an animal famous for being an Egyptian creature. Getting Mythical beast master Cerberus should be simple, just, like, draw it, and add it to your pendulum zone, when hopefully your Chaos dragon isn't there. Next up, with it's effect, send it to the extra deck, and bring forth your King Jackal, which can use it's effect, and we'll get to see our old friend Master Cerberus once again, this time on the field, able to destroy your enemies, which is boosted by the many spell cards within the deck, including Power of the guardians. Some spells include Gold sarcophagus, good if you need a specific card, which you often will, Twin twisters, to get rid of those pesky trap/spells your opponent has, raigeki, old school, but watch your opponents monsters be a annihilated, and card advance, since it's nice to know what's coming up ahead, and it works wonders for Ma'at's ability, so you don't just have to guess. I would recommend old summoning Ma'at if you have or used card advance and know what's coming up. Finally, chaos time. Radiant Vouirescensce can be summoned, sending more of it to the grave, one of which can become dark, and boom, immediate way to summon our chaos emperors. Chaos creator and Valkery also help, being of the same archetype. With envoy, or any really of your chaos dragons, destroy everything on the field and in the hand, just obliterate your opponent, and then strike. Simple. Chaotic. Real quick, let me acknowledge the triple sticks, Gather your mind, and Hyena. Both of them are for deck shortening, and yes, when it comes to it, stalling. Lot's of specific cards are needed in this deck, so using gather your mind and hyena can make the amount of cards you need to look through minimal. Also, both have vaguely Egyptian themes.  I believe that's it, it's better to play it, test this deck on Duel Nexus, or at home with your own cards, at a card store (stay safe though), test it, edit it, leave suggestions in the comments, tell me what I did wrong, what I did right, what you think of the deck, and feel free to check out my others as well. Thank you very much for reading if you've come this far, and have a good day."

People are hating on KONAMI for hitting drytrons so hard but there was a reason they did it!! Diviner of the Heralds is officially announced to be TCG and it is coming via LIOV with the Fafnir XYZ monster!!! This changes everything for drytrons and will (trust me) make them meta again. Just opening alpha + zeta (or literally anything that gives you access to them like fafnir, nova and emergency) can give you 4 ultimateness negates and a unicorn during the opponent's turn and EVEN if your board were to get dark ruler’ed (not a word), you will still have 2 orange light negates in hand as backup! I think KONAMI limited benten for a reason and this is definitely it! Just a little longer for LIOV to get released and it is worth the wait for sure, so don’t sell your drytron cards yet my fellow drytron players!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The combos and deck explanation can be found on my youtube video. </span>  <span>Link - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZSsbYs5Cqs</a></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Thanks, and I’ll see you soon!! :D</span>"

That takes a minimum of just 6 monsters and I:P can link itself Verte and the summon from Spheres, for either of our Link 5's.  If u want to play LV10 Turbo, just cut the Dark Dragoon stuff, for 2 more LV7 and LV10. Maybe also 1 LV5 to send off Pile and search LV7. Basically just get Saryuja to summon LV7 for you and skip the LV ups lol.  I find this version more fun, jamming as many extenders and link 2 bosses as I can. Have fun!! =]  &nbsp;  In lieu of a strict combo guide, I offer this checklist of things to do on any turn:  BLACK METAL / SEYFERT - This is the best starter, especially because you can, uhh, start searching your Red-eyes fusion stuff if you loop Black Metal then shuffle them back with Saryuja for extra advantage LOL. the line goes Black Metal &gt; Striker Dragon &gt; REDMD &gt; Black Metal &gt; Romulus. Seyfert does the same thing, but doesnt get us the extra plus.  ROMULUS - This card gets Ravine which sends Absorouter, which gets Tracer. If you draw either Ravine or Absorouter, just skip Romulus or use Ravine to discard Absorouter. Next you can summon Tracer using Boot Sector Launch.  SARYUJA - So, to make Saryuja here we actually need 1 extender after the Romulus play. We can keep playing without one, by using Tracer to pop Boot Sector, but that locks us into Darks, Saryuja and Spheres are both Light. If you have an extender, summon Elpy next to Striker then use Elpy to get a 4th monster.  ELPY - My favorite Elpy target is Seyfert, which is why I only play the 1, but Tempest, Pile Armed, and Black/Darkness Metal all do the same basic thing. To avoid getting locked into dragons, link off Elpy into Saryuja, then after using Pisty late in the combo (ideally for Tracer or just Rokket Synchron if you already used it) link that off for Spheres. If you make Spheres first, you have to use both Guardragons before Saryuja, to link them off, or go into Borrelend early.  PILE ARMED - Pile Armed Dragon either searches Armed Dragon Flash, or draws 1, its nuts. It makes a great starter or extender at any time, as long as you have the send for it. Any Armed Dragon, Tempest or Absorouter are the best discards. Otherwise, Saryuja is the best way to summon it, letting you get the plus without discarding.  TEMPEST - This along with Pile Armed are the best ways for us to get to our Synchros. This is one of the last monsters you re-summon at the end of you combos when you need that one last non-link for I:P or Verte. Tempest is also the alternate send off Ravine if you draw Absorouter.  CHAOS RULER - If you know you have the Light and Dark to resummon it (pretty much if you got to Seyfert) you should always go for this card. You can make it with Tracer+a chaos dragon, or Synchron+Pile Armed/Tempest. The excavate greatly helps to find Tempest and the add will usually hit Veiler, or a Rokket, but can hit Noctovision at best! The resummon is what makes it really strong, and if you pull it off should let you end on Hot Red D and Dark Dragoon with ease.  Once you do all of that, it's time to link away or synchro whatever is left, ideally ending on Heiratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres, I:P Masquerena, Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, and Hot Red Dr. Abyss. With this, I:P can link itself, Verte, the monster Spheres will summon, and one opponent's monster for Underworld Goddess of the Closed World, or for Borrelend Dragon.  &nbsp;"

The main problem was a lack of interaction; too many floodgates meant that I was just sitting there and waiting to get Twin Twistered'. This is a new build which has more traps for interaction, like Lost Wind, and I included Trap Trick to dig them out more consistently without having to rely on the opening hand luck as much. I included general stun cards like Inspector Boarder and TCBOO, and Cyber-Stein is there to turbo out Dragoon for negates or an Invoked."

Come and meet him.,"<span>The idea of this deck is to make semi-infinite summons in order to fill the field with the synchro Shien and, with support for negation (Number 106) and to increase the attack of the warriors (Ferocious Flame Swordsman). So having an excellent field in the first round to block your opponent's moves. Playing in the second round can guarantee an OTK, but you are more likely to be blocked by your opponent, which can end up breaking the combo.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Use Shogun to search for the ""Gateway of the Six"" or another card that can place ""Bushido Counters"" to facilitate the combo. The counters will help you to search and summon the ""Kizan"" or the ""Grandmaster"" to recover the spent counters and continue the combo.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Use Isolde to summon a ""Fuhma"" straight from the deck to the field so that you can do another Shien synchro. If you are lucky with your hand, it is possible to make three Shiens. Since the normal thing about this combo is that you leave two in the field.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The other monsters (Number 106 and F. Flame Swordsman) you can normally summon by following the combo. The first using two ""Kizans"" and the second using one ""Kizan"" and one ""Grandmaster"".</span>  <span>Tip: Never summon monsters that you will not remove from the field in the link zone that Shogun points to. Well, Shogun assists you by adding counters when you call the ""Six Samurai"" in your link zone. Only at the end, when you are finishing the combo with ""Number 106"" and ""F.

(note: I'm avoiding some cards like Raptor because I plan on playing this IRL, but I might update this w/ Raptor once it comes out.) Anyway, this deck is focused around Machina combos using Scraps. The main idea is to shit out monsters to the board using Machina SS conditions, along with normal summoning Recycler to send Rosenix. Rosenix gets a free token for plays as well, which i sgreat.

In short it is a Blackwing deck about getting Synchro's out at a fast rate, it is kind of old school with ""Bora The Spear"", ""Sirocco The Dawn"" and cards like Gale and Fiendish Chain. But with modern additions like Assault Blackwing Kunai, Decay The Ill Wind.</span>  Main focus of the deck: fast Synchro Summons and Destruction  <strong>Important/useful Combos</strong>: Classics as Bora + Gale insta. Synchro LVL: 7 or an easy LVL: 8 Synchro via Decay + with most of the other Blackwings. Nearly every Blackwing that can Special summon itself for a very fast Synchro.                                                          ""Black Whirlwind"" the most powerful search card for Blackwings for when you can't Special on the 1st Turn or anytime else. Sirocco's effect for  a impressive ATK  boost for 1 other Blackwing, but locks you into attacking with the powerd up monster only.  <strong>Other Powerful tools</strong>: ""Icarus Attack"" a very useful card with the low cost of tributing 1 of your Monster for destroying up to 2 cards, and getting another Blackwing out is easy thus making the cost almost 0. ""Sirocco"" + ""Bora"" + other ""Blackwing"" on the field with ""Kalut The Moon Shadow""' effect from your hand for a possible OTK or at least severe damage. ""Allure Of Darkness"" lets you draw 2 cards by banishing 1 Dark Attribute monster from your hand, that makes it 100% better then ""Cards for Black Feathers"" which prohibits you from Special Summoning for that turn.  <strong>Last but not least Synchros</strong>: this deck consists of a wide range of Synchro monsters which includes, Classics as ""Blackwing Armor Master"" and ""Stardust Dragon"" also powerful cards like ""Blackwing Raikiri The Rain Shower"" with it you can destroy up to 4 cards per turn if you got a full set of 5 Blackwings on the field, which is quite easy to achieve. Other notable cards are, ""Red Dragon Archfiend"" for blowing up the opponents defending monsters or ""Blackwing Full Armor Master"" for dealing with effect monsters.  thats it I hope this deck is of any use for this is my first deck I will upload on here, it will  definitely not be my last one! feel free to rate this deck or you may explain to me and everyone else things that could be changed or what I missed.

I think Phantom Knights are better in the current Meta game. Sure it wont win any matches, but it is very versatile. In my opinion Phantom Knights can hold on to Eldlichs resource game, to a certain degree, the matchup against Dino is evenly matched, but yeah Dragon Link is just unplayable most of the time. Against rogue decks it it is very good, you have a good otk you can pull up many disruptions on first turn and can wall up against heavy otk decks (most of the rogue decks just can set up a good otk) like Cyber Dragons.  As you can see I play two break swords and two cherubini, I do this for more recurtion and resource management. Also, you can see I don´t play Dragun, if you want to play the package it makes the deck better, but I believe Dragun should be banned it is a game breaking card and I do not want to support this card. I know its paradox to say something like this while playing Zeus, but you have to play some of these game breaking cards in order to compete and I think Dragun is even more toxic.  So obviously you can change so cards here, I like the deck how I build it, but I want to recommend so change, first obviously the dragun package, secondly ou can play farfa and take out the foolish and thirdly, you can play leviair for more consistency.  Please let me know if you like it or not and why, so we can develop our deck building skills."

Use cards like Dark beckoning beast and opening of the spirit gates to get umbral horrors like Unform and Will 'o the wisp on field easier and bring them back to set up into rank 4 plays or link plays. Umbrals also make use of the numeron engine to activate rank-up magic numeron force from the deck or to use numeron calling to summon the Numeron gate xyz monsters then go into Megaclops. This make accessing number c101 and the umbrals boss monster number c104 much easier and numeron wall is a spirit gate target its self.  &nbsp;  Other not worthy cards are the sided rank 2 engine using ghost and red blossoms from underfoot which is a 0/0 fiend and can help with retrieving used number xyz monster which can be ranked up after being special summoned from the graveyard using red blossoms effect.

Hence the new side-deck. Deck is <em>very</em> consistent. Does best going first but does fine going 2nd if you lose the dice roll. LOTS of flexibility in play style.  <strong><u>End Boards</u></strong> with best to worst scenarios (worst still pretty good stall): <ul>  	<li><strong>Option A: </strong>End on Simorgh + Mist Valley + Doom or Rugal &amp; Feather Storm set face-down.</li>  	<li><strong>Option B: </strong>Simorgh + Mist Valley, Hysteric Sign face-down as bait to be popped to search Feather Storm + Channeler &amp; Harpist</li>  	<li><strong>(rarely) Option C: </strong>End with Shuraig, Revolt, Warning Point, or other backrow as bait</li>  	<li><strong>(worst case) Option D: </strong>1 face-up Wind Wing-Beast (Harpie, Nervall, or Barrier) + 1 Feather Storm  to stall for next turn.</li> </ul> <span><strong>Bait:</strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Monsters: Harpist, Kit, Nervall</li>  	<li>Spell: Hysteric Sign, Stand-off, Rendezvous</li>  	<li>Trap: Feather Storm</li> </ul> <span><strong>Side Deck:</strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Simorgh cards are great for Spell/Trap interaction.

Dragoon</li>  	<li>Zerofyne: Dark ruler in a card +ATK boost &amp; still deal damage same-turn</li>  	<li>Doom Eagle: Tri-brigade friendly, clears out opponent graveyard sources, + OTK enabler</li>  	<li>Almiraj: Brick help - sends to grave Nervall, Kit, and (at worst) Bird of Beginning</li>  	<li>WHY? <strong><em>Warning Point instead of Imperm</em></strong>: Going against a deck like Dragon-Link where even if you have a great board they can break it 2nd turn and still go-off. Slows down their summoning &amp; attacks. You can side Imperms if you know you're going 2nd though. Up to you.</li> </ol> <span><strong>Possible Variations:</strong></span> <ol>  	<li>Like brigade better? Run less harpies but still keep some essentials: Perfumer, egotist, Harpie Lady (any variant), Harpist, Conductor, &amp; (of course) Feather Storm.</li>  	<li>Want more Simorgh? Swap out harpies for some birbs.</li>  	<li>Want more beasts? Sub-in Rescue cat, Kalantosa, &amp; Valerifawn.</li>  	<li>Finally, you can always also swap another Simorgh for the second Shuraig. I'm still trying both and neither is necessarily 'better'. Shuraig is beneficial when destroyed though, Simorgh is not.</li> </ol> <span><strong>SUMMARY</strong></span>  If you love Harpies but hate their death by hand-trap &amp; brick-city weaknesses, Harpie + Brigade is for you. You can easily search  &amp; run 3-of the best Trap (imo) of all time: Feather Storm. AND, you can use destruction &amp; banishing from opponents as an advantage!"

Anyway, Gren Maju is a fun OTK deck that doesn't require much effort or intelligence. Pretty simply, you banish tons of cards using Eater, Orochi, Shifter, etc to get a ton of fuel for Gren Maju to go to inane levels of strength and beat through anything and finish off the game fucking easy. I leaned into Dangers! a bit more heavily since I have lots of Danger! cards IRL and I plan on building this IRL, so.  Anyways, Dangers! help a ton with bodies on board and digging through the deck to get Maju, as nothing can search for Maju except for a random XYZ that I opted not to play. I also included a very s p i c y tech here- the Sangan engine. You may be wondering- What the fuck is a Sangan engine? What the fuck is this, GOAT Format? Yea, basically. The Sangan engine is basically where you normal summon Sangan, and send it off for Almiraj for an easy search with a large pool of monsters for combos, and a good monster on board. I included Santa Claws as the main target to out problem monsters, but you can also use it to search some of the Dangers! and handtraps, making Sangan a very generic card for the deck. I also included some generic cards in the extra, mainly generic links, Almiraj for the combo, and rank 8's and fusions to send for the Dogmatika match up. Overall, this is a fun and simple rouge deck that doesn't take much effort.

After this you can decide how continue the combo."
