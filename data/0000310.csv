Grind games are forced out as you banish your opponent's key cards from deck, control the board/GY, and negate everything with Naturia Sunflower/Beast and Runick spells. </p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">Going first,</strong><span class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</span>the gameplan is to set up Runick Fountain, draw 1-4 cards and a level 10 Synchro of choice. A hand that has access to Naturia Molcricket/Camellia + Runick Fountain can accomplish this. </p>Here is the deck's signature combo, courtesy of Dinh-kha Bui (Top 64 YCS Dortmund) for inventing this combo! <br /><div class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><ol><li>Special summon Hugin from RD with any Runick card. </li><li>Discard any card with Hugin's effect to search for Runick Fountain. (This is best done in draw/standby phase so your opponent cannot Droll you)</li><li>Tribute Molcricket for Camellia. Or if you have Camellia already in hand, normal summon it. </li><li>Activate Camillia's on-summon effect to mill Sacred Tree from deck to grave.&nbsp;</li><li>Sacred Tree searches Blessing.&nbsp;</li><li>Synchro Camellia + Hugin for Stardust Charge Warrior to draw 1 card. </li><li>Activate Naturia Blessing to summon Camellia from GY.</li><li>Synchro Camellia + Stardust Charge Warrior for your level 10 Synchro of choice. I personally go for Chengying, since his synergy with Runick is incredible, he's hard to remove, and he protects your lifepoints and low attack monsters. </li><li>If you have Runick Tip/Slumber, you can activate them turn 1 to trigger Runick Fountain's effect to shuffle back Runick cards in the GY to draw 1-3 cards. If you have extra level 4s, you can make Abyss Dweller or any other rank 4 of choice to further lock down your opponent.</li><li>During your opponent's turn, you can summon Molcricket from your GY when you opponent summons from the extra deck. Molcricket can tribute itself to tag out into Camellia/Sunflower for monster negates, mills, and resource generation.</li></ol><div>With this combo, you drew 1-4 cards, a strong defensive monster that can banish field/GY cards, follow-up for next turn, GY-setup for both Naturia and Runick and multiple in-hand interruptions (Bystial, Kelbek, Runick spells). <br /><br />When discarding cards with Hugin's effect to search Runick Fountain, its ideal to discard Naturia Sacred Tree (Naturia search) and Ishizu cards (Interruption/mills)! </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>When milling with Camellia, always send Sacred Tree so it can search Naturia Blessing. Naturia Blessing is a monster reborn that is not once per turn!</div></div><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">Going second, </strong><span class=""ContentPasted0"">opponent's boards are broken by interrupting your opponent at key moments with handtraps like the Bystial cards, Ishizu cards and Naturia cards. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">Remember, Naturia Molcricket can summon itself from the GY if your opponent summons from the Extra Deck, so you can potentially play turn 1! If you somehow summon Molcricket in this turn 1 situation, tribute Molcricket to summon Camellia + Sunflower, which represents 2 monster negates + 1 search!<br /></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">If your deck was milled by your opponent, it will help you out on the crack-back during your turn, since a decent GY set-up enables more plays, resources and interruptions for the Naturia player.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">When your opponent's turn 1 is complete, you can methodically pick apart your opponent's board depending on which Runick spells you have in your hand. If you can't fully break your opponent's board, you can always summon level 4 Geri, The Runick Fangs, and XYZ summon with another level 4 to stall for time/resources with Bagooska. <br /></span></p>When you finally break your opponent's board, you can go for the ideal turn 1 set-up to force a grindgame where you out-resource your opponent with a combination of Runick + Naturia cards. <br /><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</em></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">GENERAL TIPS</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</p><ul><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Before milling with Kelbek, try to make and activate Abyss Dweller first so that your opponent doesn't plus with your mills.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Remember that Runick Fountain can draw cards during your turn AND your opponent's turn! You can theoretically draw 6 cards before it's your turn again (given you have proper GY and hand set-up)! Remember to keep the GY and hand in mind when you use Runick spells.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Ishizu shufflers effectively shut down Runick Fountain's draw effect since it targets Runick spells in GY to shuffle back into your deck. Try to clear your opponent's GY shufflers before attempting to activate Fountain's draw effect!</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Runick spells skip only 1 battle phase - battle phase is still an option for finishing off your opponent's life points. If your opponent has no more resources and you can attack for game, you can still enter the battle phase after you've skipped one earlier to finish off your opponent!</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Two level 6s -&gt; Beatrice can mill any card from deck. Ideally, Beatrice is used to mill Naturia Sacred Tree for a search. Two level 6 monsters can be summoned with the Bystial cards, or a level 6 synchro summon.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If you make Chengying, its effect to banish your opponent's card in their field and GY can be triggered as a quick effect by the Ishizu cards, Runick spells and Bystial monsters.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If you get interrupted too much and you're in a bad position, make Bagooska to stall for resources.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Decks that counter Tearlaments are usually also bad match-ups for this deck - like Floowandereeze and Dracoslayers (the variant that turbos out Necrovalley). Be sure to side appropriately for those match-ups. Luckily, this deck naturally outs anti-GY floodgates like Macro Cosmos, Necrovalley and Dimension Fissure with Runick spells. </li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">Once again, shoutout to </span><a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Dinh-kha Bui for inventing Naturia Runick. It's such a fun and cool strategy!</a></p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">I found this deck personally hard to pilot, since you have to keep track of soooo many things like your GY, your opponent's GY, the amount of resources in hand, whether you can break your opponent's board, what possible combo lines you can do, how much cards you draw, etc. But man, is it fun to play!<br /><br />Alternative win conditions like controlling and milling your opponent into submission always had a special place in my heart, and Runick cards just made this playstyle competitive!</p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">It's also very cool that Runick cards are from first person perspective - it's like you're DOOMGUY blasting away your enemies, or your Skyrim hero fighting monsters in a fantasy world! Now we can live out our video game imagination in Yugioh!<br /><br />The play style also kind of reminds me of Sky Striker (rest in pieces Raye T__T), and Runick is the closest I'm going to get to playing that fan-favourite deck this format, since my favourite mecha pilot isn't viable in the meta anymore. <br /><br />Anyways, Runick Naturia is a viable contender that can comfortably face Tearlaments this meta, and I'm definitely trying this out in Locals and online duels!</p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">GLHF Duelists!</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Basic plan is to get Geartown on field and break it, either with Ancient Gear Balista or Ancient Gear Catapult. Summon Wyvern into Frame, draw Box with Wyvern, draw any 500 defense card you may need or just need to mill, use Frame's effect on field to discard said card or other brick, grab Ancient Gear Fusion, play Ancient Gear Fusion, make sure you have atleast one other Ancient Gear monster in hand, Fusion summon Megaton or Giant if possible, run over your opponent. If your opponent pops Megaton, you got Ultimate golem as backup into normal Golem if it all goes from bad to worse. You'll be searching for a way to get Chaos Giant on the field. <br />If you need something on the field but dont want to waste Megaton or Giant, Howitzer is a 1k burn immune to card effects; can waste a card effect if opponent isn't paying attention and forces a battle for a Ancient Gear search. Alternatively instead of Howitzer, if you have Geartown and/or Infinitrack Anchor Drill in hand, play Geartown, play Infinitrack to bring two monsters on field, Link-off into Ancient Gear Balista, either add Box or another Ancient Gear monster with Ancient Gear Balista's effect, use Balista's second effect to pop Geatown, use Geartown GY effect to special summon Wyvern, draw box(or another Ancient Gear monster if you already have.) with Wyvern effect, activate Box in hand, draw desired card like Frame or another Infinitrack if your hand is populated.<br /><br />I recently added Harbinger and Called by because of the Ash Blossom &amp; DBE Spam thanks to Verte being unbanned over here on Master Duel. This might not be a great deck, but it's a good one for what it is at least. Ra is here incase you need more monster removal.</p>"

It has a lot of spicy cards like Slifer the sky dragon, and many different 1 card combo's. You can go a lot of different directions. End on a winda lock, buster blader lock, Slifer floodgate (or even a ra's diciple lock), the branded fusions or a combination of those.</p><p>some nice combo's below:</p><p>Combo 1: Activate nadir &amp; search maximus. Send apkalone to grave. Add schism &amp; discard it. Now summon maximus and activate to dump construct &amp; titaniclad. Construct activates and returns schim from the grave to the hand. Set schism. End phase: titaniclad adds fleur to the hand.&nbsp;With this combo you can lock your opponent into the winda-lock, and you also have a dragon in the grave to make prologue live.&nbsp;</p><p>Combo 2: activate branded fusion and summon lubellion by sending albaz and buster dragon to the grave. Next turn, activate prologue and summon buster dragon + buster blader. Equip buster dragon to buster blader. Now you have the full buster lock.&nbsp;</p><p>Combo 3: Activate branded fusion and make brigrand by sending albaz and slifer to the grave. next turn, activate sky god revived and summon slifer on the field while drawing 6 cards. This combo is busted if you can pull it off.&nbsp;</p><p>Combo 4: activate branded fusion and make titaniclad by sending albaz and eldlich to the grave. Because Eldlich is lvl 10, titaniclad will be 3900atk permanently. Now you can also summon eldlich by destroying a spell/trap (preferably branded opening) to have a 3900atk monster and 3500atk monster on the field. It's very handy to otk your opponent unexpectedly.&nbsp;</p><p>Combo 5: add ra's deciple and branded expulsion to the deck. Activate branded fusion, summon albion by sending albaz and ra's diciple to the grave. Now search/set expuslion. Next turn: activate expulsion, tribute the albion and summon ra's diciple to the opponents field. The opponent is now locked to normal summons only, and diciple is really hard to get rid of giving you time to collect all cards you need to go for game.&nbsp;</p><p>Combo 6: activate branded fusion and make lubbellion by sending albaz and dark magician to the grave. Activate lubbelion and summon dragoon with the dark magician. Now dragoon also has the effect to pop 1 monster and do burn damage equal to it's attack. Dragoon also offers much needed protection against backrow.&nbsp;</p><p>There are some other combo's but these are the ones i use most often. The deck is insane and should not be underestimated!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

A work in progress, but the idea is to make blue eyes boss monsters alongside an Invoked Mechaba for negates. Invocation can help get early Blue-Eyes boss monsters. Sage with Eyes of Blue plays really well with normal summoned Aleister: discard sage to get out a blue eyes monster and then you can use invocation on sage and aleister in your grave. If you chose Blue Eyes Abyss, you can grab chaos fusion and then have chaos max dragon your next turn (provided theres a blue eyes in your hand or grave, which there usually is).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

60 cards deck","<p><span>I finally break this deck after doing the experiment about tindangle. so shaddoll is the best mix along tindangle in 60 cards. the most insane strategy that i make is guard dog, i tried to find better turn 1 in this deck, until i founf ""guard dog"" synergize with resh shaddoll. also the ability to spams monster is just ridiculous, but i still need to think faster bcs with that much spams we should be able to make better board, but sadly the timer is our truly enemy.</span></p>"

Well, I have a solution.","<p>When the Vernusylphs were first announced, I had some twinkles appear when I began to think about how this would impact the largely EARTH-based Adamancipator+Rock deck. It's one of my absolute favorite decks, but has suffered pretty extensively as Konami cleaned up many of their broken link monsters over the last few banlists.</p><p>The difficulty is that the Vernusylphs lock you into EARTH monster effects. You can summon any attribute, but, if you want to use those monsters on the same turn, they have to be EARTH. This means that common Adamancipator extenders like Raptite are out. In addition, common Nibiru preventers like Borreload Savage and Crystal Wing Dragon are not useful in the role.</p><p>However, what the Vernusylphs offer is immense: the ability to summon all the bricky rock monsters in your hand. Add a Koa'ki Meiru off a Supplier? Summon it. Have a Doki Doki or Analyzer, summon them. This completely removes one of Adamancipator's biggest weaknesses in being normal summon reliant. It also allows you to utilize the once heavily used Gogogo monsters to their maximum potential by sending them to the graveyard and then immediately special summoning one of them back to the field. And there are enough decent EARTH rank-4s to keep your engine going and recur some resources that you shouldn't have trouble setting up a nuisance of a board.</p><p>Your first turn is often spent setting up a basic board. The Vernusylphs are great, but you are looking for pluses. The three tuners, supplier, and the gogogos will net these for you. Remember to recur an Analyzer using Number 55 (who can also trigger your gogogos in grave). If you are running short on room, make I:P, and then Elf (who can eventually resurrect the I:P). In addition, while Guardian's are easy to summon, Traptrix Rafflesia can serve as a prevention tool against the big rock also.</p><p>Game 2, you are probably going to focus on your silver bullets: the naturia synchros, dweller, bagooska. And, going for game, you can always just play regular Adamancipatorfor Dragite access.</p><p>Note: The Fenrir's are good, but are not neccesary for a more budget build. You can always play Nibiru, or even more Tackle Crusaders (turns every Vernusylph into Book of Moon or a floodgate bounce).</p>"

Despite the banlist, I personally think this deck stays a viable choice as a good Anti Meta alternative, with pretty decent match ups overall.</p><h3>Deck Goal</h3><p>The main goal of the list is to deplete your opponent's ressources. The deck has the advantage of being composed of multiple tools to adapt your gameplay against specific gameplans (thanks to Field Spells, to the Extra Deck).</p><p><em><strong>Neshy</strong></em> (a youtuber specialized in Crystal Beast content, who has topped recently with a Conclave list) did a really good video, that explain the way to play Crystal Conclave Deck.

It also uses a small chaos engine to boost its consistency. You can use batteryman solar to mill rai-oh and revive it with some summer summoner as a good going first play, as it will essentially act as a colossus and give you the ability to negate an ineherent special summon like synchros, xyzs, links, etc. Also fusion and duo can search your stuff, so searching sekka as a going second play to counter backrow is always good.

","<p>Alternate name: Cancer<br /><br />This is a deck I've been using at locals that is very difficult to deal with due to the amount of floodgates it runs. Its main weakness is target destruction and bad starting hands, which is why all the draw spells and flood gates exist. The deck did run double mystic mine, but with the upcoming banlist that will no longer be an option.&nbsp;</p><p>The extra deck can be whatever you want for the most part, however the predaplant and mudragon are good options to pair with super poly given the current meta. Subterror is also one of the few decks that can properly utilize Dimension Shifter since it only affects Fiendess. However, D-shifter is only good turn 0 or 1, and drawing it afterwards can make it a frustrating card to play since it becomes useless. It also does not stop ash blossom. You can swap out flood gates based on what you think is necessary, however the floodgates I'm currently using do little to nothing to hender Subterror plays. <br /><br />Lava Golem + Rivalry is a lock you can do to your oppenant if done correctly, and with the field spell you can continously negate the lava golem's attacks. With Tears' ability to flood the board with omni negates among other things, Lava Golem is good for getting rid of such things without them being able to respond.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />With the upcoming banlist, you could potentially swap out D-shifter and put in either 3 Macro Cosmos or Dimensional Barrier. This will however make Fiendess useless and leave you open to spot destruction, which Tears are really good at doing.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some people don't like Subtteror Cave Clash, however I like it for recycling the Fiendess's.&nbsp;</p><p>Any advice on making this deck better/more cancerous is welcome. As the deck currently stands, it's a good way to make everyone at your locals hate you and groan whenever they see the deck, which is what I love about it.&nbsp;</p>"

It is not perfect and I encourage anyone to play around with the deck as much as you wish. This deck excels at longer games I feel vs its 40 card deck counterparts as it has more then one copy of its main boss monsters to keep you in the game. The deck can be sometimes a bit of a slow start but, after a few rounds it has great potential. The deck can brick but, it often does pretty well in my testing. With its extra deck and so many cards you will find that this deck has options for different end game strategys so the deck does not always feel the same and I think is one of the fun things about this deck. The side deck is really much up for debate and I'm not 100% sold on it but, I think its a ok starting point for some fun plays. I hope you all enjoy this deck.

He is a Garnet and is too valuable to play at only 1 copy, therefore 2 is the perfect number.</p><p dir=""ltr""><em>Nidhogg, Generaider Boss of Ice</em> - He acts as a walking &ldquo;Solemn Warning&rdquo; for Special Summons. He is an additional level 9 monster providing variety in type and attribute. By far one of the weakest boss monsters, but better than nothing.</p><p dir=""ltr""><em>Utgarda, Generaider Boss of Delusion</em> - All around fantastic monster. For the same cost as Harr&rsquo;s omni-negate (2 tributes), he targets and banishes any 1 card on the field once per turn. He also provides variety in type and attribute. And has a great defense statistic.</p><p dir=""ltr""><em>Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light</em> - Fantastic monster. With decent battle statistics, she provides a whole archetype search on Summon. Monster, Spell, Trap, as long as it is a part of the Generaider archetype, she will search it. Perfect for combos.</p><p dir=""ltr""><em>Vara, Seidhr of the Generaider Bosses</em> - The most recent addition to the archetype, she provides a &ldquo;free&rdquo; Special Summon, from the Hand or GY, that aids in preventing ""Garnets"" from ruining your Hands. She also allows you to summon any Generaider monster from either your Hand or GY. All around &ldquo;House&rdquo; that perfects the combo potential of the Deck. Most would be confused that I only run 2 but as a similar case with Harr, with 3 copies she just clogs up the Deck.</p><p dir=""ltr""><em>Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses</em> - The &ldquo;Lone Fire&rdquo; of the Deck, he can tag out himself, or a Generaider token, to Special Summon any Level 9 Generaider monster from the Deck. He acts as a perfect combo starter for the Deck. And if all of that wasn&rsquo;t good enough, during the opponent's turn he provides a 1000 ATK/DEF stats boost to all Generaider monsters while on the field.</p><p dir=""ltr""><em>Generaider Boss Stage</em> - By far the most important card in the Deck. The Field Spell. Facilitating the main gameplan of Special Summoning your bosses directly from the Deck, and its second effect provides your field with the remaining tokes to be used as tribute fodder for your bosses effects.</p><p dir=""ltr""><em>Generaider Boss Quest </em>- A fantastic and fair searcher. At the cost of a &ldquo;Mulligan&rdquo; you get to search up to 2 of your Generaider Spells/Traps. Making this card a perfect searcher for Boss Stage. The great thing about it is that the &ldquo;Cost&rdquo; to activate the card makes you place a Generaider monster from your Hand on the bottom of your Deck. This is helpful because it allows you to rid of your boss monsters by putting them back in the Deck where they can be summoned by Boss Stage.</p><p dir=""ltr""><em>Generaider Boss Fight</em> - This card is very interesting. At the cost of giving your opponent a free draw 1 you get to activate Boss Stage directly from your Deck or GY. The cost isn&rsquo;t particularly bad either because the effect that Boss Stage gives you to Special Summon a monster from your Deck activates in response to your opponent adding a card from their Deck by any means. Meaning that Boss Fight activates Boss Stage and allows its effect to activate. In this case 2 copies is also more than enough.</p><p dir=""ltr""><em>Generaider Boss Room </em>- This card is an interesting kind of omni-negate. You can only activate it if your opponent activates an effect in response to your Generaider card effect. Starting a chain. But it stops that effect by changing it to a different one that makes both players draw a card. All at the cost of 1 discard. Overall, it is a decent form of protection. Only 1 copy is needed since it's easily searchable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Dual Avatar Engine:</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">The inclusion of this &ldquo;engine&rdquo; so to speak might be confusing to some. However, I hope to justify its inclusion in this Deck with a quick explanation.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The main focus of the engine is the card<em> Dual Avatar Invitation</em>. This card is one of the most ""free"" cards I have ever seen. At the cost of a single discard you Special Summon as many Dual Avatar Tokens as you can then you get 2 free fusion summons using monsters you control or in your hand. This is quite powerful because 2 of the archetypes' Fusion monsters can be summoned using only the tokens. The catch is that these monsters only gain their good effects if they are summoned using an effect monster. This can be mitigated by using the first Dual Avatar fusion monster you summon as material for the second one. On its own this effect of <em>Dual Avatar Invitation </em>is ok, you get 1 Fusion monster with a decent effect at the cost of a discard, provided you have enough empty monster zones. As far as the Fusion monsters are, the fist Fusion monster, when summoned, grants a free &ldquo;pop&rdquo; of any attack position monster your opponent controls, and when summoned with an effect monster as material he grants a small attack and defense boost to all Dual avatar monsters. The feet fusion monster provides a trade off destruction protection, and when summoned using an effect monster she has a once per turn monster negate of a monster special summoned from the Extra Deck. Finally, with the way I have built the package the only &ldquo;empowered&rdquo; fusion monster playable is 1 copy of <em>Dual Avatar - Empowered Kon-Gyo</em> whos only significant traits is that he has, once per turn, targeting protection from spells/traps as long as you control at least 2 Fusion monster, and inherently he prevents your opponent from activating any effect at any point when he declares an attack.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Overall, it is clear to see that the strategy is mediocre at best. However when used as a supplementary engine in the Generaider strategy, its potential becomes much better. The package is very consistent, the main Deck monster acts as a 4th copy of the fusion spell, and the Field Spell acts as a 1 card starter that searches the Main Deck monster and provides you with a free tribute for his effect allowing you to summon 2 fusion monsters with all their best effects. At its worst it is a strategy that locks you into Fusion summoning (for the rest of the turn) and provides you with a free ""pop"" or a situational (Quick Effect) monster negate. Also the cost of 1 discard is mitigated by the fact that many cards in this Deck don&rsquo;t mind being in the GY and some can activate their effects while in the GY. In the end it might not be the absolute best strategy to run alongside the Generaider core, but there is no doubt that it improves the consistency and ceiling of the Deck, while keeping it fun and unique. Oh and it allows you to play Set Rotation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Level 9 Extenders:</strong></p><p dir=""ltr""><em>Trias Hierarchia</em> - A fantastic level 9 monster that provides insane advantage. With a strategy that is built around tributing tokens for effects, as it just so happens those tokens are fairies. This monster tributes Fairy monsters to Special Summon itself from your Hand or GY as a Quick Effect. Depending on how many you tribute to Summon it, you gain multiple effects. 1 tribute just summons it. 2 tributes summons it and give you a non-targeting destruction of any 1 card your opponent controls, and if you tribute 3 Fairy monsters you get to summon it, destroy 1 card, and draw 2 cards. Literally Free.</p><p dir=""ltr""><em>World Legacy Monstrosity</em> - This card is a very powerful Quick Play Spell. It allows you to either special summon a level 9 monster from your hand, or if you already control a level 9 monster, you get to Special Summon up to 2 other level 9 monsters from your Deck as long as they have different types and attributes from the one you control. It is an amazing extender with fantastic combo potential. Perfect for setting up Rank 9 Xyz Summons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Searchers/Draw:</strong></p><p dir=""ltr""><em>Terraforming</em> - Searches either Field Spell from the Deck for absolutely free.</p><p dir=""ltr""><em>Set Rotation</em> - Because I play 2 different strategies that use Field Spells, it acts as another copy of <em>Terraforming</em>, but at Quick Play speed.</p><p dir=""ltr""><em>Kuji-Kiri Curse</em> - At 2 copies this card is yet another card that allows you to get rid of any ""Garnets"" in your hand by sending them to your GY to draw 2 cards. Overall it adds to the consistency of the Deck and allows you to set up by putting monsters that can activate their effects in the GY, in the GY. Thus giving you even more advantage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>&ldquo;Tech&rdquo;:</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">As for the &ldquo;Tech&rdquo; cards I play they are more budget friendly, but seeing as the rest of the Deck and Extra Deck are pretty inexpensive you do have the option to play more expensive staples. <em>Effect Veiler</em> could be switched out with <em>Infinite Impermanence</em> and <em>Raigeki </em>could be switched out with <em>Evenly Matched</em>, it is your choice. But as far as what I play with, it gets the job done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Extra Deck:</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">To keep the rest of this explanation short I won't go over every card in the Extra Deck. For the Dual Avatar package 2 copies of the small Fusion monsters allows for the longevity of the strategy allowing you to use the Fusion spell more than once in a Duel improving the &ldquo;grind game&rdquo;. The rest of the Extra Deck consists of a toolbox of Xyz/Link monsters that can be Summoned using your Main Deck boss monsters. They contribute to the strategy providing powerful effects and stats improving the ceiling of the Deck significantly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

The deck doesn't play eanoc because he's really bad and most of the traps aren't great. The deck functions well in midrange and can't flood the board until turn 2/3.

Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</strong></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a Zoodiac deck specifically made for Masterduel's Anti-Spell Festival and it's banlist. <br /><br />I wanted a no-nonsense straightforward deck to breeze through the Anti-Spell Festival, which wouldn't be mired in the slow slog of constant trap activations on both sides - So I opted to use Zeus Zoodiac!<br /><br />No complex combos or game knowledge is needed for this deck, hence no gigantic word guide. <br /><br />Slow down and break your opponent's board with staples like Ash Blossom and Evenly Matched - then turbo out a 2-6 material Zeus with Zoodiac to win! <br /><br />If your opponent manages to slay your Zeus, your back-up plan is to use Chakanine to revive Drident from the GY, then use Tigermortar to give Drident more material for another destruction of a face-up card. <br /><br />Jar of Avarice recycles your 1-of cardslike Drident and Zeus in your GY, and Jar of Avarice (as well as any normal trap) is searcheable with Lord of the Heavenly Prison. </p><p>My version of Zoodiac is pretty expensive beacause of all the staples, however, this deck's core can be made really cheap. You only need 60 UR for Drident and Zeus, and 90 SR for 3 Thoroughblade. Every other staple card can be anything you want, especially cheap R and N cards. <br /><br />With Zoodiac, your duels are guaranteed to be fast and straightfoward, giving you a fast way to blaze through Masterduel's Anti-Spell Festival for those sweet, sweet gems. <br /><br />GLHF Duelists! <br /><br /></p><div class=""elementToProof ContentPasted0 ContentPasted2""><strong>Want to see the deck in action?

Destroy your opponent's cards, destroy your own cards, destroy everything until victory!","<p>This is an Unchained deck tailor made for Masterduel's best-of-1 format. <br /><br />No complex combos or game knowledge is needed for this deck, hence no 1500 word guide. <br /><br />Destroy your own cards, disrupt your opponent with Unchained Soul of Rage during their turn, and handtrap them to a standstill. In a game where cards are destroyed by battle or effect, you should be able to outgrind your opponent in a resource war and swing for game! <br /><br />Handtraps are used instead of the traditional trap cards that Unchained likes to use (Like Torrential Tribute) since handtraps are more suited for a Bo1 game. 13 handtraps should be able to stop your opponent in most circumstances and allow you to get your Unchained deck up and running, whether you go first or second. <br /><br />I'll end off this article with the wise words of DOOMSLAYER, ""RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT IS DONE."" Likewise for Unchained, destroy destroy destroy, until you win!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</p>"

I mainly use it to take advantage of my favorite monster in Yu-gi-oh: Tytannial, Princess of Camellias. It has excellent synergy with the deck and is really easy to summon with cards like Lonefire Blossom and Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy, and is searchable with Rikka Glamour. Often times when I open with Unexpected Dai I find myself not using my normal summon, so I use it on Lonefire to get Tytannial out. Of course in the side there is also a Naturia Rosewhip/Bamboo Shoot package and Cactus Bouncer. While less reliable, it is really funny to get these monsters out when my opponent does not see it coming.</p><p>There are some things here that are a little less traditional but are more fun for me to play. Tytannial obviously and more ways to get to it, but also Orea the Sylvan High Arbiter. While a fairly slow monster, at the right time it is a great monster for stacking the top of the deck, getting some plants in the graveyard, and clearing the opponent's field for game, and the monster is easily summonable with Strenna like Teardrop and Sacred Tree Beast are. You could swap that out and put a third Strenna in there instead if you prefer. Sylvan Dancepione could probably be swapped out for a third Sunavalon Dryas, but I love the link-2 Dancepione play to go for a Hail Mary and hope you get some useful plants off the top. It is beautiful when it works and often times get you back in the game. I play Rikka Tranquility as well as Rikka Sheet, and it's because I find uses out of both traps and I often use Tranq more than Sheet to keep myself alive. Rikka Flurries is that one card that can take care of almost any tower monster. Even if the monster is unaffected by card effects (Like Crooked Cook or Arrival Cyberse @Ignister), if the monster is the only one the opponent has on the field and you have Flurries and tribute a Rikka, they have to tribute their only monster (The effect is something that affects the player, not the monster, similar to how Evenly Matched works).</p><p>The side deck are just cards I prefer to play with the current format, Imperial Iron wall for decks that play out of the banish pile like Floo or Swordsoul, Twin Twisters for back row decks, and Ghost Sister and Spooky Dogwood because it's funny. Change around those cards to your preferences.</p><p>I mostly made this to share my creation with the community. Enjoy!</p>"

Overwhelm your opponent with sheer numbers and control the battleground with high-ranking Ninja!,"<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-c830c619-7fff-aea7-208a-ff2b389b1f27""><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The primary game plan is to get Meizen on the field to disrupt your opponent and maintain your board presence. The Ninjitsu Arts are to help cover other areas while you stabilize against your opponent. Then, when there is an opening, you swarm the board with Ninja and attack directly over their monsters for game! Other priority Ninja you want to summon are Hanzo, Tobari, Kagero, and Jio. Below is an in-depth breakdown of everything, but you can skip to the bottom to check out the decklist. The large picture at the end with a bunch of random cards is just a bunch of different stuff I experimented with in different Ninja builds. If you have any questions, comments, or critiques please leave me a comment and I'll try to get back with you!</span></p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>With all the new support, the Ninja archetype finally has an identity. They are tricky and hard to lock down once they get a foothold, allowing you to control the battlefield until your opportunity to strike. Once you've found an opening, use the amazing flexibility of the Ninja to overwhelm your opponent with numbers and powerful effects and before they know it you'll be able to assassinate them even through their wall of defense.</p><p>I'll be going through each card and give a general gameplan when using it.</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<strong>Jio, the Weighted Ninja:</strong> This Ninja is one of your premium forms of disruption in the Ninja archetype. Primarily, you'll be using him for his summon effect which will flip up to 2 monsters of your choice face-down. Any opponent monsters that are flipped face-down by this effect cannot change their position. This is great to stop link plays and force your opponent to tribute, ritual, or fusion summon to remove them from the board. There are times when you will want to leave the face-down monsters on your opponent's board to deny them the space and resources.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Twilight Ninja Getsuga, the Shogun:</strong> Usually, you want to set up this Ninja during the end of your opponent's turn or have him in hand/GY on your follow-up turns. His effect to summon any 2 Ninja from the GY is huge. And it is ANY Ninja! You can get back your fusions or Saizo as well. This Ninja's main purpose is to help revitalize your board and to provide a 3k defense body to block with.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Twilight Ninja Jogen:</strong> One of the 2 pendulum Ninja in the deck. You will mostly use this Ninja as a scale, but there are very niche opportunities to get him on board to be useful. The judgment is case-by-case, but the flexibility is greatly appreciated. His effect to have piercing on all of your Ninja is more useful than you might think. Sometimes you have to clear out key targets that you've flipped face-down and being able to get in some chip damage can go a long way.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Ninja Grandmaster Hanzo:</strong> This is THE Ninja. Your bread and butter. Hanzo is always great to see. On Normal Summon he can get you a Ninjitsu Art to help set up your follow-up. On Special Summon he gets you a Ninja in hand to further your resources. An easy combo is to Special Summon Hanzo and add Baku to hand, which will immediately put Baku on the field. This will already give you 2 Ninja to summon Meizen or Saizo from the Extra Deck. You ALWAYS want to prioritize using Hanzo for his resource gain in any way you can. Just keep in mind that if you Special Summon him using Meizen, then he will miss timing and not search.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Kagero, the Cannon Ninja:</strong> This Ninja is incredible. In my opinion, she is your primary defender. Finding a way to get her on the field or in the GY will take you a long way. When she is summoned or flipped face-up she will set a Ninja from your hand or GY face-down. While she is in the GY, if a Ninja or ANY face-down monster is targeted on your side of the field, she can bounce it out and set herself face-down in its place. Finding ways to utilize her on the opponent's turn will usually let you defend easily against their board while setting you up with resources for the next turn.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Upstart Golden Ninja:</strong> This Ninja is a nice to have, but not really needed in the grand scheme of things. If you can resolve his effect, then you can combo off with your Ninja. The best combo is to summon Hanzo then grab Baku to get the trap you discarded back, if it was a Ninjitsu Art. This will put 3 Ninja on board already! If you have one other Ninja in hand that can be summoned you can set up Saizo + Meizen, which is a deceptively formidable board.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Baku, the Beast Ninja:</strong> This little guy is a resource boon. If you add Baku from deck to hand, then he can immediately summon himself to the field. THEN, if you special summon him in any way you can add a Ninja OR Ninjitsu Art back to your hand! Finding ways to special summon this guy will set up for your Extra Deck plays while recovering your resources. Not only that but, like Hanzo and Kagero, he has a decent attack stat! Combine him with the Iron Digger equip spell and he can reach 2k attack! Unfortunately, drawing him is very poor.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Karakuri Ninja model 339, ""Sazank"":</strong> A very unusual include for the deck, but hear me out. I got this idea from a video so I can't take credit. But this Ninja is sneaky. Like extra sneaky. You find a way to get him face-down on your field and your opponent HAS to spend resources to remove it. You flip up Sazank and it is non-targeting removal. Amazing! It's face-down and gets attacked in the Battle Phase? That counts as being flipped face-up and you get to remove an opponent's monster from the field!<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Green Ninja:</strong> Another sneaky guy! You will mostly use him for his second effect. When he is sent from the field or hand to the GY, you can flip any monster on the field face-down or face-up depending on what its current position is. Having him as a face-down defender during the Battle Phase can buy you some time. But the main use for him is to either discard with Notebook or as fusion material on the opponent's turn with Tobari.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Mitsu, the Insect Ninja:</strong> Just like all the other new Ninja cards, Mitsu is a blessing to have. She is a priority to have set up on the board with another Ninja that is face-down. Being able to stop ANY effect that is activated, not just monsters on the field, is so nice for Ninja. Not only that but she allows you to activate other face-down Ninja effects if they have them. Not much to say here other than prioritize using her when setting up your field.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Twilight Ninja Kagen:</strong> Another pendulum scale Ninja. You will never summon this guy, ever. His pendulum effect is too good. Being able to give any one of your Ninja +1k attack during battle helps with beating over larger threats that are too strong to leave on the board. Or, he can give you additional reach when attacking directly for lethal damage. Meizen with Iron Digger attached and Kagen effect puts him at 4k attack! His downside of only being able to pendulum summon Ninja monsters doesn't matter obviously.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Tobari, the Sky Ninja:</strong> This is a Ninja you want to put into play as soon as possible, whether it is in your hand, on the field, or in the GY. He can discard himself to let you Special Summon any Ninja from your hand. When he is Special Summoned to the field he becomes immune to battle and card effect destruction. And while on the opponent's turn he can quick effect fusion with Ninja in hand or field. Everything about this guy is amazing. Just him alone can stall out an entire turn as he walls out the opponent's Battle Phase. Also keep in mind, the Ninja fusion can use face-down cards as material too! So Tobari can save any Ninja on your field from targeted effects during the opponent's turn.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Instant Fusion:</strong> This is such a flexible option for Ninja it is crazy. Being able to pay 1k LP to get Yaguramaru in play gives so many options. You can use it to get a quick banish off. Or you can just use him as a body for a fusion or link summon. But the main purpose is to get him in play and in the GY to be used later.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Armor Ninjitsu Art of Alchemy:</strong> While not always the most useful, it can come in handy when needing to make backrow space or just needing to draw 2 cards. Be careful when activating this though as it will remove every single face-up Ninjitsu Art. I would recommend always having at least one of these in the deck during deck building.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Monster Reborn:</strong> A nice to have card. I can see it being cut for something else. But it is nice to have a way to bring back any Ninja in GY for plays. Also being able to revive an opponent's strong monster to use is nice. Plus if you have Iron Digger, you can attach it to the revived monster to make it a Ninja!<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Book of Moon:</strong> I think this needs to be a 3 of in this deck. It is an amazing disruption. It is amazing for setting up Fallen Leaves. It is even amazing for resetting some of your Ninja effects. The card is so flexible and has no restrictions on usage. It's just overall amazing.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Ninjitsu Art Notebook of Mystery:</strong> This Ninjitsu Art may seem quite restrictive at first, but the longer a match goes on the more value this card gets. It also has quite an unusual wording for its effect but it pretty much lets you set any 1 Ninja and any 1 Ninjitsu Art card on the field, however you can only get 1 from the deck and 1 from the GY. Despite the restrictions, it is great for recovering your cards and value. It also has a bonus effect where if it is destroyed while set on your field you can Book of Moon a monster on the field, so setting 2 of these is not a bad idea in some cases.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Ninjitsu Art Notebook:</strong> A very basic card, but can do so much for you. For discarding a Ninja you can get any Ninjitsu Art from your deck. The most basic combo is to get Art of Alchemy to draw 2. But you can also get your field spell to try and recover the discarded Ninja. Or you can get any of your Ninjitsu Art traps to help set up your board. You can even grab the Iron Digger to get a quick boost/pop on the field. A funny thing about this card is it is a soft once per turn, so if you have more than one in your hand or it gets returned to your hand from the field you can just activate another one and use it again.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Ninjitsu Art Tool - Iron Digger:</strong> Just like the other new Ninjitsu Arts, this card is amazing for value plays. It gives the equipped monster +500 attack. It has an active effect to banish a Ninja from your GY to target and destroy ANY card on the field. Then if this card is sent from the field to the GY, you can get one of your banished Ninja back to your hand or Special Summon it face-down to your field. AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT! Any monster this card is equipped to become a Ninja. This means you can equip it to an opponent's monster to make them a Ninja target for your Ninjitsu Art traps, or if you summon an opponent's monster to your field you can make it a Ninja to gain any benefits from your Ninja cards, or you can even just equip this to an opponent's monster and then use the effect to destroy that monster to send it and this card to the GY to get back your banished Ninja. It is such a cool design and I hope we get more awesome Ninjitsu Art Tool cards in the future.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Hidden Village of Ninjitsu Arts:</strong> Our field spell is quite resourceful. The main function is to recover Ninja or Ninjitsu Art cards from the GY. But the added bonus of being able to protect face-up Ninja and Ninjitsu Art cards from destruction is what makes this field spell so reliable. If possible I always recommend trying to set this up immediately.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Infinite Impermanence:</strong> Our deck doesn't really play handtraps. Drawing too many handtraps can really make it hard to start our plays going first and even when going second sometimes since we rely on seeing multiple Ninja and/or Ninjitsu Art cards to get going. But Imperm is such a flexible card that it fits right in so well. Setting it while going first can help your disruption plays. Having it while going second can help to play through your opponent's board. The Ninja don't need much on the board to become a threat since Meizen can allow direct attacks over the opponent's monsters.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Armor Ninjitsu Art of Rust Mist:</strong> You may look at this card and be scratching your head, but you need to understand the value this card brings. As long as you have a Ninja face-up on the field, ANY monster your opponent Special Summons will have their attack cut in half. PERMANENTLY! This card can single handedly allow you to break boards on a follow-up turn sometimes. Cutting 3k+ attack boss monsters down to the under 2k attack range will make it easier to defend against and easier to attack over. Effectively, an opponent has to summon a 5k attack monster to match Meizen in attack while Rust Mist is active. I think this card is super slept on and has single handedly won me quite a few games. On top of that, because this card activates on every Special Summon your opponent might even get baited into spending their negates to try and stop this card.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Ninjitsu Art of Duplication:</strong> Another unusual pick I know, but again the value this brings is crazy. This Ninjitsu Art requires a Ninja tribute. Then you can Special Summon any amount of Ninja from your deck that have a combined level of the Ninja you tributed. And the cards summoned DO NOT have to be unique from each other. The most common usage for this is to get a Tobari on the board face-up so you can quick effect fusion during the opponent's turn. After that you can use your remaining summons to grab whatever you want. You get even more value off this when using a higher leveled Ninja. Activating this card in response to targeted removal or disruption is such a boon in advantage and value it is insane. Of course, do keep in mind that when this card is removed from the field, any remaining Ninja summoned from this card are also removed.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Ninjitsu Art of Dancing Leaves:</strong> Another insane Ninjitsu Art. This one needs a Ninja or face-down monster as tribute. Notice, face-down monster. This can include your opponent's monsters as well. If you find a way to flip them face-down, this card can effectively remove it and give you advantage. When this card is activated you can Special Summon ANY Ninja from your deck. ANY! On top of that, while this card remains face-up you can activate it to return any face-up Ninjitsu Art (except the field spell and equip spell) on the field back to your hand! A common thing with Ninjitsu Arts is that they take up space after they have run their usefulness. While Art of Alchemy can let you draw by destroying them, this Ninjitsu Art lets you recover them to be used again! Of course, you do have to remember that any Ninja summoned from this card will be removed once this card is removed from the field.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Meizen, the Battle Ninja:</strong> THE QUINTESSENTIAL NINJA! He is priority number 1. You need to have him active as often as possible. This guy is absolutely insane. Once per turn, whenever your opponent activates ANY card or effect, you can Special Summon ANY Ninja from your deck! On top of that, while you have a face-down monster he can't be attacked! On top of that, he has a decent attack stat of 2500 (effectively 5k to opponent's monsters if you have Rust Mist active)! On top of that, he has a passive effect that ALL NINJA CAN ATTACK DIRECTLY! You can assassinate games by just attacking over their frontline. Like I mentioned above, if you have an opponent's monster on your field and equip them with Iron Digger, it too can attack directly! Also as I mentioned before, Meizen + Iron Digger + Kagen makes Meizen a 4k attack Ninja! This guy brings the entire Ninja archetype together and propels it into action. And it makes sense that the War General of the Ninja is the most adept on the battlefield. I love it!<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Yaguramaru, the Armored Ninja:</strong> Another banger of a Ninja. Getting this guy in play and/or in the GY is a massive boon. When this Ninja is Special Summoned or flipped face-up, you can banish a Ninja or Ninjitsu Art card from your hand, field, or GY to target and banish any card on the field. Finding ways to reset him and reuse him is very rewarding. Plus he has a decent attack and defense stat of 2k.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Blade Armor Ninja:</strong> A more obscure Ninja, but can definitely come in handy. While needing 2 level 4 Warrior-types to XYZ Summon him, he can help go for OTKs or clearing boards. His effect allows you to detach a material then choose a Ninja you control to attack twice that turn. Targeting Meizen gives you 5k direct damage.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Ninja Grandmaster Saizo:</strong> This guy is not to be slept on. While he is on the field, if he is pointing to any monster(s), he can't be targeted and can't be attacked. But the main reason to use Saizo is, once per turn, he can directly set a Ninjitsu Art from the deck to the field. Combining him with Meizen can make for a deceptively strong board that the opponent has to spend quite a few resources to get through. Or they just draw that one card that outs everything :P<br /><br /></li><li><strong>XYZ Monsters:</strong> These can be whatever you are most comfortable with. I chose Time Thief Redoer, Abyss Dweller, and Bagooska. I like Time Thief in being just a recurring monster that keeps stealing cards and provides value/disruption, Abyss Dweller to help combat GY based decks, and Bagooska if I ever need to stall out for a turn or two. Obviously, these cards are secondary and you should focus on your Extra Deck Ninjas first. But the options are there and you could replace any of these with whatever you wanted.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Link Monsters:</strong> Similar to the XYZ Monsters, the Link Monsters can be whatever you want really. I like having the 3 Knightmare monsters for additional targeted removal, Cross-Sheep is for extending your value if you have the opportunity to do so, and Underworld Goddess is for getting rid of hard to remove monsters.</li></ul><p>So the overall gameplan with Ninja is to get Meizen on board mainly. It sounds simple, but the flexibility is very deceptive. If you're able to play through and stabilize against your opponent's strongest board, then you will eventually outvalue them. The hardest fight for Ninja is within the first 2 - 3 turns in my opinion. I usually find that once I'm through that, I can stabilize and overwhelm my opponent. Also keep in mind, this deck is not easy to play. There are a lot of moving parts, a lot of micro combos that add up and set things in motion. Honestly, kinda like playing Chess. I know it is a cheesy analogy to make, but hear me out. What you do in the first couple turns when it comes to setting up your field and the GY can make all the difference down the line. Because of the way Ninja work, there are so many options all the time. What Ninja do I want to summon from the deck? Why? Will I need it later or now? What about Ninjitsu Arts? Do I not care about their board state and want Rust Mist? Or do I want Dancing Leaves to snipe a card? It depends on match-up, board state, and resources available. And to be honest, I've never really had to side in anything when playing against a large variety of decks. Generally, Ninja have all the tools needed to fight against everything!</p><p>Now in terms of siding. The Side Deck can be whatever you want, I've just given my example based on the current meta decks. The cards that I feel can be switched out when siding are:</p><ul><li><strong>1x Upstart Golden Ninja, 1x Ninjitsu Art of Alchemy, 1x Ninjitsu Art Notebook:</strong> These 3 can be switched out as they are the lowest impact cards in the deck.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>1x Ninjitsu Art of Alchemy, 2x Ninjitsu Art Notebook:</strong>&nbsp;While these 3 cards can provide value, they can be changed for something more impactful like Forbidden Droplet or Evenly Matched. I'll be referring to these as the ""low impact Spells"" from here on and generally are the first 3 cards you should consider switching out when siding in.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>3x Book of Moon:</strong> I love having Book of Moon in the deck. But if you feel that the opponent doesn't really care about any monsters being flipped face-down, these 3 cards are good to side out without hurting your deck consistency.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>3x Infinite Impermanence:</strong> Same as Book of Moon, I love having this in the deck. But if you feel the opponent's deck doesn't care about this card at all, siding it out is a good option.</li></ul><p>Now I want to go over the side deck briefly, just giving my thoughts on the choices.</p><ul><li><strong>Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode:</strong> An obvious board breaker. I can also see this being paired with Lava Golem or being replaced by it. This can help going second and I would recommend switching out Spells to include these to not hurt the consistency of your Ninja monsters. However, Upstart Golden Ninja, Sazank, and Green Ninja can be replaced if you need 3 monsters to get rid of.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Senior Silver Ninja:</strong> This is an alternative to Getsuga. Effectively, he is a different way to recover resources that could be better depending on the matchup. Against the Ishizu cards, Senior Silver can't be stopped if you have more than 2 Ninja in your GY whereas Getsuga can. If you are going to include Senior Silver Ninja, then he should only be replacing Getsuga to avoid bricking and to maintain the deck consistency since they are both high level Ninja that are mainly for recovering resources.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Reinforcement of the Army:</strong> An extender that can come in handy based on the matchup. You can replace a Ninjitsu Art Notebook or Ninjitsu Art Dancing Leaves. I can even see replacing the Instant Fusion, but I feel they both do the same thing as an extender and would like to have both rather than one over the other.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Forbidden Droplet:</strong> I mentioned above, but replacing 3x Book of Moon with this is a solid idea if your opponent doesn't care about face-down monsters. Or you can replace the low impact Spells. Forbidden Droplet is just a nice option to have since Ninja don't really have a problem with discarding any cards.</li><li><strong>Silent Graveyard:</strong> This is an alternative to Abyss Dweller if you have trouble getting it on the field. I would replace the low impact Spells with these to maintain the power of the deck while having the ability to counter GY based decks.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Evenly Matched:</strong> A must have in the Side Deck in my opinion. Honestly, it doesn't really matter what you replace with this if you need it, cause without it you won't be playing the game anyway.</li><li><strong>Appointer of the Red Lotus:</strong> This last slot can be whatever honestly, but this card seemed kinda cool to include. On top of the insane value Ninja can create for you, having a hand disruption on top of everything else can be devastating against some decks. I would recommend switching out Art of Alchemy for this or Upstart Golden Ninja if you ever want to side it in.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Sol and Luna:</strong> This card isn't featured in the Side Deck, but I'm probably going to replace Red Lotus with it. I've come to like this card quite a lot, but only as a 1 of. The Spell allows you to target one monster you control and one monster your opponent controls, then change them both to either face-up or face-down Defense Position, the opposite of what it was when targeted. The problem with the card though is it REQUIRES both targets to activate, meaning it is way less flexible than Book of Moon. However, once the Spell is played and monsters have been targeted, it will still go through even if any of those monsters leave the field. Replacing a Ninjitsu Art Notebook with Sol and Luna might be the way to go for the Main Deck, but for now I'm relegating it to the Side Deck.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Upstart Goblin, Called by the Grave:</strong> These 2 cards I have also considered placing into the Side Deck or even Main Deck. Again, there is flexibility all over with this Main Deck and Side Deck. Obviously Upstart is just a nice draw 1 and Called by the Grave is just an amazing card in general.</li></ul><p>So I've gone through so much, but because of how flexible this deck is I've done so much experimenting with so many things. I'm going to include a picture below of all the cards I've experimented with and considered for the deck. Maybe it might inspire some ideas of your own! Honestly, if you build it right I think any of these cards could be useful. I mean my previous guide is about a combo version of Ninja that uses a wide variety of cards, which I might have to update at some point since I was less experienced with Ninja then. Anyway, thank you so much for trying this deck out. It is so cool and I love it and hope you do too! Feel free to leave me any questions and I'll try to get back to you.</p><p><img class=""article-img-floatnone"" src=""https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/658504379720007710/1042157200380022897/Untitled.png"" alt=""A compilation of a bunch of different ideas!"" width=""890"" loading=""lazy"" /></p>"
