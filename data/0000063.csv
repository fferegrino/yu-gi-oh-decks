But I'm Still a Beginner,"Sorry about my english or how I made this description.  The objective of this deck is take control of your opponent's monsters, so the first thing that you need to do is use ""Unpossessed"" and ""Awakening of the Possessed"" to protect your lvl 3 monsters. The card ""Masters of the Spiritual Arts"" can help you to use both. In case than the opponent's monster would be too strong and there is not a way to control it, you can use the ""Archnemeses Protos"" or use the ""Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon"" to beat it.  I know that is a poor description but I'm only a beginer."

Machine duplication can also be used on couple of the Infinitracks helping to gain the much needed card advantage. And with cyber dragons being being so popular today Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon is great in the deck. Infinitracks are also mostly level 5 which helps bringing out Infinity. Infinitracks on their own severely lack card advantage and cyber dragons can provide it better than Trains. This deck is in no means a meta deck and isn't meant to be the greatest cyber dragon build.

Many strong options but need to pick the right play for each situation. The only li,"The deck is still being improved over time. The biggest problem comes when you have only one play at start and it gets negated, like your Kepler normal summon. You can't always make exactly what you want on turn 1, the outcomes range between Dark Armageddon, White Armageddon, Wave King etc, those are all good ways to start.  Your big enemy is smth like Vanity's fiend or Necrovalley, but you have at least one answer to each in the main deck.  Always remember the potential of Reiji. You can normal summon your Ragnarok with Reiji in pendulum zone, or you can kill your opponent from below 4k hp with him on board.  Try to keep one Ragnarok in extra deck, so that you can bring him and a lv 8 D/D/D from grave every time you want either to make a rank 8, or to banish with Ragnarok.  Some reasonings behind the choices:  Why almost pure D/D/D? There are 3 reasons:  One is that Gilgamesh is a very good value card that you should play in order to move ahead, but it restricts summoning to D/D/D. So anything else can be played on turn 2 only  Second is that unlike something like Orcust, D/D/D really relies on you having other pieces available to you all the time. So you can't start a play by just foolishing a Knightmare, you would probably need at least 3 pieces in hand to do something threatening.  Third is that graveyard summoning effects of Ragnarok and High Genghis are very good, but they only apply to D/D/D. And you would eventually want to return extra deck monsters instead of just another copy of Ragnarok.  &nbsp;  Then why not fully D/D/D?  So the archetype has some very nice cards to help itself out, but all hinges on you pulling off the first few effects, like activating Dark Contract With the Gate, or Kepler, or Swirl Slime, and for that you should use a called by the grave or something of that sort for protection. I'd rather run more interesting cards, but I figured after testing that Called, Impermanence, or one of the alternatives from side deck are pretty needed. Originally I ran Pendulum Switch, which is particularly good for finishing off with a scaled Reiji, or returning a scaled Bright Armageddon etc. It was just too slow.  WHY NOT CLEAR WING etc?  It's common that people try to bring out Clear Wing + Siegfried on turn one. Those two are great together, but you commit your whole hand to those two cards and are left with nothing else because you cannot play Gilgamesh if you want Clear Wing.  I opt for a less impactful first turn board, but having scales set for follow-up turns and Gilgamesh on board to allow a backup if he is destroyed. My favourite card to bring out on turn 1 is High King Ceasar + whatever else you can pull off.  Just remember that the point of this deck is to set up your board and grave and keep options open. Some cards encourage OTK plays but those are very situational. Your Contract with the Gate becomes extremely strong after turn 1 and to fully exploit the optionality of the deck you need to keep scales (or at least one scale) and a well set up extra deck and grave.  Of course, any suggestions are welcome. I have loads of fun with this deck, and hope you do too."

Duh the best plant in a game because its almost any plant in a game. You re-abuse it with super accessible World Legacy succession in certain combos. Check the vid to see a long 1 card lonefire  / Scorpio combo.</li>  	<li>3x Scorpio. What lonefire summons early on atleast. You all know the drill</li>  	<li>1x Darling cobra. Just 1 the deck is a bit streched rather then being at 40 cards tho, you shouldn't draw it often</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Glow-up bulb"">Glow-up bulb</a>. Forget the whole once per duel you lowkey wanna see it so its at 2. Revives itself, sometimes you can sack something worthy</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Spore"">Spore</a>. Essential for Borreload Savage plays. Rose Dragon engine can typically set that up. I used to run 2 but its not Independent as bulb. Revives itself</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""World Carrotweight champion"">World Carrotweight champion</a> - This is what you send of White Rose Dragon. So it gets accessed in most combos. Works well with dangers</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Naturia Rosewhip"">Naturia Rosewhip</a>. Aroma link and needlefiber can both summon this card. Also since Lonefire is re usable lots of times, basically once you get good at this deck your combos ll start extending and you ll be ending on Rosewhip on top of strong boards already. <strong>Your opp can activate 1 spell / trap per turn</strong></li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Rose Fairy"">Rose Fairy</a> - If this card is added from the deck to the hand you can ss it. Soo a Red Rose dragon which you always access via Fiber ll end up floating into this card, you either search this or a target for Carrotweight champion, depending on combo but both are needed for some combos. works with dangers.</li> </ul> Rose Dragons &amp; Aroma stuff <ul>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""White Rose Dragon"">White Rose Dragon</a>. This card + any level 1 tuner is a full combo, its a free summon if you control a plant tuner / dragon tuner which this deck spamms so yeah</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Red Rose Dragon"">Red Rose Dragon</a>, hello Needlefiber. This card molds your extradeck to be full of Plants &amp; Dragon Synchros</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cross Rose Dragon"">Cross Rose Dragon</a> - The fact that its a dragon matters for Hieratic link, floating effect is really cute specially with Aroma garden since it can sacrifice tokens. You can summon Aromaseraphy monsters which can all produce some disruption along with the trap. Quick effect, Typically good fall back plan tbh.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a> (Link) - You actually use this card all the time. Any 1 card combo sooner or later reaches this card. Fantastic card, if your LP are higher battle immunity to itself and Plants it points to (Rose whip, other Aroma synchros). Ofc it has Lonefire effect</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Rosemary"">Aromaseraphy Rosemary</a> - If you gain LP negates an eff. If your LP are higher + 500 to all plants you got</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a> - If you gain LP pops a card. Searches on synchro summon (Triggers of Cross Rose), if your LP are higher  Opp can't target, searches certain aroma trap which gives you lifepoints by returning plants to deck / sending em to grave. Also can revive aroma by paying 1000</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a> - Card above searches it, its it continuous Trap card. Heals by only 500 so you can swap out Trickclown for bigger Aromage engine / Lightsworn Wulf if one wishes, but trickclown has higher early game consistency so I opted for that (Ofc brill fusion is in the deck)</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Garden Rose Maiden"">Garden Rose Maiden</a> - Searches a card which often time revives it (Garden Rose maiden) which is already a plus... on top of that it can revive Dragon synchros (Like crystal wing) or your maindeck rose dragons. You summon it mid combo for plussing</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a> - let there be plants</li> </ul> Dangers! <ul>  	<li>You don't need to many (even if they stop being semi-limited). You want level variety for synchro plays, so 2 Nessie, 2 Jackalope (best one), 1x Mothman, 1x Chupacabra (Yes I wanted 2 level 4s). Some cards in a deck benefit from being in graveyard.

Firstly, they can access generic Fusion Monsters without needing polymerisation  or other off-archetype cards. Secondly, only one Aleister is needed to produce an unending stream of Invoked monsters. Thirdly, the ability to banish monsters from either Graveyard means it is possible to deny your opponent a chance to recycle important monsters while possibly gaining an unusual attribute for your Summon. Finally, the ability to banish other monsters from one's own Graveyard means it is possible to use the monsters on the field for a link summon, before getting a second use from them."

Many ""Dark World"" monsters gain extra effects if discarded by an opponent's effect. They are based around effects that activate when they are discarded from the hand to the graveyard by a card effect. The ""Danger!"" archetype aims to amass card advantage from the effects of the ""Danger!"" monsters, that force the opponent to discard a card from the ""Danger!"" player's hand. The strategy consists in the ""Danger!"" monsters revealing themselves in their owner's hand to activate their effects, then ""hiding"" in the hand again, making the opponent randomly discard a card from their opponent's hand. If they fail to ""catch"" the ""Danger!"" monster, the monster is Summoned and a card is drawn. If they do ""catch"" the ""Danger!"" monster, it triggers its discard effect, which varies from Special Summoning a ""Danger!"" monster from the Deck to destroying a card on the field. As such, the competitive potential of the Deck lies in the fact that activating a ""Danger!"" monster's effect will only rarely be a disadvantage to their user. Summoning several ""Danger!"" monsters in a turn isn't difficult and they can quickly perform an OTK, especially when combined with other archetypes, such as ""Dark World"", whose effects activate when they are discarded."

The ""Danger!"" archetype aims to amass card advantage from the effects of the ""Danger!"" monsters, that force the opponent to discard a card from the ""Danger!"" player's hand. The strategy consists in the ""Danger!"" monsters revealing themselves in their owner's hand to activate their effects, then ""hiding"" in the hand again, making the opponent randomly discard a card from their opponent's hand. If they fail to ""catch"" the ""Danger!"" monster, the monster is Summoned and a card is drawn. If they do ""catch"" the ""Danger!"" monster, it triggers its discard effect, which varies from Special Summoning a ""Danger!"" monster from the Deck to destroying a card on the field. As such, the competitive potential of the Deck lies in the fact that activating a ""Danger!"" monster's effect will only rarely be a disadvantage to their user. Summoning several ""Danger!"" monsters in a turn isn't difficult and they can quickly perform an OTK, especially when combined with other archetypes, such as ""Dark World"", whose effects activate when they are discarded."

ANCIENT GEAR BALLISTIC SHOOTER DESKBOTS.,"Deck in action &gt;<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxF0BHj1M8</a>  Card ratio explanations below:  Deskbots <ul>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> - Tuner of the deck, revives itself whenever 2 machines are summoned in the same time (Pendulum summon, Machine dup, Urgent schedule). One is really all you need, he enables Nat beast. Gains 500 for each machine (most of the deck is machine)</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Deskbot 002"">Deskbot 002</a> - Usually the most summoned deskbot, on summon searches a deskbot card (but there are no <strong>good</strong> deskbot spells / traps yet). Not OPT. He is so often summoned that a deck consistently abuses Mannequin cat. 500 + to all machines (most of your extra deck is machine). Reliant on other cards</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">Deskbot 003</a> - The best normal summon in the deck, on summon summons another one from the deck. Quickplay attack boost of 500x deskbot cards you control. Easily the best card in your deck</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Deskbot 004"">Deskbot 004</a> - The best advantage maker in a deck, if he ever destroys a monster by battle you should win that game because he gets to swarm to then indirectly from the deck and from grave / hand. Gets huge by itself so can swing everything, Triggers Genius but not 001, can set another 004 for attack with 006</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Deskbot 005"">Deskbot 005</a> - Its all you need to make the infinity. Now there is a combo with triple 005 but thats a win more and it downgrades your decks consistency, yes 005 + machine dupe is weaker if you just play 2 but it doesn't matter there are 4 fantastic machine dup targets in a deck already. Revives when popped in scale</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Deskbot 006"">Deskbot 006</a> - This card scale matters more then 005 because it the opposite scale of Guitaars, but its really not the best draw, luckily the Ancient Gear link gives you more plusses so you end on a full scale way more often then before. Adds back deskbot card when popped in scale</li> </ul> I am not running 007, 008, 009. They are all bad bricks. Atleast 006  sets up for next turn with its add back. 008 can be cute in lategame when your graveyard is full but she overlaps with Infinitrack tunneler anyway, Redirecting targeting to itself doesn't matter no deskbot is to problematic to deal with other then in battle. 007 is just horrid scale as it works badly with guitars, by far the worst one. 009 is only good if you want a 1 card Djet with schedule or if you want to overkill your opponent, not enough uses.  Gear &amp; Track Engine <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Geargiauger"">Geargiauger</a> - This is 1 card GGX / AGear link. It plus around 15 cards in a deck (2 card combos) equals infinity. Restrictive but ups the deck consistency.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Geargiaccelerator"">Geargiaccelerator</a> - Its the brick you need for auger, if you open both its amazing</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Ancient Gear Wyvern</a> - On summon searches ancient gear card (Ancient gear box) when ancient gear box is added to your hand you can search any machine with either 500 atk or 500 defense from your deck to your hand (Hi deskbots and infinitracks)</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Ancient Gear Box</a> - Works if added from graveyard to hand discard it with guitaars revive it with Musashy or GGX, put it back in a deck with Tunneler</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""GearTown"">GearTown</a> - This card can be searched by link, it allows the link to drop a monster on top of searching 500/500 stuff when going second. You can also pop it with 005 or breaksword</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Catapult"">Ancient Gear Catapult</a> - If you can resolve this you have the infinity. I used to run it at 3 but now that we got Ancient gear link, Ancient gear engine is way more commonly used so I decided to cut 1. Works with all the scales (more consistent then in pure Agears tho not to consistent, 2 is like perfect). Graveyard effect comes in handy to, for link climbing popping 005, 006. Opening a way to resolve this card is great</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Infinitrack Tunneller"">Infinitrack Tunneller</a>  - has 500 defense. Tribute an earth machine to ss him. level 5 helps with infinity. Has Pot of Avarice eff for earth machines, which 97% of a time you get to proc turn 1 hopefully drawing handtraps.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a> - Summons an earth machine from your hand on summon. just some swarming potential. has 500 defense.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Super express Bullet Train"">Super express Bullet Train</a> - Adds back an Earth machine at the end phase. Works with Qli Genius (Which is a lot more consistent due to new Ancient Gear link, also works with Urgent schedule. If you control an Earth Machine you can just summon him...... whats not to like.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Urgent Schedule</a> (THIRD sided) - Works only going second so just 2 in a maindeck. Triggers 001 as mentioned. Tuneller, 001, Train - best targets</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Symphonic engine <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Symphonic warrior Guitaars"">Symphonic warrior Guitaars</a> - Summons a tuner or / additonal normal summon from the deck</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Symphonic warrior Mics"">Symphonic warrior Mics</a> - Additional normal summon + level 5 machine. 2300 atk, if youd raw it with Guitaars you have a full scale</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Symphonic Warrior Drumss"">Symphonic Warrior Drumss</a> - can become earth which is relevant for some Links and nat beast. level 2 tuner</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Other <ul>  	<li>Level 3 tuner handtraps (I run 5) - That way if you draw Mic + Guitaars you can pend summon them atleast</li> </ul> 3x <a data-name=""Machine duplication"">Machine duplication</a> - 003, Geargiauger, 004 + dup = infinity, 002, 005 if desperate.  &nbsp;  Extra deck Mandatory <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a> - Evolution is beautiful</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> - You summon this card more then Cyber Dragons do.

I remember buying cards online one day and coming across a Level 6 DARK Machine Monster called <a data-name=""Timeater"">Timeater</a>.  The effect of Timeater simply stated that if it destroyed an opponent's monster by battle, your opponent would skip their Main Phase 1. A pretty unique effect if I do say so myself. I obviously knew the card wasn't great, but I simply <em>had</em> to build a deck based around it one day.  After failing miserably at a Regional with Tribute Stun, I focused a bit more of my time on building a Timeater deck. Around this time I had also discovered a Spell Card called <a data-name=""Terminal World"">Terminal World</a> which prevents both players from getting their second Main Phase. With these two cards, you can essentially skip your opponent's turn by destroying one monster, as your opponent is forced to go straight to their Battle Phase and then straight to their End Phase, meaning that the only cards they can play are Quick-Play Spells and Traps.  As I mentioned previosly, I had taken a Tribute Stun deck to a Regional, that deck comprised of a fairly large Monarch Engine, so I essentially rebuilt that deck but with Timeater in mind, and the decklist you can see on this page is the result of a lot of theorizing and playtesting.  The most basic way you can lock your opponent out of their turn requires an admittedly fairly specific board setup and 3 cards in your hand (only 1 of which is searchable). Those cards are <a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a>, Timeater and Terminal World, you also need a monster to tribute and your opponent cannot have a monster whose ATK is 1900 or more. Here is how to do the lock: <ol>  	<li>Tribute a monster to summon Timeater (you can also Tribute your opponent's monster if you have Stormforth).</li>  	<li>Play Black Garden and then Terminal World.</li>  	<li>Attack into your opponent's monster with Timeater. When the monster is destroyed Timeater's effect will activate, skipping the opponent's next MP1.</li>  	<li>Your opponent passes their turn</li>  	<li>You now need to summon any monster to your field without tributing Timeater, Black Garden will activate giving your opponent a token.</li>  	<li>Attack into the token, Timeater will activate again.</li>  	<li>Your opponent skips their turn.</li>  	<li>When it comes back to your turn you can now Tribute Summon for a Monarch or summon another low-level monster and keep the lock going.</li> </ol> Is it convoluted? Yes. Is it fun? Heck yeah.  Let me explain some specific choice cards and potential deck changes that could've been made:  <a data-name=""Caius the Shadow Monarch"">Caius the Shadow Monarch</a>: You can't rely soley on Timeater for the deck to work, you have to run some actual good monsters and Caius was still somewhat decent at the time when I played this deck. It's just good removal.  <a data-name=""Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch"">Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch</a>: I ran this specifically because it's good for the lockdown. Seeing as the Monarchs have mandatory effects, Caius isn't so good if your opponent doesn't have backrow, Thestalos however can be played regardless of what field your opponenet has. Hand Piercing also can be used outside of the combo to restrict the opponent. You can side out Thestalos for other Monarchs/Tribute Monsters if you're up against a deck that plays a lot of GY effects.  <a data-name=""March of the Monarchs"">March of the Monarchs</a>: This can definitely be replaced with <a data-name=""Return of the Monarchs"">Return of the Monarchs</a> if you like. My logic at the time of building this deck was that I have a lot of draw power as it is so it's very unlikely that I don't see any of my Tribute Monsters, so protection was probably a better idea for certain matchups.  <a data-name=""Chicken Game"">Chicken Game</a>: This was a card I didn't run in my Regional deck, but it makes a lot more sense to run, especially considering that I'm played 3 Terraforming and 3 Black Gardens anyway. I can simply get all the draws that I want and then prevent my opponent from using it by setting Black Garden.  <a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a>: Outside of the lock, this card is also pretty useful in other ways. It can create a small barrier for you if your opponent does a lot of Special Summoning, filling up your field with Tokens, and also those Tokens can be Tributed for Timeater or a Monarch if you need to. I'd recommend shutting off Black Garden first though. Another admittedly situational use would be if there are 3 Tokens on the field, you can destroy them to summon back 1 Monarch from your GY, giving more Tribute Fodder or Damage Output.  <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a>: This was simply the last card I threw in, I built the deck specifically to go against Pendulum decks (which were mostly Majespecter at the time) and Solemn Warning hard counters them, but it's also just useful in general. However you can literally change this card up with anything else you want, be it another Monarch, a different Trap, more draw power etc.  The Extra Deck almost doesn't matter with this deck, hence why there are the Utopia cards in there, the only monsters I remember going into were <a data-name=""Gauntlet Launcher"">Gauntlet Launcher</a> and <a data-name=""Slacker Magician"">Slacker Magician</a>. Just play whatever Rank 6s you want.  And that's about it for this list, it's outdated now but at the time it managed to get me 3rd Place at my locals. I remember going up against someone playing Pendulums and locking them out for 5 turns which was pretty neat. But for the most part it plays like a basic Monarch Deck with Black Garden.

To support this, I added trap trick (works with generaider battle), lonefire blossom (works with mardell), and other generic draw cards. Generaider monsters used can be varied depends on your build, my personal choice is utgard (banishes things).  Next step is to make ip masquerena. Many engine can be used to summon this, but I chose trickstar and sangan. Trickstar has a lot of synergies, from candina is one card link 2 with corobane also searches reincarnation that can lock people with droll&amp;lock bird, light stage is searchable with terraforming too. For the sangan part, I accompanied it with the mentioned corobane and tour guide from underworld to make masquerena, sangan also searches droll and other handtraps if you happened to have droll already.  Now continuing to the real play, this deck often works on opponent's turn. I will explain phase by phase.  Draw phase: opponent's normal draw can trigger the field spell effect, so we can summon a generaider from deck+token to fill monster zone if the said generaider is summoned. The generaider summoned can be anything depends on situation (preferably utgard).  Standby phase: droll is online now, you can use its effect after resolving generaider battle. If you have trickstar reincarnation set, you can activate it before droll (activate generaider battle, on different chain: activate generaider field, chain trickstar reincarnation, chain droll) and voila trickstar hand ripping combo.  Main phase: your masquerena becomes online, it's preferred to summon generaider before main phase so u can link masquerena off in response to opponent's action. Card pool for masquerena to summon is many, as we have full field (tokens too). I prefer to summon knightmare to disrupt or unchained abomonation for big body and clearing boards.  Battle phase: if you dont have masquerena, this is the time to disrupt before they attack. You can activate generaider battle to activate field and do basic generaider combo then disrupt your opponent.  Main phase 2: not much, just watching them setting backrows.  End phase: unchained abomination works here, it destroys a card and if you still have generaider token, its destruction will trigger unchained abomination. So, 2 cards popped in the end phase.  Last but not least, the support/staples. Handtraps (good for disrupting, going second, also a link fodder with corobane), one day of peace (can trigger generaider field while giving you no damage if they battle your token), extravagance (draw cards, tested, you dont need most of the extra deck anyway), impermanence (handtrap, another target for trap trick), solemns (to prevent getting nibiru'd during your opponent's turn), cosmic cyclone (backrow removal), and called by the grave (negates hand traps).  Extra deck: preferably 3 copies each for the key cards (unchained abomination, masquerena, and knightmares) because extravagance, almiraj to trigger normal summoned sangan.  Side: depends on your matchup"

The deck is pretty consistent but relies a lot on searching so disruption can really break you. You want to set up the same board of Eternal Soul and Dark Magical Circle every game so playing some negates helps you get there. You do a lot of your summoning and tricks on your opponents turn.  I would never call this deck is competitive or strong but it is a lot of fun to play and you can really disrupt you opponent.  Between the Magician Navigations, Eternal Souls, and Magician of Dark Illusion you can easily summon a Dark Magician every turn and banish their cards if Dark Magical Circle is in play.  Using the Eye of Timeaus to summon Dark Magician The Dragon Knight protects your backrow and is in turn protected by the Eternal Soul creating a pretty tough board to deal with.  Make sure to take advantage of looping your Magicians Rods. When you summon a Dark Magician with Eternal Soul or Magician Navigation on your opponents turn, you can sacrifice it after it's summoned to grab a Magicians Rod. Rinse and repeat."

Raphion will only work in this case if your opponent has a monster with atleast 2000 atk assuming your opponent still has 8000 LP. Then you can use Michion and Raphion together in a situation like that  Sangan and Time Maiden are deck thinners as they will make the job faster  Although a FTK/OTK deck, it will still function pretty well in case you don't get the right cards at the right time. In that case you can use Time Maiden's powerful effect to her full potential  <strong>Strengths</strong>  Pretty much any deck that focuses on heavy beatdown and lacks the right defences to ""destroy"" the Timelords(Im looking at you Blue Eyes)  <strong>Weaknesses</strong> <ul>  	<li>Decks that focus on banishing instead of destroying</li>  	<li>Decks that negate effect monsters rendering Timelords completely useless</li>  	<li>Cards that tribute opponents monsters( F'ing Kaijus man)</li> </ul> <strong>In conclusion</strong>  I usually wait for a couple of turns to get the right cards and If I don't in that amount of time.I tend to play the game without focusing on achieving an OTK  Just so you know.A Blue Eyes Deck is completely powerless against this deck and there is like only one card that I know can be a problem dealing with it in The Blue Eyes Archetype.But people don't normally summon it so...moving on  You are free to change the cards in the deck to your playing style but if you have any ideas on how to improve it. Let me know  <strong>Quick Update</strong>  You can substitute Raphion with Sandaion if you do want to rely on your opponents monsters which will deal its own 2000 effect damage.The downside to this is that Sandaion is not really easy to search out through the deck buts its a small price to play. The fun part is that if somehow an opponent negates Sandaion's effect,they must now worry about the 4000 beatstick which got summoned with no tributes whatsoever, So Sandaion can still protect itself with its massive stats from battle(or used against you so becareful)"

I've seen most of the post chaos impact Tenyi have dropped the normal monsters, I kept them with the addition of Angel Trumpeter, I hope in the next set we see a Tenyi rank 4 normal monster along side the new big boss that protects your effect monsters.  The Danger! monsters are used as draw and dump support for the Tenyi in hand, its a win win with Mothman and Nessie if you get a monster dumped or if they do. Danger! cards are a bit to generic but I like the way they interact with the monsters in the deck more than just dumping 10 cards with Pot of Desires. I play tested this against Dragon of Red-Eyes and didn't have to bad of a time. I'm in the process of getting the deck core for Tenyi to start taking to locals, not too bad price point wise."

Davinator1212","I haven't had time to upload this deck profile because I've been busy this entire week but now I am able to upload it! Last weekend I went 6 rounds undefeated with my Pure Thunder Dragons deck at the Brooklyn NYC Regional and lost to an Altergeist player round 7 only because he won the die roll, then I lost to pure orcust and then won against another pure orcust, leaving my record at X2 and placing 13th place. This decklist is really good and doesn't really brick, if you know how to play this deck properly you can turn any hand into full combo, leaving you with at least a Titan and a Colossus which is normally enough to get you through your opponent's turn when you go first. With a really busted hand you can end with Apollousa, a Titian and/or Colossus. There are 2 ways to get this end result. The first is to summon <a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a> to mill <a data-name=""Thunder Dragonroar"">Thunder Dragonroar</a> and then using <a data-name=""Thunder Dragonhawk"">Thunder Dragonhawk</a> in hand to summon the Roar from grave and get a token from Solar. Then tribute the token (since it is level 1) to get Linkurbioh in the extra monster zone. Then tribute Roar for Colossus and activate Roar to summon <a data-name=""Thunder Dragondark"">Thunder Dragondark</a>. After that use Colossus, Dark, Solar and Linkurbioh to bring out Apollousa, then use Dark to get <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Fusion"">Thunder Dragon Fusion</a> to get out Titan. The second way is doing all the same steps except whenever you summon Roar instead of going into Linkurbioh, use the Token and Roar to go into Lambda or Some Summer Summoner and special Dark off Roar then use those 3 for Apollousa. Also I really liked <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a>, its an instant win against orcust and basically any other deck besides the mirror match. D. Shifter plus Batteryman Solar is full combo without Hawk. A lot more is explained in my deck profile from Davinator1212 since he was nice enough to give me a deck profile! The link is down below and I hope you guys enjoy this deck. Stick around for more :).  &nbsp;  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhXtViB-JrM</a>  ^^^^^^^^^^^  My Top 16 Brooklyn Regional Deck Profile"

Don't expect anything from me. I made this just for fun :D</h4> &nbsp; <h2>Why Traptrix ?</h2> For the first time I heard about that Deck was on ""DevPro"". There was one guy who summoned ""Traptrix Myrmeleo"". My thoughts at that moment: ""Nice Artwork and a really nice effect. Why not build a Traptrix Deck ?  And at that day I read all the cards and tried to build a deck. 2 years ago I played ""Naturia Sacred Tree"". It special summoned an insect from the deck by tributing a plant. And it works also reverse (tribute plant, special insect) But now we have <strong>Traptrix Sera</strong> (she made this deck so srong!)  &nbsp; <h2>Pros</h2> + <strong>Great</strong> 1st turn boards  + Summon <strong>Traptrix Sera</strong> and profit!  + <strong>""Trap Trick""</strong> searches every trap you need <em>(but activate wisely!)</em>  + If your normal summon gets negated, that's no problem! <em>(because of Sera)</em>  + 1 Traprtrix monster + Shade Brigandine =<strong> Easy 2 card combo</strong>  + Sera is <strong>unaffected</strong> by trap effects <em>(if link summoned)</em>. That makes her really strong!  + <strong>Traptrix Rafflesia</strong> protects your Traptrix monsters! <em>(targeting, destruction)</em>  &nbsp; <h2>Cons</h2> - <strong>Weak</strong> against strong board decks  - If you can't summon <strong>Sera</strong>, you will have a hard time!  - You can easily make wrong choices <em>(miss timing, don't pay attention to your opponents cards, activate ""holes"" too early)</em>  - Weak against Denk Sekka <em>(rip traps)</em>  - If you don't see a Traptrix monster in your opening hand, you don't get card advantage  &nbsp; <h2>Why am I playing ""these"" cards ?</h2> <strong>- Artifact Moralltach ... </strong>Moralltach can be summoned by Artifact Sanctum <em>(obviously). </em>The good thing about that card is: It protects your <strong>Sera </strong>against battle <em>(special in battle phase to destroy your opponents monster)</em>  <strong>- 3x Traptrix Atrax ... </strong>Atrax is underrated. She can out <strong>""Red Reboot"" </strong>and that's awesome!! Reboot says, <strong>if the trap was negated, then... . </strong>If Atrax is on the field, normal trap cards activation and effects <strong>can not</strong> be negated. And you can also activate ""holes"" from your hand. Thats pretty neat! <strong>Traptrix Mantis</strong> can bounce your set ""hole"" and <strong>Atrax</strong> can activate it immediately!  <strong>- Compulsory Escape Device ... </strong>It says that each player have to choose 1 monster they control <em>(""choose"" is not target!!). </em>If you choose <strong>Sera</strong>, nothing happens to her and the opponents monster is shuffled into the deck <em>(it's really strong against many monsters nowadays). </em>Sera is <strong>unaffected</strong> by <strong>ALL</strong> trap effects. That means you can trigger Sera's special summon effect whenever you can.  <strong>- Galatea, the Orcust Automaton + Thunder Dragon Colossus ... </strong>Cherry targets <em>(obviously). </em>You have space in your extra deck.  <strong>- Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon ... </strong>Waking the Dragon ?  <strong>- Treacherous Trap Hole ... </strong>Many Traptrix players don't play this hole but <strong>I LOVE</strong> this card. You can search that card 1st turn with <strong>Myrmeleo </strong>and link summon to Sera. If your opponent has <strong>2 monsters</strong> on the field, thats great! <strong>Destroy</strong> these monsters and trigger Seras effect. But what if your opponent just has <strong>1 monster</strong> on the field ? Just target <strong>it</strong> and <strong>Sera</strong> <em>(she triggers and stays on the field)</em>, then you can special ""Dionaea"" from the deck and she sets the hole to your side (I don't recommend doing this, unless you are 100% sure that your opponent ends his turn)  &nbsp; <h2>Pro Tips</h2> <ul>  	<li>If you have <strong>Sera</strong> on the field and <strong>a trap card that can be activated</strong>, then you have a MST that turn. You can activate Lost Wind, the regular Compulsory and target Sera. Her effect activate to <strong>special</strong> a Traptrix monster from the <strong>deck</strong> <em>(Myrmeleo). </em>She can <strong>destroy</strong> a spell/trap on your opponents side. <em>(Sera's other effect triggers to set a hole from deck). </em>That tip is usefull especially against field spells or pendulum scales.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Always use <strong>Traptrix Mantis'</strong> effect in the <strong>end phase</strong> on your opponents turn if you have <strong>Sera</strong> on the field. You can target a ""dead"" trap card and <strong>DO NOT</strong> set that card <strong>because </strong>in your turn you can give the hole, <strong>that was set from Sera</strong>, to your hand and then you can set these 2 cards in <strong>any</strong> order you like. Your opponent <strong>DID NOT</strong> know where these traps are. Mantis can also <strong>""reset""</strong> the holes that was set from <strong>Dionaea </strong>last turn <em>(it prevents from banishing)</em></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li> <h3><em><strong>2 card combo</strong></em></h3> </li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><strong>Normal summon a Traptrix</strong>  <em>(best is Myrmeleo)</em></li> </ul> -&gt; <ul>  	<li>Link summon to <strong>Sera</strong></li> </ul> -&gt; <ul>  	<li> Set Shade Brigandine<strong> then activate it immediately</strong></li> </ul> -&gt; <ul>  	<li><strong>Sera special Mantis</strong> <em>(you <strong>always</strong> special her because you can easily set a<strong> trap and activate her bounce effect</strong> to trigger <strong>Sera</strong>. If you have <strong>0 traps</strong> in hand, just special summon Myrmeleo and <strong>trigger</strong> Myrmeleos effect. <strong>IT WORKS</strong>)</em></li> </ul> -&gt; <ul>  	<li><strong>Trigger</strong> Seras <strong>other</strong> effect to set a hole from deck -&gt; XYZ to <strong>Rafflesia</strong></li> </ul> -&gt; <ul>  	<li>Set all your <strong>traps</strong> and thats it!</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2><strong>Match-ups</strong></h2> <ul>  	<li><strong>vs. Sky Striker ´... </strong>You can easily play against <strong>""There Can Be Only One""</strong>. Normal summon <strong>Dionaea</strong> <em>(plant)</em>, special<strong> Mymeleo</strong><em> (insect)</em> to destroy that card</li>  	<li><strong>vs. Thunder Dragon ... </strong>Side<strong> ""Time-Space Trap Hole"" </strong>to return them to the extra deck. And try to let him <strong>no thunder</strong> monsters on the field!</li>  	<li><strong>vs. True Draco ... </strong>Easy match-up. Just destroy the field spell and they can't do much.<strong> Sera</strong> and <strong>Rafflesia</strong> were <strong>unaffected</strong> by thei<strong>r continious traps</strong> and <strong>Rafflesia</strong> also <strong>force</strong> him to target her. Play <strong>3 Bottomless</strong> and win.</li>  	<li><strong>vs. Cyber Dragon ... </strong>Don't let him <strong>contact fuse</strong> with <strong>Sera</strong>. If you follow this rule you<strong> win</strong>. (xD)</li>  	<li><strong>vs. Dino ... </strong>You have a hard time against this deck. Miscellaneousaurus ist just too strong. Your holes are pretty much dead.

Coming in Mystic Fighters set.","Mathmech Processor Final Sigma is a synchro lv12 which can be summoned via malefic engine (surprsingly, it's the only lv12 synchro target for malefic archetype).  First step is to aim for the cards like malefic cyber-end dragon on hand and parallel gear on field. To acompolish this, you can use paradox gear effect. Paradox gear is easily searched/summoned by cards like: malefic world, malefic selector (read its condition first), one for one, where arf thou (using sky striker token as condition), and platinum gadget (summoned using sky striker engine).  As a secondary strategy, this deck can use basic malefic beat-up. So, you need field spell to acommodate that. Field besides malefic world, like sky striker area zero (searchable with engage) and trickstar lighstage (searchable with candina, good for going 2nd) are recommended. Malefic territory is a must, as it can search malefic world and disable ur malefc monsters downside effect. Also dont forget terraforming and set rotation.  Aside for summoning platinum gadget, the sky striker engine can be used to break board too. The rest of the main deck are just handtraps or cards used to break board (monster and/or backrow). The cards listed are just example and the ratio is up to you. You can use any break board cards based on matchup/your likings.  Extra deck: mathmech processor final sigma, cyber end dragon, stardust dragon, platinum gadget, hayate, kagari, shizuku, malefic paradox dragon (lv10 synchro), dragocytos nethersoul (big body, another lv10 synchro target for parallel gear+stardust), and the rest are generics with big body or to break board.  PS: some cards are not available on tcg yet (example malefic selector)"

(UPDATED","Odd-eyes archetype is only known as a part of pendulum strategy, but in reality it holds more than just summoning vortex dragon and other 50 negates. Every odd-eyes card has built-in break board/damage dealer effect, this deck will capitalize that sector to its full potential.  Strategy is to have lair of darkness on the field and then tributing opponent's monster for odd-eyes wizard dragon (it floats too, +2). To do that, we need searchers like spiral flame strike (searches lv7 odd-eyes or break board), sky iris (searches odd-eyes monster), terraforming and set rotation (both search lair or sky iris), ahrima (searches lair).  Odd-eyes has variety of cards that we can use as supports, such as odd-eyes dragon (wizard dragon requirement, damage dealer), arc pendulum dragon (extends ur pendulum play), revolution dragon (searches dark dragon pendulum monster), persona dragon (negates extra deck monster effect), odd-eyes mirage dragon (protection, scale 8), pendulum dragon (double battle damage) and odd-eyes fusion (material from extra deck). Other cards to complement this strategy are supreme king package (darkwurm, gates, foolish/dragon shrine; extends pendulum play), darkest diabolos (can be searched with foolish/dragon shrine), pendulum fusion (material from pendulum scale), and phantazmay (dark dragon lv7, fixes hand). The rest of the main deck cards are only to disrupt opponent like handtraps or breaking board cards.
