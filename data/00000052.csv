Because of this, my deck is built with only 3 handtraps (and an additional 6 in the sideboard) and instead uses those slots to help break boards and/or bait out disruption to set up your combo.<br /><br />The theory behind this is that between <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=61884774"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/61884774.jpg"" data-card=""61884774"" data-name=""Yosenju Oroshi Channeling"">Yosenju Oroshi Channeling</span></a>, and <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=18458255"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/18458255.jpg"" data-card=""18458255"" data-name=""Dream Tower of Princess Nemleria"">Dream Tower of Princess Nemleria</span></a> setting up a plus 1 for exactly the cards you need to OTK (that being 1 card scales set up or more large bodies to pendulum summon with those scales), or using <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=57103969"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/57103969.jpg"" data-card=""57103969"" data-name=""Fire Formation - Tenki"">Fire Formation - Tenki</span></a>, <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=37469904"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/37469904.jpg"" data-card=""37469904"" data-name=""Duelist Alliance"">Duelist Alliance</span></a>, <a class=""type-pendulum-tuner-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=92746535"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/92746535.jpg"" data-card=""92746535"" data-name=""Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer"">Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer</span></a>, and <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=58981727"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/58981727.jpg"" data-card=""58981727"" data-name=""Yosenju Sabu"">Yosenju Sabu</span></a> to go plus and set up your pendulum summon partially, all you need to do is use board breakers to deal with the relivant disruptions and punch a hole to resolve your important cards.

Going first, however, sucks and so roughly half of the sideboard is dedicated to playing floodgates and the yosenju countertrap, to try and stun the opponent with relatively one sided effects. The idea is that your monsters are just bigger, and outside of skill drain, you can even bounce them back to your hand MP1, move to battlephase, then reset them MP2.&nbsp;<br /><br />Overall, the deck is supprisingly skill testing to play, and while being basically worse tenpai, it's not so much worse that with tight play and careful sideboarding, I think you could top at least a regional level event with a list like this.</p>"

The unique flavour Yubel offers is that its main Yubel boss monster ""Phantom of Yubel"" contact fuse from the GY, giving the pilot a monster negate and insulates plays from interruption. Phantom's ""negate"" isn't really a negate, it generates more advantage for the duelist by converting your opponent's effect into destroy any Yubel monster from deck instead!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Played together with Unchained, generic fiend support, S:P Little Knight, Apollousa and a healthy amount of lot of staples, Yubel's Fiend Link forms a very competent strategy tier 1 Masterduel strategy!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><br />Want to see the deck in action?

As for the maindeck ""Yubels,"" 3 Spirit of Yubels, 1 Yubel - Terror Incarnate and 1 OG Yubel are used. While they are garnets, they aren't too bad to draw since they can be contact fused in hand to summon Phantom of Yubel or they can be used as a combo piece. A singular One for One also leads to Samsara D Lotus, and it counts as a starter.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">A complementary <strong>SACRED BEAST </strong>engine is used to assist the main Yubel strategy.

It is composed of x3 Opening of the Spirit Gates, x3 Dark Beckoning Beast and x1 Chaos Summoning Beasts. This engine contributes up to 3 extra fiend bodies on field, and more 0/0 fiend monsters to contact fuse Phantom of Yubel with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>STAPLES</strong>&nbsp;featured in this deck are the usual suspects in Masterduel - the 12 card ""Maxx C"" package (3 Ash, 3 Maxx, 2 Called By, 1 Crossout and 2 Gamma + 1 Driver) so that you can come out on top of the ""Maxx C Minigame."" 1 Imperm are popular staples and Crossout targets to negate.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Yubel is a powerful combo deck that can link spam fiend monsters like no tomorrow.

This allows all your Yubel monsters to reflect damage similar to the infamous Mikanko archetype, turning your opponent's powerful cards into their greatest weakness. With this game mechanic, Voiceless Voice and Centur-Ion's 4000ATK/DEF beatsticks are basically freewins!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">As you progress towards whatever win condition you want, your combo lines are typically insulated by Phantom of Yubel's ""monster negate,"" which generates you more advantage.

You get several monster negates, link aways, banishes, and you get an insane resource loop that constantly feeds your hand, field and GY with a lot of resources. With that, you should be&nbsp;able to get ahead of your opponent and win in a grindgame or quickly OTK with overwhelming next turn.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GOING SECOND</strong>, the Yubel strategy features a ton of staples to weaken your opponent's gamestate and alot of gas to enable the duelist to power through interruption. As you combo up, you can contact fuse for Phantom of Yubel to insulate your combo lines. You can link your opponent's cards away with Unchained Soul of Anguish, then banish with S:P Little Knight. Finally, you can leave one of your opponent's high ATK/DEF monsters alive to OTK your opponent with Yubel's Nightmare Pain damage reflection.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></div><ul style=""text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Yubel does a lot of actions that involves having no monsters on the field - meaning that Psy-Frame Gamma is almost always live!

For the price of allowing your opponent to draw 1-2 more cards, you can end on a negate that generates resources so you can have follow-up on the crackback.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Currently, Yubel folds to boardbreakers like Evenly Matched and Triple Tactics Talent.
