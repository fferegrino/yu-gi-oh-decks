This is an attempt to port the deck over to the TCG format. I really like this deck, and in a format of snake-eyes fiendsmith that can play through up to 11 disruptions, a gameplan of breaking boards instead of disrupting them while they are being built feels much more viable. Because of this, my deck is built with only 3 handtraps (and an additional 6 in the sideboard) and instead uses those slots to help break boards and/or bait out disruption to set up your combo.<br /><br />The theory behind this is that between <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=61884774"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/61884774.jpg"" data-card=""61884774"" data-name=""Yosenju Oroshi Channeling"">Yosenju Oroshi Channeling</span></a>, and <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=18458255"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/18458255.jpg"" data-card=""18458255"" data-name=""Dream Tower of Princess Nemleria"">Dream Tower of Princess Nemleria</span></a> setting up a plus 1 for exactly the cards you need to OTK (that being 1 card scales set up or more large bodies to pendulum summon with those scales), or using <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=57103969"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/57103969.jpg"" data-card=""57103969"" data-name=""Fire Formation - Tenki"">Fire Formation - Tenki</span></a>, <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=37469904"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/37469904.jpg"" data-card=""37469904"" data-name=""Duelist Alliance"">Duelist Alliance</span></a>, <a class=""type-pendulum-tuner-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=92746535"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/92746535.jpg"" data-card=""92746535"" data-name=""Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer"">Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer</span></a>, and <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=58981727"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/58981727.jpg"" data-card=""58981727"" data-name=""Yosenju Sabu"">Yosenju Sabu</span></a> to go plus and set up your pendulum summon partially, all you need to do is use board breakers to deal with the relivant disruptions and punch a hole to resolve your important cards.

Going first, however, sucks and so roughly half of the sideboard is dedicated to playing floodgates and the yosenju countertrap, to try and stun the opponent with relatively one sided effects. The idea is that your monsters are just bigger, and outside of skill drain, you can even bounce them back to your hand MP1, move to battlephase, then reset them MP2.&nbsp;<br /><br />Overall, the deck is supprisingly skill testing to play, and while being basically worse tenpai, it's not so much worse that with tight play and careful sideboarding, I think you could top at least a regional level event with a list like this.</p>"
