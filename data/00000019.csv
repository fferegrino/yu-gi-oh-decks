You need to make safer game development where you analyze Risk vs Reward. Playing Dino is having a time advantage in that you prioritize reducing your opponent's hit points as quickly as possible over a long-term game plan. So I'm used to playing Dino with very few engine cards as you can see and having at least 14 tech slots to choose to go second and OTK. You want to end the game still in the Early game because your power peak happens in the first turns having much less time to make the decisive choices of the game and they will have a much bigger impact. That's why you play around global threats and try to find combos and synergies as soon as possible. That said, I want to show you some combos that I don't see anyone doing the right way, which is to take advantage of Misc's protection to make Dolkka as soon as possible and only then play Scrap and end up with the follow-up Omega returning Misc to GY.  Scrap Dino Banlist Combos: to see the replay go to ""duelingbook"" and put the rest of the URL after .com/  Basic Combo playing around handtrap: replay?id=813757-30057365  Archosaur + Baby or Petit (remember Arc + Baby = Ovi + Baby = Misc + Baby = Ovi + Misc - just have a little details in the start but the end board is the same)  Tyranno + Dolkka + Omega + Wyvern + Rex  ou  Full Combo (Don't play around handtraps): replay?id=813757-30057632 Tyranno + Dolkka + Omega + Dweller  Lost World + Oviraptor (does not play around hand trap): replay?id=813757-29666506 = Tyranno + Omega + Wyvern + Raptor Note: in this combo when I skip the Wyvern 1st effect to summon any Scrap and destroy the same Scrap summoned and when I summon the 2nd Raptor I destroy the token in opponent field;  Oviraptor + Babycerasaurus (does not play around hand trap): replay?id=813757-29674813 Basic Combo if you open with 1 Scrap Raptor in hand or don't want to use both Raptor leaving 2nd Wyvern effect alive on opponent's turn: = Tyranno + Dolkka or Laggia + Omega + Wyvern + Chimera When Tyranno effect destroy Chimera you trigger Wyvern effect to special summon and pop  I apologize for linking to a site I shouldn't have but it was the easiest way for me to bring the combos to you, I also understand if this deck profile is removed for those same reasons.  Please comment below anything about this deck profile, I will answer them all."

Doesn't use Rafflesia + Gravedigger's Trap Hole because in my experience it's just not consistent enough- Petingcessouer locks you into Madolche summons and she's pretty much your main combo starter.  &nbsp;  A few Madolche tips I've learned that I haven't really seen anywhere else:  &nbsp;  If you have multiple different starters in your hand (Magiliene, Petingcessour, Anjelly, etc.), my favorite opening move is to tribute Anjelly for Petingcessouer. This already ensures a monster in the GY so you don't need to waste detaching a material for Glassouffle- in fact, you can go into Tiaramisu instead and really start messing up your opponent's board.  If you can get Lightning Storm to work, it's incredible, but even if you don't? Baiting a negate early on like that can be devastating. If you really want to see it do some damage, though, try combining it with Forbidden Droplet or Dark Ruler- those two cards work wonders for Evenly Matched as well.  Do not sleep on Glassouffle's secondary ability. Seriously. Hand getting thin? Recycle an Upstart or Extrav into the deck. Opponent using a lot of annoying Graveyard effects? Shuffle 'em back in. Abyss Dweller can help with that, too.  &nbsp;  I'm totally open to suggestions, especially from those more experienced in the Madolche ways."

That is why Obelisk got thrown in here, he doesn't really synergize with anything in here, and could very well be replaced by another God or any other card.  Slifer, Ra and Ra Sphere Mode are searchable by Thunderspeed Summon. Obelisk can also be summoned by Thunderspeed Summon tho, just not be searched by it.  Summoning Isolde is very easy. Use her first effect to search Infernoble Knight Renaud, and her second effect to discard an Equip Spell from your Deck to special summon Fire Flint Lady right from your deck. This allows you to special summon Renaud from your hand, and it lets you recycle the Equip Spell you just discarded. Now you have 3 monster (and an Equip Spell of your choice) which can be tributed for a god or linked away.  Magnum Shield allows even your normal monsters to become quite the beat sticks. I even used it on Idaten the Conqueror Star and Arcana Knight Joker. But there are a lot of options for Equip Spells, so choose whatever you want.  If Ra is summoned using Ancient Chant and the three Knights as tribute fother, Ra will start out with a whopping 5000 Atk.  Be aware that the recycle effect of all the Poker cards can also be activate be returning a Warrior Extra Deck monster back to the Extra Deck. This allows you to easily summon multiple Isolde and Arcana Extra joker per duel.  &nbsp;"

It can be found here, please take a look at it, it's an awesome deck:  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/mae/"">Mae</a>  Like Mae's original deck, this one too is all about summoning ""<a data-name=""Rose Tentacles"">Rose Tentacles</a>"" and destroying lot's of Rose Tokens with it, while putting out some additional damage with ""<a data-name=""Seed Cannon"">Seed Cannon</a>"". The Sunavalon Linkmonsters help summoning as many Rose Tokens as possible in one go. ""<a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a>"" can be used to search every monster in the deck while ""<a data-name=""Garden Rose Maiden"">Garden Rose Maiden</a>"" serves as your searcher for ""<a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a>"". It also combos with ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" for a field wipe.  This deck is of course a fun 'n' casual only deck and probably not as good as Mae's original. But it's still very enjoyable to play, so I thought I'd share it with you people.  &nbsp;  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/S1qsfqb.png"" alt=""image"" />  Discord: Lucy&#x1f497;&#x1f33a;&#x1f98b;#1508  <a>Reddit</a>  <a>Steam</a>"

It's fairly consistent and brought me much fun in the past.  Also: Edge.,"I always loved Yami Bakura's ""Occult"" deck, using one of the first alternative win conditions: The Destiny Board. All the hilarious censoreships aside, I think it's still until this very day one of the most fun ways to win a duel. I couldn't really find an at least halfway consistant Spirit Message deck which I liked, so I decided to make my own. Anyway, let's get right to my deck.  The way to go and all around goal of the deck is; obviously; bring out all Spirit Message letters and win via the effect of ""<a data-name=""Destiny Board"">Destiny Board</a>"". A very early version I used of it, consisted of just a bunch of stalling cards which definetely is a way to go but a rather inefficient one in my opinion. Trying to get out ""<a data-name=""Curse Necrofear"">Curse Necrofear</a>"" as well as her sister ""<a data-name=""Dark Necrofear"">Dark Necrofear</a>"" as soon as possible and then recycle them with ""<a data-name=""Dark Spirit of Malice"">Dark Spirit of Malice</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Dark Spirit of Banishment"">Dark Spirit of Banishment</a>"" everytime they die is a way better way to go and offers another legitimate winning strategy besides the Spirit Messages. That is of course no reason to not put at least a bit of stall into the mix. ""<a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a>"" is of course a good way to skip an attack from your opponent. ""<a data-name=""Tour Guide From the Underworld"">Tour Guide From the Underworld</a>"" also helps to quickly summon monsters from the extra deck like ""<a data-name=""Number 48: Shadow Lich"">Number 48: Shadow Lich</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a>"" which help you keeping up your defense, while ""<a data-name=""Dark Sanctuary"">Dark Sanctuary</a>"" (with a bit of luck) also keeps your defense up against incoming attacks. Keep in mind that you gotta make your choice if you have Battle Fader in your hand and also Dark Sanctuary on the field. You can only go with one, if you decide to activate Dark Sanctuary once the opponent attacks you, you cannot use Battle Fader for that attack anymore. All around I recommend to always make use of your Battle Fader(s) first and use Dark Sanctuary only as the last possibility.  As for the side deck, I really only go with ""<a data-name=""Draw of Fate"">Draw of Fate</a>"", using it only rarely as a side option when I feel like it since it's a kinda good card for the deck but has a huge downside as well.  &nbsp;  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/S1qsfqb.png"" alt=""image"" />  Discord: Lucy&#x1f497;&#x1f33a;&#x1f98b;#1508  <a>Reddit</a>  <a>Steam</a>"

Additional Zexal support is included for either board control, sapping resources from the deck (in the case of Time Thief Redoer) or building a line of defense. Furthermore, Forbidden Droplet and Dark Ruler No More is included to shut down opportunities for the opponent to retaliate (since the Arcana Knights have a lot of recycle ability now due to Joker's Knight, Joker's Wild, and Joker's Straight). The same goes for other counter tools like Solemn Strike.  &nbsp;  This deck doesn't really support Slifer very well, but Ra works in this just fine. I was running Mound of the Bound Creator before in the main deck, but i decided to move it to a side deck option since Ra and Sphere Mode are really secondary strategies in this deck due to how restrictive they are."

For the agents their new link monster is super helpful as it freely sends Majesty Hyperion from your deck to the graveyard and then if you link it off and banish it you just just got a free boss with no minus. Their new synchro monster is also pretty neat and it’s a tuner as well so halq can summon it. Their new spell is awesome too but I skipped it in this build.  The Despia support is sick as well, the new branded spells are amazing, their new monster is a useful extender, and the new dragon is actually really good for it’s revival and sheer burn that just makes it super pressuring, I’m not disappointed with this support at all and at this rate this deck might actually be super viable in the near future."

While there are plenty of decks out there that utilize Dragon Rulers I feel none of them take advantage of their true potential which is abusing the graveyard and generating unmatched searching power through their best friend Eclipse Wyvern, not to just summon themselves and draw 4 to 5 cards at the end of the turn. This deck builds the nastiest of boards in a consistent basis despite being a 60 card deck because you could literally dump 30+ cards in one turn to the graveyard then go bonkers reviving them and linking them off etc. Anyways I hope you have fun ruining someone else's life playing the baddest of decks ever created hehehe"

Nothing special here.,"<h1>Main Deck Monster - 14</h1> <h5>3x Rescue Cat</h5> Main and best Starter of the deck. Since the send to GY is cost, if it get's ashed, you can Gamma the ash. Be aware of the errata! Most cheaper Rescue Cat Cards are pre-errata and don't state, that the effects of the summoned monsters are negated. <h5>3x Tri-Brigade Fraktall</h5> Searchable with Tenki. Also your Starter. 1900 ATK is also nice sometimes. <h5>3x Tri-Brigade Kitt</h5> Cat Target &amp; extender. It's great to keep a Kitt in Hand for a follow-up next turn or to discard off Twin Twister or Forbidden Droplet in your opponents turn. <h5>3x Tri-Brigade Nervall</h5> Extender &amp; Searcher. Don't burn through them! Only use them, if you're able to use the search effect! <h5>2x Tri-Brigade Kerass</h5> Cat Target and can sometimes unbrick your hand. SS him and discard Kitt or Nervall, and you're good to go. I usually don't really want to have him in my starting hand but rather search him of Nervall. That's why only 2. If you would play Pot of Desires, then I would put him to 3. <h1>Hand Traps - 14 + Driver</h1> Always adapt to the current meta. You have so many space for them... <h5>2x D.D. Crow</h5> If you hit the correct card, it can be really strong. Sometimes it's just nice to have an additional Winged Beast in your GY. Sometimes it comes up, that you have Hraesvelgr, the Desperate Doom Eagle on the field and the opponent has 2 monsters in GY. So D.D. Crow enables the 4800 ATK of Doom Eagle.  Since it's searchable of Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen, you can also put it to 1. <h5>3x Ash Blossom</h5> Still the most versatile hand trap. <h5>3x Ghost Belle</h5> Hits all the current meta decks quite good, especially in a mirror match. So I started to main deck it. <h5>3x PSY-Frame Gamma + 1x Driver</h5> All your starters can be protected by gamma (Cat, Fraktall, Tenki).  Sometimes you can hit a badly timed Artifact Lancea.  Sometimes you can protect a crucial Revolt, when you don't have any monsters on field and it get's ghost belle'd. Just keep in mind, with gamma &amp; driver on the field, you're only able to summon a max link 3, if you don't have a correctly summoned Ferrijit in your GY.  With cards like Ferrijit, Bearbrumm, Double Dragon Lord, Forbidden Droplet &amp; Twin Twister, you have enough usage for dead cards like driver or offline gamma's. <h5>3x Infinite Impermanence</h5> It's really strong in the mirror match. It can't get Gamma'd. Can be beneficial to turn off Floodgates for a turn like Summon Limit.  <strong>For Budget Players: </strong>1:1 replacement would be Effect Veiler. But I would rather recommend playing something like Pot of Desires at 3. <h1>Spell Cards - 7</h1> <h5>3x Fire Formation - Tenki</h5> Searcher for Fraktall. Bait for Ash. Can be later used for Forbidden Droplet or Double Dragon Lord. <h5>2x Forbidden Droplet</h5> The only money card i'm running since I pulled it from the display.  Great going 1st and 2nd. Just set it going 1st and use a dead Apollousa, Tenki or any card that's currently resolving (like Revolt).  Going 2nd, obviously shut down the opponents main threats. If you discard a Nervall or Kitt, you're starting your play at the same moment. That's why I love this card in this deck.  <strong>For Budget Players</strong>: 1:1 replacement is Dark Ruler No More. But it's only usable going 2nd. I would recommend also playing Monster Reborn &amp; Foolish Burial as a extender &amp; starter. Or just use more Hand Traps. After all, why not. <h5>1x Harpie's Feather Duster</h5> I like main decking it, since there are a lot of Subterror and Altergeist players around. Oh and it's your only out to Mystic Mine... <h5>1x Called by the Grave</h5> Main defence against hand traps. Please come back to 3 :( <h1>Traps - 4 (+ 3 Imperm)</h1> Infinite Impermanence is already described in the hand trap section. <h5>3x Tri-Brigade Revolt</h5> The reason, why Tri-Brigade is currently Tier 1. Summons a 3k body with a untarget banish, and is a search, and can recover some banished ressources. Busted.  A lot of people run it at 2 since you're able to search it. But I don't mind drawing into this card. If I already have Revolt in my hand, I can playout my turn differently and don't have to rely on Bearbrumm. <h5>1x Imperial Order</h5> Stops more from the opponent that from yourself. Stops so many strong board-breaking staples. Decks like Sky Striker can give up the duel right away. <h1>Extra Deck</h1> I don't own Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder. If I would, I would definitely look for a way, to play him. He's just so stupidly strong. <h5>3x Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen</h5> Main Beater. Untarget Banish. Searcher if in GY. Just an all around good card. Play it at least at 2. I only play it at 3 because I have the extra deck space for it. <h5>2x Tri-Brigade Rugal the Silver Sheller</h5> Probably the weirdest choice to play at 2. But I actually really like playing him, when I realize it's going to be a grind match. He + Shuraig enables a untarget banish in the opponents main phase. And I play him at 2 because sometimes you need to go into him with a bad start hand in order to link away Ferijit or Bearbrumm. And I have the extra deck space for it. <h5>2x Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</h5> He's really important when you play cat, since you always go into him after the cat summons. That's why I like him at 2. Important: if you correctly linked summoned him of cat's summons, you're able to summon him of revolt to give you an additional draw! <h5>1x Tri-Brigade Bearbrumm the Rampant Rampager</h5> Revolt searcher. That's it. And that's why I only play him at 1. I played him a long time on 2, but I almost never go into him more than once. The second effect comes up sometimes, if I know the opponent doesn't have an interruption and I want to fully commit to my 1st turn board. <h5>1x Topologic Zeroboros</h5> This should be Accesscode Talker if I had one. This slot is just for a good finisher. Zeroboros can get really big the longer the duel goes and can also wipe the field, if you manage to summon a monster in a link area he points to and then go for game in the turn after.  The reason why I budget-picked him over the classic Accesscode replacement Borrelsword Dragon is, that Zeroboros only needs 2+ monster like Accesscode (Tri-Brigade + banish 3 --&gt; Zeroboros), while Borrelsword needs 3+ monsters... <h5>1x Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</h5> Your main going 1st end monster. Usually with 3 negates (2400 ATK) + a set revolt. <h5>1x Hraesvelgr, the Desperate Doom Eagle</h5> Super strong against Drytron, since you can spell speed 2 shuffle back a card from gy.  Can get really beefy, if the opponent doesn't have a monster in GY to finish.  But usually, I'm using him to go into Zeroboros. <h5>1x Ancient Warriors Oath - Double Dragon Lords</h5> Cheap and amazing disruptor. For his effect, you also can use Tenki on the field, or Kitt / Nerval in Hand to extend any play. <h5>1x PSY-Framelord Lambda</h5> The classic card if you main deck PSY-Frame Gamma and have some extra space in your extra deck. Can be anything you want... I just like to go into it, if I have already monsters on the board but a live Gamma in my hand. <h5>1x Salamangreat Almiraj</h5> Unbricker of your hand. If you don't have any starters in your hand, but a Kit or a Nervall, you can send them to the GY to start from there. <h5>1x PSY-Framelord Omega</h5> It comes up quite often, that you can Gamma in your own turn. So a target for that is important. <h1>Side Deck</h1> Nothing special here. Just adjust to the meta. The following Side Deck is built to hit Drytron, Mirror Match (Tri-Brigade), Sky Striker, Virtual World and over all Backrow Heavy Decks, since a lot of Rogue Decks are quite Trap Heavy. <h5>2x Alpha, the Master of Beasts &amp; 1x Dinowrestler Pankratops</h5> Your going 2nd cards. I don't like to main deck any of them. <h5>3x Artifact Lancea</h5> Strong in the Mirror Match. Strong against VW. Can also stop Invoked. <h5>3x Droll &amp; Lock Bird</h5> A must against Drytron, your worst matchup. Maybe catch some Dragon Link variants... But mainly in the side against Drytron. Can also hit Meltdown or Nadir Servant in a Invoked Dogmatika. <h5>3x Twin Twister</h5> Strong against any backrow heavy decks. Force an early Revolt in the mirror match. <h5>2x Anti-Spell Fragrance</h5> Hits almost any deck when you can go 1st. If you're going second, it can still be strong against Sky Striker &amp; Drytron. <h5>1x Red Reboot</h5> I hate Altergeist. And a lot of Rogue Variants of any deck is running a lot of staple traps. And Solemn Strike is arguably the strongest trap card."

It uses synchro summoning to access the extra deck. Therefore it uses zombie tuners with the dark attribute. This attribute is key for the only non-zombie synchro summon. This summons the <a data-name=""Ascension Sky Dragon"">Ascension Sky Dragon</a> which is the highest level synchro summon and the only monster with the light attribute. This is not the most powerful monster in my deck though. The most powerful summons I can utilize are the <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</a> in combination with the <a data-name=""Zombie World"">Zombie World</a> field spell. This makes all monsters on the field or in either graveyard a zombie. Each zombie-type monster in either graveyard adds 100 ATK to the <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</a>. That's not all. When the regular <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</a> destroys a zombie-type monster and sends it to the graveyard, you can special summon that monster on your side of the field. Since <a data-name=""Zombie World"">Zombie World</a> makes all monsters zombies, this applies to the opponents non-zombie monsters as well."

mothman, there are many ways you can have that extra special summon  7-then with winder and that extra monster special summon time thief perpetua, and use her effect to attach time thief flyback from deck to time thief redoer  8-then set the time thief retrograde that you searched  9-during the next opponent's turn standby phase, use both redoer and perpetua to snatch a card off of the opponents deck to get a peak on what they are playing assuming you went first, and special summon winder with perpetua's eff ideally in DEF mode, and search either another time thief retrograde or another time thief regulator to redo this entire combo in case something happened to your board  this was a one card combo, that the entire deck is inspired from it, and if you don't get time thief regulator in hand at first turn, you can still just summon redoer and set the many trap cards that you would probably drawn, if not, than you would have drawn a lot of monsters that will let you summon perpetua as well  the three top extra deck cards i find myself summoning, are redoer, perpetua, and tornado dragon, which gives me a firm control of both the monsters with redoer's spinning eff, and the S/T with tornado dragon, while perpetua provides the materials to do all that  <strong>instructions :</strong>  the main deck monsters are chosen so they would cover the 3 special summoning speeds, speed 1 : special summon while you control nothing (evil swarm mandragora + Danger mothman!+ The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine) , speed 2 : special summon while you control a monster (raidraptor - strangle lanius + time thief adjuster + raider's wing) + speed 3 : is committing to the normal summon which includes all of them  don't always seek to summon zues, zues is a powerful card that should only be used as a last resort, and even before zues, you have evilswarm exciton knight to do the same thing basically  for most games you would be okay just by summoning redoer, perpetua, and tornado dragon, but if you need more or a different type of control, cards like abyss dweller and evilswarm nightmare are available  while facing annoying decks that want to limit your number of monsters, like mystic mine for example, or if you want to unclog your field for some reason, link summon black luster soldier, but while facing mystic mine in particular it is good to have only redoer, because he can escape the field when mystic mine activates, leaving the field empty and mystic mine will self destruct at the end phase  people will want to negate redoer, so if that happens, the best thing is to catch them offguard by using him as a material for vespenato, a piercer with 2500 atk  and if you are facing deck that rely on heavy hitters with big amounts of ATK, then you have utopia the lightning, and arc rebellion xyz dragon, the latter should be reserved to punish the opponent if they commit too much to the board  <strong>final thoughts :</strong>  all and all, practice makes perfect, this deck is so fun, but could be better with each duelist's personal touch, and some support if konami ever remembers time thieves, personally, i would love to see a ROTA for the deck, to increase the chances of getting time thief regulator, and a time thief that would cover special summon speed 1 and 2, with an effect of (if you control no monsters, or if all monster you control are ""Time Thief""  special summon this card from your hand) and it can have a quirky quick effect to tribute itself for a reason, since a lot of time thieves does that, but at the end, i love the deck as it is, and i hope konami remember this unfinished archetype with amazing potential (calm down red-eyes players .. i know you cringe when you hear the word ""potential"" )"

You should always try to bring out your link 2 monster or if you can link 3 monster  evil eye monster since their cost for activating effect only applies to monster on your link zones so if you don't have any monsters on those zones its just 500 atk buff.  So, as for the combo it's simple you want to have serziel or the field spell  so we can search serziel or basilius on our starting hand while serziel being the best, we play 3 of evil eye of selene so we don't have to search it often also, we want to have some extra any evil eye cards for the combo.  The combo is you summon serziel you search for basilius if you don't have it but if you do add evil eye of reemergance  to go into link 3 if you also have evil eye selene, then use basilius effect to send eye of gorgoneio to grave then use gorgoneio effect to discard any  evil eye card  the add any evil eye card you need based on what you have and what you want. Then link summon evil eye empress or ruler of evil eye if you have reemergance then equip evil eye selene.  &nbsp;"

Sky Scourges are few but they are also extremely powerful when hitting the field.  I’ve made this before and it’s super funny to pull off, the best part is that you can also add in a domain lock for GGs  In my opinion this is the most bricky form of monarch but also the most powerful when it goes through."

It is a very standard GOAT Control list, that is teched out to play against Chaos decks.  The main strategy of the deck is to control your opponent with the help of Scapegoat and Thousand-Eyes Restrict and generate advantage with your power spells like Pot of  Greed (even tho I don't exactly know what it does) in combination with Magician of Faith until you beat your opponent.  To some card choices:  I have chosen not to play Morphing Jar. It benefits my opponent (a Chaos deck player) more than me, and I think it is in general too unpredictable.  I would LOVE to include the Phoenix package into the deck, as you can see in the extra deck, but it isn't strong enough against Chaos.  To Exarion:  There is a controversy about if one should include Exarion into the GOAT Format or not. For me, I don't play Exarion, but I don't mind if my opponent does.  The side deck can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!"

Special summon Junk Converter, then synchro summon Junk Speeder, after that, using Junk Speeder's effect special summon: Road Synchron, Steam Synchron, Fleur Synchron and Changer Synchron. Using Junk Speeder, Road Synchron, Steam Synchron and Fleur Synchron, synchro summon Red Supernova Dragon.  &nbsp;  Once you get rid of Road Synchron and Fleur Synchron from your deck and CS from the field, you can activate RSD's quick effect (only triggers when your opponent activates a monster's effect or when they attack), banish all cards your opponent controls but also RSD too. Once this step is complete all you have to do is normal summon Junk Synchron, then special summon Junk Converter from the GY. This will trigger Doppelwarrior (must be in your hand) so special summon him, then synchro summon another Junk Speeder from the Extra Deck using Junk Synchron and Junk Converter as materials. Using Junk Speeder's effect, special summon Junk Synchron and Cyberse Synchron from the deck on to your field. Synchro summon T. G. Hyper Librarian using DW and JS, then using one of DW's tokens and CS, synchro summon Formula Synchron, then draw 2 cards. Once they're all on the field you can then freely synchro summon Stardust Sifr Divine Dragon (if you draw Synchro Chase, activate it then special summon Librarian once the synchro summon of SSDD is complete). If Red Supernova Dragon's effect is activated last turn, during the end phase: special summon him.  &nbsp;  Reload, Magical Mallet, Reinforcements of The Army, Card Destruction and Allure of Darkness should make this a lot easier to pull off.  &nbsp;"

Just spam summons until you get wise strix and force and then you have to make a decicion what to do next. If you feel save, want to summon ultimate falcon and haven't already through last strix and skip force, you want to either(if you already have a rank up in your hand) get launch through wise and activate it(use raider's wings(from wise) for force to strip it from its materials) and make force to stranger falcon, then to arsenal and then destroy it with bardiche or you skip stranger with phantom knights' force(wise) but then you can't link anymore(or you do it last). If you have done this it is possible to also get Borrelsword and one of the XYZ Dragons(if you want requiem with triple negate(in one turn) you can't use phantom knights' force for ultimate) on the field (with luck and training). The other option is to ditch ultimate and fokus on 5 negates with fog blade, phantom knights' claw and requiem. Either way after wise comes bardiche.  (1. Tipp: If you want to go the arsenal falcon route and you already used the second effect of  strange linus and the effect of raider's wings(which you should) summon mimicry through arsenal for extra card search when he is in GY)  I always thought raidraptor is the inferior version of blackwing, because of the many effects that hinder special summons from monsters other than raidraptor, but if you pick the pearls most of them have a second effect other than special summon that puts them on pair with blackwing, sometimes even better (turn not completely ruined because of one negate) which has its own uniqueness.

A simple ""Cyber Art"" deck and yet the one I love the most. Made for fun play.","So, with the new (by me highly anticipated) Cyber Strike Structure Deck coming up, which is really coming closer and closer, I decided to upload my 3rd deck here and my probably most favorite deck of all time: My very own Cyber Dragon deck. I started playing this deck in Legacy of the Duelist and immediately fell in love with it. So much so that I right after playing it for some duels, I had to buy it in real. A deck purely focused on pure beat down and in this category, it's really the John Cena of YuGiOh. On top of that it comes with a good amount of reliable searchers, which makes it very consistent. A deck that had such a strong impact on the game, considered a classic with lovely, modern support. With all this foreshadowing done, I wanna get right to the deck and how it works.  Put the opponents Life Points to zero. Done.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/dQyPg0d.png"" alt=""image"" />  ...Okay, alright. It might not be that inzanely easy. Or is it? First of all, I can definetely assure you, you will never pull a dead hand. If you can't go right into a huge swarm of metallic, flying serpents or a large, purple beatstick, you can at least go into.. A large, blue beatstick? The ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Sieger"">Cyber Dragon Sieger</a>"" (german for ""Winner"") helps you to be safe against every attack from your opponent, as it's a 2100 ATK monster that how ever can just make it's own ATK become 4200 once you or your opponent enters the Battlephase. And it only need's two of your monsters to get it out. Working as a strong monster or as a buffer; being able to give your other ""Cyber Dragon""-monsters the 2100 ATK buff instead of itself; it really is a reliable ""go-first"" possibility. Keep in mind that summoning at least two monsters in one round is basicly guaranteed with this deck. ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Vier"">Cyber Dragon Vier</a>"" (german for the number ""four"") for example can be special summoned from your hand once you summon another ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>"", which is basicly every card in your deck due to the Cyber Dragon monsters effects of becoming <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a> in your graveyard or on the field. Another possibility is via ""Cyber Dragon Core"", which uppon summoning let's you search every single ""Cyber""-Spell/Trap card. Searching for ""<a data-name=""Cyber Revsystem"">Cyber Revsystem</a>"", which then let's you summon a (indestructable) monster. This of course is not the only way to get out your metal beasts, but one example. So as you can see, going out of your round will most likely not go without you having a bunch of monsters out or one very strong monster. While the monsters absorbing ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>"" or the Winning Link machine are powerful monsters already, the stuff that really makes the deck are the huge Fusion Monsters of course. ""<a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a>"" is a 2800 monster classic that can attack twice per Battlephase while ""<a data-name=""Chimeratech Overdragon"">Chimeratech Overdragon</a>"" can stack this up even further, letting you attack the amounts of time that you used monsters for its Fusion summoning. And of course the legendary ""<a data-name=""Cyber End Dragon"">Cyber End Dragon</a>"" that is easily summoned with ""<a data-name=""Power Bond"">Power Bond</a>"" with 8000 ATK and piercing damage. Just be aware of possible heart attacks when doing so.  Besides Power Bond (which by the way can be searched out with ""<a data-name=""Cyber Pharos"">Cyber Pharos</a>"" which on the other side can be searched out with ""<a data-name=""Cyber Emergency"">Cyber Emergency</a>"") you have ""<a data-name=""Cyberload Fusion"">Cyberload Fusion</a>"" to summon your Fusion Monsters. A good way to get a huge bunch of Cyber Dragons to your banned cards mountain is via ""<a data-name=""Cyber Network"">Cyber Network</a>"". It keeps giving you a fresh supply of banished Cyber Dragons to use with your Cyberload Fusion and if there are Cyber Dragons left bannished once Cyber Networks time is over, you can summon all of them to your field to use to your hearts content, even tho their effects cant be activated. Passive effects s well as those that don't have to be manually activated by you, still work. A little, hidden gem in my eyes is ""<a data-name=""Super Strident Blaze"">Super Strident Blaze</a>"". Aside of the primary effect which you don't have to activate to also not suffer to it's downside, it comes with a passive effect which is always there as soon as you equip it to your Fusion Monster of your choice: Your opponent is locked out of activating effects while you are in your most important phase: the Battlephase.  I'm usually not the person to use much of an Extra deck, but in this case I must say that ""<a data-name=""Iron Call"">Iron Call</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Iron Draw"">Iron Draw</a>"" as well as an additional Cyber Dragon Sieger can be a very good choice. I usually swap those with ""<a data-name=""Cybernetic Revolution"">Cybernetic Revolution</a>"" as well as ""<a data-name=""Cybernetic Hidden Technology"">Cybernetic Hidden Technology</a>"" and sometimes even the Strident Blaze cards. Of course you can switch out every other card as you see fit as well, but that's how I go.  This deck is obviously not made for competitive play in any way and soley made for casual and fun play. Altho with Cyber Dragons still being a deck theme that sees play in competitive YuGiOh, I must warn you. In fun circles this deck might f&#x2665;ck up your friends, as it can be very ... Overwhelming sometimes. Or to say it lightly, a ""weaker"" deck in therms of fun play might not have a really good/fair time against it, due to it's strength and the consistently strong performance. At least on comparison to other fun decks. I hope you still have a good time with it if you decide to try it out. <blockquote><div><em>You'll be the best, so make me proud.</em></div></blockquote> &nbsp;  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/S1qsfqb.png"" alt=""image"" />  Discord: Lucy&#x1f497;&#x1f33a;&#x1f98b;#1508  <a>Reddit</a>  <a>Steam</a>"

First of all it was ahead of its time with a brillant  remover, a non-targeting  and non-destruction  remover. Second of all it’s a OTK machine that was getting better and better along these years, and was a shame to not get a structure deck in the 2019 poll (losing to Shaddoll, Sacred beast and now infamous  Charmer deck). I personally find it a little difficult to play with this deck, ‘cause it has so many lines to play that I got confused (although i’m not a very smart girl). But here we are with a lot of new supports, infinite lines to play and a deck so sweet that might cause diabetes to your opponents.</span>  <span>And so this was my top choice to the now “past”  remote YCS  South America. That was my first remote  duel and my first competitive event,so I chose Madolche ‘cause I love this deck from the bottom of my heart and, also,  it is one of my most played decks of all time that I felt comfortable to use in a competitive environment. Did I good? Did I like it? In conclusion we will see. </span>  &nbsp;  <b><i>Disclaimers</i></b>  <span>When I try to build a deck I like to use cards that I already have</span><i><span>,</span></i><span>thus I rarely have the new staples for exemple. So the majority of cards that you’ll see can be considered a budget option for certain cards, in other words no Access code talker. However  I hope you like my choices for certain cards and if you have any questions or tips, please message me.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Starters</i></b></span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a>: </b><span>this cute girl can tribute herself to summon any madolche monster from the deck, preferably </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a> </b><span> to start her combo because she was a special summon or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a> </b><span> to extend your plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a>: </b><span> a newcomer where the new broken combo resides. This little girl can special summon herself from your hand with you having no monster in your GY and, on top of that, summon another madolche from your deck but this monster will have 1 level less than the original . The way that she can trigger her second  effect by any special summon is insane, so if she was summon  by  </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a> </b><span> or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a> </b><span>  you also would summon another Madolche monster , like </span><span> </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess"">Madolche Puddingcess</a> </b><span> for instance to proceed to XYZ plays.</span>  <b>2x</b> <b><a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a>:  </b><span>The primary function of this owl is to summon </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Messengelato"">Madolche Messengelato</a> </b><span> to start your combos  and put some protection , but it can  maybe summon </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a> </b><span> or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a> </b><span>to use some different line of plays.

Furthermore when a madolche card is shuffled back in the deck you can set a madolche spell/trap card from your deck, and this will happen a lot. It is everything we ever wanted.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Magileine"">Madolche Magileine</a>: </b><span>add any madolche monster to your hand and it’s a non hard once per turn effect , so in conjunction with </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Salon"">Madolche Salon</a> </b><span> this card can show its true potential.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Madolche Messengelato"">Madolche Messengelato</a>: </b><span>This dude has the insane non hard once per turn effect in all archetypes.  Summoned most of the time by the effect of </span><b> <a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a>, </b><span> the ability to add any madolche spell/trap card for a simple special summon it’s amazing.

This card can shut down decks like drytron (that was so prevalent), Tri-brigade stuff  and so many others. However this card does not stop plays( like Ash Blossom does) and it’s a high impact hand trap that have to accomplish a specific condition. So I decided to side it and thank goodness I did. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a>; 1 x </b><b><a data-name=""Skull Meister"">Skull Meister</a></b><b>: </b><span>with so many GY plays like </span><b><a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a>,</b> <b><a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a>, </b><span> Dragon link or even Virtual world… this adorable ghost girl will be one of your best friends in this format.</span><b><a data-name=""Skull Meister"">Skull Meister</a> </b><span>is basically a male belle.

Some duels  was extreme fun  like One that I had with a Uruguayan man,: I started with a standard madolche board and when was his time to play he said “ end of battle phase” And I only saw a purple card  </span><b><a data-name=""Evenly Match"">Evenly Match</a>, </b><span> but for some reason he forgot that I had Lancea at my hand, both of us laugh so hard. In another duel I used </span><b><a data-name=""Ghost Mourner &amp; Moonlit Chill"">Ghost Mourner &amp; Moonlit Chill</a> </b><span>to negate a</span><b>  <a data-name=""Zoodiac Boarbow"">Zoodiac Boarbow</a>, </b><span>and this brazilian guy's rage quit… And I can't stop laughing</span><span>. In some duels I had an extreme ruling contest and I got really frustrated with it. LAG, bad connection (I live in a rural area, but my internet is at least 100mb), and.. I had enough and I Scooped. My final score was the solid 3-2-3, a frustrating experience but a funnie one. I hope you enjoy it   </span>"

This deck also utilizes <em>Macro Cosmos</em> and <em>Dimensional Fissure </em>as a meta-call against decks like Tri-Brigade, Drytron, and Sky Striker who heavily play around their GY's. This archetype has a lot of 1 card combos and can create powerful level 7-10 Synchro Monsters for almost every situation; just be careful with cards like <em>Droll and Lock Bird </em>and <em>Nibiru</em> as they can stop you from your combo plays.

I tested Cards like lightning storm and you can use it instead of raigeki and twin twisters if you have 2-3 of them. You want to search for your normal summon/tuner monsters if you didn't draw them in the start of the game and you want to make your synchco monsters (whatever it is you want to make at the time) and make a big board. If you're running out of plays, you can make Greatfly/Picofalena to link off to recycle your grave yard.

The main deck uses the same tactics to acheive the win as before, going second and OTK'ing, or board breaking and preventing the opponent from coming back. Either swinging with Gren Maju after banishing so many cards for the win, or using the level 8's along with the XYZ's to break boards or control the game long enough to OTK.  The main deck has some key changes. 2 Phantazmay have now been put into the main deck. Although Dragon Link is no longer as prevalent, Phantazmay is highly useful against Tri-Brigade, Ignister and Striker to both draw extra cards that could help break boards, as well as offering targeting protection which allows the deck to play around Striker more easily, as the matchup can be a pretty rough one sometimes.  Super Poly has now been relegated to the side deck due to Striker now being more prevalent, the card being useless against Prank Kids, Eldlich and Ignister, and also not always being useful in the Tri-Brigade matchups. Triple Tactics Talent took its place, and is extremely useful at allowing the deck to push through hand traps and other interruptions.  The Extra Deck no longer has the 2 N'tss. While it is useful against Dogmatika, it has no utility against anything else. Pain Gainer allows me to gave a 4 material Zeus, which can really come in clutch. Violet Chimera is an extra super poly target that can be used vs Salamangreat.  There Can Be Only One has now been dropped. With many decks likely to be using some main deck Spell/Trap removal now the striker matchup has returned, and Different Dimension Ground being able to acheive a similar stun effect i felt the card was not needed. In it's place, Eradicator Epidemic Virus allows me to blowout anything that relies on spells/traps (namely Invoked/Shaddoll, Striker, Drytron and other backrow).  Feel free to comment and like the deck!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The Main Deck also includes a small number of retrained monsters designed to allow the Deck to function as a cosplay deck first, and to help the Deck out second - for example, ""Obnoxious Celtic Guard"" is useful for creating ""Gilti-Gearfried"", but is primarily there because it is a Yugi/Atem card. Similarly, ""Ankuriboh"" is there so that a Yugi Deck can have a defensive Kuriboh card, with its other benefits being of secondary concern. This ""problem"" is particularly egregious in the Side Deck, where the Monsters and Traps in particular are designed to be upgrades/retrains/nods to some of Yugi's classic cards or classic DM-era cards (albeit in the case of ""Gravedigger's Trap Hole"" somewhat tenuously, as it is only a ""Trap Hole"" in the TCG, not in the OCG). If trying to make this Deck more playable in even slightly more competitive environments, these could easily all be swapped out for more traditional hand traps/anti-meta cards/current staples and the like, and furthermore, whilst the Deck in its current form is very fun, focusing either on the Egyptian God element with Slime support and Mound of the Bound Creator and the like, or on the Extra Deck element with more Warrior support, would no doubt produce better results."

This deck could also utilizes <em>Macro Cosmos, Dimensional Shifter</em> and <em>Dimensional Fissure </em>as a meta-call against decks like Tri-Brigade, Drytron, and Sky Striker who heavily play around their GY's (the Side deck contains at the Moment different ideas for the future Version of this deck).  This archetype has a lot of 1 card combos and can create powerful level 7-12 Synchro Monsters for almost every situation; just be careful with cards like <em>Droll and Lock Bird </em>and <em>Nibiru</em> as they can stop you from your combo plays. The deck is flexible first or second, but going first with a<em> Baroness De Fleur </em>end board is usually ideal.  You can decide to cut the Tenyi support in order to play more hand traps."

Check out the new version here: https://ygoprodeck.com/wrath-of-the-conductor-paleozoic-era/</span></p> <span>The main focus of this deck is the summoning of high ATK power monsters, mainly <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno<span>.</span></span></span>  <span><span><em><span>Frostosaurus</span></em></span>: 1 Tribute, 2600 ATK. Can be easily summoned using <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> or <span>Hunting Instinct</span>.</span> <span><span><em><span>Megalosmasher X</span></em></span>: Solid 2000 ATK, <span>4 stars</span>, useful for <span>Synchro</span>/<strong>X<span>YZ summoning</span></strong>.</span> <span><span><em><span>Black Brachios</span></em></span>: Useful for revealing face-down monsters, or disrupting a high attacker.</span> <span><span><em>Destroyersaurus</em></span>: Can be discarded to add the deck's only Field Card to the hand, and fulfills one half of <span><span>Ultimate Conductor</span> <span>Tyranno's</span></span> Special Summon condition.</span> <span><span><em>Miscellaneousaurus</em></span>: Can be discarded to protect your monsters from effects during the main phase, and fulfills one half of <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno's</span> Special Summon condition. Has a Special Summon effect that doesn't see much use unless the duel goes on for a very long time, and you have at least 4 dinosaurs in your GY.</span> <span><span><em>Scrap Raptor</em></span>: The decks only tuner monster, and the only <span>Level 4</span> Dinosaur Tuner that exists as of now. It's effect only functions within it's archetype, so it can be ignored.</span> <span><span><em><span>Souleating Oviraptor</span></em></span>: The most important card in this deck. Can be used to add any Dinosaur from the deck to either your hand, or GY. This can get you <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> early on, can provide you with your Tuner, or if <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> is set, instant access to <span>Frostosaurus</span> or <span>Ultimate Tyranno</span>.</span> <span><span><em><span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span></em></span>: The most powerful card in the deck, <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> can only be Special Summoned by banishing 2 Dinosaurs from the Graveyard. With the combined efforts of <span>Destroyersaurus</span>, <span>Miscellaneousaurus</span>, <span>Souleating Oviraptor</span>, and <span>Synchro</span> <span>Summoning</span>, this is very easily achieved. <span>U.C.T.</span> can attack all monsters your opponent controls, instantly destroying any DEF position monsters while inflicting 1000 points of damage in the process.</span> <span><span><em><span>Ultimate Tyranno</span></em></span>: Similar to <span>U.C.T.</span>, but without the ability to instantly destroy defense position monsters. If this monster is on your field, it must attack every monster before your other monsters can attack. Try not to use this guy when <span>U.C.T.</span> is present.</span> <span><span><em><span>Fossil Dig</span></em></span>: Used to grab any dino from the deck aside from either of the Tyrannos</span> <span><span><em><span>Jurassic World</span></em></span>: A small ATK and DEF boost for dinos.</span> <span><span><em><span>Swords Of Revealing Light</span></em></span>: Protects you from attacks for 3 turns.</span> <span><span><em><span>Tail Swipe</span></em></span>: A useful field clearing ability. Requires you to control a <span>Level 6</span> or higher dino. Best used when <span>Frostosaurus</span> is the strongest monster you control on the field.</span> <span><span><em><span>Call Of The Haunted</span></em></span>: Revives a monster from the GY. If <span>U.C.T.</span> has made it out on to the field at least once, it can be revived.</span> <span><span><em><span>Dust Tornado</span></em></span>: Destroys a Spell or Trap.</span> <span><span><em><span><span>Hunting Instinct</span></span></em><span>: </span>An easy way to get your high level dinos onto the field.<em><span> <span>Mirror Force</span></span></em><span>: </span>Destroys all of your opponent's attack position monsters.<em><span> <span>Seven Tools Of The Bandit</span></span></em><span>: </span>Negates Trap Cards.</span></span> <span><span><em><span>Survival Of The Fittest</span></em></span>: Adds 1000 ATK to any dino. Most useful on the <span>Level 4</span> dinos, as the higher level ones already have huge attack powers and can clear the field easily. Destroying a monster with the ATK boosts allows the monster to make a second attack on monsters.</span> <span><span><span><em>Dinowrestler Giga Spinosavate</em></span></span>: [1 Dinsoaur Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters] The deck's only <span>Synchro</span> Monster. This monster is very powerful. It becomes the attack magnet while it is face-up, it can destroy a single monster once per turn, your opponent cannot activate Spells/Traps while it is attacking, and you can sacrifice another card you control if this guy would be destroyed. A great target for <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> if it somehow gets taken out. Can easily be <span>Synchro Summoned</span> using <span>Scrap Raptor</span> and almost any other dino in the deck.</span> <span><span><em><strong>Evolzar Dollka</strong></em></span>: [2 <span>Level 4</span> Dinosaur monsters] Useful for negating monster effects. Can be done twice using it's material</span> <span><span><em><strong>Evolzar Laggia</strong></em></span>: [2 <span>Level 4</span> Dinosaur monsters] The most versatile of the 3 XYZ's, <strong>Laggia</strong> can negate a single Summon, or Spell/Trap activation</span> <span><span><em><strong>Evolzar Solda</strong></em></span>: [2 <span>Level 6</span> Dinosaur monsters] Very rarely used, I just included with the rest of the Evolzar's so it wouldn't feel left out.</span>"

Discard cards to negate and banish, and search after doing so. M","<p><span>As indicated in their name, Plunder Patroll is a deck wherein the shipmates consist of pirates/vikings (the ""plunder"" aspect), who are also trolls (the ""-troll"" in Plunder Patroll, hence the extra ""l""). Their play-style focuses around summoning Black-, White-, or Redbeard in order to activate their effects during the opponent's turn to Special Summon a Plunder Patrollship from your Extra Deck, as long as that summoned Ship has the same attribute as a monster card that your opponent controls or is in their graveyard. Let's talk a bit more in-detail on the cards themselves, from the Plunders to the extra cards in the deck:</span></p> <span><strong>The Plunder Patrolls (and their Spells and Traps) -</strong></span> <span><strong><a data-name=""Whitebeard, the Plunder Patroll Helm"">Whitebeard, the Plunder Patroll Helm</a></strong>: Whitebeard is, without a doubt, one of the best Plunder Patroll cards. All the Main Deck Plunders are Level 4 WATER Fiend monsters, however, Whitebeard is one of the few Tuner monsters. Previously aforementioned, Whitebeard can tag itself out into the Spell/Trap zone as an equip card, by Special Summoning a Plunder Patrollship from your Extra Deck, as long as that Ship's attribute is the same as a monster that is on your opponent's field or is in their graveyard. Additionally, when discarded or sent from the monster zone to the graveyard, Whitebeard can Special Summon a Plunder from your Deck, locking you into Plunders. All of the Ships discard a Plunder card to activate an effect, and search immediately after. This means, by discarding for a Plunder Patrollship's effect, you can trigger Whitebeard to Special Summon a Plunder to your side of the field, potentially for use by Blackbeard. <strong><a data-name=""Redbeard, the Plunder Patroll Matey"">Redbeard, the Plunder Patroll Matey</a>: </strong>Redbeard, like Whitebeard, shares the ability to tag into the Spell/Trap zone and summon a corresponding Extra Deck Plunder monster. Redbeard also has the effect where when it is discarded or sent from the monster zone to the graveyard, it can equip itself to a Plunder you control. </span> <span><strong><a data-name=""Bluebeard, the Plunder Patroll Shipwright"">Bluebeard, the Plunder Patroll Shipwright</a>: </strong><span>Admittedly, Bluebeard is the worst of the Plunders. However, it is a Plunder name, so it must be played at triple copies. Bluebeard's main application is it's ability to Special Summon itself from the hand while you control a Plunder. A Bluebeard on board is a Ship in play, I say, as controlling two Plunder's gets you access to Blackbeard, as well as Moerk. And, if the other Plunder you controlled when Bluebeard's summon effect activated was a Tuner, then you can even make Brann. That is, if Moerk or Brann being hard-summoned is the correct move (A Dingirsu protection effect *<em>can*</em> be useful). When discarded or sent to the graveyard from the monster zone, Bluebeard can discard a card from your hand to draw one card. This isn't the most useful effect, but it can have some uses in discarded unneeded handtraps or as an additional way to trigger a Plunder effect. <strong><span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Goldenhair, the Newest Plunder Patroll"">Goldenhair, the Newest Plunder Patroll</a>: </span></strong><span class=""name_txt selectable"">While not the newest Plunder Patroll anymore, Goldenhair is imperative to the Plunder Patroll strategy. Before recent support, getting a Goldenhair into the graveyard was the primary objective for Plunder pilots, as while in the grave, at the cost of being locked into Plunders and a discard, Goldenhair can Special Summon herself back to field, providing a body, a name, and her use as a Tuner monster. Goldenhair has the ability to discard any card and Special Summon herself from the hand, but this effect is only used in poorer hands typically, as the hand advantage is a necessity in Plunder. You need the resources for your Patrollships. Regardless, a Goldenhair in rotation is extremely helpful in maintaining a board presence by giving you access to any Plunder Patrollship, all by controlling another main deck Plunder. <strong><a data-name=""Blackeyes, the Plunder Patroll Seaguide"">Blackeyes, the Plunder Patroll Seaguide</a>: </strong>Lastly, the newest Plunder Patroll card, we have Blackeyes (or as I prefer, Ravenwing). Blackeyes is phenomenal, and is truly what the deck was lacking. While in the hand, you can target a Plunder in your graveyard; Special Summon Blackeyes from your hand, and return the targeted card to your hand. Do you see it's applications? It gets back your resources, it summons itself, and at the end of the day, it's another Plunder name. Additionally, a discarded Blackeyes, or a Blackeyes sent from the monster zone to the graveyard, can Special Summon a Plunder that is equipped to a monster. While not always used, it is helpful in assembling lethal, as well as making more Ships.</span></span></span>  <strong><span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd"">Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd</a> (Field Spell): </span></strong><span class=""name_txt selectable"">Yes. The name is ""Shipyarrrd"". Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd is the deck's resident field spell. By discarding one card, you can search any Plunder Patroll card in your deck. This allows you to trigger the various Plunder effects, as well as get you to the one card you need. Discarding unneeded handtraps, or even discarding a Plunder for the sole purpose of bringing it back off of a searched Blackeyes are both good plays. Additionally, while in the graveyard, Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd can bounce a Plunder Patroll card in your Spell and Trap zone to the hand to set itself directly from the grave to your field, making it hard to actually out. This recursion not only means your field spell is most always online once you activate it that first time, but it also gets you Plunders in the hand when it bounces them in the Spell and Trap zone. Remember, Redbeard and Whitebeard become equip cards. Shipyarrrd has one more effect, that being that all Plunders you control gain 500 ATK for every Plunder in your Spell and Trap zone. This makes establishing lethal laughably easy. <strong><a data-name=""&lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;Emblem of the Plunder Patroll&lt;/span&gt;""><span class=""name_txt selectable"">Emblem of the Plunder Patroll</span> </a>(Equip Spell):</strong> Emblem of the Plunder Patroll is an incredible card, and goes to show the lengths that Equip Spells need to go to to be playable at any capacity. However, this deck only plays it at two copies capacity --- though you could play three, as it is worth it. While equipped to a Plunder, the monster gains 500 ATK and becomes untargetable. However, the real shine of Emblem is that by sending it as an equip card to the grave, you can Special Summon a Patrollship from your Extra Deck, whose attribute is the same as a monster on/in either player's field/graveyard. This means that Ash Blossom you discarded during your opponent's turn equals a Brann, just by being in your grave. Additionally, the Plunder that Emblem was originally equipped to becomes an equip card (with the effect of giving the card it equips onto 500 ATK) for the newly summoned Patrollship. <strong><span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Plunder Patroll Shipshape Ships Shipping"">Plunder Patroll Shipshape Ships Shipping</a></span> (Normal Spell):</strong> Say that twice as fast, I triple-Plunder-dare you. Shipshape Ships Shipping is the Fusion Spell of the deck, but that's not what you'll be using it for. By banishing it from the graveyard, you can equip an Emblem of the Plunder Patroll, or a Plunder monster, to a Plunder you control, straight from the deck. This gets you access to Ships turn one, and turns on your most powerful Ships by getting your equip cards into rotation. I don't suggest playing multiples, as it's balls to draw. <strong><a data-name=""&lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;Plunder Patroll Booty&lt;/span&gt;""><span class=""name_txt selectable"">Plunder Patroll Booty</span></a> (Continuous Trap):</strong> Plunder Patroll Booty is one of the most useful cards you could have access to in Plunder. Plunder's weakness is maintaining and having access to resources, as well as having access to the proper monster attributes without Emblem. Booty fixes both of those issues, kind of. Plunder Patroll Booty can return to your hand, or Special Summon, a Plunder in your grave, while changing the attribute of a monster your opponent controls to any of your choice. Don't have access to a DARK for Moerk? Target and declare DARK, then reborn a Blackbeard! I typically side a Booty out when going second, but that doesn't mean any less then three is good. Oh, and remember, you can't reborn a Ship that wasn't summoned properly. For example. a Moerk summoned off of Redbeard's effect cannot be Special Summoned back from the graveyard with Booty, because that Moerk wasn't Xyz Summoned the hard way.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Handtraps - </strong><span><a data-name=""Ghost Be&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;lle &lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/span&gt; Haunte&lt;/span&gt;d Mansion.""><span>The rest of the monsters I play are six handtraps: Triple copies of </span></a><a data-name=""Ash Blos&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;som &lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/span&gt; Joyous&lt;/span&gt; Spring"">Ash Blossom <span class=""name_txt selectable"">&amp;</span> Joyous Spring</a>, and triple copies of <a data-name=""Ghost Be&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;lle &lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/span&gt; Haunte&lt;/span&gt;d Mansion"">Ghost Belle <span class=""name_txt selectable"">&amp;</span> Haunted Mansion</a><a data-name=""Ghost Be&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;lle &lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/span&gt; Haunte&lt;/span&gt;d Mansion."">. Realistically, these could be whatever handtraps you prefer. I've played Driver and Gamma, and it worked perfectly. Main-decking Nibiru is good as well. In the end, the choice is up to you, but I choose to play two playsets of low-impact handtraps in the main, and sideboard the more high-impact handtraps. However, </a><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a><a data-name=""Ghost Be&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;lle &lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/span&gt; Haunte&lt;/span&gt;d Mansion.""> is also a handtrap, but it could be cut for whatever. I personally prefer Imperm in the main, as it has it's uses going first or second, and is generic enough to make an impact on most decks.</a></span></span>  <span><strong>Other Spells and Traps - </strong><span>At the end of the day, these cards can be anything of your choosing, but here's my explanation for each: <strong><a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>: </strong>Desires is a plus one, in my eyes. And in Plunder, those extra cards are needed. You could maybe play Prosperity, but honestly, you need the extra card off of Desires more then you do a specific card. I don't recommend cutting this. <strong><a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a>: </strong>TTT is a flexible spot. I play TTT because of the applications: The draw for discards, the hand knowledge and removing potential handtraps and threats, and removing pesky monsters on board. While this could be <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>, another handtrap, blinding second staples, or anything you choose, I decided upon TTT. <strong><a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>: </strong>Search Shipyarrrd. That's all. </span></span>  <strong><span>The Extra Deck -</span></strong><strong><span> <a data-name=""Blackbeard, &lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;the Plunder Patroll Captai&lt;/span&gt;n"">Blackbeard, <span class=""name_txt selectable"">the Plunder Patroll Captai</span>n</a> (Link 2): </span></strong><span>Blackbeard is what you'll be making more then anything else. Blackbeard has a Quick Effect to tag any effect monster you control into the Spell/Trap zone as an equip card for a Ship with the same attribute as a monster your opponent controls or is in their graveyard. This effect includes targeting itself. Additionally, after you summon, you can draw 1 card, to make sure you have a Plunder in hand for the Ship's discard. Blackbeard's tag-out effect is incredibly useful, as a combat trick, as an extender, or as the most basic way to get into your powerful ships, such as Lys or Moerk. </span><strong><a data-name=""Plunder Patrollship Moerk"">Plunder Patrollship Moerk</a> (Rank 4 Xyz): </strong>Moerk, a generic rank 4 Xyz monster, has the ability to discard a Plunder card to banish a monster on the field. Since this is the first ship we're covering, I'll make it known all the ships have a discard effect, and then those effects become Quick Effects if they're equipped with a Plunder card (with the exception of Lys). Therefore, Moerk's banishing effect is a Quick Effect if a Plunder is equipped. Additionally, after all Ships discard and apply their effect, you can search a card from your deck. Moerk specifically allows you to add a Plunder Patroll Spell or Trap from your deck to your hand. Be weary though, as all of the Ship effects that search a card can be negated with Ash Blossom. You gain a different effect, however, if you have Xyz Material. If you hard-summoned Moerk, and have Xyz Material, then you have access to a Dingirsu-like effect where if a Plunder card you control would be destroyed, you can detach an Xyz material instead. <strong><a data-name=""Plunder Patrollship Brann"">Plunder Patrollship Brann</a> (Level 8 Synchro): </strong><span class=""name_txt selectable"">Brann, a generic level 8 Synchro, has the ability to discard a Plunder to banish a Spell or Trap on the field, and then search a Plunder monster. This effect becomes a Quick Effect if a Plunder is equipped to Brann. Furthermore, Brann has an on field effect that boosts all your Fiends by 500 ATK, except itself. This ATK raise helps establish lethal, and two Brann can be game in most cases. <strong><a data-name=""Plunder Patrollship Lys"">Plunder Patrollship Lys</a> (2 Mat Fusion):</strong> Lys, a Fusion monster requiring two Plunders as Fusion Material, is the best Ship by far. Lys lets you discard a Plunder to negate and destroy a monster effect, and only searches if a Plunder is equipped. This means the negation is a Quick Effect always, and cannot be Ash Blossom'd in every case. Furthermore, the search itself adds any Plunder card. Lys also has the effect to Special Summon a Plunder from your Spell and Trap zone during the Main Phase, meaning you can remove the equipped card to prevent Lys from being Ash Blossom'd. The best way to activate this effect is to have made Lys with Blackbeard, then reborn the Blackbeard from the Spell and Trap zone to make another Ship. <strong><a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a><a data-name=""Bahamut Shark and Toadally Awesome""> and </a><a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> (Rank 4 and 2 Xyz)</strong>: During a turn in which you have not activated a Plunder effect that locks you into Plunders, it is incredibly easy to make Bahamut Shark. If you didn't know, Bahamut Shark has the ability to detach an Xyz Material to Special Summon a low-rank WATER Xyz monster from your Extra Deck, that being Toadally Awesome. Toad, while on the field, can negate a card effect and set that card to your field. Toad tributes itself to do so, but can return itself or a WATER in your grave to the hand when you do tribute it. <strong><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> (Link 3):</strong> Knightmare Unicorn is a discard outlet and removal. You don't make it often, but the option is there. This is one of the few flex spots in the Extra Deck. <strong><a data-name=""White Aura Whale"">White Aura Whale</a> (Level 8 Synchro):  </strong>When you aren't locked into Plunders, White Aura Whale is a crazy card to Synchro into. On Summon, it wipes the field of all of your opponent's Attack position monsters. Additionally, White Aura Whale can also attack twice in a battle phase and inflict piercing battle damage. And lastly, if it's destroyed, you can banish a WATER from your grave to reborn it as a Tuner. That reborn effect isn't once per turn, by the way. So, a really blowout card to make. <strong><a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a> (Level 8 Synchro): </strong>Dragite allows access for a negate right off the bat. This card goes best when going first after siding, because it turns off the opponent's going second blowout spells. There's not much explaining required here. Dragite is just a good, easy to make Synchro that negates. </span>  <span><strong>Conclusion? </strong><span>Plunder Patroll is easily one of my favorite decks, hence why I am sharing my current build here. I will be updating this as the list sees further change. The side deck is entirely up to your choice, as well as the handtraps and flex spots, such as Knightmare Unicorn and TTT. While not the strongest deck, Plunder makes for some of the most fun games I've ever had in this game. I hope you enjoy this deck as much as I have in recent days.</span><strong> </strong></span>"

Its consistency is amazing and ceil","Utopia has never been stronger, back in the day you could only negate when attacking or if you were really lucky you could maybe make a Zexal but now you can control the board at all times. The goal: set up double Leos with a Pegasus and Eagle Claw (one through Utopia Double, the other from Dragner), then on the opponents turn immediately after the draw phase summon a Hoper Harbinger using Dragner's remaining materials. If going second try to bring out a Magnus through Dreadnought should you expect to get hit with a Mystic Mine. Utopia Dragner is now the strongest monster in the deck in my opinion and he is the key to winning. With this deck you can very consistently make him every turn. Anyways the reason you should not play the deck at 40 cards is because you absolutely under no circumstances want to see a double or nothing spell or a ZW equip, having one is often the difference between being able to play through negates and completely being in dead waters. Additionally the deck requires versatility, if youre stuck with three copies of Onomatopickup or Onomatopaira youre probably scooping with just 40 cards because its a once per turn but with 60 you can add the monster, the field or the paira. The field Onomatopia is sooo good too, literally whatever extender you need it can summon from the deck easily and the attack bonus is good in keeping you even more protected(Number 23 being the main beneficiary). Zexal field is also up so that you can get more use out of Dragner and especially Number 23. Astraltopia is another awesome versitile card, it can get you the spell to draw on Utopia summons, the card to make Dragner, or the additional interruption in XYZ Import.  I hope you enjoy the deck  -Chief Kaiju Hunter"

When going second: Get all the problems out the way first before attempting to go for OTK on opponent. This would consist of monsters like Knightmare Unicorn/Pheonix or even an Avramax and attempt to win off these moves. You can also go for a Spatha with Arboria and Reclusia to prevent Reclusia's effect to pop itself off the field.  What you don't want from this deck is cards that are not crusadia, regardless if going first or second. This will prevent you from doing anything due the the fact your only link 1 requires a crusadia monster, but if you get that sorted your set to go.  (Can also I:P with a Watt in hand for a Wiked combo.)  You can also add Orcust with link and xyz engine for a free negate and anti destruction.(Personally I don't run)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Most of the monsters here can hold their own even if Zombie World isn't present, so you can use your Extra Deck to wreak havoc while you wait for it.</span>  <span><span><em><span>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</span></em></span>: A <span>Level 3</span> Tuner that also doubles as a hand trap which can be used to prevent the opponent from pulling cards directly from their deck. <span><em>Doomking Balerdroch</em></span>: A <span>Level 8</span> monster that can easily be Special Summoned from the Graveyard by it's own effect, <span>Book Of Life</span>, <span>Call Of The Haunted</span>, or from the deck by <span>Pyramid Turtle's</span> effect. Tribute Summoning isn't recommended, as the other methods are easier and keep your monster's alive. <span>Pyramid Turtle's</span> effect is the most useful method, and this monsters ATK is often worth sacrificing the turtle during your own Battle Phase, especially early on in the duel. Not only is this monster powerful, but it can activate either of it's effect's once per turn when another Zombie on the field activates an effect of it's own. This opens up more opportunities if <span>Zombie World</span> is active, allowing you to either negate an effect, or Banish any monster on the field or in the Graveyard. <span><em><span>Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</span></em></span>: A <span>Level 3</span> Tuner that also doubles as a hand trap which can be used to prevent the opponent from moving cards around from their Graveyard.</span> <span><span><em><span>Necroworld Banshee</span></em></span>: While she is on the field, your <span>Zombie World</span> is protected from being destroyed or negated. You can also banish her at any time to immediately activate another <span>Zombie World</span> from your deck or hand.</span> <span><span><em><span>Paladin Of The Cursed Dragon</span></em></span>: This guy lets you Special Summon 1 Zombie monster from your opponent's GY that was destroyed by battle.</span> <span><span><em>Pyramid Turtle</em></span>: This is the most efficient Zombie searcher I'm aware of. Truly an amazing card. Literally every monster in the Main deck can be Special Summoned via it's effect once destroyed. This is an easy way to get quickly get <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon <span>or</span> Doomking Balerdroch</span> onto the field.</span> <span><span><em>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</em></span>. Despite being <span>Level 7</span>, as long as you have a Zombie monster, (which is your entire deck), it can be Tributed using only 1 Tribute. Any Zombie monster this monster destroys can be Special Summoned to your side of the field as soon as it has been sent to the GY.</span> <span><span><em>Scapeghost</em></span>: A good defensive tool if you are being overwhelmed. The maximum amount of<span> Tokens it creates with it's flip effect can be used to perform up to 2</span> <span>Link Summons</span>, or up to 2 <span>Fusion Summons</span>, provided you have a <span>Polymerization <span>ready</span></span>. <span>Scapeghost</span> itself is also a Tuner, and if you flip it yourself and have at least a <span>Level 4</span> monster ready, you can use 2 of the Tokens, <span>Scapeghost,</span> and the <span>Level 4</span> monster to <span>Synchro Summon</span> <span>one of th</span>e most powerful monsters in the deck, <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</span>. Doing the same thing but using all 3 of the tokens instead will allow you to <span>Synchro Summon</span> <span>Shiranui Shogunsaga</span>.</span> <span><span><em>Zombie Master</em></span>: By sending 1 monster from your hand to your GY, you can Special Summon any Zombie monster from either GY that is <span>Level 4</span> or lower<span><span>.</span></span> An incredibly easy way to set up an <strong>XYZ Summon</strong> for <strong>Gem-Knight Pearl</strong>, or a <span>Synchro Summon</span> for <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</span>.</span> <span><span><em>Book Of Life</em></span>: Revives 1 of your monsters from the GY and banishes one of your opponent's monsters from their GY. Essentially a <span>Monster Reborn</span> that can also hinder your opponent.</span> <span><span><span><span><em>Polymerization</em></span>: <span>Used to</span> <span>Fusion Summon Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</span> or <span>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</span>. <span><em>Super Polymerization</em></span>: <span>A quick-play version of</span> <span>Polymerization</span> <span>that can't be negated. It uses monsters on either side of the field, meaning you can use your opponents transformed Zombies to summon one of 2 powerful Dragons with manipulative effects. Be mindful that</span> <span>Super Polymerization</span> <span>does not work with materials in the hand the same way normal Polymerization does.</span></span></span></span> <span><span><em>Terraforming</em></span>: Instant access to <span>Zombie World<span>.</span></span></span> <span><span><em><span>Zombie World</span></em></span>: The most important card in the deck, this Field Spell not only transforms all monsters on both fields and GY's into Zombie-types, it also prevents both players from Tribute Summoning any monster that isn't a Zombie. Luckily for you, everything at your disposal is already a Zombie. This card not only hinders your opponent, but it basically turns <span>Paladin Of The Cursed Dragon</span> and <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</span> into the apocalypse, stealing monsters from the opponent's GY and turning them against them. <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</span> absolutely loves this card and benefits immensely from it.</span> <span><span><em><span>Call Of The Haunted</span></em></span>: Revives 1 monster from your GY.</span> <span><span><em>Dust Tornado</em></span>: Destroys 1 of your opponents Spells/Traps.</span> <span><span><em>Mirror Force</em></span><span><span>:</span></span> Upon declaring an attack, your opponent's attack position monsters are destroyed.</span> <span><span><em>Seven Tools Of The Bandit</em></span>: Negates a single Trap card's activation.</span> <span><span><em><span>Trap Of The Imperial Tomb</span></em></span>: When a Zombie is summoned from your opponent's GY to your field, you can destroy 2 cards on the field. Makes a great combo when either <span>Paladin Of The Cursed Dragon</span>, <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</span>, or <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon'</span><span>s</span> summoning effect is activated.</span> <span><span><em>Tutan Mask</em></span>: Protects a single Zombie from a Spell or Trap.</span> <span><span><em>Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</em></span>: [2 Zombie monsters] By fusing any 2 Zombie monsters, you have a behemoth of a monster that can create clones of the monster it battles. Even though this monster can't destroy monsters by battle, anything it attacks (or is attacked by) has it's ATK reduced to 0, and you spawn a Token gifted with the attacked monsters original ATK and <span>Level</span> (as long as that target has a <span>level</span>). Be mindful that <span>Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon <span><span>can be destroyed by battle if the attacking monster</span> <span>overpowers it, but not before creating a token</span></span></span>. After a Token has outlived it's usefulness, it can be used as a Tribute Summon for <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</span>, <span>Synchro Material</span>, or even Link Materials for <span>Vampire Sucker</span>. <span><em>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</em></span>: Relatively easy to summon, requiring any 2 DARK monsters aside from tokens, <span>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</span> gains ATK equal to one of your opponents Special Summoned monsters the turn it is <span>Fusion Summoned</span>. It can also copy the effects of a single <span>Level 5</span> or higher monster that your opponent controls once per turn. This is deadly and can be abused when combined with the Summoning effects of <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</span>, <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</span>, and <span>Vampire Sucker</span>. Lastly, when this monster is destroyed, your opponents loses all of the Special Summoned monsters they have on the field.</span> <span><span><em>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</em></span>: [1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters] By far the most powerful monster in the entire deck. Starting off with 2400 ATK, it gains an additional 100 ATK for each Zombie on the field and in both GY's. If <span>Zombie World</span> is active and the GY's are packed, this monster's ATK can reach insanely high levels. Not only that, but anytime a Zombie is destroyed by battle, this monster's effect activates and lets you Special Summon ANY Zombie monster from either GY. <span><em>Shiranui Shogunsaga</em></span>: When this card is Special Summoned, you can banish 1 Zombie from your Graveyard to have this card gain ATK equal to the sent monsters ATK for 1 turn. When combined with <span>Zombie World</span>, this could potentially give this monster a grand total of 7500 ATK depending on what you choose. Since it's effect activates upon being Special Summoned, you can use <span>Book Of Life</span> and <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> once it's been sent to the Graveyard to retaliate when your opponent controls a powerful monster.</span> <span><span><em><strong>Gem-Knight Pearl</strong></em></span>: [2 level 4 monsters] A powerful, easy to summon 2600 attacker, only lacking an effect. <span><strong><em>Number 22: Zombiestein</em></strong></span>: 2 Level 8 DARK monsters. You can use any combination of 2 <span>Doomking Balerdroch</span>, <span>Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</span>, or <span>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon <span>to <strong>XYZ Summon</strong> this titan.</span></span> Without protection, this monster's effect negation isn't too useful; it's insanely high ATK is what gives it a spot in this deck. If it somehow makes it into the Graveyard, it can be used to give <span>Shiranui Shogunsaga</span> an absurd boost in power. </span><span><span><em><span>Vampire Sucker</span></em></span>: [2 Zombie monsters] This monsters effect might not seem too helpful, but you can create a few combos with it. Once per turn, you can summon any monster from your opponent's GY to their side of the field in DEF position, and turn it into a Zombie (useful for instances when <span>Zombie World</span> is not active). That monster can then be used in one of 2 ways. It can be used as a Tribute for a Tribute summon (<span>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</span>) even though you don't control them, it can also be used to create a Token for <span>Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon<span>.</span></span> Further more, summoning the monster let's you draw a card. Of course, her draw effect can be triggered any time a Zombie monster is Special Summoned.</span> <p><span>Feel free to share any ideas/strategies that you think might work better and I'll look into them. ~~~Special thanks to YGOPRODECK user ""Ashvenfall"" for reminding me that <span>Super Polymerization</span> is a thing and introducing me to <span>Doomking Balerdroch</span>. I have tested these cards and they have increased the efficiency of the deck by a considerable amount.~~~</span></p>"

Of the other four, <a data-name=""Aromage Rosemary"">Rosemary</a> works to put monsters in defense, <a data-name=""Aromage Canaga"">Canaga</a> bounces spells, <a data-name=""Aromage Majoram"">Majoram</a> banishes form the GY and <a data-name=""Aromage Bergamot"">Bergamot</a> is basically the main deck boss. The women also have ED versions of themselves, enhanced by Angelina's power. <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Jasmine</a>'s is a better playmaker that works for all Plant Decks, <a data-name=""Aromaserapy Rosemary"">Rosemary</a>'s buffs the ATK of your board and negates effects and <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Majoram"">Majoram</a>'s searches some importaint Traps.  The traps in question are <a data-name=""Humid Winds"">Humid Winds</a>, <a data-name=""Dried Winds"">Dried Winds</a> and <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a>. Of course I only run the former and latter. Humid lets you search a mage, and Blessed serves as a way to get LP or summon an Aroma monster form the GY.  The spells are also pretty important. <a data-name=""Aroma Garden"">Aroma Garden</a> being a field that grants consistent LP and an atk buff to go with Rosemary's, and <a data-name=""Aroma Gardening"">Aroma Garden<em>ing</em></a> does the same but also lets you get a monster form the deck if you happen to be losing.  Off theme support includes <a data-name=""Spore"">Spore</a>, <a data-name=""Rose Princess"">Rose Princess</a>, <a data-name=""White Rose Cloister"">White Rose Cloister</a>, <a data-name=""Rose Fairy"">Rose Fairy</a>, and <a data-name=""Staysailor Romarin"">Staysailor Romarin</a>. I also run <a data-name=""Gingerbread House"">Gingerbread House</a> as a tech for more LP and possible popping of their monsters or making Rosemary's negate a quick effect, <a data-name=""Juragedo"">Juragedo</a> as a free body that also gets LP and <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a> and <a data-name=""Super Solar Nutrient"">Super Solar Nutrient</a> for more summoning form the deck.  The Extra Deck, besides the Aromaseraphy monsters, also has the game-breaking <span><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></span>, as well as <span><a data-name=""Desert Locusts"">Desert Locusts</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Trishula</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Ancient Sacred Wyvern"">Ancient Sacred Wyvern</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""FA Dawn Dragster"">Dawn Dragster</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a></span>, and...that's about it  For the side I actually have 4 open slots so Efect Veiler and Twin Twisters are placeholders. The actual side deck has<a data-name=""Red Resonator""> Red Resonator</a>, <a data-name=""Ghost Sister and Spooky Dogwood"">Ghost Sister and Spooky Dogwood</a>, <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>, <a data-name=""Rose Lover"">Rose Lover</a> and a 3rd copy of Gardening and Blessed Winds.  This is my Aromage deck, as per usual I appreciate some feedback (though I will preface this by saying that I will eventually acquire Dried Winds.)"

This tries to capture the feeling of drawing that blue bricky card and be able to play it like a regular monster just as we all did as kids.  The main strategy of this deck relies on Phul (Ritual From the Deck), Bethor (Blow up opponents cards) and Phaleg to increase the attack of ALL monster you have on your side of the field, *also the effect stacks*  It's another very *VERY* casual deck but really cheap and easy to pilot after reading all the card text feels very intuitive  Have fun and enjoy the main deck links without the arrows!"

Ojamas and Melffys act as an advantage engine to hard make the links usually by stalling through your opponent's first turn and using Mellfy Catty and Ojama Pajama getting a Red with Cat and searching and immediately discarding an Ojamagic to get your three vanillas. Use Rescue Cat and Obedience Schooled to both make your Melffy XYZ and access your mini Tri-Brigade engine. This deck has been my baby for the past couple months and I now share it with you. I'm sharing this more to see how you all take this decks shape and upgrade it.

Most of the monsters from Invincible Fortress are present here and retain their high defenses, they just operate with a different overall play style than before.</span>  <span>The main theme of the deck is utilizing Rock monster Flip-Summoning to place your opponent's monsters back into their hand, paving the way for multiple direct attacks. What makes this much easier, is that the majority of the monsters here all share the same effect of: ""Once per turn: You can change this card to face-down Defense Position"".</span>  <span><span>MAIN DECK</span></span> <span>Each monster that can be flipped face-down once per turn activate the following effects when they are Flip-Summoned:</span> <span><span><em><span>Golem Sentry</span></em></span> - Returns 1 of your opponent's monsters to their hand.</span> <span><span><em><span>Guardian Sphinx</span></em></span> - Returns all of your opponent's monsters to their hand (requires 1 Tribute to summon).</span> <span><span><em><span>Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx</span></em></span> - Shuffles all monsters your opponent controls back into the deck (requires 2 Tributes to summon).</span> <span><span><em><span>Medusa Worm</span></em></span> - Destroys 1 monster your opponent controls. <span><em><span>Des Lacooda</span></em></span> - You draw 1 card. <span><em><span>Moai Interceptor Cannons</span></em></span> - Can be flipped face down, but does not have a secondary effect.</span>  <span>There are also various ways to protect your monsters. Controlling <span>Hieracosphinx</span> prevents your opponent from attacking your face down monsters, while <span>Swords Of Revealing Light</span> prevents all attacks against you for 3 turns. <span>Catapult Zone</span> can be used to protect your important monsters while sending high level monsters to the GY for easy Special Summoning via <span>The Shallow Grave</span>, and <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> (be mindful that <span>The Shallow Grave</span> also works for your opponent). <span>Terraforming</span> and <span>Metaverse</span> provide easy access to <span>Catapult Zone</span>.</span>  <span>Other high level monsters include <span>Criosphinx</span> and <span>Exxod, Master Of The Guard</span>. <span>Criosphinx</span> synergizes well with <span>Golem Sentry</span>, <span>Guardian Sphinx</span>, and <span>Ordeal Of A Traveler</span>. These cards return other cards to the hand, and each time a monster is returned to the opponent's hand, <span>Criosphinx</span> causes your opponent to randomly discard 1 card. This can be done multiple times per turn. <span>Exxod, Master Of The Guard</span> combos effectively with any monster that can be flipped face down. Sporting 4000 DEF, he acts as a wall that burns the opponent for 1000 damage each time an EARTH monster is Flip-Summoned, (which is the entire deck lol) although Tributing a Sphinx monster is required to Special Summon him. The effects of <span>Golem Sentry</span> and/or either Sphinx monster can really hurt the opponent, and leave an opening for them to finish off the remainder of Life Points.</span>  <span>The final monster is <span>Des Lacooda</span>, who can also be flipped face down once per turn. This creepy looking guy is a draw engine and the only monster who can be used to <strong>XYZ Summon</strong> <strong>Soul Of Silvermountain</strong>. <span>Des Lacooda</span> is a Zombie monster however, and cannot be protected by <span>Catapult Zone</span>, but can still trigger the effect of <span>Exxod </span><span>due to it's EARTH attribute.</span></span>  <span><span>Attack The Moon</span> is fantastic when you have at least 1 monster that can be flipped. Once per turn, when a Rock monster changes it's battle position, you destroy one of your opponents Spell/Traps. Flipping a monster face-up is a position change. There are also 2 <span>Dust Tornadoes</span> for a little more coverage.</span>  <span>Lastly, <span>Staunch Defender</span> can be used to force your opponents to attack monsters they cannot defeat, such as any Sphinx monster or <span>Exxod</span>.</span>  <span><span>EXTRA DECK</span></span> <span>There are 4 different <strong>XYZ</strong> monsters, 3 of which require 2 <span>Level 4</span> monsters, and only 1 that requires 2 <span>Level 3's.</span> <strong>Number 55: Gogogo Goliath</strong> lets you add <span>Level 4</span> or lower EARTH monsters from your GY to your hand, recycling any defeated monsters. <strong>Gallant Granite</strong> is an amazing searcher, as he allows you to either add any Rock monster from your deck to your hand, or Special Summon one in face-down defense position, providing a very simple way to get your hands on <span>Exxod</span> or <span>Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx</span>, as well as summon the latter without having to Tribute Summon. <strong>Number 52: Diamond Crab King's</strong> rather complex effect can be strategically used to either provide a solid defensive wall, or unleash a devastating attack. Lastly, <strong>Soul Of Silvermountain, </strong><span>the only <span>Rank 3</span> monster in the Extra Deck</span> renders 2 of your opponent's set Spell/Traps from being used as long as it exists on the field.</span>  <span>This deck is a lot of fun to use and has won me quite a bit of duels, both in real life, and in the Link Evolution video game. Feel free to share any ideas/strategies that you think might work better and I'll look into them.</span>"

You will almost never brick at the start and will always be able to achieve something in your first couple of turns. Red-eyes fusion is probably the most important card in this deck and with magicalize fusion as well, two copies of Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon are easy to summon. As stated in the title, this deck is still a work in progress, and is subject to change. For instance, if I find a card that I think works well with the deck, a card like mountain is easily on the chopping block. Anyway, enjoy!"

I also use thunder king and denko, forsome lockdown plays and also vylon prism for summoning crimsom blader, which is very good against any monster who has a level, with level 5 or higher (aka dragoon). So the basic combo is the following:  having pa/ma and another level 4 light thunder type monster: <ul>  	<li>Normal summon pa/ma;</li>  	<li>Uses pa/ma effect to normal summon another level 4 light thunder type monster;</li>  	<li>Overlay both monsters into utopia double;</li>  	<li>Detach a material from double tosearch double or nothing and to summon utopia dragner;</li>  	<li>Double detach from utopia dragner to summon hoping harbing, if youre going first, or utopia beyond, if youre going second</li> </ul> The ending board is dragner, who can turn the atk of one attacking monster 0, and hoping harbinger, who can negate the effect of a spell card once per turn, and thats not counting the extenders like double summon and recycling battle or handtraps. You can do combos a little bit biggers, but the basic board is this. If you draw thunder sea horse, a level 4 light thunder monster and wonder xyz, you can do this basic board during the opponent turn, because utopia double and utopiadragnereffects are quick effects."

The only thing this deck lacks is jiggle physics.</span>  <span><span><em>BASIC SWARM/HARPIE'S PET BABY DRAGON:</em></span> Normal Summon <span>Harpie Channeler</span>, use <span>Elegant Egotist</span> to Special Summon either <span>Harpie Lady 1</span>, or <span>Harpie Lady Sisters</span>, then use <span>Harpie Channeler's</span> effect to Special Summon <span>Harpie's Pet Baby Dragon</span> by discarding <span>Harpie Harpist</span>. When a Dragon monster is on the field, <span>Harpie Channeler</span> becomes <span>Level 7</span>. <span>Harpie Oracle</span> can be Special Summoned when there is a <span>Level 5</span> or higher Harpie monster present. You now have at least 3 Harpie monsters on the field, activating all 3 of <span>Harpie's Pet Baby Dragon's</span> effects. During the End Phase, the effects of <span>Harpie Harpist </span>in the GY and <span>Harpie</span> <span>Oracle</span> on the field will activate. Harpist adds a Winged-Beast with 1500 or less ATK from the deck to the hand, and Oracle allows you to retrieve a card from the GY that has ""<span>Harpie Lady Sisters</span>"" in it's text, in this case, <span>Elegant Egotist</span>.</span>  <span><span><em>STAY STOCKED:</em></span> Any turn after activating <span>Hysteric Sign</span>, when it is destroyed, you can add 3 different Harpie cards from your deck to your hand. Once it's successfully activated, use one of these scenarios to quickly destroy it and fill your hand with the important things:</span> <span>1). <span>Link Summon Harpie Conductor</span>, declare an attack on a monster you can't defeat, then activate her effect to destroy a Spell/Trap you control instead, destroy <span>Hysteric Sign</span>.</span> <span>2). Play <span>Harpie's Hunting Ground</span>, summon a Harpie monster to trigger it's effect, destroy <span>Hysteric Sign</span>.</span> <span>Of course, you could just wait for a monster to be targeted for an attack and use <span>Harpie Conductor</span> to activate her effect, but doing it with method #1 is obviously quicker.</span>  <span><span><em>6000 LP OR LESS = 3 TURN WIN:</em></span> If your opponent has 6000 or less Life Points, you can win the match within 3 turns assuming nothing happens to prevent the following setup. Use 3 <span>Level 4</span> WIND monsters to <strong>XYZ Summon Harpie's Pet Phantasmal Dragon</strong>. It's effect not only allows you to attack your opponent directly, but it also protects all of your Harpie monsters from being targeted by effects or attacks, as long as it has material. At the End Phase of each turn, 1 material is detached. <span>Mirror Force</span>, <span>Raigeki</span>, and similar cards, or attack prevention such as <span>Swords Of Revealing Light</span> are the only way to stop this dragon's onslaught while it still has material.</span>  <span>Other useful cards:</span> <span><span><em>Harpie's Pet Dragon</em></span>: This sexy dragon has fantastic ATK/DEF which only climbs higher the more Harpie Ladies you have. With a full field of 5 Harpie Ladies, it's attack can reach 3500. If 3 of the monsters are <span>Harpie Lady 1</span>, it will reach maximum power at 4400. <span><em><span>Alluring Mirror Split</span></em></span>: When a Harpie Lady is destroyed by battle, Special Summon a replacement. <span><em>Hysteric Party</em></span>: Did your opponent just activate a <span>Mirror Force</span>? That's cute. Keep 1 card in your hand to use this Trap and get all your Harpie monsters right back after they are slain. <em><span><span>Three Of A Kind</span></span></em>: After using the BASIC SWARM strategy explained earlier, this card can be activated, which destroys 3 cards your opponent controls. Combined with <span>Harpie's Pet Baby Dragon</span>, you can rid the field of 4 of your opponent's cards during a single Main Phase. <em><span>Harpie's Feather Storm</span></em>: A Hand-Trap that protects you from monster effects for an entire turn. <span><em>Cyber Slash Harpie Lady</em></span>: The strongest un-boosted monster in the deck, which doesn't require any outside Tuner monsters due to her awesome transformation effect.</span>  <span>This a versatile archetype with lots of other Harpie cards bearing similar effects. Capable of swarming and destruction, there are other honorable mentions such as <span>Birdface</span>, <span>Harpie Dancer</span>, and <span>Harpie Lady Phoenix Formation</span>, among others. This is just the setup I've found to be the most reliable. You could also incorporate other archetypes that synergize well with Winged Beasts and/or WIND monsters, but as I've said before, I prefer pure Harpie. This deck is so much fun. It's won me lots of duels and is one of my favorites to use. It might not be meta, but it sure packs one heck of a punch.</span>"

The boss monsters in this deck are as follows:  <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Beyond"">Number 39: Utopia Beyond</a> <a data-name=""ARC Rebellion XYZ Dragon"">ARC Rebellion XYZ Dragon</a> <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</a> <a data-name=""Number 99: Utopic Dragon"">Number 99: Utopic Dragon</a> <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>  MAIN STRATEGY  First, let's hope you have drawn a <strong><a data-name=""Time Thief Regulator"">Time Thief Regulator</a></strong>, and that your opponent is going first. Let's also hope that your opponent ends their turn with a monster left in attack position that can be effected by your card effects.  First, normal summon your <strong>Time Thief Regulator</strong>, summoning <strong><a data-name=""Time Thief Winder"">Time Thief Winder</a></strong> and <strong><a data-name=""Time Thief Bezel Ship"">Time Thief Bezel Ship</a></strong> from your deck.  Summoning your <strong>Time Thief Winder</strong> will trigger its effect. Add <strong><a data-name=""Time Thief Adjuster"">Time Thief Adjuster</a></strong> to your hand using this effect.  XYZ summon <strong><a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a></strong>, and then activate it by detaching <strong>Bezel Ship</strong> to add <strong><a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a> </strong>to your hand. Do not set <strong>Double or Nothing!</strong>.  Special summon <strong><a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Beyond"">Number 39: Utopia Beyond</a></strong>, as the final part of <strong>Number 39: Utopia Double</strong>'s effect, using <strong>Utopia Double</strong> as the XYZ material.  This special summon will trigger <strong>Utopia Beyond</strong>'s effect, changing all of your opponent's current face-up monsters' attack to 0.  <strong>Utopia Beyond</strong> will also have 6000 attack permanently, and will not be able to attack directly due to <strong>Utopia Double</strong>'s effect.  Special summon <strong>Bezel Ship</strong> by its own effect, detaching a material from your XYZ monster. Special summoning <strong>Bezel ship</strong> will trigger <strong>Time Thief Adjuster</strong>'s effect, special summoning it as well.  XYZ summon <strong><a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a></strong> in attack position.  Enter your battle phase.  Declare an attack on any monster (You won't be able to attack directly) with <strong>Number 39: Utopia Beyond</strong>, but negate the attack with <strong>Utopia</strong>.  Negating the attack will allow you to activate <strong>Double or Nothing!</strong>. Activate it. This will allow your <strong>Utopia Beyond</strong> to attack again, doubling it's attack during the damage step.  If all goes well, your opponent will have lost all of their life points, taking 12000 damage at that time.  You do not have to play exactly this strategy. It is just as easy to use Raidraptors to achieve this same end goal.  There are many other strategies in this deck that can OTK/FTK as well. Be sure to experiment with this deck to find out which one you enjoy the most.  The side deck is outfitted with cards to be able to handle meta deck such as Virtual Worlds, and even more sinister decks, such as Drytrons or Cubics."

The Dogmatikas. The bane of any extra deck-focused deck, which, when combined with Shaddolls and Invoked, forms a disgustingly powerful control deck. That's not what we're doing today. Today is all about the deck in its purest form.  The Dogmatikas are all about their crusade against the extra deck, so we'll barely ever use ours. I say barely because Dogmatikas cannot go first on their own. The best you can do is normal summon Ecclesia or Adin and set some traps to live until your next turn. Because of this, we're running Instant Fusion to summon out Millennium-Eyes Restrict which can be linked off into Linkuriboh to fulfil the conditions for every single summon except for Nexus and White Knight. However, Instant Fusion is currently sitting at 1, so you're rarely going to draw it in your opening hand. To fix this glaring issue, you can substitute Retort Fusion and use Kamionwizard to summon Magistus Maiden Artemis instead of the Linkuriboh play. You can also use Darkfire Dragon and summon out Striker Dragon to pretend you're doing a dragon link combo. Just be aware that the TCG doesn't exactly have this card yet, so if you get your hands on a playset of Retort Fusion and use it at an official tournament, you're gonna be disqualified.  So now, we come to the extra deck. As with all Dogmatika builds, you need to be careful about which cards you're dumping from your extra deck throughout your turn. N'tss is a non-OPT pop anything on the field so only send this when you have stuff to pop. Fossil Warrior Skull Knight is your extra copies of N'tss, but it comes with an upside. If you've already popped all the troublesome monsters on your opponent's field, he can just sit in grave until you're ready to use him. The goodest of bois. Titaniklad is pretty self-explanatory. He gives you a free summon from deck in the end phase (or a free search if you'd rather have that), but this effect is a hard OPT so you can't just dump 3 Titaniklad and build a board like that. Wind Pemasus @Ignister strikes fear into your opponent's heart as they constantly fear its effect to shuffl one of their monsters into the deck after they destroy one of yours. And finally, Herald of the Arc Light. Unlike every single synchro deck in recent memory, we only care about its ritual spell/monster search effect. This gets you White Knight who can dump Titaniklad using Dogmatikalamity to summon itself from hand.  Now it's time for the main deck. Most of these cards should be familiar. Ecclesia searches your archetype, Maximus sends 2 cards from both extra decks to grave, Fleurdelis boosts attack when your cards declare attacks and negates a monster's effects if you have another Dogmatika on field, Nadir Servant is the single-most busted search card in the game, and Punishment sends a card from your extra deck to the GY to destroy and opponent's monster as long as the attack is greater than that opponent's monster. As for the cards that you might not know, Adin is a free summon from hand that can float into any Dogmatika from deck (except Nexus and White Knight of course). White Knight lets you send a card from both extra decks to the GY when your opponent activates an effect. Ashiyan summons itself when an extra deck summon is sent to the GY and even adds a Dogmatika from grave back to hand as consolation. Nexus is your win condition. Lightning Storm on attack declaration and burns if it killed any extra deck monsters by the effect. Not to mention its amazing summon condition that lets you empty your opponents GY of extra deck monsters to summon itself.  As for spell cards, Called By is for handtrap insurance, Dwimmered Path adds any Dogmatika from GY to hand, Dogmatika Nation provides some protection to your Dogmatikas, and Dogmatikacism gives you some way to lower an opponent's monster's attack and gives you a free extra deck dump when that monster is destroyed. Handtraps are handtraps, and you can sub out the ones I used for whichever fit the scene you're in. Same with the handtraps in the side deck. As for the 3 extra deck monsters in the side deck, you can sub these in if you refuse to give in to the temptation of the extra deck. Omega recurs resources, Link God is the biggest technically-summonable send for Punishment, and the third Fossil Warrior is like the other 2 Fossil Warriors, but he's actually happy to be here.  There's quite a few other options you can run in the deck if you want to. Almiraj helps with that whole ""you have almost zero way to set up a board first turn"" by using Adin as its link material. Mega Zaborg can dump 8 cards from both extra decks on summon, but like all Monarchs, he tends to brick your hands more often than not. Theo is bad. But he's also a Dogmatika if you really want the whole church present. Just don't play more than one. Dogmatika Encounter and Genesis are also quite bad. But if you run into an issue known as ""my opponent refuses to summon from the extra deck"", Encounter can help get your monsters on field. Genesis is still really situational though, so only run that if you know you'll be able to fulfil its activation requirements consistently. Kaijus and their like do what they've always done and eat your opponent's boss monsters before they become an issue. Lightning Storm is Lightning Storm and since you're almost always going second, it can help deal with backrow decks. Forbidden Droplets is even more insurance against your opponent's bunguses.

Some combos include using Magician's Restage to summon Magicians' Souls and using Magicians' Souls to send it to the graveyard to draw cards. Magician's Restage also works on Berry Magician Girl. Magician's Restage is also useful in summoning Predaplant Verte Anaconda.  Using Eye of Timaeus, you can summon either Dragoon or Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight. One of my favorite things to do with this deck is using the effect of Kiwi Magician Girl to increase Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight's attack to higher levels to beat over foes, since nothing's more humiliating than losing to Dark Magician Girls in general.  Of course there's always the tried and tested Predaplant Verte Anaconda into Dragoon combo that's in nearly every deck nowadays. There's also the summoning of Divine Arsenal AA Zeus from two level ones including Magicians' Souls or Berry Magician Girl.  This deck also includes Ash Blossom and Solemn Judgement, although these can switched out for any other hand traps or field traps of your liking, these are the ones I went with."

With all of them on the field, your opponent can not: (Attack | Special Summon | Set monsters | activate Spells/Traps ).  In other words, they can do nothing. This far, I could only make out two cards that could threaten this combo: Volcanic Queen and Galaxy Cyclone. Both of those are run very rarely if ever. Normal Kaijus don't work because your opponent cannot special summon. Sphere mode and Lava Golem don't work because you never want to have more than one monster on the field after resolving your combo. And other Spell/Trap removal options don't work because they can't be activated from the field.  &nbsp;  Your core strategy is this:  Summon House Duston/Stygian Security  Run into the enemies monster and special summon as many Dustons as possible to either side of the field. (make sure to give your opponent at least two dustons, except white or house duston).  Activate Mystic Mine and set Anti-Spell fragrance.

But first, since I went through some trouble building the deck due to motives explained below, I changed the rules for the challenge and take a similar approach to some special decklists posted on OCG. That rule being that I know must use, at least, 30 cards on my Main Deck that belong on the original card list of the Structure Deck, where having multiple copies of a card will count. But the 40-card Main deck rule stays.  Now, as for the achetype itself, the Spirit Charmer Structure Deck actually covers 3 sub-archtypes linked together by their playstyle; those being Charmers, Familiar-Possessed and Awakening of the Possessed.  Charmers are a series of Level 3 Spellcaster-Type Flip monsters with 500 Atk/1500 Def with share the effect that if the card is flipped, you can target one monster your opponent controls that shares its attribute and take control of it while the Flip monster remains on the field. This Flip monster also cover all attributes on the game, except DIVINE: Eria for WATER, Hiita for FIRE, Aussa for EARTH, Wynn (not Winda, and no, not that one) for WIND, Lyna for LIGHT and Dharc for DARK.  Familiar-Possessed are a series of Level 4 Spellcaster-Type monsters with 1850 Atk/1500 Def that represent an ""upgraded"" form of all 6 Charmers. All of them can be Special Summoned from the hand or Deck by sending their respective Charmer monster and a face-up monster on your side of the field with the same attribute as that Charmer monster. Also, if summoned by this method, all of them can deal piercing damage. However, Lyna and Dharc have an additional effect: Lyna can add 1 Spellcaster-Type monster with 1500 Def from your Deck to your hand, while Dharc can add 1 Level 3 or 4 LIGHT Spellcaster monster.  Finally, Awakening of the Possessed consists of Level 5 monsters with 2000 Atk/200 Def that can also be Special Summoned from the hand or deck by sending a face-up Spellcaster-type monster and a face-up Level 4 or lower monster with the same attribute as the Level 5 monster, where in this case there isn't a LIGHT or DARK monster. All of them have an effect when summoned by their summoning condition and a floating effect: <ul>  	<li>Rasenryu (WIND): Return a card your opponent controls to the hand, without targeting. If is sent from the field to the GY: Add either a ""Possessed"" Spell/Trap or ""Spiritual Wind Art - Miyabi"" from the Deck to your hand.</li>  	<li>Nefariouser Archfiend (EARTH): Special Summon a Level 4 or lower monster from the GY with its effects negated. If is sent from the field to the GY: Add either a ""Possessed"" Spell/Trap or ""Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane"" from the Deck to your hand.</li>  	<li>Gagigobyte (WATER): Send a random card from your opponent's hand to the GY, then, both players draws 1 card. If is sent from the field to the GY: Add either a ""Possessed"" Spell/Trap or ""Spiritual Water Art - Aoi"" from the Deck to your hand.</li>  	<li>Greater Inari Fire (FIRE): Burn your opponent equal to the original ATK of 1 monster they control (you can chose the target, but by how the effect is written, it actually doesn't target). If is sent from the field to the GY: Add either a ""Possessed"" Spell/Trap or ""Spiritual Fire Art - Kurenai"" from the Deck to your hand.</li> </ul> For their new support of the Structure Deck (at last, after overexplaining the archtype):  Spirit Charmers is a interesting card. As a Quick-Play Spell, you can discard a card to take 2 cards from your deck that are either ""Charmer"" monsters, ""Familiar-Possessed"" monsters or ""Possessed"" Spells/Traps; then you will add 1 of them to your hand and the other is Set on the field. It can summon the Flip monsters face-down from the Deck, searches backrow, which is really good, and adds consistency to the Deck. It think is obvious you run 3.  Awakening of the Possessed (AotP for short), not the series of monsters, is a Continuous Spell with 3 effects, where only the last one is a hard OPT: <ul>  	<li>ALL MONSTERS YOU CONTROL gain 300 ATK for each different Attribute you control. And yes, it can stack with multiple copies of itself, like TGX300 or Solidarity.</li>  	<li>""Charmer"" and ""Familiar-Possessed"" monsters you control cannot be destroyed by card effects.</li>  	<li>As the hard OPT, if you Normal or Special Summon a Spellcaster monster with 1850 ORIGINAL ATK, draw 1 card (is mandatory, for some reason).</li> </ul> Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin is their Field Spell that negates the first monster effect used by your opponent as long as you control a Spellcaster monster with 1500 Def. It also has an additional effect to search monsters with 1500 Atk/200 Def, but is mainly played due to the negate.  Moving to the traps, Possessed Partnerships is a Normal Trap that Special Summons a Spellcaster monster with 1500 Def from your hand or GY, and then destroys a face-up card on the field if you control 2 or more different Attributes. It can also banish itself from the GY to place a ""Possessed"" Continuous Spell/Trap from the GY on the field, face-up.  The last card is Unpossessed, a Continuous Trap with 3 effects, the last one being a hard OPT, like AotP: <ul>  	<li>""Charmer"" monster cannot be destroyed by battle, helping to their playstyle and to maintain control of the stolen monster.</li>  	<li>""Familiar-Possessed"" monsters gains 800 ATK when attacking an opponents monster. (They don't get ATK with direct attacks or while being attacked).</li>  	<li>The hard OPT, and oh boy this is a mouthful, is that if a monster(s) is destroyed by any means while this card is already face-up on the field: You can Special Summon from your Deck a Spellcaster monster with 1500 Def in Attack Position or face-down Defense Position, but its Attribute must be different from the destroyed monster(s).</li> </ul> For the outside support, and the reason I made the new rule, are the following: <ul>  	<li>Dharc &amp; Lyna: For some reason, the Structure Deck does not come with Dharc &amp; Lyna, despite they covering some of the most popular Attributes ever played, and also being the Attributes with the most amount of monsters. For that reason, and also for the possible search their ""Familiar-Possessed"" do, I added them to the mix.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Eda the Sun Magician: If Normal or Flip Summoned, it can Special Summon any Spellcaster monster with 1500 Def from the Deck in face-down Defense Position. During the opponent's turn, as a Quick-Play, can flip a face-down Spellcaster monster to face-up Attack Position. I add it for placing an specific ""Charmer"" monster on the field and then use it for disruption for the opponent's turn, possibly stealing a playmaker, that is if they aren't destroyed beforehand.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>There are no Extra Deck monsters on the Structure Deck, not even the Link-2 Charmers. You can go wild in this section, but for my recommendation, I suggest both Lyna and Aussa for Attribute coverage and to steal monsters for link climbing, Selene for revival of the Main Deck Spellcasters and also link climbing, any Link-4 or higher monster that is generic (I went with Borrelsword Dragon and Underworld Goddess), Day-Breaker for a bit of extra removal, and finally, any R4NK Xyz Monster (I decided for Tornado Dragon for backrow removal and The Lightning package).</li> </ul> Anyway, I hope you enjoy the decklist and for the next time, it will be the Obelisk and Slifer Structure Decks. Until next time!"

Mainly going for red super nova dragon which is really hard to deal with for some decks. The deck can also easily OTK with quite a lot of special summons and high ATK dragons. The main problem is that the deck runs out of resources very fast and has only little recovery due to red rising dragon's and ede imp saber's GY effects. Super polymerization just destroys the deck most of the time. Other hand traps are also very problematic to deal with. The main play of the deck is to summon crimson resonator and edge imp tomahawk which mills edge imp sabers. Then synchro for red rising dragon, summon back crimson resonator, summon creation and synkron resonator with crimson, go for red super nova dragon, add creation resonator back with synkron resonator and summon it, then summon edge imp sabers, synchro for another red rising dragon and go for red dragon archfiend abyss to get a negate.  https://youtu.be/xNoID6bXtN8"

This rips two cards and establishes what I call 'The Monarch Lock'. Domain with a Monarch locks out of extra deck, and if you have a majesty's then you also get a monster effect lock. You can also just use Erupt as your monster effect lock. Most of the time, the extra deck lock can really shut down some decks and if it doesn't, game two you can side for something like sphere mode or another Caius the mega monarch.  This may sound confusing but trust me this deck is pretty simple to understand.  &nbsp;  Again, any suggestions are appreciated."

Have fun! ,"Usually with Fluffals, they're a going second deck. This deck can fluctuate depending on your starting hand. If you have Polymerization in your starting hand, then you're in great shape. If you have Divine Wrath in your starting hand, you should try to hold onto that for a little while because it might be destroyed if you set it first turn. Once you Fusion summon once, do it again if you want depending on the current board state. If you are going second, then try to go into Daredevil as soon as possible, but go into Frightfur Sheep otherwise."

Normal the lvl 4 rock -&gt; Activate Researcher -&gt; activate Analyzer. Use the effect of Researcher and Analyzer you are looking to hit Adamancipator Crystal Dragite to draw a card or Koa'Ki Mieru Guardian to protect the board or plays. Synchro into Adamancipator Risen Raptite to special a rock from top 5. Link 2 for Crystron Halqifibrax to special Researcher or Seeker. Link 2 for Predaplant Verte Anaconda using Halqifibrax. Synchro into Borreload then equip Halqifibrax. Activate Verte Anaconda to send Red-Eyes Fusion, Red-Eyes Black Dragon and Dark Magician from the deck to the graveyard. The Fossil Engine is used to create beaters in the grind game or to make a material to extend plays. A 2 card combo would be Miracle Rupture and Adamancipator Signs. Use Rupture to send Dragite from deck to grave and then use signs to Special Dragite from the GY. Use the effects to add Researcher or Seeker to the top of the deck then draw with Dragite to start your combo. Problems are bricking with Dragun materials and being unable to extend from a handtrap or whiff."

Overlay 2 level 6 dragunity on your field into Atum. Now use Atum to detach Gae Dearg and SSummon Darkness Metal from your Deck (DMetal should be in Defense Position bc its ATK/DEF will be 0). Now activate DMetal to SSummon Gae Dearg from GY once again then activate Gae Dearg again to add and discard Baby Roc and immediately SSummon Baby Roc. That is the basic 1 card-combo. It will end up you having 4 monsters on the field and then you can link your monster into anything your like (L2 Spheres to bounce your opponent's monster, L4 Borrelsword of Apollousa for main beater or negations, or L2 Whelp, send Dragon Buster to the GY and somehow equip it to one of your beater by DMZ Dragon to lock your opponent from SSummon from his/her Extra). After that, you can still make better board using remain cards in your hand. Here's some ways: <ul>  	<li>Now if you still have Ravine in your hand and 1 card, you can either use Ravine to send Absorouter in order to add Tracer to your hand, NSummon it, destroy Ravine by its effect and go for Crystal Wing, Chaos Ruler or Borreload Savage (equip it with Romulus and get 2 negates), OR send White or Black Dragon to GY to get the remain, SSummon it and link for Pisty and revive some Dragon</li>  	<li>If you have World Legacy Guardragon, it's great bc you can use it with Ravine to perform many nice play, like making 1-level 8 synchro (Chaos Ruler or Savage Dragon, but I prefer Chaos Ruler 'cause it can get Synchron by chance with its effect and it can be easily revived) then somehow, mostly by SSummon your Rokket Synchron back with WLG which was luckily send to GY by Chaos Ruler effect or Ravine (if you have multiple copies of it in your hand), to synchro into Hot Red Dragon</li> </ul> Advantages:  -Short combos and not complicated  -Multiple negations and attacks with huge ATK in case you make the best board  -Hard to break after being made successful  -Multiple ways to start combo (Dragunity Start Combo, Rokket Start Combo, White/Black Dragon Start Combo)  -Multiple ways to beat your opponent (Borreload S. Dragon, Crystal Wing, Hot Red Dragon and mostly Borrelsword D.)  Drawbacks:  -Totally stopped and destroyed by hand traps  -Can easily trigger your OP 's nibiru  -Due to the banlist, it's now weaker than many decks (Drytron, Tri-Brigade, Shaddoll)  -Can be destructed by multiple destroying unstoppable cards (Accesscode Talker)"

I made a deck like this about three years as just a fun casual deck to get me back a little into Yu-Gi-Oh and I didn't realize how much some of these cards are now. So definitely not a budget deck but I wanted to add some stuff to it and all of the cards I added are inexpensive so I think you can salvage something for a budget if you wanna try it out. I have yet to try this one out yet so once I can add the cheap cards I'll test it and depending on the results I might edit this or leave it. This was just a way to visualize how I would mix up the deck and what cards I'm going to add.

IT'S A CUTE BIRB. DO YOU NEED ANY MORE REASON?,"Annoy the heck out of your opponent by 'normal' summoning one million times per turn and completely stop them from doing anything at all.  Note that if you play this deck, you run the risk of your opponent surrendering before you even finish your combo. No, it's that long. They just realize that they have no chance to win against these birbs, either that or it just flew right over their head. On the off chance that your opponent didn't surrender after seeing your monstrous birb, however, you can shut down their play with your floodgates and then peck them to death.  Jokes aside, the birbs are VERY cute, and this deck is pretty impeckkable. Try it out.  IMPORTANT: You absolutely need Lucky Straight in your extra deck. He will watch over you and make sure you don't brick your hand."

The house is on fire!!!,"<span>This is the first guid oa a deck written by my brother, being  his YCS remote duel SA choice. I hope you enjoy his guide as much as I do.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Eternal fire</b>  &nbsp;  <span>The almighty fire fiends of the great sacred tree are useful once again in this modern format . You can ask why or maybe how, and I will have answers for both questions . </span>  <span>First of all, basically every infernoid is a D. D. Crow, it means that there is no card in GY safe from being banished when these fiends hit the field . On top of that, the archetype’s big monsters can fully clean the field, monsters and back row.</span>  <span>Now, let’s go to how the deck functions and why I built it like that:</span>  &nbsp;  <span>MONSTER:</span>  &nbsp;  <i><span>I don’t want to set world on fire </span></i><span>crew:</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Antra, Harmadik and Patrulea</b><span> are here to serve as food to the bigger infernoids or for a quick answer to any threat in the field using </span><b>Decatron</b><span> . Antra bounces anything, Harmadik destroys one monster and Patrulea destroys one spell/trap, and also, they have the common quick effect of banishing any card in gy, only with a cost to tribute one monster in field (including themselves).</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Decatron</b><span> is here for a lot of reasons (pun with reasoning). Reason 1: </span><b>Reasoning</b><span> and </span><b>Monster Gate</b><span>, with these two cards you can mill almost fully deck  given space to play with almost all the other infernoids, and in the end finish with its summoning and mill the last infernoid that you need. Reason 2, is an excellent fist bait for any interactions that your opponent might have. Reason 3, with the trap </span><b>Void Feas</b><span>t, always has the chance to summon two of it and a Sjette or one of it and Seistema, in conclusion two of one mill on top of this action. Reason 4, Decatron gains the effect of any infernoid; that's awesome!! </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Sjette and Attondel</b><span> are here because I like them and they are good targets for Void Feast. That 's all.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Seistema</b><span> is strong for no reason. If it attacks it can banish a card without targeting at the end of the battle phase.  </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Onuncu and Devyaty</b><span>, the big Bosses. Onuncu is a dark hole on legs that negates and banishes spells/traps . Deviaty is a heavy storm on legs that negates and banishes monster’s effects.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Tierra</b><span> is the target for performing fusing using </span><b>Void Imagination</b><span> . Only in the process to summon it, the advantage gained is colossal because it is an instant mill of 6 infernoids . When she hits the field, her effect will gain even more advantage: mill 3 extra deck and top deck’s cards for each player (your opponent loses combo pieces and you can mill </span><b>Psy- Framelord Omega, Wind Pegasus @Ignister or Elder Entity N'Tss</b><span>) .</span>  &nbsp;  <i><span>Tools to set the world on fire </span></i>  &nbsp;  <b>Void Vanishment</b><span> is the search for any other void card and a set up for the Void Feast.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Void Feast </b><span>is a really cool tool, because If you have two of it and another void trap/spell, you could activate the fist one to send a void trap/spell to the Gy and activate the second send the fist Void Feast, getting the two of them resolving.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Void Imagination</b><span> lowers the level of every infernoid to one  with the downside that your opponent will receive half of damage. With that you can continue summon infernoids without worrying about the total level count on the field. However,the real good use is to summon Tierra from your extra deck using 6 monsters from your deck, if your opponent controls a monster special summoned from the extra deck. That’s a set up, follow up and a body with a lot of effects on the field.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Void apocalipse</b><span> is a good card to set up your GY with infernoids that you may need.</span>  &nbsp;  <i><span>The fire is good, but I thing it’s missing some Darkness</span></i>  &nbsp;  <b>The lair of Darkness package</b><span> is here to give the cost of any infernoid to the opponent. The Field spell itself is for that, bypassing even dragoon protection. Ahrima is here to search the field spell and to possibly bring the Diabolos, a very good monster to deal with. Beat Cop is here to tribute an opponent’s monsters and give protection to the field spell.</span>  &nbsp;  <i><span>Psych tricks and magic tricks are also good </span></i>  &nbsp;  <b>The PSY-Framegear Gamma package</b><span> is here to give a chance to interrupt your opponent in his turn without breaking the consistency with reasoning and monster gate. Also PSY-Framelord Omega can be used in rare synchro plays and with Tierra, if he gets milled.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Reasoning and Monster Gate are here to mill the deck, only. One for one, bring fast the Decatron. And the Pot of Extravagance is a pot of greed in this deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <i><span>For the extra deck,staring:</span></i>  &nbsp;  <b>Wee Witch's Apprentice and Duelittle Chimera</b><span> to give that little atack boost for an otk.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Crusadia Equimax</b><span> for a big beat stick.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Gravity Controller</b><span> is a fun one. With Tierra on the field, because it’s level is 11 your play with infernoid should stop right there, but with him, won’t. That’s because Tierra  can be used as material to summon him, leaving the level count on the field equal zero.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Wind Pegasus @Ignister and Elder Entity N'Tss</b><span> can be sent to GY by Tierra. There Elder Entity N'Tss can destroy what you want and Wind Pegasus @Ignistertarget  can  target 1 card your opponent controls; shuffle it into the Deck if any monster gets destroyed.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Relinquished Anima </b><span>can steal one of your opponent's monsters if Deactron gets negated but not destroyed.</span>  &nbsp;  <i><span> The side</span></i>  &nbsp;  <span>Generic to deal with anything. Spell/traps, big fields and give even more interruptions.</span>"

Overall, these three have the best main-deck synergy and open up the board to the other combos of the deck. Ponpoko is a great lead into Tantan, who can special summon Kalantosa, which when special summoned by a Beast, it can destroy any card on the field. This makes Kalantosa the main-deck's carry to maintain board. Additionally, Valerifawn has the ability to special summon Kalantosa from the GY (proccing effect), and leading into, at lowest, level 4 synchro plays. Alpha is also a good emergency monster for when the opponent has board, between being able to special summon from hand if your opponent has a higher total attack point value (which is common since Melffys have the attacking power of a wet napkin), and being able to send Beasts from the field back to the hand to send face-up monsters on your opponent's field to their hand (which is good for clearing extra deck summons). To top it off, Barrier Statue of the Drought is a safety net to keep your opponent from building a non-Earth board for as long as possible.  &nbsp;  <strong>SPELLS</strong>  Most importantly, Obedience Schooled is ideal in a starting hand, first or second. Special summons three Level 2 or lower Beasts from the deck to the field, with the drawback of their effects being negated and only being able to summon Beasts for the rest of the turn (which is good for this deck, since extra deck plays are the build's extenders and carry). Equally important, Hide-and-Seek, which prevents card effect destruction once per turn and can shuffle three Beasts with different names from the GY to the deck, then drawing one card afterwards. Next, Child's Play is incredible in a combo-heavy meta and, if your opponent goes nuts, 10,000 life points is easy to achieve to prevent your monsters from being destroyed by battle, and Foolish Burial is included for the sake of getting Kalantosa to the GY easily to pave the way for Valerifawn. For control, Twin Twisters and Harpie's Feather Duster are solid means of keeping backrow in check.  &nbsp;  <strong>TRAPS</strong>  Mirror Force. Less is more.  &nbsp;  <strong>EXTRA DECK</strong>  Melffy Mommy and Melffy of the Forest are essential to keep this deck well-oiled. Ideally, with starting hand including Obedience Schooled, going OS into Melffy of the Forest is the go-to first play. Then, if Hide-and-Seek isn't in the starting hand, using Forest's effect to get it is the next move. Play H&amp;S, and if there's another Level 2 monster in your starting hand, you could always use it and the other monster summoned by OS to start Mommy, who at 5 materials becomes the ultimate attacker for the deck. Mommy has three stages; at 3 materials, she cannot be destroyed by battle. At 4, you take no battle damage from battles involving her. at 5, any attack position monster she's included in a battle against (whether she's in attack or defense position), her effect deals damage to your opponent equal to the opponent's monster's attack. This is the deck's boss monster and win condition, if successfully protected by H&amp;S and Mirror Force.  Secondarily, Number 64 is good for challenging heavy boards due to its ability to summon tokens with attack equal to the highest attack on the field, and Marjoram alongside Child's Play is a good way to clear cards on the field (once per turn) if Kalantosa isn't an option. Dark Mist is included for grins, but can come in handy in tight spots, as well as the other synchro monsters included in this build."

It was a day like no other, I wanted a deck that had a lot of special summoning but I didn't want to use any main/popular archetypes at the time. I grew interest in garbage lord and his effect as well as others like rescue rabbit and tour guide. It's a simple deck with Box of Friends and Garbage Lord and his Ogre friends. <em><strong>The Goal</strong></em> is when you have a Garbage Lord in your hand you can special summon it, with Lab Wall or Mill Shield on the field you can then use shield &amp; sword for an awesome combo. The XYZ's are just a bonus as well as the instant fusion i just added as fodder plus to put those 3k def monsters to use instead of wasting to the GY you could XYZ summon. THE DECK IS JUST A MEME DECK AND SHOULDN'T BE PLAYED COMPETITIVLEY (<em>Altho I have won some duels with this and it was quite hilarious as it's literal garbage both figuratively and literately</em>)"

Basically we try and keep it really similiar, just adding a few more fusion target, a new side play for heavenly sphere and thats mostly it. The most important thing is, that we are not aiming for five head dragon + 1-2 negates anymore. We rather try to set up follow up turns where we explode and sheer force our self over the opponents board, or grind them turn by turn out.  Lets go over it card by card and talk about the goal we have with this deck.  The dragonmaid core :  3 Chamber : Searches you the fusion spell, hospi to extend, tidying to extend if you have ravine or to set for controll. She is one of the 1 card sphere maker and what is really important, she is the only one able to summon the fusion maids from grave at the start of the bp.  3 Parlor : Basically works the same as chamber and does almost all the same. Only difference she can send tidying directly for combo, but cant gets its controll eff. However if you already have extender in hand she is a good way to get nurse or any other maid you may need later to grave. Also a 1 card sphere  1 Nurse : She is one of the cards holding the deck together. Overworked nurses are sadly also part in a fantasy card game, thats why you want to use her every turn to extend and summon more maids. She is basically a flat +1 or +2 everytime you summon her ones the grave is set.  1 Changeover : Your fusion spell to go into the gem of the deck Dragonmaid Sheou/Strahl or House in rare cases. Important to remember for the gy effect, even if the target leaves the board, you still add changeover to hand.  2 Hospitality : Probably one of the most broken extender to ever be printed. Set up your grave, non target summon from hand and gy. Searchable and one activation a turn no use. Sadly the price tag is justified, but dont buy it if you can avoid. Dont let people sky rock the price and gate people out. the reprint is coming !  3 Tidiyng : Looping cards back to hand and in best case triggering your House is always good, but non target summon from hand or gy in etiher players turn while being searchable by two cards ? This card should be the 40$ one~ Also REMEMBER the targets once targeted dont need to stay on board to resolve. You can tar sphere, chain sphere and bounce 2 cards.  1 Dragonmaid Ernus : Can summon a maid in your opponents turn before they set up the negats , else just for its name and level  1 Dragonmaid Lorpar : Name and Level again. But its also a decent card to force a negate with its discard effect.  &nbsp;  Rokket :  2 Tracer : Its tracer, it summons another rokket for a free  Savage Dragon, and can be summoned by quick launch. Yeah, I dont know how quick launch and this can exist at the same time. Also its a 1 card I:P , allows you to do guardragon through hand traps and is always a combo saver / extender / starter.  1 Absoruter : As we play Ravine we love discarding things that also give us free cards back so this card is already good for us, but it can also work as a mini noctovision dragon if we have a rokket on board. Dragon, free summon and search? Sign me up  1 Silver : Wont come up often but the banish eff can be nice. ( Update : after maybe 100 games, the banish eff still never came up. Still a different name so we keep it)  1 Recharger : target for quicklaunch and tracer, but also can work with striker dragon eff to recycle a tracer back to hand and summon 2 of boot sector <ol>  	<li>Boot Sector : Summon striker, search this spam rokkets. Simple</li>  	<li> 3x Quick Launch : Not once per turn free rokket Monster</li> </ol> Dragons :  2 Noctovision : Make striker = free summon. Simple. gives you a extra draw and protects your set tidying when in grave, this card is basically a dragonmaid. Since its release its been probably the most played card which isnt part of the archtype.  2 Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay : With Sky Striker and other link decks running around, its just a nice card to have, also it fixed goddess weakness of being targeted + its a high level dragon to fusion. Also it lets you dig for super poly and other cards which may save your day when the opponent starts playing solitair. Also it annoys sky striker and we love to do that  1 Dragons Ravine : Search of Romulus and dumb extender and send extender. Or send Gram for another big body. Also cleans your hand of cards you dont want to have there  1 Tempest 1 Gold Sako : Simple combo to search  Parlor or....well there is only Parlor left. Maybe Lorpar in rare cases?  1 Fallen of Albaz : You summon him of Sphere most of the time and just poly away their boss Monster for a titanclad, its a easy dragoon out, as if they negate sphere bounce you just summon him and fusion dragoon away. Its probably my favorite non maid in this deck. ALSO we have a new combo for him, I will explain later.  Hand traps : 3 Ash + Super poly/ Lancea . Super poly is king in this deck as we can also use it during the BP to get a bit more damage on board, while it also just ruins dragonlinks day, and annoys shadoll / invoked to no compare.  2 Ghost Bell : With Tri bri, Sky Striker and Drytron running around this card became much more important again. Specially as it can negate tri bri revolution which is usally the end of the game for them  Extra :  1x Dragonmaid Sheou : Its your best card, its your free summon omni negate, waifu, dragon. Also we play only one because she shuffels herself back.  2x House Dragonmaid : So we can use Sheou omni negate, or pop a whole opponents board. We can shuffel her back and usually dont need more  1x Borrel Savage : Omni negate, whats to say. Sadly not a maid  1x Titanclad the Ashdragon : Summon of Albaz to remove a boss monster or if its send by maximus to get you a free albaz to combo with / fusion into venom dragon  1x Starving Venom Dragon : Its a awesome super poly / fallen of Albaz target. While also a threat to the board right after being summoned.  1x Romulus : Searches Dragon Ravine for you and is a good link 2 target with good zones  1x Pitsy  : The extender dragon which is the last link guardragon not banned YET.  Its a link 1 dragon we can summon to extend and can still use zones of goddess and five head. But dont force a summon with it without the 2. Its rarely worth it  2x Sphere : One of the stronges interrupts in the game + free summon from deck + good zones + being a dragon + 1 card out to dragoon. And can make any light based deck go -3. Will explain that combo in the side deck  1x Mudragon : Super poly target , also the target protection is lovely against sky striker  1x Striker Dragon : link 1. dragon. searches boot sector launch. the only thing this thing misses is a it pointing downwards  1x Underworld Goddess of the Closed World : The new card we try to abuse, or atleast flex with. We usually will always summon her with I:p but its not to hard  summon her with all the dragons and maids rotating at all times. She also doesnt care about DRM and all the annoying things being played. Laughing at Dragoon with her only being outed in battle  1x Link God Dragon/ Fiveheaded Link Dragon : We want to make him almost every turn, as your opponent will 99,99% not play anything that can out this thing. You will have a full grave for atleast 3-4 turns were you could just sit on it , but as you play maids, you will just combo again and again with a 5k beater who cant be stopped.  Side deck : Its really up to you what you play in here but this combo I wanna showcase  1x Albion fusion dragon :  1 x Rokket fusion dragon :  The combo is basically to use sphere to bounce a card of your opponent (-1) summon Fallen of Albus and fusion it with a n opponents light monster into Albion (-2) , summon with Albion Rokket fusion and pop another card with its effect (-3)  All in all this deck is just learning which card leads to which combo, but the end board you should aim for is usually Sphere + Sheou or ones you know the cards a little better you can end on more. But keeping a few hand traps, traps is currently better.  Afterwords : I am happy with how this deck developed over the past months and I think it was close to being as good as this version can be. However the elpy bann really weakend it sadly, more than anyone expacted. The deck rewards you for making decisions in either players turn while also having straight goals which you play towards. But in the end the best part of this deck is, having your opponents scoop instantly after playing five head / no fully realizing how immun it is / not wanting to belive what they read for a moment, while than seeing that they are now on the glock to out this thing or lose.  I think in all my games only 1-2 Persons were able to win after it was summoned. One was just stalling until I ran out of cards to banish other was a Kaiju top deck. So its still a good average of staying and winning you the game.  &nbsp;  And thats my new crap guide to Dragonmaid, you welcome."

Now I finally get to play him the way he deserves to be played. I've been fine-tuning this deck for months, and this build allows me to play Ra as the untouchable, omnipotent god he was always meant to be.</div><div>Here's a card-by-card breakdown of all the excellent support cards Rage of Ra provided, and the most efficient applications of each.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=78665705"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/78665705.jpg"" data-card=""78665705"" data-name=""Ancient Chant"">Ancient Chant</span></a>&nbsp;searches Ra, from either deck or graveyard, graveyard being relevant every now and then (more on that later). It also grants you one extra summon, and gives Ra the power to absorb the ATK/DEF of the monsters tributed to summon him. These are all self-evidently great effects that don't need much examination, but here are a few general notes about making the most of this spell:</div><div>1. Just playing the card gives you an extra tribute summon. You have to remember to banish it from your graveyard before performing the tribute summon if you want Ra to gain the tributes' ATK. On that note, <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=5253985"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/5253985.jpg"" data-card=""5253985"" data-name=""Soul Crossing"">Soul Crossing</span></a> lets you sacrifice your opponent's monsters for a Divine monster (like Ra!). <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=5253985"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/5253985.jpg"" data-card=""5253985"" data-name=""Soul Crossing"">Soul Crossing</span></a> is a Quick-Play spell, and that's obviously awesome, but if you play it as a normal spell on your turn, you can banish <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=78665705"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/78665705.jpg"" data-card=""78665705"" data-name=""Ancient Chant"">Ancient Chant</span></a> from your graveyard first, and Ra will absorb your opponent's monsters' ATK points. This can lead to some interesting variations on Ra's ATK, since the only monsters of your own you'll ever really be sacrificing are Reactor Slime and its two slime tokens for 1500 base ATK points, or <a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=42166000"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/42166000.jpg"" data-card=""42166000"" data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</span></a>&nbsp;for 3000. Of course, that base ATK is in addition to the life points you can then pay to Ra's ATK.</div><div>2. On rare occasions, you might find yourself in a situation where all three copies of Ra are in the graveyard, and you have the Sphere Mode of Ra in play. Sphere Mode only searches Ra from hand or deck. <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=78665705"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/78665705.jpg"" data-card=""78665705"" data-name=""Ancient Chant"">Ancient Chant</span></a>&nbsp;can put Ra back into your hand from the graveyard in this instance, letting you activate an otherwise useless Sphere Mode.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=4059313"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/4059313.jpg"" data-card=""4059313"" data-name=""Blaze Cannon"">Blaze Cannon</span></a>&nbsp;is the card that turns Ra into the all-powerful, game-warping god that he was in the anime. It is a quick-play spell that can't be negated, and it grants Ra three effects for one turn:</div><div>1. Ra is unaffected by your opponent's cards' effects</div><div>2.

Use these monsters to link/xyz summon various monsters. Extra deck is pretty subjective to whichever cards you want to run. I personally like #13 and #31. They're easy to get both out and can force your opponent into attacking them and taking the damage. I chose I:P as a way to give protection to other link monsters. Still looking for link monsters that may be more useful than the ones currently in the deck."

The Twin of my other Rose-themed deck ""World of Roses"".","<blockquote><div>Death offers you thorns, eternity offers you roses, and life offers you both.</div></blockquote> There is only one thing in YuGiOh! that I love as much as I love Cyber Dragons: Rose Dragons!  The Rose Dragon archetype to me has always been a cool concept, Dragons and Roses combined, centered around Synchro summoning. The archetype features one of the most beautiful set of artworks in my eyes. However, the Rose Dragons have never been a really consistent or all around strong archetype. There was always something missing, an important part that somehow got lost. Until now. With the release of Lightning Overdrive, the deck got all the cards it needed so desperately. ""<a data-name=""Basal Rose Shoot"">Basal Rose Shoot</a>"" for example, is a wonderful spell to make the effect of ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" change from an all-in suicide bomb into a black hole with self protection. The archetype also got a new field spell with ""<a data-name=""White Rose Cloister"">White Rose Cloister</a>"". Nothing crazy but it shouldn't be underestimated.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/NQoaPOi.png"" alt=""image"" />  Anyways, let's get to the ""how-to-use"" section of this page. It's actually really not that hard, not that special. The heart of the deck are the Rose Dragonlings. ""<a data-name=""White Rose Dragon"">White Rose Dragon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Blue Rose Dragon"">Blue Rose Dragon</a>"" are your LVL 4 non-tuners while ""<a data-name=""Red Rose Dragon"">Red Rose Dragon</a>"" as well as ""<a data-name=""Roxrose Dragon"">Roxrose Dragon</a>"" are your LVL 3 tuner monsters, which you will be use mainly to summon your Boss monsters like ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"">Black Rose Moonlight Dragon</a>"" as well as ""<a data-name=""Ruddy Rose Dragon"">Ruddy Rose Dragon</a>"". To keep a good 50:50 between Dragon type monsters and monsters of a different type is important to get ""<a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a>"" out more easily, which then goes into your Synchros without the need to fulfill its LVL requirements. You basicly go around the whole process of Synchro summoning via adding up the monsters levels to each others, basicly call it ""Alternative Synchro Summoning"". ""<a data-name=""Rose Princess"">Rose Princess</a>"", altho not being a tuner, can act as one as well if you summon her with her effect. Otherwise, if you don't already have it, you use her to search out ""White Rose Cloister"" as this helps you to easily bring out a tuner and a non-tuner (or simply two monsters) in one turn, by allowing you to special summon a Rose Dragonling or a plant type monster from your hand in case you don't control any monsters but your opponent does. It also helps you buff your LVL 7 Dragon Synchros for a whole 1000 ATK if you make a right guess at the beginning of your turn. Via ""<a data-name=""Ruddy Rose Witch"">Ruddy Rose Witch</a>"", you can even put a plant-type monster on top of your deck, to make the guess for the next turn a 100% right one. The 50:50 in therms of monster types also lets you use ""<a data-name=""Frozen Rose"">Frozen Rose</a>"" more effectively if you are willing to make a little sacrifice. Once you got your Rose-Synchro Boss monsters out, you can protect them more easily with your trap cards. ""<a data-name=""Blooming of the Darkest Rose"">Blooming of the Darkest Rose</a>"" lets your Black Rose Dragon ""dodge"" a fatal blow/effect from your opponent, while ""<a data-name=""Shadow Impulse"">Shadow Impulse</a>"" lets you swap your Synchro monsters, in case your opponent destroy one of them. This works with Black Rose Dragon -&gt; Black Rose Moonlight Dragon and vice versa as well as Ruddy Rose Dragon -&gt; ""<a data-name=""Ascension Sky Dragon"">Ascension Sky Dragon</a>"" and vice versa which leaves you at least not completely open, if your opponent gets over your Synchros. ""<a data-name=""Synchro Transmission"">Synchro Transmission</a>"" however lets you place a trap for your opponent to easily wipe the whole board before he ends his Main Phase if you use it to summon a Black Rose Dragon, as well as giving you a nice little extra card in your next turn, by sending your Black Rose Dragon back to your Extra Deck.  All around I really gotta say that Lightning Overdrive definetely brought some new delicious stuff to this archetype, mostly with its brand new Boss monster; the Ruddy Rose Dragon; as well as with the spell card Basal Rose Shoot. Thanks to Roxrose Dragon, it's almost laughably easy to bring out a Black Rose Dragon which then immediately goes into its new, stronger variant.

The Extra Deck can use any cards you want to.  Starting by explaining the star of the deck, <strong>Slifer the Sky Dragon</strong> (&amp; Executive Producer) is a Level 10 DIVINE Divine-Beast monster with ? Atk/? Def. He, alongside Obelisk &amp; Ra share the same summoning condition that requires a Tribute Summon of 3 monsters and when Summoned, neither player can activate cards or effects. Slifer unique effects are that its gains 1000 Atk/Def for each card in your hand; if your opponent Normal or Special Summons one or more monsters, all of those monsters loses 2000 Atk/Def and if its Atk becomes 0 by this effect, they are immediately destroyed; also, if it was Special Summoned instead of Tribute Summoned, it sends itself to the GY at the End Phase of that turn. A very iconic boss monster that, in my opinion, has of the most strongest floodgate effects if your opponent cant get rid of it.  Both Slifer and Obelisk recieved new support cards in order to favor their playstyle, as well as making them a bit easier to summon and what legacy support would exist without making them cards that represent their signature attacks in the anime?  Since this is the Slifer deck, we'll start with his signature card, <strong>Thunderforce Attack</strong>. Is a Quick-Play Spell that can only be activated while you control AN ORIGINAL <strong>Slifer the Sky Dragon</strong>; it allows you to destroy as many face-up monsters your opponent controls. After that, it gives you the choice of drawing cards equal to the number of destroyed monsters that were sent to the opponent's GY (this is to prevent the player to place your own monsters or tokens and then blow them up), but if you do, you can only declare 1 attack for the rest of the turn. It can act as a Quick-Play <strong>Raigeki</strong> while also being a +1/+2 in the most common scenarios, however it can be bricky and requires setup. Playing it at 3 can be risky, so I recommend playing 2.  Next is another Quick-Play Spell, <strong>Soul Crossing</strong>. During the Main Phase, immediately after the effect resolves, you can Tribute Summon a Divine-Beast monster by tributing any 3 monsters on the field, including your opponents (by the way, yes, you can use up to 3 of your opponents' monsters). If you used at least 1 monster that belongs to your opponent, you can only activate 1 card effect for the rest of the turn, but the effects of Divine-Beast monsters are excluded from this effect lock. Unless your opponent negates this card effect, this is card is a non-target, non-destruction removal of 1 to 3 of their monsters, while also giving you a free monster. This is a safe 3 of, and also allows to play 3 copies of Slifer since it can prevent it from being a brick in your hand.  The last new support card that I used from the deck is <strong>Ultimate Divine-Beast</strong>, a Continuous Trap. If your opponent declares an attack, you can discard 1 Spell/Trap to Special Summon a Divine-Beast monster from the GY in Defense Position and then it redirects the attack to itself. During the End Phase: if you control a Divine-Beast monster, you can destroy all face-up cards your opponent controls that activated their effect this turn. While it can be a bit costly to activate, it has good effects and yes, you can activate the second effect before Slifer goes back to the GY.  The deck also includes <strong>Tellus the Little Angel</strong> and <strong>Millenium Seeker</strong> as support cards, but this build will not use them. As a quick explanation, <strong>Tellus the Little Angel</strong> is a token generator that works from the GY, and <strong>Millenium Seeker</strong> can Special Summon itself for the hand but it has a very double-edged effect.  And now, the outside support: <ul>  	<li><strong>Level 10 Slimes</strong> (*sad train noises*): This Structure Deck features <strong>Reactor Slime</strong> and <strong>Metal Reflect Slime</strong>. <strong>Reactor Slime</strong>, during the Main Phase, can Special Summon 2 tokens, but locks you on only summoning Divine-Beast monsters for the rest of the turn; and during the Battle Phase, as a Quick Effect, can send itself to the GY to set a <strong>Metal Reflect Slime</strong> from your hand, Deck or GY and it can be activated that turn (which is a Continuous Trap that Special Summons itself as a Level 10 WATER Aqua monster with 0 Atk/3000 Def). In order to have the full engine, I added 3 copies of <strong>Guardian Slime</strong> and <strong>Egyptian God Slime</strong>. <strong>Guardian Slime</strong> is a Level 10 WATER Aqua monster with 0 Atk/Def that can Special Summon itself from the hand if you take battle or effect damage. During damage calculation, it can make its Def equal to an attacking monsters' Atk. If it is sent to the GY from the hand or field, it can search any Spell/Trap that enlists ""<strong>The Winged Dragon of Ra</strong>"" on its text. On the other hand, <strong>Egyptian God Slime</strong> is a Level 10 WATER Aqua Fusion monster with 3000 Atk/Def that can also be Special Summoned by Tributing 1 Level 10 Aqua monster with 0 Atk. It cannot be destroyed by battle, your opponent can only target this card for both attacks and effects and it can be treated as 3 tributes for a Tribute Summon. Both cards are very reliable and grants a lot of protection to the deck while paired with...</li>  	<li><strong>Mound of the Bound Creator</strong>: A Field Spell that makes Level 10 or higher monsters unable to be destroyed or targeted by card effects, if they destroy a monster by battle it burns the opponent for 1000 and if it is destroyed, you can add 1 DIVINE monster from your Deck to your hand. If <strong>Egyptian God Slime</strong> is on the field, it indirectly makes your entire field untargetable for card effects while making him a nearly undestructible monster that protects your monsters from being attacked. And since Slifer is also Level 10, not only it can be searched, but is also protected by the Field Spell. A <strong>Terraforming</strong> is added to the mix to either search it or search...</li>  	<li><strong>Lair of Darkness package</strong>: This Deck also features <strong>Ahrima, the Wicked Warden</strong>, <strong>Duke Shade, the Sinister Shadow</strong> &amp; <strong>Lair of Darkness</strong>; where its intended use is for using the <strong>Torment Tokens</strong> as Tribute fodder. By this logic, both <strong>Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</strong> &amp; <strong>Lilith, Lady of Lament</strong> to use their effects in combination with <strong>Lair of Darkness</strong>. In the Side Deck, I added some of the Trap Cards it could be useful for this deck's playstyle that can be searched with Lilith's effect.</li>  	<li><strong>Millenium Revelation</strong>: Since I wanted to give a use to <strong>Guardian Slime</strong>'s search effect, I added a copy of this card. Is a Continuous Spell that can send a Divine-Beast monster from the hand to the GY to add <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> from your Deck or GY to the hand. It also has another effect related to Ra's Summoning condition, but I mostly use it to search <strong>Monster Reborn</strong>.</li>  	<li>Extra Deck: Pretty much anything you like. In my case, I added Synchro and Link monsters that could help to draw more cards, and a Halqifibrax as an extender; since this deck actually runs a Tuner, that being Scapeghost.</li> </ul> And that's for the Slifer version. The Obelisk version will be uploaded later today or tomorrow. Also, I would like to say that from now on, I'll try to post new recipes for the series every 2 weeks, on Fridays. This will give me time to playtest the decks and see which pros and cons each one has.  Anyway, thanks for reading all this wall of text as always and I hope you like this kind of decks."

Not the strongest but still good.

The current meta ends on 2-4 negates and interruptions so with magical muskets all you need is a musket monster and cards on your opponent's side of the field to go off. Muskets strength is gaining an advantage from what your opponent gives you, so if they run a control deck you're going to be able to spam a bunch of Magical Musket monsters on the field, but if you're playing against a heavy combo deck you are going to be able to add all your Magical Musket hand traps to hand. My deck best matches up with heavy combo decks such as Xiangjian, Dinos, Heroes, Drytron, Cyber dragons, Infernobles and etc granted most of those decks run a good handful of hand traps so it'll ultimately come down to what you open with and how many handtraps your opponent opens up with turn 1. The approach I've given my deck is a going second because I main deck Dark Ruler No More, as well as Forbidden Droplets which is busted against the current meta and is amazing in Magical Muskets as Magical Musketeer Max, is your ace monster his effect says in short gain advantage by the number of cards you opponent controls on the field so you don't want to pop or remove your opponent's cards just negate the effects of their cards on their field.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Strengths: The strength of the deck is you can gain a fast advantage quickly depending on what your opponent is playing which can spiral into a huge advantage for you in the mid/late game. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Weaknesses: The biggest weaknesses the deck has are being able to see a musket monster in the starting turn and being able to successfully normal summon a musket monster to the field, which is why I run Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay and Pot of Prosperity to give the deck a little more draw power and consistency.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Side Deck: The list from my side was a major focus on the deck weakness explained above by mainly targetting kaiju's and anti-magic arrow as monsters on board and back row is the major problematic cards that Magical Musket monsters struggle with the on seeing you're normal summon.

With a twist?  All aboard the pain train. ,"This is a budget friendly version of the deck so no Infinite Imperms, Zeus, or Ice Dragon Prisons, Ash Blossoms, etc.  &nbsp;  Strategy is the same as most other earth machine decks except I feel like Machine Duplication is an excellent combo extender. Summoning 3 Harvesters or 2 Trenchers can leads to a lot of easy XYZ and Link plays to push through hand traps. Also, summoning trencher and harvester off of Urgent Schedule can lead into huge combo plays without even using a normal summon.  Reasoning is a really cool tech since the deck runs so many different monster levels and having them in GY can help too. Also, if you pitch overdrive, it can be used in GY as well.  Considered main decking x1 Cycle Reader since it's searchable but the deck is too tight on space.  Would love some feedback. Thanks."

Armed with plush familiars in their image and the mysterious powers of the pendulum, these musicians take to the stage.  Recently, through a fan of theirs, they met with several performers and spellcasters who wanted to see if their talents can summon forth dragonic beings of the stars, the frozen depths and the very Vortex itself. Coolia, the leader and teacher of the troupe agreed to the collaboration, albeit with concern for the safety of her students. The ritual and concert was eventually interrupted when a data thief crashed it, the ensuing chaos caused a mysterious hero to arrive, seemingly from a world on the precipice of collapse... ""  Alright, with Dawn of Majesty set to arrive soon. I find it prudent to update the profile to v1 status now.  Per the original profile, the aim is to have a semi-control deck that can consistently end on <span><a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a></span> and an enhanced <span><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></span>. As such there are two new tools that I think could help with that: <ol>  	<li>The first is <span><a data-name=""Pendulum Xyz"">Pendulum Xyz</a></span>. A card that allows me to use the scales as Overlay Units, material for Xyz monster, and also allows one to be treated as the level of the other for the summon. As I run the Supreme King Package, this means I have a way to get Gate Zero used as material without <span><a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a></span>, but the catch is that you will need new scales as a result. <a data-name=""&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008000;&quot;&gt;Duelist Alliance&lt;/span&gt;""><span>Duelist Alliance</span></a> can also search this card and as such I opted to run a playset of that, and one of <span><a data-name=""Pendulum Halt"">Pendulum Halt</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Pendulum Call"">Pendulum Call</a></span>.</li>  	<li>The second is the upcoming archetypal Link monster: <span><a data-name=""GranSolfachord Musecia"">GranSolfachord Musecia</a></span>. A link-2 monster that lets you add a Pendulum monster form the ED to the hand, replace that monster in the ED with another one (provided one is even and the other odd) and then search a Solfachord with a level that matches the scale of a Pendulum summoned monster.</li> </ol> The general strategy is still to try to get <span><a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a></span> out, but the likely difference is that I would likely use Musecia as the first Link monster and then summon Masquerena later. What plays will ripple form those changes, and will these maestras used these tools for a crescendo?"

""Vendread"" is quite an interesting archetype since it features a Ritual monster theme with Zombie-Type monster, which is still a combination that no other archetype went for. If you heard of ""Vendread"" before, you might be aware of the fact that the hype around them died rather quickly when the powerful support was missing, leaving them in the limbo of semi-playability. Nonetheless, I think they are functional enough to build a deck around and they do have some aces to work with that might surprise the unaware opponent.</p> <p>Starting with the monster line-up, I chose to include every ""Vendread"" Main Deck Effect monster except for ""<a data-name=""Vendread Core"">Vendread Core</a>"", since I did not need more Link material. That means one copy of ""<a data-name=""Vendread Revenants"">Vendread Revenants</a>"", which feature the worst revive effect but the absolutely insane Quick Effect banish when used as tribute for a ""Vendread"" Ritual monster. One copy of ""<a data-name=""Vendread Houndhorde"">Vendread Houndhorde</a>"" for the okayish revival and solid ""<a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>"" imitation effect for Rituals, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Vendread Striges"">Vendread Striges</a>"", which features a very good revival effect but a subpar Ritual monster one, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Vendread Anima"">Vendread Anima</a>"" for added plays with banished monsters. ""Vendread"" does need some help from generic Zombies though, so I also included three ""<a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a>"" as ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" helpers, three ""<a data-name=""Uni-Zombie"">Uni-Zombie</a>"" for the same reason but they also work as Tuners for the deck, two ""<a data-name=""Shinobi Necro"">Shinobi Necro</a>"" as additional resources when banished for the Ritual Summon of a ""Vendread"" monster, one ""<a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a>"" as yet another Tuner and more material, one ""<a data-name=""Shiranui Solitaire"">Shiranui Solitaire</a>"" for potential ""<a data-name=""Uni-Zombie"">Uni-Zombie</a>"" setup, and three ""<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"" for the obvious handtrap effect, but also as a Zombie Tuner option for ""Vendread"".</p> <p>The Ritual part of the deck is where it's at though, so I included both three ""<a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a>"" and three ""<a data-name=""Pre-Preparation of Rites"">Pre-Preparation of Rites</a>"" as consistency tools, alongside three copies of ""<a data-name=""Revendread Origin"">Revendread Origin</a>"" and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Revendread Evolution"">Revendread Evolution</a>"". To make the most out of ""<a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a>"", you need to Ritual Summon first, then activate the card to make it a +1 in card economy terms. ""<a data-name=""Pre-Preparation of Rites"">Pre-Preparation of Rites</a>"" is always a +1, but comes with the caveat of only being able to search for the combination of ""<a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Revendread Origin"">Revendread Origin</a>"". Talking about ""<a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a>"", he is in the deck at three copies but is also a pretty subpar Ritual monster on his own. However, by using the ""Vendread"" Main Deck Effect monsters as material you can give him some additional power and he is the easiest Ritual monster in the archetype to summon. ""<a data-name=""Vendread Battlelord"">Vendread Battlelord</a>"" is the Level 7 Ritual and an absolute powerhouse in my opinion that can catch the opponent off-guard if they are not aware of what he does. You can easily summon him as the first action during your turn by ditching one copy of him from the deck via ""<a data-name=""Revendread Evolution"">Revendread Evolution</a>"" and then activate his effect to disallow the opponent from using monster effects, which in turn locks the opponent out of using handtraps and therefore gives you the opportunity to build your board in piece. I also included one copy of ""<a data-name=""Revendread Executor"">Revendread Executor</a>"" for his protection effect, but he rarely saw play when I tested the deck. The rest of the Main Deck is made up by one ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" as graveyard setup and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Vendread Charge"">Vendread Charge</a>"" to get your ""Vendread"" non-Ritual monsters on the field easier and to save resources from removal by dodging the effect in form of gaining another monster.</p> <p>The Extra Deck has a lot of colorful options, since ""Vendread"" on its own really does not need that much of the space in there. Both ""<a data-name=""Shiranui Sunsaga"">Shiranui Sunsaga</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Shiranui Shogunsaga"">Shiranui Shogunsaga</a>"" work as beatsticks, ""<a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>"" can equip Link monsters for negates and is fairly easy to make, ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</a>"" is a situational option with battle focus, ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" serves as the usual field nuke, ""<a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a>"" can work as a negation tool as well as searching for Ritual cards, ""<a data-name=""Formula Synchron"">Formula Synchron</a>"" can be summoned via ""<a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>"" which itself provides more resources, ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" is the usual backrow removal option, ""<a data-name=""Vampire Sucker"">Vampire Sucker</a>"" can have merit in some situations, ""<a data-name=""Avendread Savior"">Avendread Savior</a>"" is the only archetypal Extra Deck monster and can recycle resources, provides graveyard setup and can even potentially run some opposing monster over, ""<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>"" is the counter option against another graveyard-heavy deck and ""<a data-name=""Evilswarm Exciton Knight"">Evilswarm Exciton Knight</a>"" is more of an emergency tool if you cannot manage to make something more useful and want to potentially stop the opponent from going crazy with summons.</p> <p>""Vendread"" has some interesting interactions and is quite a deckbuilding challenge; however, they do have a small number of dedicated players that experiment with various options, like using ""<a data-name=""Spirit Sculptor"">Spirit Sculptor</a>"" in order to search for other helpful engine parts. The deck provides a number of effects that can surprise the opponent that did not read the cards, since ""Vendread"" Main Deck monsters tend to revive themselves, the ""Vendread"" Ritual monster provide searches upon their demise, ""<a data-name=""Vendread Battlelord"">Vendread Battlelord</a>"" disabling entire card types and the Ritual Spell ""<a data-name=""Revendread Origin"">Revendread Origin</a>"" serving as protection for some of the archetypal monsters while in the graveyard. Granted, you will find better (Zombie) decks if you look for them, but ""Vendread"" is not that bad and certainly unique enough to give them a spin; and if you are really interested, you might want to check out my archetype analysis on them, which you can find here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/08/07/archetype-analysis-vendread/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/08/07/archetype-analysis-vendread/</a></p>"

The strategy is also known as ""Cure Burn"".","<p>This is my take at building a ""Fire Princess Burn"" deck, which is also referred to as ""Cure Burn"". The main card to use in this strategy is obviously ""<a data-name=""Fire Princess"">Fire Princess</a>"", a Level 4 monster that inflicts 500 damage to the opponent whenever you gain life points. This means that you normally need sixteen ticks of healing with ""<a data-name=""Fire Princess"">Fire Princess</a>"" around to inflict lethal damage to the opponent, which is certainly a more casual-oriented strategy to use, but one that can be fun to work with. But due to the age of the strategy, there are various older cards that do not necessarily see play anymore in other decks.</p> <p>The monsters are quite simple: We use three copies of ""<a data-name=""UFO Turtle"">UFO Turtle</a>"" as the searcher to fetch us one of the three copies of ""<a data-name=""Fire Princess"">Fire Princess</a>"". Granted, ""<a data-name=""UFO Turtle"">UFO Turtle</a>"" is a battle searcher and the entire idea of battle searchers rotated out of the interest of players a few years ago, but it certainly helps via blocking attacks, searching the necessary monster and keeps the deck very budget-friendly even for a casual deck. The last triplet comes in form of three copies of ""<a data-name=""Golden Ladybug"">Golden Ladybug</a>"", which passively heals during the Standby Phase and therefore gives us a slow but recurring trigger for the effect of ""<a data-name=""Fire Princess"">Fire Princess</a>"".</p> <p>There are quite a few more Spell cards to talk about, since three copies of ""<a data-name=""Spell Absorption"">Spell Absorption</a>"" can make quite the difference in the game by spamming this card type. Three ""<a data-name=""Ancient Leaf"">Ancient Leaf</a>"" can trigger ""<a data-name=""Spell Absorption"">Spell Absorption</a>"" while also making use of the added life points for more draw power, three ""<a data-name=""Goblin Thief"">Goblin Thief</a>"" are a dream card to use with ""<a data-name=""Fire Princess"">Fire Princess</a>"" due to supporting both the burn strategy via healing as well as inflicting damage on its own, three ""<a data-name=""Ledger of Legerdemain"">Ledger of Legerdemain</a>"" can fetch more of the necessary cards via draw and the deck is able to stall enough to make that work, three ""<a data-name=""Swords of Revealing Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a>"" are further stall options and also give a ""<a data-name=""Spell Absorption"">Spell Absorption</a>"" trigger, two ""<a data-name=""Child's Play"">Child's Play</a>"" help protecting ""<a data-name=""Fire Princess"">Fire Princess</a>"" while providing more healing for the ""Cure Burn"" strategy, three ""<a data-name=""Cauldron of the Old Man"">Cauldron of the Old Man</a>"" provide constant healing/burning, three copies of ""<a data-name=""Dark Sanctuary"">Dark Sanctuary</a>"" provide further protection while also inflicting damage, one ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" serves as a fourth draw for ""<a data-name=""Dark Sanctuary"">Dark Sanctuary</a>"", one ""<a data-name=""Poison of the Old Man"">Poison of the Old Man</a>"" serves as more healing/burning, one ""<a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a>"" against pesky backrow and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Magical Mallet"">Magical Mallet</a>"" to shuffle unnecessary cards away while also providing another ""<a data-name=""Spell Absorption"">Spell Absorption</a>"" tick.</p> <p>The Trap cards are fairly straightforward: Two copies of ""<a data-name=""Bye Bye Damage"">Bye Bye Damage</a>"" can kill the careless opponent when running one of your monsters over, while two copies of ""<a data-name=""Wall of Disruption"">Wall of Disruption</a>"" can lower them far enough to be a non-threat to your health points and for them to take additional damage due to running into a higher ATK monster. The Extra Deck is only really filled with options that could be potentially made, with cards like ""<a data-name=""Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" to work against opposing monsters that block your strategy, while ""<a data-name=""Gagaga Cowboy"">Gagaga Cowboy</a>"" can be used to inflict another 800 damage and therefore potentially finishing a few games.</p> <p>""Cure Burn"" is nowhere near powerful enough to keep up with many decks in the modern meta. However, it is a fun little strategy for casual if you are searching for a deck that does not use an archetype to run.

The core of the deck is still the same, summon Archfiend Empress and float with her effect and the Dark Spirit monsters, only this time we are combining them with an Unchained engine. Unchained cards, such as Unchained Twins - Aruha and Abominable Chamber of the Unchained, are in this deck to boost the early game power by setting up Unchained Soul of Rage interruptions, whilst also providing some nice destruction synergy.  <strong>Deck playstyle:</strong> Beatdown  <strong>Core cards:</strong> Archfiend Emperor, Archfiend Empress, Dark Spirit of Malice, Dark Spirit of Banishment  <strong>Gameplay:</strong>  You want to dump your fiends into the grave as soon as possible so that you can revive them from there later. You mainly summon during the opponent's turn to pressure them into outing your monsters, which depletes their resources whilst also providing you with a fairly powerful wall. Archfiend Empress in combination with a Dark Spirit is a decent loop of protection!  In addition to that, you have access to the fairly unique method of removal via the Unchained cards. Unchained Soul of Rage and Unchained Soul of Disaster provide removal through using your opponent's monsters as material for link summons! Also, monsters such as Knightmare Unicorn provide more interruptions  Masterking Archfiend is a great card that can give you access to additional Archfiend Heiress searches, and has a maintenance cost! This means you can choose to remove it, which is useful if your opponent is using that pesky Mystic Mine..."

No, I haven't justified ordering Adjusted Gold/Malicious Bane yet (I pray that KoMoney gives them a reprint) I've been huntin' fer Increase and Faris, hopefully without having to pay full price. I eagerly await for Destroy Pheonix Enforcer, as I have sided Fusion Destiny in anticipation.  I'm thinking of swapping Pheonix Enforcer + his materials for Thunder Giant, so Grandmerge has 2400 as opposed to 1800 with Burstinatrix/Avian.

Does not rely on normal summon. Extremely consistent. Builds a board with 2-4 interruptions. Multiple removals during combo, including non-targeted banish, double shuffle, destructions and other. Very simple in terms of rulings understanding. Fits both TCG and OCG banlist for online play. Generates hand advantage.  Cons:  Many meta and anti-meta decks with floodgates hit it really hard. Because:  It is tightly bound to WYRM archetype, and has to be played around it. It requires the GY. It locks you to Synchro summoning. All your tuners are water normal monsters."

Your main starter is either going to be Mo Ye, as he can one-card synchro into Chi Xiao which gives you a search AND Mo Ye draws you a card on synchro summon, or Eccclesia, who can tribute herself to special summon Mo Ye, and start your combos from there.  The D/D engine is in here to go into Halqifibrax plays and to dig deeper into the synchro pool, however, it's not as consistent as just the Swordsoul engine is. When it goes off, you can end on some devastating boards, but if you prefer to use a pure Swordsoul engine, the side deck is catered to taking out the D/D engine, and just using generic handtraps and removal.  &nbsp;  There Can Be Only One is a great tech option for games two and three, as your ideal end board will have no more than one type of monster on the field, and can completely shut down monotype archetypes you may be facing."

The deck is build out of two engines:  <strong>1. Sacred Beast part:</strong> <ul>  	<li>This engine is there to put big boys with protection on the board. I did choose Hamon since it is the best standalone monster out of the trio. Also, its support card <a data-name=""Cerulean Skyfire"">Cerulean Skyfire</a> is searchable with Curious and adds a nice interruption to your end board.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Opening of the Spirit Gates"">Opening of the Spirit Gates</a><a> is the strongest card of the engine. It searches every other peace you are are missing (except for Skyfire). It recycles </a><a>Cerulean Skyfire AND even Cursed Eldland if needed. And it also helps to make combo plays. </a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Fallen Paradise"">Fallen Paradise</a><a> delivers the needed protection for your Hamon. It also generates a +2 every turn, if not dealt with by your opponent.</a></li> </ul> <strong>2. Eldlich part:</strong> <ul>  	<li>This part is here for the grind game.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Eldlich the golden Lord"">Eldlich the golden Lord</a><a> is central for the engine to work and delivers in addition a level 10 body with whom you can go into either </a><a>Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max or </a><a>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos.</a></li>  	<li>Most of the trap cards can be used as cost for other parts of the deck and can float out of the graveyard.</li> </ul> <strong>Notable Generics:</strong> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Magician's Souls"">Magician's Souls</a><a> is a broken card which can draw you two cards and by the way get your Eldlich engine rolin'.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""E&lt;a&gt;xodius the Ultimate forbidden Lord&lt;/a&gt;"">E</a><a>xodius the Ultimate forbidden Lord</a><a> is the target for Souls, can be a level 10 body for Link or Xyz plays and helps to recycle your monster cards.  </a></li> </ul> The deck has problems going second and is overall not perfect, but I like the synergy between the two archetypes.  I would love to own this deck IRL, but a lot of cards are very expensive, so it won't happen in a foreseeable future...

Description:  Magistus has been a deck that has been out since Genesis Impact. Taken to be the worst deck of the set (and rightfully so), it has yet to make a impact on the meta. With the introduction of Zoroa, The Magistus Daimon to the deck in BODE, the archetype has finally gained a good consistent 1st turn board. The goal of course, is to end on Zoroa with multiple equips attached to lock the opponent out of the game. Then on the next turn, set up negates or end the game with Accesscode.  Let's go through the list together:  Magistus Engine: x20  3 Verre: This card is our S/T searcher for the deck. (Also has an effect to bring down material from the banish zone). Verre allows us to grab our extenders and is one of the best cards to grab off Artemis for the next turn play (that being if you already have a way to end on Zoroa). Also has a banish effect to equip more Magistus cards from GY (important for more ED locking and/or extension plays).  3 Zoroa: The tuner of the deck. Drawing him allows you to go into Zoroa under 5 summons or Borreload Savage early on. Typically your revive target off of Vitra but a necessary card of the combo.  Can also serve as a proper starter by attaching Artemis and grabbing a needed card.  3x Endymion: The more barebones starter of the deck. Does everything that you would want from it. Typically, you'll be attaching Artemis to start off your plays and/or Ninanruru/Rilliona to play thru the opp board. It's also a decent hand fixer.  3x Crowley: Our extender of the deck. Does nothing by itself but is important to have as it serves as one of the main ways you'll get to Zoroa.  Also has the same effect as Verre.  3x Vitra: Our monster reborn for the archetype. A card that you'll be grabbing off of Rilliona on the follow-up turn or an extender to end on your intended board. Also has a Magistus equipped protection effect that is important for keeping the lock in place.  3x Trismagistus: One of the best cards in the archetype. Serves as a soul charge from the hand and another way to extend your plays. Also has a nice battle protection effect for magistus cards equipped with an extra deck card. Really good card.  2x Theurgy: One of the most ""cuttable"" parts of the list. It serves as another way to attach Artemis or play thru opponents boards. Especially important in a meta with effect veiler/imper as it allows our cards to still get to full combo thru interruption. Also serves as a type of interruption on the opp turn by attaching an extra ED monster to your magistus monsters.  Starters:  Rilliona, Zoroa, Endymion  Extenders:  Crowley, Trismagistus, Vitra, Theurgy  More ""Generic Cards"": x8  2x Spell Power Mastery. A useful card that allows us to search for Endymion. This card allows us to get to our starter even if we don't draw it. Ran only at 2 because we really don't want to draw more then one.  1x Called by the grave: Pretty self-explanatory. Allows you to negate a handtrap or serves as a interruption on opp turn.  2x Cosmic Cyclone: Flex spot of the deck but it's always nice to have more S/T removal.  3x Triple Tactics Talent: This card can easily be switched for Desires. Due to the nature of this deck being able to combo with basically any two card hand, TTT serves as more of another extender drawer or board breaker for going second.  Hand-Traps: (What - we're playing YGO in 2021 aren't we?) x12  3x Ash Blossom  3x Effect Veiler  3x Droll &amp; Lock Bird  3x Infinite Impermanence  Standard selection of HTs. It's important to recognize that Effect Veiler and Droll are both spellcasters. Meaning that they can link into Artemis to start plays or be discard fodder for Crowley.  Extra deck:  2x Artemis - the best equip card that the deck has. It allows the search for any of our Magistus monsters that we need in hand.  1x Ninanruru - Our S/T removal other then cosmic. Can be useful to force activation of cards. Also has a nifty effect to allow two attacks on monsters.  1x Vahram - The main target to equip to Zoroa. Gives Zoroa a construct-like send and S/T protection. Also has a boardwipe effect that burns all face-up cards. Just like the fiery bird it is.  1x Aiwass - Our target for Fusion matchups. Can also be made with Invocation in matchups that don't use the ED. Don't forget the atk/def gain effect to hit over monsters.  2x Rilliona - Typically the card that allows the search for baby Zoroa. Allows us to consistently go into Zoroa. Remember that this card locks us into Magistus ED monsters. Also has a neat effect to negate a monster on your turn.  1x Zoroa, the Magistus of Daimon - Our main t1 board usually revolves around him. Important to realize that Zoroa says the cards don't have to be attached to him to do the floodgate effect and that Zoroa works no matter where the ED monster attempts to activate. Also has a neat reincarnation effect that becomes useful for plays later on and to reestablish the lock. Can be ran at 1 or 2 - up to your preference.  1x Borrel Savage - Omni negate that can be made t1 to play around Nibiru if you have full combo or be made in matchups that don't use the ED. Also a neat target on later turns for more negation.  1x Bahmaut Shark/1x Toadally Awesome - fans of this deck already knows about these cards. You typically make this with Endmyion and Crowley (by changing Crowley to water). Another play to play around Nibiru or to have another negation on the board.  1x Halq/Selene/Accesscode - Standard Accesscode link climb combo. Make Halq with Zoroa and another monster then SS Veiler. Then link into Selene and revive another spellcaster. Then go into Accesscode. Typically the play that you will do to end the game.  1x Dragite - Honestly, this is the flex spot of the deck. Choose whatever you would like to run in this spot. Running Dragite just for another S/T negation when I can't get a link in GY for Savage. Pick whatever  you would like for this spot.  Side Deck:  Meta dependent but to explain choices:  1x Magistus Invocation - Now you might be asking, why are you running this card in the side? Well, to be honest typically you won't be ending on Aiwass with Invocation in the deck as you would have to search invocation off Rilliona. The problem with that is that if you have the search for Rilliona, typically you'll be looking to grab ways to break boards or extend. The card itself serves as a brick in the starting hand and does nothing for us in the way for extension. In testing this deck, I rarely grabbed this card and loathed the times it was in my starting hand.  3x Secret Village - We're a spellcaster deck so might as well run one of our good support cards. This card + Zoroa can often lead to unbreakable boards. Good for locking your opp out of Spell cards.  1x Cosmic - to finish off the 2 in the MD  1x Feather Duster - Good S/T wipe card.  Of course, change what you would like in the SD. All up to the players preference.  Finale: As explained earlier, most 2 cards in the deck lead to ending on Zoroa. That means that you will be able to consistently end on the ED lock. This list intends to end on that board thru multiple disruption.  Basic Combo with Rilliona and any other Magistus Spellcaster:  NS Rilliona -&gt; grab Trismagistus -&gt; Activate Tris -&gt; SS Spellcaster -&gt; XYZ into Rilliona -&gt; Activate Rilliona (Detach Rilliona Spellcaster) SS Zoroa -&gt; Zoroa Effect Attach anything (Typically something you don't want to equip with Zoroa T1 like Ninanruru (or if you don't want to lock out Links something you do want to attach) -&gt; Zoroa effect to revive -&gt; Syncro into Daimon -&gt; Effect Daimon to attach -&gt; Rilliona GY effect to attach to Magistus monster  (Typically you'll attach the Link to the Rilliona XYZ. Reasoning being that Tris will give Rilliona one BP protection now and you'll force your opp to deal with both Zoroa and Rilliona or else you'll get value on the following turn off both Artemis and XYZ).  Of course, this is one of the many combos that lead to full combo. This deck doesn't really have one exact play to establish the lock (thou it'll typically involve the XYZ).  Strengths:  Consistent - most two card hands get to combo (more so if you have a starter)  Can play thru multiple disruption.  Can outright win some games.  Weaknesses:  Nibiru (If you don't get to a negate before Nibiru (which some hands can - make sure to think out your plays!))  Board Breaker cards like DRNM.  Decks that focus on Main Deck monsters.  Anyways, that wraps up this post. Feel free to comment suggestions! This deck has many different variations, so any tips is appreciated! Thank you for reading my post and have a nice day.  (There's also a discord server for Magistus on which I'm pretty active! Feel free to join!)  &nbsp;"

""Aliens"" have been around for quite some time but also received support on a semi-regular basis, which the newest members of the archetype making an appearance in <em>Dawn of Majesty</em>. Straightaway, ""Aliens"" are nowhere near competitive but still manage to be an interesting and versatile archetype if you take the time to get to know their effects.</p> <p>For more summoning power right from the start, I decided to run three copies of the ""Alien"" Normal monster ""<a data-name=""Alien Shocktrooper"">Alien Shocktrooper</a>"", which not only comes with sizeable stats but is also very helpful with the three copies of ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"" to setup for Rank 4 and Link-2 options. Three copies of ""<a data-name=""Alien Ammonite"">Alien Ammonite</a>"" are also very helpful due to being Level 1 Tuner monsters that can revive Level 4 or lower ""Alien"" monsters from the graveyard when Normal Summoned, therefore allowing for the same Link-2 summon as well as giving you the option to summon your archetypal Level 5 Synchro monster. Two ""<a data-name=""Alien Dog"">Alien Dog</a>"" give the deck yet more swarming and provide the special resource of the ""Alien"" archetype: A-counters. Said counters can also be distributed by two copies of ""<a data-name=""Alien Stealthbuster"">Alien Stealthbuster</a>"" as well as two ""<a data-name=""Alien Overlord"">Alien Overlord</a>"", the first one being often used as discard fodder or being sent to the graveyard directly from the deck, while the other one serves as a solid beater that is Special Summoned using A-counters and can also distribute them on the field. One ""<a data-name=""Alien Telepath"">Alien Telepath</a>"" serves as archetypal backrow removal in the Main Deck.</p> <p>I also included a small ""Reptilianne"" engine (shoutouts to Loukas Peterson for the original idea), which allows for more searches, swarming, removal and stat reduction. Three ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Lamia"">Reptilianne Lamia</a>"" are fantastic monsters to work with due to summoning themselves for some life points while also lowering an opposing monster to 0 ATK, and play well into the Extra Deck in form of ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Echidna"">Reptilianne Echidna</a>"", which searches for the number of 0 ATK monsters. One ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Vaskii"">Reptilianne Vaskii</a>"" can be used as a Reptile-type ""Kaiju"" option that comes with 2600 ATK and a destruction effect. The only other Reptile in the deck is ""<a data-name=""Danger!? Tsuchinoko?"">Danger!? Tsuchinoko?</a>"" due to being extremely helpful when either effect triggers.</p> <p>The backrow has plenty of setup to work with: Two copies of ""<a data-name=""Mausoleum of White"">Mausoleum of White</a>"" might seem out of place, but give ""<a data-name=""Alien Ammonite"">Alien Ammonite</a>"" another option to enter the field via Normal Summon, triggering its effect. The copy of ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" searches the Field Spell for more consistency, while one copy of ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a>"" can recycle monsters from the graveyard for further plays. Three copies of ""<a data-name=""&quot;A&quot; Cell Recombination Device"">""A"" Cell Recombination Device</a>"" serve as setup and search, while the three ""<a data-name=""Code &quot;A&quot; Ancient Ruins"">Code ""A"" Ancient Ruins</a>"" give the deck yet more Special Summoning from the graveyard. The one ""<a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>"" serves as protection against handtraps and the like while three copies of ""<a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>"" can give you a shot at disarming the opposing board when going second. The Traps are just one copy of ""<a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a>"" and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a>"" to hinder the opponent, while two copies of ""<a data-name=""Mass Hypnosis"">Mass Hypnosis</a>"" are certainly more questionable/situational, but absolutely hilarious if you get them off.</p> <p>The Extra Deck features two copies of ""<a data-name=""Cosmic Fortress Gol'gar"">Cosmic Fortress Gol'gar</a>"", the Level 5 ""Alien"" Synchro monster with is overall easy to summon, big stat-wise and helpful in terms of effects for multiple reasons. One ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Hydra"">Reptilianne Hydra</a>"" is included as a situational choice, but also fairly easy to summon due to ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Lamia"">Reptilianne Lamia</a>"" and any Level 4 ""Alien"" building into the monster. One copy of ""<a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a>"" serves as a searcher for scenarios in which Link Summoning is not available, one ""<a data-name=""Daigusto Emeral"">Daigusto Emeral</a>"" can draw cards as well as revive ""<a data-name=""Alien Shocktrooper"">Alien Shocktrooper</a>"", and one ""<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>"" is included as the usual graveyard counter. On the Link front, we have two copies of ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Echidna"">Reptilianne Echidna</a>"" for the aforementioned reason, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame"">Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame</a>"" as a powerful A-counter spreader and basically a Reptile ""<a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a>"" on legs, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll"">Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll</a>"" for all the amazing effects it provides, one copy each of ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>"" for removal and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>"" if you want to throw the strategy out the window and just kick with a Link-4 beater.</p> <p>When I first started working with the ""Alien"" archetype, I was kind of annoyed by the fact that a lot of their cards do not make clear what the overall gameplan is supposed to be. However, now that I have taken the time to study them a little bit more, I have to say that they are a fun archetype that is quite unique amongst the various archetypes in the game. There are also various other versions and cards that one can use to build an ""Alien"" deck, for example by using the ""Ogdoadics"" as the backbone of the deck. Regardless of what the final build looks like, I can only recommend them to anyone searching for a deckbuilding challenge; and if you like to know more about them, feel free to visit my blog and read the ""Archetype Analysis: Alien"" there using this link: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/07/31/archetype-analysis-alien/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/07/31/archetype-analysis-alien/</a></p>"

They're nice and inexpensive. Secretary is an easy way to make a big play. I mostly use it to trigger Zeroboros, but it's also handy for making a Mirage or just general use as an extender. I only run 2 because it's a ""once per turn"" effect. Formud can bring out Splash Mage and make Zeroboros on its own, then you can trigger the effect by special summoning something. Even by itself, it's a decent 1 card combo. I only run 2 because I only have 3 targets for it.</span>  <span>Hopefully</span> Accesscode Talker <span>gets reprinted soon; it's currently way too expensive for a budget deck. I'd take out</span> Borrelsword Dragon <span>for it. I'd also consider removing Veiler</span> <span>for Impermanence. If you wanna play a more traditional build you can take out some of the combo cards for hand traps, but some of the best ones are kinda expensive. Ghost Ogre is an option. </span>  <span>I'm not using</span> Pot of Desires <span>because while it may be a great card, it can screw up my combos by doing stuff like banishing Gazelle.</span>  <span> </span><span>So yeah, it's a decent build priced at less than $130 on TCGPlayer.</span>  <span>I'd love to hear some budget-friendly picks for the side deck.</span>"

Saturday mornings at 8,"<span>Yu-Gi-Oh Toon monsters. Great monster effects, hilarious artwork, and the animation style that should be the standard for any cartoon. Nowadays most cartoons look like garbage, but this isn't an animation review, it's a deck review.</span>  <span>Anyone familiar with Maximillion Pegasus' playstyle in any video game should already have an idea of how this goes, only this time, it's much better. Toons have always been a unique set of monsters, transforming from a gimmicky effect type into their own archetype, and when utilized properly, they can be extremely broken. This deck focuses on summoning Toon monsters, keeping them alive at all costs, and using their special ability of attacking your opponent directly for a win in as little as 2 turns.</span>  <span>Before we begin, there are 3 important factors that ALL Toon monsters share with one another. #1). They cannot attack the turn they are summoned. #2). If <span>Toon World</span> is active and your opponent doesn't have any Toon monsters of their own, they can attack directly. #3). When <span>Toon World</span> is destroyed, all Toon monsters are destroyed. Oddly enough, factor #3 only applies to 3 of the monsters in this deck. (<span>Toon Goblin Attack Force</span>, <span>Toon Gemini Elf</span>, &amp; <span>Toon Mermaid<span>)</span></span><span>,</span> while the other 6, (the better ones) are unaffected.</span>  <span>Speaking of <span>Toon World</span>, <span>Toon Kingdom</span> is the backbone of the entire deck, and is what gives the toons their power. A retrained version of <span>Toon World</span>, which is now trash, <span>Toon Kingdom</span> is a Field Spell Card that activates their attacking ability, and also keeps them alive. <span>Toon Kingdom's</span> name becomes <span>Toon World</span> while it is on the field, and is activated by banishing the top 3 cards from your deck. While this card is active, your Toon monsters cannot be targeted by card effects, and if one (or more) would be destroyed by battle or effect, you can simply banish another card from the top of your deck for each one, and keep them alive. When you have <span>Toon World</span> active early on, and 1 or more powerful monsters on the field, banishing cards isn't a big problem; by that time you're probably only a turn or 2 away from getting the dub.</span>  <span>Literally every card in the main deck aside from <span>Necroface</span> and <span>Jar Of Avarice</span> are Toon cards. (<span>Comic Hand</span> works with Toon cards, but is not considered a Toon card). The Spells/Traps offer additional protection and search power, while the monsters all have effects similar to their non-toon counterparts. Aside from the 3 factors mentioned earlier, here </span><span>is what each monster can do:</span> <p><em><strong><span>~Just a reminder, Toon Kingdom's name is treated as Toon World while active on the field~</span></strong></em></p> <span><em><span><span>Red-Eyes Toon Dragon</span></span></em>: Once per turn, Special</span><span> Summon any other Toon monster from the hand, (other than copies of itself) ignoring their summoning conditions. An easy way to bypass Tribute Summoning.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Ancient Gear Golem</span></span></em>: One of the strongest monsters in the deck. Rocking 3000 ATK, when this monster attacks, your opponent cannot activate Spell/Traps until the end of the damage step, and it also inflicts piercing battle damage to defense position monsters; useful when <span>Toon World</span> is not present.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Barrel Dragon</span></span></em>: My personal favorite of the toons. You can target any card on the field then toss a coin 3 times. If at least 2 of the results are heads, the card is destroyed. This can be done once per turn. <span><em><span>Toon Black Luster Soldier</span></em></span>: This guy is busted in just about every aspect. He has 3000 ATK, can banish 1 card every turn if it wants, and is the only Toon monster that can attack the turn he's Summoned. He can only be Special Summoned however, in the same manner that all <span>Ritual Monsters</span> are summoned, by sending monsters from the Hand or Field to the Graveyard whose combined <span>Levels</span> equal 8 or more. <span>Level 4</span>'s work nicely, or if you have your <span>Jar Of Avarice</span> ready, <span>Toon Ancient Gear Golem</span>.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Cyber Dragon</span></span></em>: Can be Special Summoned if you control no monsters and your opponent controls at least 1. This monster can be used to Special Summon <span>Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</span> if your opponent decides they want to Summon monsters to the Extra Zone.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Dark Magician</span></span></em>: By discarding 1 Toon card, you can either Special Summon any other Toon monster from the deck, (other than copies of itself), ignoring their summoning conditions, or add 1 Toon Spell/Trap from the deck to the hand. Easily the most useful monster other than <span>Red-Eyes Toon Dragon</span>.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Gemini Elf</span></span></em>: Discards 1 card from the opponents hand upon inflicting battle damage.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Goblin Attack Force</span></span></em>: Switches to DEF position after attacking, and cannot be switched back for an entire turn. Not a useful effect, but a <span>Level 4</span> monster with 2300 ATK is always a nice thing. Since it has 0 DEF, this guy usually acts as a wall and doesn't attack until a Tribute Summon using it can be performed during Main Phase 2.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Harpie Lady</span></span></em>: Can be Special Summoned while <span>Toon World</span> is active, and if you control at least 1 other Toon monster when you do this, you can destroy 1 of your opponents Spells/Traps.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Mermaid</span></span></em>: Can only be Special Summoned while <span>Toon World</span> is active. This monster doesn't do anything particularly useful, but is a free 1400 ATK Special Summon and be used as Tribute fodder if you already have another monster ready to go.</span>  <span><span>Toon Kingdom</span> has already been covered. Here are the deck's other Toon Spells/Traps:</span>  <span><em><span><span>Comic Hand</span></span></em>: If you control <span>Toon World</span>, use this to steal an opponents monster and turn it into a toon, allowing it to attack directly under the same circumstances as all the other Toon monsters.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Bookmark</span></span></em>: Searches for <span>Toon World</span> or any card that lists <span>Toon World</span> in it's text, aside from itself, and can be banished from the GY to prevent <span>Toon Kingdom</span> from being destroyed once. Extremely useful.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Page-Flip</span></span></em>: Choose 3 toon monsters with different names from your deck, and your opponent picks one for you to Special Summon, ignoring it's summoning conditions, while shuffling the others into the deck. The best options to go with are obviously <span>Red-Eyes Toon Dragon</span>, <span>Toon Dark Magician</span>, <span>Toon Black Luster Soldier</span>, or <span>Toon Ancient Gear Golem</span>.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Table Of Contents</span></span></em>: Add any single Toon card from the deck to your hand.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Briefcase</span></span></em>: While you control a Toon monster, when your opponent summons a monster, shuffle it into the deck. Save this for top-tier threats you cannot overcome, or for disrupting your opponents Extra Deck Summons.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Mask</span></span></em>: While <span>Toon World</span> is active, you can Special Summon a Toon monster from the hand or deck whose <span>Level</span> is less than or equal to the <span>Level</span> of one monster they control, ignoring it's summoning conditions.</span>  <span>The last 3 cards left to mention are <span>Necroface</span>, <span>Jar Of Avarice</span>, and <span>Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</span>. These 3 are not Toon cards but serve a unique role in the deck. <span>Necroface</span> exists in this deck as a way to return any of the cards banished by <span>Toon Kingdom</span> (or your opponent's dirty tactics) back into the deck, and it gets a nice ATK bonus for each card returned. <span>Jar Of Avarice</span> is a nice way to recycle cards from your Graveyard, in case all 3 <span>Toon Kingdom's</span> somehow get destroyed, as well as your other Top-Tier Toon cards. Lastly, <span>Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</span> is a <span>Fusion Monster</span> that doesn't require <span>Polymerization</span>, but rather your <span>Toon Cyber Dragon</span> and any monster in the Extra Monster Zone. You can use one of your opponent's monsters, and not only rid the field of a potential nuisance, but have a nice 2400 non-Toon attacker at your disposal. Good stuff mah dude. </span>  <span>That about wraps it up. Beware, if you don't already own some of these cards, mainly the spells, and you don't have a well-paying job or parents who give a generous allowance, then LOL, you probably won't be using this deck.</span>"

Originally this was a pauper deck for a challenge but I modified it and threw some inexpensive cards in.  The Idea behind that deck is to go blind 2nd and break your opponents board. The Tenyi monsters are pretty good extenders and Nahata is able to shine in this case because it basically allows all your vanilla monsters to run over most of the cards your opponent will throw at you.  The Treacherous Trap Hole is in there if you either are forced to go first or the OTK fails.  Giant Ballpark is just a win-condition on it's own. Not only does it allow you to swarm the field for an all out attack, but it also has the ability to save you from OTKs because you can stop 1 attack, send Gokipole and the use it's effect to special summon a vanilla and then pop a monster.  Overall the deck is pretty simple to pilot. You just throw all your stuff at your opponent and hope that it works and if it doesn't make Rafflesia and ontop of that Picofalena increases your grindgame massively because not only are you able to recycle your cards and then draw but on top of that she also allows you to equip a Resonance Insekt or a Gokipole on another Insect which both will trigger their effects if your opponent decides to remove the equipped monster."

Additionally, he wins more rare cards from the duels he wins in the preliminaries.

Also his deck is fortified with the monsters he won per ante at the tournament; again there's no major archetype.  Although Yugi manages to win back Joey's ""Red-Eyes"", Joey refuses to take it back and says he'll earn it when he becomes a better Duelist (in the English dub, he lends it to Yugi to help defeat <a title=""Marik Ishtar"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Marik_Ishtar"">Marik</a>). In later arcs of the anime, he is shown to have it again, which means one of three things. The first being Yugi/Atem beat Joey and gave Red Eyes back to Joey because he deserved it. The second is both Yugi and Joey had a draw and neither of them won or lost but Joey earned back his Red Eyes, or lastly he defeated Yugi in the Duel following the tournament, earning back his Red Eyes. The true result is left for the viewer to decide. In the manga Jonouchi does not use it again, except in <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Millennium World"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Millennium_World"">Millennium World</a>, where he wouldn't necessarily need the actual card, but it is eventually confirmed that he has re-obtained it when he shows the card to Aigami in <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!

""Venom"" as an archetype can be rated as one of the worst group of cards in the game of Yugioh, since they feature a mechanic of distributing counters that do almost nothing regardless of board state while also being incredibly restrictive and slow to get out. On top of that, the boss monsters have absolutely nothing to do with the aforementioned mechanic and instead go for an alternate win option that is inconsistent and slow. However, they are an archetype that I would still deem playable, so I tried making the most of it.</p> <p>The ""Venom"" monster part is really limited if you do not want to work with ""Venom"" counters, so aside from three copies of ""<a data-name=""Venom Cobra"">Venom Cobra</a>"" to summon via ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"", three copies of ""<a data-name=""Vennominon the King of Poisonous Snakes"">Vennominon the King of Poisonous Snakes</a>"" as a recurring monster and potential beatstick and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Vennominaga the Deity of Poisonous Snakes"">Vennominaga the Deity of Poisonous Snakes</a>"" as the card with the alternate win condition, there is not that much that I would deem playable in the monster department. They got help from various other Reptile-type monsters though: The ""Reptilianne"" archetype provides ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Vaskii"">Reptilianne Vaskii</a>"" as a Kaiju-esque beatstick with a removal effect and ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Lamia"">Reptilianne Lamia</a>"" for her easy Special Summon condition and for setting opposing ATK values to 0. The ""Aliens"" provide ""<a data-name=""Alien Stealthbuster"">Alien Stealthbuster</a>"" as a monster that still has an effect by simply hitting the graveyard, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Alien Overlord"">Alien Overlord</a>"" is easy summonable with the help of some A-counter usage. Alongside one ""<a data-name=""Danger?! Tsuchinoko?"">Danger?! Tsuchinoko?</a>"" for two helpful effects, there is one copy of ""<a data-name=""Ipiria"">Ipiria</a>"" to give us more resources upon revival and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Yamorimori"">Yamorimori</a>"" for further control and destruction effects.</p> <p>The Spells consist of three copies of ""<a data-name=""Snake Rain"">Snake Rain</a>"" to setup the various effects of the Reptile monsters as well as providing stats to both ""Venom"" boss monsters. Two copies of ""<a data-name=""Ogdoadic Water Lily"">Ogdoadic Water Lily</a>"" can make use of the graveyard-filling, one ""<a data-name=""Card of Demise"">Card of Demise</a>"" allows us to fill the backrow and can possibly still be helpful when the cards in hand have to be discarded due to the graveyard effects, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" to revive monsters from the graveyard, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>"" since the deck has plenty of Dark Attribute monsters and since, weirdly enough, ""<a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>"" is part of the archetype due to naming shenanigans. The Trap line-up starts with two ""<a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>"" that can fetch almost any other pair of Traps in the deck, two ""<a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>"" as board resets, two ""<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>"" since they are massively useful effect blockers, make it easy to get over opposing monsters and can pretty much always played twice, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Offering to the Snake Deity"">Offering to the Snake Deity</a>"" for more removal and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a>"", which cannot be searched via ""<a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>"" but help stopping certain plays to opponent might go for.</p> <p>The Extra Deck includes one copy of ""<a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>"" as previously mentioned, which is a solid monster all around, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Hydra"">Reptilianne Hydra</a>"" as a situational option to summon using ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Lamia"">Reptilianne Lamia</a>"", one ""<a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a>"" as a Reptile monster searcher, one ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" for backrow removal, one ""<a data-name=""C&lt;a data-name=&quot;astel the Skyblaster Musketeer&quot;&gt;astel the Skyblaster Musketeer&lt;/a&gt;"">C</a><a data-name=""astel the Skyblaster Musketeer"">astel the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" to get rid of monsters that you cannot handle using the destruction effects in the Main Deck, one ""<a data-name=""Evilswarm Exciton Knight"">Evilswarm Exciton Knight</a>"" to reset the board, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Echidna"">Reptilianne Echidna</a>"" as a very solid searcher, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame"">Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame</a>"", which is basically the Reptile version of ""<a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a>"" and is easily capable of filling your board since the graveyard should be rammed full with various monsters to summon, one ""<a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a>"" helps running over bigger monsters, the entire ""Knightmare"" package for obvious reasons, and one ""<a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>"" as a generic boss monster to kick the opponent with.</p> <p>One criticism with this deck might be the lack of the ""Venom"" archetype, since  only a small part of the deck even belongs to the archetype and it looks more like ""Reptile Goodstuff"". And I cannot deny that that is the case; however, I think this is as far as you can go with ""Venom"" while still having a playable deck, since using their counter mechanic is certainly too flawed to work. However, if you would like to give a ""Venom"" deck a shot, feel free to get some inspiration on the rest of the cards from my ""Archetype Analysis: Venom"" article on my blog, which you can find here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/05/22/archetype-analysis-venom/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/05/22/archetype-analysis-venom/</a></p>"

","Enough is enough, we shall not stand as our monsters attack are reduced to nothing, an attacking your opponent becomes a death sentence. Behold SuperHeavy Samurai.  SuperHeavy Samurai is an archetype is based around big boys in defense, they attack while in face up defense position, and cards like <a data-name=""Superheavy Samurai Transporter"">Superheavy Samurai Transporter</a> and <a data-name=""Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter"">Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter</a> can be special summon from your hand, but here's the catch along with the special summoning and many other monster effects can only be activated by having <strong>no spell and trap cards in your graveyard. </strong>This generally means that there are no spell or trap cards in the deck because of this, however you can run Rise to Full Height because it has and easy banish from your graveyard and it also doubles your monster defense same as <a data-name=""Superheavy samurai soul Gauntlet"">Superheavy samurai soul Gauntlet</a> but reduces defense to 0 at end of turn.  One of the best combos in the deck is <a data-name=""Superheavy samurai soulpiercer"">Superheavy samurai soulpiercer</a>, normal summon soulpiercer then link off into <a data-name=""Superheavy samurai Scarecrow"">Superheavy samurai Scarecrow</a>, soulpiercer effect goes off to add a monster from deck to hand like <a data-name=""Superheavy samurai soulpeacemaker"">Superheavy samurai soulpeacemaker</a>, use Scarecrow effect to discard and bring back soulpiercer to then target it with soulpeacemaker, use soulpeacemaker to special summon any monster from your deck to the field then add monster to hand with soulpiercer again because it was sent to the graveyard.  With this you can special summon tot he field <a data-name=""Superheavy samurai Big Benkei"">Superheavy samurai Big Benkei</a> for example and then add to hand <a data-name=""Superheavy smaurai trumpeter"">Superheavy smaurai trumpeter</a>, special summon it and synchro summon <a data-name=""s&lt;a data-name=&quot;uperheavy samurai warlord susanowo&quot;&gt;uperheavy samurai warlord susanowo&lt;/a&gt;"">s</a><a data-name=""uperheavy samurai warlord susanowo"">uperheavy samurai warlord susanowo</a> and then attack them. because you generally want to go second for draw and attack.  Now look I don't have to tell you everything you can do with these cards I'm sure your smart enough to figure that out for yourselves. But as far as the side deck goes it's just some other cards you can put into the deck, among other card if you wish like <a data-name=""Giant rat"">Giant rat</a>.

The main combo consists in throwing Wightbaking to the graveyard by any means and then acctive its search effects to draw a Wightprince and if you have a Burial From a Different Dimensiom in hand pick a King of The Skull Servants or Wightprincess if not pick a Wightmare then discard Wightprince that will active his own effect and discard more 2 skull servants from your deck, if you reached here you have two possibilities: <ul>  	<li> the first and strongest in my opinion is if you have a Burial From a Different Dimension in hand because then you can active wightprince effects in graveyard without no atk drawback to your King of the Skull Servants.</li> </ul> <ul>  	<li> if you dont have a burial From another dimension so you must have searched Wightmare and if you do you can active Wightprince in graveyard and banish expecifically a normal Skull Servant, after that active Wightmare from your hand and now you have a King of the Skull Servants with a minimum drawback.</li> </ul> <ul>  	<li>also you can complement the two ways above if you didn't wasted your normal summon yet and you searched out a King of The Skull Servants with the Wightbaking then you will have two big beatsticks in the field nice!</li> </ul> The extra deck really sucks but i dont found more anything worth to put there, also if anyone is wondering why theres a synchro monster its because the lightsworn in the deck is a turner so its not impossible to bring out.  &nbsp;  Thats all i learned after playing with the deck if you have a any suggestion please tell me and sorry if i committed any grammatical errors."

This is a going first deck that relies on your Spell Card effects such as Ojama Country to keep your opponent from attacking. there is also Triple Ojama Trio and Ojama Duo in the deck to stop your Opponent from summoning on their first turn. There are three ways to winning with this deck. <ol>  	<li>Deck Out. this deck is a slow deck that ramps up the more you get into your deck, so use cards like Ojama Pajama to search your deck for certain cards, as well as Ojama Blue's effect on battle destruction, for the Ojama Blue Effect to be possible without your opponent using their own monsters, simply give your opponent a Token with the Ojama Duo or Ojama Trio along with Ojama Country being on the field, Thus they can use the Token to Destroy Blue and allow you to search.  note the Polymerization Cards are not searchable, i have tried this deck with Verte but you do find yourself locked into only certain types of monsters when using Obedience Schooled so be careful of that. but Obedience Schooled can be coupled with any Ojama Monster to Allow you to Summon two Number 64: Ronin Raccoons to protect yourself from being attacked. since Ronin Raccoon can not be destroyed by battle or card effect when another Beast monster is on the field, two Raccoons on the field will protect you from being destroyed by lightening storm or any destruction, but do note, they can still be targeted for none destruction effects to keep a watch out for those, plus with the Token Generation from the Raccoons the Tri-Bridge monsters are easy summons, just not on the same turn as when Obedience was activated.</li>  	<li>Classic life point hits, while this deck offers nothing in negation, outside of stopping your opponent from summoning monsters, there is plenty of disruptions in the deck, such as the before mentioned Monster summoning disruption, but if you find yourself with the Three Ojama Brothers (Yellow, Black and Green) a Ojama Red and Ojama Delta Hurricane you can blow your opponent's entire field away, leaving them open for a straight on attack if you have Ojama Country on the field, if they are below 4000 life points you will win the duel. you can also speed up this progress with cards such as Ojama Party, Ojamagic, Ojama Blue, Ojama Pink, Ojama Country, and Ojama Duo's second Effect to search out the needed cards, and this can all happen while you complete Win Scenario 1.</li>  	<li>Burn Damage?! I know what your thinking, ""An Ojama Burn Deck? Really?"" and Yes its true, this deck has the Potential to burn your opponent's life points away, While you are trying to do either of the before 2 Win Scenarios, you will end up with Ojama Tokens on your Opponent's field. a little known fact about these tokens are, they deal 300 damage when they leave the field, i know not much, but surprisingly these cards can actually be recyclable too, may i introduce to you, Necroface, a Level 4 Zombie Effect Monster, with the effect to return Banished cards to the deck and gain attack points for it when it is normal summoned. while this card is annoying on your side of the field, you can simply link it away for Verte after you summon it, but do be careful, Necroface's effect is a double edged sword returning your opponent's banished cards to the deck as well, so Necroface works against Tri-Bridge Omen, and the first Win Scenario of Decking out your Opponent but, with your opponent having a full field of tokens and you either having Ojama Delta Hurricane or five monsters to attack over them, you can deal a minimum of 1,500 life point damage to your opponent. not much right? well  look at it like this, in general you have Three Copies of Ojama Duo and Ojama Trio in the deck, that's a potential of 4,500 life point Damage, but if you use the second effect of Ojama Duo to banish them to summon two Ojama Monsters with different names to your field, you can abuse Necroface's effect to recycle the three of them granting you a potential of at least 1,800 more adding up to 6,300, and do not worry about decking yourself out either, because Melffy Hide and Seek allows you to reshuffle 3 Beast monsters from your graveyard with different names to your deck and allows you to draw a card as well. Adding another Necroface to your deck from the side deck is your own choice, but this Win Scenario is the most unlikely and requires the most set up, which allows for more chances to mess up with the setup for it and the more potential to lose the duel.</li> </ol> So those are the three win Scenarios for the deck, the easiest would probably be the Deck out Scenario, but the Attacking Scenario is a close second while the Burn Scenario does have the most setup, needing to go into the side deck for more copies of Necroface or  Melffy Hide and Seeks, which isnt a bad thing, because game one you can employ either of the other two win Scenarios to get game. the deck is actually pretty strong if you use it correctly,but just remember the weaknesses of the targeting none destruction removal."

You want to get a Melody of Awakening Dragon on your first turn, so that you can retrieve a Blue-Eyes White Dragon and a Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon. You then special summon Alternative. With this, all you need is Polymerization and another Blue-Eyes White Dragon to fusion summon Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon. This is the main power of the deck, being unaffected by effects and can destroy 3 cards per turn. This deck has several potential strategies in it, ones involving Links, Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX, and the Five-Headed Dragon.  Another major strategy is to have a Blue-Eyes White Dragon on the field and a Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon in your hand. You then Link summon Imduk the World Chalice Dragon by sacrificing the Blue-Eyes (I know that card is not in this deck, replace something with it). You can then banish Imduk to special summon Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon. Then, using Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon's effect, you can bring back the Blue-Eyes White Dragon you sacrificed earlier. The reason to use Imduk is that it is a useless card to banish, instead of having to banish a precious Blue-Eyes."

Basically just summon four monsters with Uka in hand however you can.  I wanted to include Okami and Kaku, but sadly they're too bricky because they require more board setup to summon (We don't talk about Yata)  If you don't own/run Apollousa, you can replace necroface with Barrier Statue of the Abyss and summon that with Uka, then do your regular link plays but end with I P Masquerena for Knightmare Unicorn and something like Zeroboros (sadly even less budget :/ )  You could also use Reprodocus in place of Akashic/Security, and link into Simorgh with Barrier statue of the stormwinds.  You can play around with extra deck options, there's versatility for more rank 8  XYZ or dark Links if you want to run the barrier statue strategy. There's a lot more potential for Gizmeks with the new support and between Makami and Uka searching/summoning over 825 cards you can run some interesting tech."

Gimmick Puppets... aren't very good, but they hold a special place in my heart. I've been playing them casually for about 7 years.  This particular build is a budget deck that was made during Master Rule 4, so I am sure there are several updates that could be made (eg. Girsu, Zeus, Hand Traps, etc.).  ...  I prefer Inferno Reckless Summon to Machine Duplication in most cases, since it allows you to get out Magnet Doll and Bisque Doll and can set up the field for a board wipe with Dark Strings or Pain Gainer. (If you're already playing Magnet Doll, you've submitted to the fact that you are be dependent on your opponent's board anyways)  Desperado Barrel Dragon and Heavy Metal Raiders are in there just for jollies, since most your deck is mostly dark machines with low Attack.  I never understood why Konami made Gear Changer an EARTH monster that can't be searched from the deck. I guess they were just scared that Pups would be TOO GOOD.  Have fun out there!"

But if you're playing modern Yu-Gi-Oh, this probably isn't the case.  The entire Jinzo archetype seems strangely over-balanced, and not particularly good, but it oozes with style.  In short, get out a bunch of Jinzos, support them with extra deck monsters, and hope it's enough to win.  This is intended to be a casual budget deck, so I didn't include Hand Traps, Kaiju engines, Dragun, Gamma, etc.  ...  Spice up the party with Desperado Barrel Dragon and Heavy Metal Raiders, since your deck is mostly Dark Machines anyways. Since we're main-decking Super Poly, I threw in a little Time Wizard just for extra style points (and because it's searchable by Desperado).  Various ""Brain"" and ""Mind"" cards for that Espa Roba flavor. Jinzo - Layered is also included for style, though you should probably never play him.  I'm not quite sure why Konami made half the archetype around trap hate and the other half around taking control of your opponent's monsters, but it doesn't quite work together.  Have fun out there!"

Jizukiru is a level 10 Kaiju with Light typing that opens up playing El Shaddoll Construct.  Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord is a level 10 and can be useful for recovering monsters.  Skill Drain will disrupt your opponent and turn your main deck monster lineup into massive beaters.

You must defend to win! How can? You can!!!,"<p><strong>ABOUT THIS DECK:</strong></p>  <blockquote> <p><strong><em>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY, IT WILL HELP YOU SO MUCH!</em></strong></p> </blockquote> <strong>* Cards in Main Deck and Extra Deck:</strong>  - Timelord Series: They can burn your opponent LP, also, they can return Monsters, Spells, and Trap your opponent control to hand or Deck.  - Red-Eyes Fusion: I will not talk more about this. You can Fusion Summon “Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon” – one of the mainstay monsters.  - Called by the Grave will protect you from “Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring” or something else, also, it can negate the opponent’s combos.  - Twin Twister: You can use it to destroy 2 Spells and/or Traps YOU CONTROL if you have “Starlight Road”. Then activate “Starlight Road” to Special Summon “Stardust Dragon”. If you don’t have “Starlight Road”, you can use it to destroy Spells/Traps your opponent control, such as “Royal Decree” or something else.  - Scapegoat: To do this combo, you must Set them in your turn. During your opponent's End Phase, activate this card and Special Summon 4 Tokens to your field. During Main Phase, you can do this: Link Summon 1 “Linkuriboh” to your Extra Monster Zone, then Link Summon another “Linkuriboh” to a zone that the first “Linkuriboh” point to. Then Link Summon “Security Dragon” using 1 Token and the 2nd “Linkuriboh” as materials. In this time, if you want, you can return 1 monster your opponent control to their hand. Then activate the effect of “Linkuriboh” in your GY, tribute the left Token, Special Summon that “Linkuriboh”. After you do all of this, you can use all of those monsters as materials for Link – 4. You can Summon “Borrelsword Dragon” if your opponent monster has high ATK, “Borrelguard Dragon” if your opponent has a lot of like “Dark Hole”, “Mirror Force” or something else, “Borreload Dragon” if they have a lot of powerful monsters, or “Topologic Zeroboros” if there are a lot of banished cards.  - Mirror Force series: It can protect you so much. But if you have a lot of Mirror Force in your hand, just set half of them to your field, because if your opponent destroyed all Spell/Trap you control, you still have Mirror Force in your hand.  - Waking the Dragon: You must believe the heart of cards when using them. You should wish, wish, and wish that your opponent destroy that card you control. And if it does, you can Summon “Ultimate Falcon”, “Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon”, “The Last Warrior from Another Planet”, “Cyber Dragon Infinity”, “Number C69: Heraldry Crest of Horror”, or above Link monsters, depends on the situation of the Duel.  - Starlight Road: You can combo this card with “Twin Twister”. But if you have this card and “Waking the Dragon”, JUST ACTIVATED (This is your optional).  - Magic Cylinder: The most powerful Trap in this Deck. It makes your opponent take a lot of damage that you would take, and also can make you win a Duel! If you have 3 “Magic Cylinder”, you can also still Set all of them! Because when your opponent declares an attack, you can activate 3 “Magic Cylinder” at the same time. But carefully!  - Solemn series: You can use this to protect your Spell/Trap from ""Mystical Spece Typhoon"", ""Twin Twister"", ""Lightning Storm"", ""Jinzo"" or something that your opponent plays.  <strong> *Side Deck:</strong> Depends on your opponent, carefully use them!  <strong>*Tips:</strong>  + You can also use ""Mystic Mine"", ""Swords of Revealing Light"", or something that you want to upgrade this Deck.  + If your opponent uses ""Royal Decree"", ""Jinzo"", etc, you must have ""Timelord"", ""Twin Twister"", or any Spells in your hand. If you do not have any of them, you must believe the heart of cards!"

Key cards: Bar,"The Decks main strategy is to go first is to use <em>""Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda""</em> to set up a 2 material <em>""Springans Merrymaker""</em> (with a <em>""Springans Captain Sargas""</em> if you drew it or searched it off <em>""Springans Watch""</em>) then use floodgate cards such as <em>""Barrier Statue of Inferno""</em> &amp; <em>""Anti-Spell Fragrance"" </em>to lock your opponent out of playing the game. Now, you may say that ""Well they can just normal summon a monster with 1000 or more ATK to beat over the barrier statue"" but that is where you're wrong! Because <em>""</em><em>Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda"" </em>is a recent field spell it has 3 effects, one of those being that when an Xyz Monster leaves the field by a card effect, it can target 1 monster your opponent and prevent it from attacking. It wins in the grind game due to you being able to continuously pop your opponent's cards with <em>""Springans Ship - Exblower""</em> and <em>""Barrage Blast""</em>, always have an omni-negate only with <em>""Springans Interluder""</em> and always be able to resummon the Xyz with <em>""Salamangreat Sunlightwolf""</em> recycling your Springans for discard fodder.  Going second the Deck isn't nearly as strong, however, it has <em>""Springans Ship - Exblower"" </em>to help- bait out negates and, in the scenario where they don't have them, pop a ton of their cards. If playing the deck you should make sure to pack your side deck with tons of cards to accommodate for this weakness of going second. The deck also plays 8 hand traps in the main deck which is the optimal number if you want to draw 1 per hand. They also only summon once or twice allowing them to play under winda and Summon limit extremely easily.  Explanation of the important cards in the deck:  <strong>Springans Captain Sargas:</strong> drident on your opponents turn by detaching material from an xyz.  <strong>Barrier Statue of the Inferno:</strong> You can Special Summon, your opponent cannot.  <strong>Springans Watch: </strong>Terraforming, OR: ROTA and foolish.  <strong>Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda:</strong> Cheats out xyzs and prevents attacks.  <strong>Springans Interluder:</strong> omni-negate every turn.  <strong>Barrage Blast: </strong> Salamangreat Rage if it was a continuous Trap.  <strong>Anti-Spell Fragrance:</strong> No Spells, No harpie's, No lightning storm.  <strong>Springans Ship - Exblowrer:</strong> BOOM!  <strong>Springans Merrymaker:</strong> Armageddon Knight, then sends Titanklads on your opponents turn.  Thanks for reading. Bye."

There's definite room for improvements.  The main strengths of Archfiends include their access to Falling Down, the high attack power of their monsters, and their easy recyclability. Some of the Archfiends have no OPTs too. The deck is surprisingly well suited for grind games and can potentially be tweaked to lean more in that direction.  All of the links are good generic fiends, with Masterking Archfiend being a centerpiece; Tour Guide + Fiendish Rhino Warrior can summon him, FRW can send an Heiress, and Masterking can trigger his ability on Chain Link 1 to put an extra body on the field, or give you back a resource while you get a search. Zombiestein is the most reliable option to beating over Dragoon; Dingirsu is good for removal and can be ranked up into Pain Gainer and The Seven Sins. Leviair is for recycling.  Archfiends are less reliant on the Extra Deck than other archetypes, so Pot of Prosperity and Pot of Extravagance work well here. You can cut Curse Necrofear and the Allure of Darknesses for three Prosperities if you'd like. Side deck consists of anti-meta and board wipe cards which Archfiends can profit from.  Proof of Pruflas might be worth playing around with in this deck. Other promising builds for Archfiends include a level 6 focused variant, using XYZs like Jinzo - Layered, Beatrice, Dhampir, and Constellar Ptolemy M7, a trap heavy build that makes extensive use of the viruses, or a fusion build that uses Summoned Skull, Super Polymerization, etc."

To Win: go second, summon a timelord(s), attack, stall and burn.  Obviously this is a budget/casual deck, but if you wanted to improve it you could add some more copies/searchers for Mystic Mine, Summon Limit, Threatening Roar, etc.  ...  There are 5 clowns added (making this a 45 card deck) just so I could reasonably keep the name ""Carnival of Horrors"". Surprise your friends and neighbors by playing Crass Clown and Dream Clown in current year. Shock them even more by adding Poly and Bickuribox into the mix. Or just take them out entirely.  Chain Energy and Cauldron of the Old Man to supplement your timelord burn. It makes the duel more exciting when there's a time limit on things.  Only 1 copy of Mystic Mine because it's relatively expensive, and because you want your casual friends to continue to duel with you.  Extra deck optional, but will obviously boost consistency.

Step 1: Evil Eye, if you've got Serziel in your hand you could try summoning him/her. Doing so allows you to grab whatever Evil Eye you want which could be Basilius or Selene or even the Field Spell if you've got Selene already.  Step 2: Unchained, I'm not to sure about the names but you want the traps to be in your hand, plus a way to destroy them so that you can use their effects. Aruha is the one that can Special Summon itself by destroying a card you control (maybe the trap card? hint hint).  Step 3: Now that you've got Serziel on field plus Aruha and whatever you summoned off the trap card you destroyed (or spell) You can summon that Basilius you grabbed or activate the field spell to get one. That's 4 monsters ready and waiting to be used for Link Summoning. Make the Blue Dog using your summon from the trap + Basilius or Aruha, equip the Eye of Selene to Serziel and use whatever other cards are in your hand to bolster your defenses.  This end board definitely won't win games or lock your opponent out of anything too important but on their turn if they Special Summon you can Link their card away with the Blue Dog and you've got Serziel who is immune to things while equipped with Selene so you can use their effect to destroy another of your opponent's special summoned monsters, which will make it so you need to destroy a card on your turn (per Serziel's effect), luckily if you've got another Unchained trap or that Aruha still around you can summon another Unchained from the deck.  Every time you use Serziel or another Evil Eye spell/trap your Serziel gains 500 ATK and you lose 500 LP, this is how you can make Big Serziel using a monster with 2600 or more ATK so that Big Serziel can attack twice.  Sorry if I've not explained things well enough, but I think this deck is more fun to experience yourself rather than having someone explain every step to you.  Enjoy!"

It's really funny.  &nbsp;  <span>UPDATE 1:</span>  So, since i originally released this deck, i tried to work a bit more of a burn strategy into it as well since Sunny's Snitch is already a burn spell on top of a searcher. Hopefully this should be a more optimal build. Its still obviously non-meta, but its better than what i had before i think.  &nbsp;  Zeus is also in here for buffer room and additional aggro if necessary. Plus, its really funny watching people rage over Zeus when he comes onto board. The side deck is also just full wombo combo shenanigans with Crossout Designator because ""y'know.""  &nbsp;  ALSO, if you want to prioritize getting Zeus out, run something like Gachi Gachi Gantetsu instead of the single copy of Splash Mage (or you could take out one of the Knightmares instead).  &nbsp;  <span>UPDATE 2:</span>  I've abandoned the burn shenanigans.

This is Nurse Burn, and as such, you want to get Nurse on board as soon as you can. To achieve this, we're running four draw cards and six searchers for Nurse. If Nurse or Simochi is not active on your opponent's turn, you lose the game. It's that simple.  The burn cards are as follows: Upstart Goblin, Gift Card, Tri and Guess, Dark Cure, and The Paths of Destiny. The extra deck that I included is specifically for use with Ghost Reaper as this deck dies to a single interaction. If you want Tri and Guess to almost never fail, run an extra deck of fifteen of the cheapest link monsters you have. The Psychic Eraser Laser in the side deck is also a solid burn card, but you need your opponent to play the game first.  Other options for the deck include Mystic Mine as Nurse is unaffected by its restrictions, Soul Taker as a really bad removal option, The Eye of Truth if you want to pretend hand knowledge was worth it in a deck that just spams burn damage, Pot of Extravagance if you can't afford Prosperity, and Forbidden Chalice if you can't afford Forbidden Droplets"

Then when the time is right, and your GY is fully stocked you can go into AC and win the game. This deck will struggle if you're not able to fill you GY with monsters to use.

This is more of an experiment than a legitimate deck, but it can be fun to test out yourself. Super vulnerable to interruption b/c scrap engine but fairly reliable otherwise.  Main combo requires scrap raptor and either recycler or factory. You essentially need to dump four cards to the grave (rosenix, world wand, Taniguku, Uka), so you'll need to summon two golems unless you hard draw foolish burial/succession/reborn. Factory relies on terraforming, but recycler can be searched off of small world if you have one of the gizmeks in hand (banish gizmek from hand, banish scrap raptor from deck, add recycler to hand). There are a few ways to patch up bad hands, you'll most likely just end with less link material on the field in the end.  The combo - <ol>  	<li>Summon raptor, target and destroy itself. Add recycler or factory.</li>  	<li>Activate factory</li>  	<li>Summon recycler, send rosenix</li>  	<li>Banish rosenix for token, link into scrap wyvern</li>  	<li>Wyvern summon recycler &amp; destroy recycler <ol>  	<li>chain link 1 wyvern, chain link 2 factory</li>  	<li>factory summon golem A from deck, wyvern summon golem B from deck and destroy factory</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Golem A summon recycler, recycler mill world wand</li>  	<li>Golem A and recycler link into Lib, Lib adds succession</li>  	<li>succession summons golem A</li>  	<li>Golem A summon recycler, recycler mill Taniguku</li>  	<li>recycler and scrap wyvern link reprodocus</li>  	<li>Golem B summons recycler, recycler mill Uka</li>  	<li>recycler and Lib link codebreaker virus, virus summon zero day to opponents field</li>  	<li>reprodocus make zero day your desired attribute</li>  	<li>Link/do other plays (Avramax is a decent option using reprodocus and virus to direct attacks away from the barrier statue)</li>  	<li>banish Taniguku from grave to summon Uka, Uka target zero day to summon barrier statue of desired type.</li>  	<li>???</li>  	<li>Profit?</li> </ol> If you don't summon Avramax and have a good hand you'll end with two golems and two link 2s on the field before the barrier statue (maybe an Uka if you drew one since it's a free summon during the combo), so you could also make a 4 material Apollousa, or whatever other link plays you want. The provided extra deck only has the bare minimum plus a couple recommended cards. Avramax can draw attacks away from the barrier statue, Apollousa is Apollousa.  If you don't want to use zero day or Uka, Reprodocus can make something a winged beast to summon simorgh, who summons the wind barrier in the end phase. If you can't finish the combo, golem can also summon scrap recycler to your opponents field as well, so if you can summon Uka from the hand/graveyard you can put up the earth barrier statue. You can sub in whatever barrier statue you think is most effective, the ones in the main deck are just the most reliable to get out. And if Reprodocus makes zero day the divine attribute, you can summon Obelisk from the deck (Big Meme). This is essentially an engine to search any of Uka's targets while still putting up link material. Nothing competitive, but I like finding weird uses for cards."

Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon is Insane.","This is a fun Blue-Eyes deck that i made when i saw the potential of Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon.  Now if you run Abyss Dragon, you can run with Poly or you can run a variant where you use a Advanced Ritual Art and Chaos Max Dragon because you special summon Abyss and can grab both cards necessary for the Ritual (For Next Turn).  Ok so this Deck though, you want to get Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon onto the field, but you want to make sure you at least use (1 Blue Eyes Alt Dragon), so the Alternative Ultimate Dragon has its full effect. It can pop 3 Cards every turn, not just monsters, 3 cards in general. He Also cannot be targeted or destroyed by card effects. So he can still die to battle but he's got 4500 Attack, not the easiest to do in 1 turn.  I put in the Numeron #100 (OTK Package), because its extremely easy to use with Draglubion #97, honestly to good not to use.  I also put in a Nebula to easily get out a Rank 8 xyz.  This isn't a meta deck what so ever but I've had a ton of fun using it.  Worst comes to worst and you go first, you summon out as many big beaters as you can, and you use Skill Drain and play big 3K Beatstick.  Hey Can someone let me know about this, if i have Blue-Eyes Alt Ultimate, and my opponent has Cyber Dragon Infinity, can Infinity use his Effect to suck up the Dragon? I have been running cyber a bunch lately and was curious about this."

Arlekino provides one extra disruption to the boards regular musketeer decks can provide. He is also a good beat stick and can be used as a material for things like accesscode and apollousa when he is no longer needed. Musketeers in general are a very good control deck because they can search each and every form of negation under the sun, using cards like max and caspar. Your usual win condition is just getting a caspar out and then searching multiple negations off of max, which are later used in caspar's column in order to trigger his effect to search another disruption. After a turn or two your opponent should have burned through their field and hand so they won't be able to do much. Then you will be able to go into either utopia double or accesscode to go for game. <h4 class=""engine-dark-box""></h4>"

Depending on your opening hand, you can get fully set up but most cases you will have to get stuff set up and win the following turn.  Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon is Key, but to get its effect off you need to make sure you have a Blue-Eyes on the Field or even easier in the GY.  So your objective is to get the Blue-Eyes to the GY, either from Foolish Burial, or dragon shrine. Dragon shrine is clutch because you can get one in the GY, then send an additional dragon since you sent a normal monster first, and you send Stone of Ancients which will help you special summon Abyss at the end phase. So i will usually get out a linkuriboh and chill. Depending on your hand you can go into xyz or even Alt Ultimate Dragon, but most cases you will end with a linkuriboh and possibly a Imperm Set.  Then in the end phase, your Stone of Ancients will activate, special summon the Abyss dragon (I usually do in defense), which in turn will activates abyss effect which you search your Advanced Ritual Art, and the Chaos Max dragon. Now if you have either of those in hand or its more ideal to get a poly then go for it, but in this example you don't have either card.  So next turn you will have an empty board, most likely they killed off your linkuriboh. So you activate Advanced Ritual Art sending the Dragon Core Hexer to the GY, Summoning the Chaos Max Dragon. Now you should have more then enough Monsters in the GY by now, and in the case of this example you have searched or had Chaos Dragon Levianeer in hand already. So what you do is banish 3 light monsters, don't banish the Dragon Core Hexer we need that, summon out your Chaos Dragon Levianeer, activate its effect special summoning the Dragon Core Hexer in defense. Now you can synchro the Chaos Levianeer and the Dragon Core Hexer to make the Phantasmal Lord Ultimitl Bishbaalkin.  Now when that monster gets summoned, you can activates its effect to summon out tokens (o atk, 0 def) to your side of the field, and your opponents side of the field, the amount of tokens depends on how many monster zones are open. Its fills the remaining zones. So now your opponent has atleast 1 token, attack with Chaos Max and game over (8000 Damage).  This isnt some meta beating deck, buts a hell of alot of fun to play. I forget who i saw this strategy from but i changed it up some.  Any way to make it better feel free to comment or message, im no expert and don't know everything so give me some new ideas."

Use Foolish Burial, send a monster to the GY then special summon D. A. D. (provided you didn't use Foolish Burial during the previous combo).  D. A. D. can also be summoned by chaining 2 Mystic Tomatoes with 1 Witch Of The Black Forest. Only downside is you must wait a turn before summoning him if you choose to do it this way.  If you're lucky enough to remove from play 3 or more monsters with Pot Of Desires,  you can bring them back to your GY with Burial From A Different Dimension (up to 3 at a time), then freely summon D.

Also no dragoon.,"This deck focuses on Archfiend Black Skull Dragon and Red-Eyes Alternative Black Dragon.  ---------- Main ----------  Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit are self-explanatory. Ash can stop your opponent from searching, and Ghost Ogre can destroy their face up card's effect.  Red-eyes Alternative Dragon can be special summoned from your hand by tributing a red-eyes monster from your hand or field. If he gets destroyed by battle or card effect, you could special summon 1 red-eyes monster from your GY to your field, but if it's a red-eyes black dragon normal monster, then it's attack is doubled. So you could play around this if you wanted to.  Red-eyes Black Dragon is fodder for Red-Eyes alternative Black Dragon, or mostly just fusion material for Archfiend Black Skull Dragon and Meteor Black Comet Dragon. Also used for Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon.  Summoned Skull is also mainly fusion material for Archfiend Black Skull Dragon and material for Archfiend's Ascent,  Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon is self explanatory. You can special summon any summon-able dragon from your hand or GY once each turn.  Meteor Dragon Red-eyes Impact is used for fusion summon of Meteor Black Comet Dragon or just to re-summon for his effect. He is a Gemini monster though, so just using him for fusion material is viable.  Red-eyes Archfiend of Lightning is the same as meteor dragon red-eyes, mainly for fusion material but if you want, you could summon him. He's also a Gemini.  Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon is the same as meteor dragon and archfiend of lightning, mainly for use for other cards, not really needed to win. He's also a Gemini.  Red-Eyes Retro Dragon can return your field from destruction if timed correctly, and pretty good overall.  Red-Eyes Fusion is one of the best fusion cards besides the fact you can't summon at all after using it, and you have to use it first before any form of summoning. You can set monsters though.  Red-Eyes Insight lets you search red-eyes fusion easily by sending 1 red-eyes monster from your hand or deck to the GY, which is really more a benefit than a cost.  Monster Reborn is self explanatory.  Infinite Impermanence is a hand-trap, literally, you can activate it from your hand if you do not control no cards during yours or your opponent's turn. It also negates your opponents monster's effects and if it was set before use, you can negate any spell or trap card effects that would be in the same column as this set card.  Evenly matched lets you banish your opponents monster non-targeting, until they have the same number of cards on their field as yours. This can only be activated after the battle phase, both player's. If you control no cards, you could also activate this straight from your hand.  Return of the Red-eyes is like eternal soul but only for normal monsters in your GY when you control a red-eyes monster. So you could special summon 1 normal monster during either players turn once per turn if you control a red-eyes monster.  ---------- Extra ----------  Archfiend Skull can prevent your opponent from using card effects when he declares a attack, so your opponent can't use anything when he battles unless they have a card that responds before hand. After he battles, he can shuffle a red-eyes black dragon from your GY into your deck to inflict burn damage equal to the monster's atk.  Meteor Black dragon is a good beatstick and can summon any red-eyes monster when destroyed. He also sends a red-eyes monster from your deck to the GY and deals half their ATK as burn dmg to your opponent.  Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon inflicts 500 burn damage each time your opponent uses a card effect. You can also detach one material to special summon a red-eyes normal monster from your GY.  Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack can detach a material to special summon 2 phantom tokens, then you can tribute any Mecha phantom monsters or tokens to destroy 1 card on the field.  Number 11: Big Eye lets you detach one material to target and take control of one monster your opponent controls, so you could take a boss monster they have that doesn't have target immunity.  Photon Strike Bounzer lets you negate a monster effect on the field then inflict 1000 burn damage.  Archfiend Ascent can deny summoned skull destruction, and if he is destroyed, you can special summon a summoned skull from your hand deck or GY, his name also becomes summoned skull on the field.  Knightmare cards are self explanatory. Phoenix to destroy one spell or trap card your opponent controls, Cerberus to destroy one monster they control in their main monster zone, and unicorn to shuffle one monster they control back into their deck at the cost of discarding 1 card.  Linkuriboh is self-explanatory. You can send black stone of legend to the GY and use it's recycling effect to shuffle a red-eyes from your GY back into your deck and add the stone back to your hand.  ---------- Side Deck ----------  Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion is self explanatory. Ghost Belle can stop them from moving cards from the GY.  Framegear Gamma and Frame Driver is self-explanatory, if you had an empty field and your opponent used a monster effect, you could negate and destroy it, special summoning Gamma and Frame Driver to the field, Gamma has to be in your hand, and Frame Driver could be anywhere in the game except from removed from play. They are great at stopping opponent hand traps, so if you find yourself dueling against someone with a million hand traps, they can literally save you.  Nibiru is great if you find yourself against someone with a spam special summoning medical condition, he's able to wipe out their field via tribute, so most cards, almost none, have immunity to Nibiru. They do get a beefy token though, the good news being that the token is a dumb dead card, non-effect, and no protection whatsoever.  Harpie's feather is self-explanatory and raigeki.  Dark ruler no more negates all your opponent's face-up monster effects for the rest of this turn."

As for the name, I named this deck after the movie ""My Hero Academia: World Heroes' Mission.""  I didn't watch it yet, but I plan on doing that soon.  This deck uses Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer to pop the opponents' cards and one of your own, before you go beyond Plus Ultra and revive him on the next turn. In addition, Destiny HERO - Denier can put a banished Malicious on top of your deck so you can summon it from the deck and make more plays.  This deck is good going first or second. Go first? Set up a board of Destroy Phoenix Enforcer and any other disruptions or negates you can think of. Go second? Break your opponents' field apart with your HEROs' effects before OTKing them.  If you play this deck, make sure to channel your inner Deku or All Might and go beyond...PLUS ULTRA!!"

Released back in <em>The Lost Millennium</em>, this group of cards features seemingly random cards that are combined into one group by their support naming the following monsters: ""<a data-name=""Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter"">Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Monk Fighter"">Monk Fighter</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Master Monk"">Master Monk</a>"". They feature almost no strategy to begin with, but since they do still function as a card series I tinkered a little bit with them to come up with the following build.</p> <p>The monster line-up is as follows: Two ""<a data-name=""Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter"">Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter</a>"", three ""<a data-name=""Monk Fighter"">Monk Fighter</a>"" and three ""<a data-name=""Master Monk"">Master Monk</a>"" are basically required to make this deck a ""Monk"" deck, so there is little explanation necessary here. Two copies of ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"" can fetch both ""<a data-name=""Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter"">Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Evilswarm Heliotrope"">Evilswarm Heliotrope</a>"" as the biggest Rock-type Normal monster with Level 4 I could find. An ""Adamancipator"" engine consisting of three ""<a data-name=""Adamancipator Seeker"">Adamancipator Seeker</a>"" and three ""<a data-name=""Adamancipator Analyzer"">Adamancipator Analyzer</a>"" give the deck much needed speed and consistency and can make something out of the fact that ""<a data-name=""Monk Fighter"">Monk Fighter</a>"" is a Rock-type monster. Also, three ""<a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>"" are in the Main Deck to both clear the opposing board if they get too summon-heavy, but also function with another card in the deck.</p> <p>The backrow can be filled with three copies of ""<a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>"", which can also search for ""<a data-name=""Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter"">Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Evilswarm Heliotrope"">Evilswarm Heliotrope</a>"" like ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"" does, two ""<a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" to work with the graveyard and to gain more swarming, tempo, etc., three copies of ""<a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>"" to get around the fact that the ""Monk"" monsters have abysmal stats but still need to destroy monsters in battle, and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Legendary Black Belt"">Legendary Black Belt</a>"", which is kind of a win condition in this deck (albeit a bad one, but we are talking ""Monks"" here) and can potentially run over an opposing ""Nibiru Token"" for sizeable damage if ""<a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>"" is also involved. The Traps are three ""<a data-name=""Armory Call"">Armory Call</a>"" for Equip card consistency and a potential surprise for the opponent when they attack your monsters and you equip them with ""Moon Mirror Shield"" during their turn, three ""Lost Wind"" for being a lifesaver in this deck with effect negation and ATK halving, and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Lone Wolf"">Lone Wolf</a>"" for lackluster protection for one ""Monk"" monster. The Extra Deck does not need that much attention in my opinion, aside from ""<a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a>"" which is one of your searchers; the rest really only works as nice options to have in certain situations, but is certainly not necessary due to the gimmicky and casual nature of the deck in question.</p> <p>Would I recommend playing a ""Monk"" deck in 2021? No, absolutely not. There is little the deck can work against and with barely any synergy or strategy given by the series, it is certainly a gimmick from the past that I simply wanted to feature the deck for documentation purposes. However, if you still want to read up on what little info there is about building a ""Monk"" deck, I do have an article about them on my blog here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/08/11/archetype-analysis-monk/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/08/11/archetype-analysis-monk/</a></p>"

Here’s my attempt for working with them.  Rabbit and worm drake will work for turboing out king of the feral imps, it also can set up two worms in the graveyard for victory (who’s the main win con for this build), worm drake is a actually a reptile so it’s also unintentionally part of the archetype.  A little controversial is that I play 3 worm queen, normally people play one but I chose to do three because it summons from the deck.  I added Ogdoabyss for one reason, W nebula meteorite which summons a level 7 or higher light reptile which Ogdoabyss apparently fits the bill for.  Any other questions can be answered, Worms don’t have much potential but sometimes casual players rage so hard when victory is flipped."

Alongside Slifer, Obelisk received a new Structure Deck that supports its playstyle and allows to be summoned a bit faster than before, as well as adding a search option.  Rules are the same as always: It must be a 40-card Main Deck with any cards on the Extra Deck, where the Extra Deck must feature at least 30+ cards from the selected Structure Deck.  Starting up, we have the main star of the deck: <strong>Obelisk the Tormentor</strong>. A Level 10 DIVINE Divine-Beast monster with 4000 ATK/DEF, that requires 3 tributes to be Normal Summoned, neither player can activate cards or effects during its Normal Summon and said Normal Summon can't be negated, also it is sent to the GY during the End Phase if it was Special Summoned instead. It cannot be targeted by card effects (including your own) and you can tribute 2 monsters to destroy all monsters your opponent controls but Obelisk can't attack that turn. Obelisk is the only one of the 3 Egyptian God monsters that has a baseline ATK/DEF and a very solid one, even if Slifer and Ra can get bigger with the proper setup. You run it at 3 since the new support actually makes him easy to summon and it can be searched with <strong>Gizmek Makami, the Ferocious Fanged Fortress</strong> (If it is Normal or Special Summoned, you can discard 1 monster to add 1 monster from your Deck to your hand whose ATK equals its DEF).  For the new support, <strong>Soul Crossing</strong> is also featured in this Deck. <strong>Soul Crossing</strong> is a Quick-Play Spell that during the Main Phase allows you to Tribute Summon 1 Divine-Beast monster by tributing monsters from both sides of the field, but you can only activate 1 effect for the rest of the turn if you used at least 1 monster from your opponent's field, unless that effect is from a Divine-Beast monster. Is a big board wipe that can stop a combo if played at the right time and it isn't stopped and gives you a large body on the field.  Another card that is also featured in the Slifer Deck but didn't used is <strong>Divine Evolution</strong>. This is a Normal Spell that, without targeting (due to Obelisk's effect) can choose either a Divine-Beast monster or a ""The Wicked"" monster that is not already under the effects of <strong>Divine Evolution</strong> and grant it the following effects: <ul>  	<li>+1000 ATK/DEF</li>  	<li>Its activated effects and effect activations can't be negated. (If you got confused by the text, it means that effects they have in the moment they are played and effects they have while face-up on the field can't be negated).</li>  	<li>When the selected monster attacks: You can make your opponent send 1 monster they control to the GY of their choice.</li> </ul> Another support card used here is <strong>Angel O1</strong>. Is a Level 1 LIGHT Fairy monster that can be Special Summoned from the hand by revealing a level 7 or higher monster in your hand. And while on the field, if it was Special Summoned, you can Tribute Summon 1 Level 7 or higher monster in addition to your Normal Summon/Set. Is a free monster that can be used as Tribute Fodder, Link Fodder, Synchro Material; there's no reason to not run it. 3 can be risky to fulfill its Summoning Condition, but 2 has worked well with me.  Lastly, we have Obelisk's signature attack: <strong>Fist of Fate</strong>. A Quick-Play Spell that can only be activated if you control the original <strong>Obelisk the Tormentor</strong> on the field. Without targeting, it lets you choose an Effect Monster your opponent controls and negates its effects to then destroy it and then, for the rest of the turn, cards with that name have their effects negated for the rest of the turn. In addition to all this, if this card was activated on the Main Phase (yours or your opponents), it can destroy all Spells/Traps your opponent controls. On one card that requires some setup, you have removal and full lockdown on the effects of 1 monster for the rest of the turn as well as being a Quick-Play <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster.</strong>  And that's all from the stuff of the Extra Deck. As for the outside support, I used the following: <ul>  	<li>Deskbot Engine: Since this Deck has no use for the Extra Deck, unlike the Slifer version that could use <strong>Egyptian God Slime</strong>, I added an Deskbot Engine to have a pair of negates as well as drawing at least 4 cards on the first turn. The Main Combo is explained here: https://youtu.be/MO5UdLHT-Qo . However, is possible to end with <strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong> instead of <strong>Naturia Beast</strong>. The choice is yours.</li>  	<li><strong>Mound of the Bound Creator</strong>: added 1 copy, you to give a little more protection to Obelisk.</li> </ul> And that's it for this version of the Triple Structure Deck Challenge for the Egyptian God Deck: Obelisk the Tormentor. Honestly, both this deck and the Slifer one is pretty fun to play with and while both have their pros and cons, I hope you enjoy testing them out and tweaking them to your liking.  While I did have the setback that make this deck unable to be posted earlier, I do have ready the next 2 entries for the series; those will be the 2 upcoming Structure Decks: Cyber Style (Cyber Dragons and Cyberdarks) and Lost Sanctuary (The Agent/Hyperion).  Until then, thanks for reading this wall of text."

Some research I did when building the deck and wanted to share.</strong>  Qliphort debuted on November of 2014 in The New Challengers, the second set of the Pendulum era, and saw quick competitive success thanks to the sheer power of their boss monster Towers and it's consistency tools. Their second wave of support came on January 2015 in Secrets of Eternity, giving them among other things Monolith for draw power and Skybase as a secondary boss monster. The November 2015 forbidden and limited list (TCG) saw the limitation of Scout and <a data-name=""Saqlifice"">Saqlifice</a> alongside the banning of Towers, knocking the deck out of the meta for good. The trap Qlife's End was released on November 2016 (TCG) in Invasion: Vengeance, as a way to turbo out Skybase. The release of Link monsters, which don't have a level/rank and therefore bypass the immunity of Qliphorts, meant that Towers could be unbanned in February of 2018 (TCG); that month Qlis also received on Extreme Force their own Link monster in Genius, a Link 2 that provides negation and generates advantage when making big Pendulum plays. Extreme Force would be, as of today, the last time that the deck, which also has all their cards unlimited now, received direct support, meaning that they are still stuck on a sea of Link meta decks and staples that force them to depend on floodgates to even have a chance at victory.  <strong>Debut and support over the years...</strong> <table>  <tr> <td><img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//2/22/NECH-BoosterEN.png"" alt=""2014"" width=""94"" height=""166"" /></td> <td><img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//3/38/SECE-BoosterEN.png"" alt="""" width=""94"" height=""166"" /></td> <td><img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/5/56/INOV-BoosterEN.png/257px-INOV-BoosterEN.png"" alt="""" width=""93"" height=""166"" /></td> <td><img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/0/0f/EXFO-BoosterEN.png/257px-EXFO-BoosterEN.png"" alt="""" width=""94"" height=""166"" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td>2014: 1 effect mons., 5 pendulums, 2 spells (1 field and 1 equip) and 2 traps</td> <td>2015: 1 effect mons., 3 pendulums and 1 trap</td> <td>2016: 1 trap (Trap monster)</td> <td>2018: 1 link</td> </tr>  </table> <strong>New to Qliphorts? What they do</strong> <ul>  	<li>All of their pendulum effect monsters have the ability to normal summon themselves without tribute, but in doing so their level becomes 4 and their ATK 1800, this also happens when they are special/pendulum summoned. They are also all unaffected by the activated effects of monsters with a lower level or rank than their own.</li>  	<li> However, you want to save your normal summon to properly tribute summon them so they get their original levels and therefore increase their immunity, they will also get their unique effects, some from being tributed using Qli monsters, others for being tributed. You can facilitate tribute summons by pendulum summoning or getting an extra normal summon via <a data-name=""Laser Qlip"">Laser Qlip</a>.</li>  	<li>Their boss monsters, the Apoqliphorts, can only be tribute summoned, and they need 3 Qlis as tributes. Their immunity goes beyond their high level, as they are also unaffected by spells and traps.</li> </ul> <strong>The strategy...</strong> <ul>  	<li>To stun: As if Qlis weren't weak enough to backrow hate... Modern iterations of the deck run counter traps and floodgates in the form of traps such as <a data-name=""Summon Limit"">Summon Limit</a> and sometimes even monsters as well like <a data-name=""Vanity's Ruler"">Vanity's Ruler</a> as it doesn't hurt it's playstyle too much and keeps their arch nemesis (Links) at bay.</li>  	<li>To beatdown (And stun at the same time): continuing with the trap line up, <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> and <a data-name=""Re-Qliate"">Re-Qliate</a> (Which can be searched by <a data-name=""Qliphort Scout"">Scout</a> so you only need to run one) are able to hurt the opponent and let Qlis go into the good ol' Skill Drain Beatdown mode, getting their original ATK values ready for combat. Another great and classic tool for beatdown this deck has access to is <a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a> which can close out games fast.</li>  	<li> Ol' reliable Towers: I know that <a data-name=""Apoqliphort Towers"">Towers</a> isn't as strong as it once was, but I'm the type of player that always wants to build up towards a certain board or boss, so the simple path of pay 800 LP with Scout to search out <a data-name=""Qlife's End"">Qlife's End</a>, pay 800 more next turn to get Towers (Or <a data-name=""Apoqliphort Skybase"">Skybase</a> if I sided it in in order to avoid my opponent building up their grave with Towers' effect) and summon said Towers with the Qlife's End I set last turn is a path I'm glad to take most of the time.</li> </ul> <strong>Some techs not every Qliphort list runs...</strong> <ul>  	<li>Limiter Removal: Those that take the more stun route tend to avoid this card but as I said earlier I like it for giving more ways to do beatdown.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Performapal Trampolynx"">Performapal Trampolynx</a>: Allows you to get 2 searches with Scout's soft once per turn effect, also it feels good to play this one because I avoid playing more copies of <a data-name=""Qliphort Monolith"">Monolith</a> and <a data-name=""Qliphort Stealth"">Stealth</a> just because they have a scale of 1, as Trampolynx has a scale of 4 which is still perfectly fine for Qlis.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Ballista Squad"">Ballista Squad</a>: Make your opponent extend and then punish them by combining this with <a data-name=""Qliphort Carrier"">Carrier</a> or <a data-name=""Qliphort Helix"">Helix</a> in order to make you go even in card advantage while interrupting them, as both of the Qlis I just mentioned don't have their effects restricted to being tributed for a tribute summon.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Machina Metalcruncher"">Machina Metalcruncher</a>: At the cost of your normal summon you can get your hands on Scout if really needed and a body that benefits from the same Skill Drain effects as the rest of your monster line up.</li> </ul> <strong>Final considerations...</strong>  Those techs aren't some magic hidden combo I came up with that nobody else found yet, you can take them out if you don't like them. Also, staples like Ash and Pot can easily go up to 3 if that makes you more comfortable. Lastly, the side and extra deck (With the exception of Genius) are up to the particular player, obviously you need a big extra deck to fuel <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a> or <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Extravagance</a> if you decide to run them, but you can play anything, some good generic rank 4s and Link2/3s will do, it doesn't matter that much cause you will be locked to only special summoning Qlis most of the time. Okay so hear me out, how about a 3000 ATK Link 2 that requires not 2 Qliphorts but 2 Apoqliphorts and is inmune to everything Links included to give Qlis a somewhat fair boss monster to build up to? No?! No? Okay then, bye and thanks for your time."

Tested with much of old meta deck e work great, for example won easy vs Dark Magician, Blue-Eyes, Blue-Eyes Ritual, won very easy vs no meta ex.. Dragunity, Mathmech.  Can fight and win vs ABC, Altergeist, fight much vs Dogmatika and can won but is hard vs Dragun of Red-Eyes pure deck.  Despia don't have much cards for now, but the 90% of despia cards are very good cards, this deck is hard to use because all the cards have 2 o 3 effect, don't is easy remember all effects, but is linear how to use, if u play the 1st times with a program, this will help you how to play and remember the effects.  A good power up for this deck is the fusion ""The first Darklord"", for example if u fusion this card with ""Dramaturgia of Despia"", ""Dark Honest"" and another card, u will have summoned also ""Dramaturgia of Despia"" for this effect, after effect of ""The first Darklord"" for summon ""Dark Honest"", effect of ""Dark Honest"" and this card came back in hand, and much other.. have much combo this deck.  This deck have much 8 stars cards, so, when u can summon for FTK attack ""Number 97: Draglubion"", effect and summon ""Number 100: Numerion Dragon"", effect and win, or summon ""Number 38.."" for protect from 1st magic opponenet effect ect..  Don't forget the very good fusion cards ""Masquarade, the Grimsongleam Dragon"" beause is -600 lp for every opponet card and auto reborn when u want and the fusion ""Despia Quaretis"" make opponent monsters to 0 ATK and add or special summon a card..  Vs much decks is the combo ""Fusion Deployment"" for summon ""Fallen of Albaz"" and fusion summon with 1 opponent monster and 2x of ""Super Polymerization"" for fusion summon with opponents monster (simila Dogmatika style).  My note is that very better to have 3x of ""Effect veiler"" and don't use 3x of ""Despian Comedy"" because the ""Effect Veiler"" work always, 2nd in light and u can fusion summon with it.  With this cards, some times you can fusion summon also ""Mudragon of the swamp"" for change the attribute of all the cards and continue summon or in dark if u have ""Dark Honest"" in hand.  3x of royal decree is very important vs decks how ""Dark Magician"", Altergheist etc.. and is also a good card for send in GY with the others effect.  The card ""Albion the shrouded Dragon"" is a very good card for +1 in hand or special summon if u need of 8 stars in field.  I hope you will like, for me is good deck this, yes need of fix.. for extra deck of sure, but tested much and i have used 1 time only the extra deck vs the 2nd game vs Dragun of Red-Eyes deck and i won (with fortune) 2-1, for the others games, never used the extra deck.."

Amen to that. Cards like Firewall Dragon, Crystron Halqifibrax, Borreload Savage dragon and Dragoon are destroying the game. Decks are supposed to be build on chemistry, not just putting some additional cards in the deck to make same, slightly worse combos than top tier decks.  With last thought i build my own version of more or less pure agent fairy deck. This deck performs better than i expected, you have your hand traps in heralds, sauravis(which you get off of herald of the arc light) and called by the grave. It is pretty consistent, even if the hand looks 'bricking awesome' you can end on celestial nightlord parsath and krystia :)  By any means you always try to trigger the effect of Venus.  This can be done:  -summon earth, search venus, activate neptune --&gt; summon venus , activate effect ---&gt; shine balls --&gt; moon --&gt; majesty hyperion to the grave --&gt; banish neptune to summon majesty hyperion --&gt; THIS IS HOW YOU GET SANCTUARY TO THE HAND.  -summon Master flare hyperion and sent venus to the grave --&gt; do what you can  NEVER use 'the sacred water in the sky' for activating sanctuary, always bring missing agent to the hand. for sanctuary search  you have neptune  Most of the time you end your turn (and im not kiddig) with: celestial knightlord parshath, kristya, herald of the arc light, majesty hyperion  Sometimes, this means if you have master hyperion in your openning hand or somehow manage to summon any other level 8 monster during your plays, before you summon kristya, you summon it and make number 38: hope..  --&gt; than they cant attack you herald of the arc light and you have 1 more negate.  And sometimes you will just end on something less, but i feel very good about this deck.  &nbsp;  ps. dont mind the side deck, i don't use one because i never play tournaments"

Actually let me start by saying this is NOT my current build! In fact, you can hardly call this a build of any kind. Now that that's out of the way, here why I'm uploading this now:</span> <ol>  	<li><span>This was one of my earliest deckbuilds and it was horrid. I wanted to spam out Water monsters as much as I could, wanting to end on Moulinglacia, Toadally Awesome and Bubble Reef all at the same time. This is more of an ode to my journey as a duelist, taking a trip down memory lane to one of the first decks I brought to locals. Fun fact I won against Striker with this abomination. To 95% it was because my opponent summoned their almost 9k ATK Nibiru in ATK position for me but a win's a win. That was the only match this deck has ever won. So here I am, wanting to share this with y'all.</span></li>  	<li><span>I'm hungry. Like, really hungry. I'm the last one still in the office, there's nothing to do and my shift doesn't end for another hour. So I'm trying make time pass by writing this guide (on how not to build a deck) and drown out the sound of my growling stomach by hitting the keyboard as hard as I can.</span></li> </ol> <span>Let's break this down step by step, shall we?</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The Main Deck:</span>  I'm glad I only played two Moulinglacia, that way I didn't draw that card as much as I could've, which is good since handlooping is the quickest way to lose a friend or two. I gotta say, my Marincess ratios weren't as bad as I thought. I no longer played Snow and while I'm still on the fence on 3 Pascalus, I at least played both Blue Tang and Sea Horse at three, proving I at least had the mental capacity of 15 year old. I don't know why I played only one Battle Ocean, not because it's wrong but because I don't think I knew it was right.  My secret tech, the spicy flavor I was so proud of was my singular Fishborg Launcher. I had 9 cards to discard the card, which I would then summon back from the GY by milling the top card. I had to mill a Water monser but that shouldn't have been a problem, right. Right? Wrong! I dunno why but all I remember is milling spells for days with this card.  Besides that I just played a few extenders which to be fair wouldn't be bad and at least I should've consistently ended on the Marincess Link bosses but you my friend are forgetting one thing. You play how you build. If your deckbuilding' crap chances are you play like it, too. So take it from the guy who thought Almiraj into Secure Gardna in a non-Invoked deck was a good alternative board to end on since he saw someone ending like that in a video once (non voluntarily of course), I sucked, hard.  &nbsp;  <span>The Extra Deck:</span>  I was surprised about this one. The ratio's aren't perfect and there's a lot I would change nowadays but for starter, that looks way better than what I was expecting. There's really not much else to say, it's a bad, yet functioning Extra Deck.  &nbsp;  <span>The Side Deck:</span>  What's frustrating me the most is that this deck could've been genuienly decent had I swapped half of my side deck for my main deck. Seven handtraps, backrow removal and two solemns would've been much better than Abyssteus into Abysspyke by going minus 2 (Unless of course I drew the Fishborg Launcher, in which case it was a minus 2 plus I got to mill a spell). Dogoran was the only Kaiju I had available and it wasn't for another year that I got myself my third and final Ash Blossom.  &nbsp;  <span>The teaching moment:</span>  So what's to take from this? Originally I was thinking something along the lines of not buying cards without proper playtesting but honestly, you can't expect people to get it from the start. Maybe all these tech cards were 20 euros down the drain but I tried my best and improved over time. Instead here's what I think I learned: Listen to others. Don't take everything at face value but I after my opponent stomped my 0-2 with Invoked Mekk-Knights he looked over my cards and told me to cut a bunch of stuff. Back then I thought he didn't know what he was talking about, after all, all these Water monsters would get my to Toad and Bubble Reef and Moulinglacia! But in retrospect, he was right. So instead of telling him that these cards served a purpose I could ask him why he was thinking I shouldn't play them. Again, it's okay to be of a different opinion but then be open, start a (healthy) discussion and genuinely listen. Maybe I would've realised the deck wasn't good this was, probably not but after playing this game for a longer time I really came around to appreciate the different takes people have on decks. Whether that's slapping Five-Headed Link Dragon into your Dragonmaid deck as a lot of decks struggle to out it, playing Flame Bufferlo instead of Lady Debug in Salamangreats (not that that's much of a controversy anymore) or playing Lyriluscs pure with a Nervall even thought people may consider it just bad Bird Up.  In the end, the diversity is what pushes new ideas forwards, inspires deckbuilding and promoted discussion. There's something awesome about people trying out things differently, trying to make a deck their own. These changes can be small and seem insignificant or change the deck's playing style altogether. Originally I thought about making a three part upload for three different Marincess decks. One focused on the r4nk engine, one about handtraps and one about traps but then I scraped the idea as I wasn't happy with how the decks turned out when build solely focused on a single aspect. However, the reason I wanted to do this was to show how different the same deck can be, how an archetype can be interpreted in so many different ways, suited to a person's own liking. So if there's anything to take away from this deck profile (please let it not be the deck) it's that I believe deckbuilding is non-linear and that we can all learn from each other.  Well, I'm off in three minutes and the rain has cleared and the hunger has persisted so I'll end it here and wish y'all the best."

You are equipped with santa claws' to have a very handy kaiju like effect and the combination of negates such as dark bribes and recalls alongside the battle faders should keep you alive to the point where appropriate can be activated. After using appropriate's effect once after activation the rest is cake. Players should note, not all draw cards can activate appropriate's effect like dark world dealing and upstart goblin, the most common method to activate it would be with the dark bribes and such as well as book of eclipse and most other draw cards in the deck. Once the engine is running, keep an eye out on your deck as you are just as likely to deck out if you do not destroy the appropriate with the MST or use pot of avarice to refill the deck. While you are making your opponent burn through cards, the shaddol engine should easily be able to floodgate monsters or focus attacks if you ever happen to be low on draw power. This deck can be slow at first, but appropriate is so powerful that just a couple uses of it and you will be unstoppable!"

I dare you.,"Good day everyone. For this version of the <strong>Triple Structure Deck Challenge</strong>, is the turn on the bat for the <strong>Cyber Style’s Successor Structure Deck</strong>, one of the upcoming structure decks. Due to some of the cards still not available (and recently having a product delay), there’s a small change some of the cards featured here won’t appear on the website. At the end of the typical wall of text I’ll place the decklist and card ratios.  With that said, the rules are the same as always: A 40-card Main Deck where 30+ cards must form part of the selected Structure Deck. The Extra Deck is free to edit. With that said, let’s begin.  <strong> </strong>  <strong>Archetype analysis</strong>  This Structure Deck is designed in order to feature both archetypes played in the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX anime by Zane Truesdale (also known as Hell Kaiser) by implementing a combination of the <strong>Cyber/Cyber Dragon </strong>archetype with the <strong>Cyberdark</strong> archetype.  <strong>Cyber/Cyber Dragons</strong>  The first archetype, <strong>Cyber/Cyber Dragons</strong>, consists of two main things: constant Special Summoning and searching of LIGHT/DARK Machine and Dragon monsters and pure damage output. Almost all of the archetype is added to the Structure Deck, however I’ll only list, with an asterisk, which new cards were played and why, as well as how many copies of it:  <strong>*Attachment Cybern</strong>: Part of the new support, is a Level 3 LIGHT Dragon monster that can equip itself to a Dragon or Machine “Cyber” monster and grant it 600 ATK while equipped. If it is sent to the GY while equipped to a monster, it can Special Summon any other Machine or Dragon “Cyber” monster from the GY. It can be equipped from the hand or targeted by the Cyberdark monsters when they are summoned, making them 3000 Attackers. You could try running more than 1, but for the sake of making a 40-card Deck, I played only one.  <strong>**Cybernetic Horizon</strong>: This Spell card is both a “Cyber” and “Cyberdark” Spell card, so it can be searched by Core or Claw. You can send 2 Dragon/Machine “Cyber” monsters with different attributes (they have a lot of attributes since it works with any “Cyber” monster that is a Dragon or Machine, but most of the time it will be a LIGHT and a DARK), 1 from the hand and 1 from the Deck; add 1 Dragon/Machine “Cyber” monster from your Deck to the hand, if you do, send 1 Machine “Cyber” Fusion monster from the Extra Deck to the GY. Also, you’re locked to only Machine monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn. The Extra Deck mill effect is in order to turbo one of the materials for the Fusion Summon of their new boss monster, or just send a target for <strong>Cyberdarkness Dragon</strong> to pick-up and then be tributed for the new boss monster. Did I mention is also a search card and GY setup for both archetypes? Run 2 or 3.  <strong>*Eternal Cyber</strong>: Is a Quick-Play Spell card that targets 1 Machine “Cyber” Fusion monster in the GY and either Special Summons it or returns it to the Extra Deck. It can also banish itself from the GY to protect a Machine “Cyber” Fusion monster to be destroyed once. Is overall good protection and reviving, only limited by their conditions to be activated.  <strong>Cyberdark</strong>  Now let’s talk of the second archetype, <strong>Cyberdark</strong>, which received a bit more love with the new support. Cyberdark consists of DARK Level 3 Dragons and Level 4 Machine monsters. The Level 3 Dragon monsters, <strong>Cyberdark Cannon</strong> and <strong>Cyberdark Claw</strong> both have three effects: one by discarding it, another while being equipped to a monster and a third one when they are sent to the GY while equipped to a monster.  <strong>Cyberdark Cannon:</strong>  Discard: Add 1 Machine “Cyberdark” monster from the Deck to the hand.  As an equip: During damage calculation, if the equipped monster battles: send 1 monster from the Deck to the GY.  Sent to the GY as an equip: Draw 1 card.  <strong>Cyberdark Claw:</strong>  Discard: Add 1 “Cyberdark” Spell/Trap from the Deck to the hand.  As an equip: During damage calculation, if the equipped monster battles: send 1 monster from the Extra Deck to the GY.  Sent to the GY as an equip: Target a “Cyberdark” monster in your GY and add it to your hand.  The Level 4 Machines, <strong>Cyberdark Horn</strong>, <strong>Cyberdark Keel</strong> and <strong>Cyberdark Edge</strong> share the same 2 effects: if they are Normal Summoned, they can target 1 Level 3 or lower Dragon monster in your GY and equip it to gain ATK equal to its original ATK. Also, they can destroy the equipped monster instead of themselves. Each one of the have a unique effect: Horn deals piercing damage, Keel burns for 300 damage if it destroys a monster in battle and Edge can attack directly, but any damage dealt by the attack is halved.  They had only two Spell cards: <strong>Cyberdark Impact!,</strong> a Spell card that allows the Fusion of <strong>Cyberdark Dragon</strong>, one of their Fusion monsters, by shuffling Horn, Keel &amp; Edge from the hand, field and/or GY into the Deck. Their other Spell card, and is honestly kinda good, is <strong>Cyberdark Inferno</strong>. Is a Field Spell that makes your opponent unable to target or destroy with effects “Cyberdark” monsters you control that have a monster equipped. You can target 1 “Cyberdark” monster on the field and return it to the hand to immediately Normal Summon 1 “Cyberdark” monster. At last, if it is destroyed by the opponent: you can add 1 “<strong>Polymerization</strong>” or 1 “Fusion” Spell card from the Deck to the hand.  They have 2 Fusion monsters: <strong>Cyberdark Dragon</strong>, that uses the Horn, Edge &amp; Keel as materials. If it is Special Summoned, it can equip 1 Dragon monster from your GY to it and it gains ATK equal to its original ATK. It also gains 100 ATK for each monster in your GY and if it were destoyed by battle, it can destoy the equipped monster instead. The bigger one is <strong>Cyberdarkness Dragon</strong>, that requires any 5 “Cyberdark” monsters. If it is Special Summon, it can equip 1 Dragon or Machine monster to the GY on it and it gains ATK equal to its original ATK. When your opponent activates a card or effect, as a Quick Effect, it can send 1 card equipped to it to negate the activation and destroy that card.  As for the new support, we have:  <strong>***Cyberdark Chimera: </strong>Is a Level 4 Machine with 800 ATK/2100 DEF (this will be important later). It has 3 effects: You can discard 1 Spell/Trap; add 1 “<strong>Power Bond</strong>” from your Deck to your hand but you’re locked into Dragon or Machine “Cyber” monsters for the rest of the turn. If you activated the first effect this turn, the next Fusion Summon you do can also use materials from the GY by banishing the materials. If it is sent to the GY, by any means, send 1 “Cyberdark” monster from the Deck to the GY with a different name of the current “Cyberdark” monsters there. Since is a Level 4 Machine, it can be searched by Cannon; its 2100 DEF can make it summonable by <strong>Cyber Dragon Nachster</strong>, in which Nachster can easily trigger both effects; and can search “<strong>Power Bond</strong>” and temporally make it a “<strong>Overload Fusion</strong>”, while preparing the GY for said Fusion Summon. Running 3 is pretty good.  <strong>**Cyberdark World: </strong>Is a Continuous Spell card that adds 1 “Cyberdark” monster from the Deck to the hand when activated, but with different name with the “Cyberdark” monsters in the GY. It also gives “Cyberdark” monsters an additional Normal Summon and they can equip monsters from the opponent’s GY if they are appropriate for the effect. It’s honestly good for pure-ish Cyberdarks, but in this case it can help to search Cannon and use Cannon’s effect to search Chimera.  <strong>**Cyberdark Invasion: </strong>Is a Continuous Trap card that can activate 1 of 2 effects: you can target 1 “Cyberdark” monster you control and equip it 1 Dragon or Machine monster from either GY that gives 1000 ATK to it; OR you can send 1 Equip Card you control equipped to a Machine monster to the GY and destroy 1 card your opponent controls, without targeting. Is pretty good in a pure Cyberdark build and it has it uses when combined with <strong>Attachment Cybern</strong> (1600 ATK boost), Cannon or Claw for milling, <strong>Leng Ling</strong> for double attacking or just stealing a monster from your opponent’s GY.  <strong>**Cyberdark End Dragon: </strong>But is now time to talk about the big boss, the great kahuna, their newest boss monster <strong>Cyberdark End Dragon</strong>. Is a massive Level 12 DARK Machine Fusion monster with 5000 ATK/3800 DEF that can be summoned by 2 ways: Fuse <strong>Cyberdark Dragon</strong> and <strong>Cyber End Dragon</strong> OR Tribute 1 Level 10 or lower “Cyberdark” Fusion monster that is equipped with “<strong>Cyber End Dragon</strong>”. It’s unaffected by your opponent activated effects. It can equip 1 monster from either GY to itself; and if he is equipped with an Equip Card, it can declare attacks equal to the number of Equip Cards equipped in it. Is large, surprisingly easy to summon with some combos and unless your opponent summons something as big or more, he might not be able to remove it off the field, maybe a Kaiju though.  <strong> </strong>  <strong>Extra Deck &amp; Side Deck</strong>  In the Extra Deck, not only it features the monsters listed here, I mostly filled it with more Cyber Dragon related monsters to play, those being: <strong>Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</strong>, <strong>Cyber Twin Dragon</strong>, <strong>Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</strong>, <strong>Cyber Dragon Nova</strong>, <strong>Cyber Dragon Infinity</strong> &amp; <strong>Cyber Dragon Sieger</strong>. I also added one <strong>Predaplant Verte Anaconda</strong> to activate either <strong>Overload Fusion</strong> or <strong>Cyberload Fusion</strong> from the deck.  In the Side Deck, I added cards that will definitely be the reason people will actually by this deck, if the recipe remains the same once it goes overseas. Those being <strong>Lightning Storm, Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju </strong>and<strong> Infinite Impermanence</strong>.  <strong> </strong>  <strong>Tips</strong>  And here go some tips to boost this deck:  <strong>Dogmatika package</strong>: 3 copies of <strong>Nadir Servant</strong> and <strong>Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</strong> and 1 copy of <strong>Dogmatika Maximus</strong> can help in thinning your Extra Deck and setting up the materials for <strong>Overload Fusion</strong> or a Chimera-boosted Fusion Summon with <strong>Power Bond</strong>; although you must wait a few turns due to Dogmatika’s restrictions.  <strong>Chaos monsters</strong>: <strong>Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning</strong>, <strong>Chaos Valkyria</strong> and <strong>The Chaos Creator</strong> are good monsters to play with since this deck runs mostly LIGHT and DARK monsters and banishing them can be improve the usage of <strong>Cyberload Fusion</strong>.  And that should be it. The Main Deck for this version of the challenge is 100% cards from the Structure Deck, while the only extra additions where on the Extra and Side Deck. It is strong and pretty consistent whether you play pure Cyber Dragons, pure Cyberdarks (it’s finally possible thanks to this support) or mixing both; so if you want to start playing Yu-Gi-Oh! with a rather strong Deck, I recommend trying this one.  The next recipe, uploaded later today or tomorrow (this time I will deliver, deck is on final stages of testing and script is almost ready), will be about the Lost Sanctuary Structure Deck, which was just fully announced a few days ago. As always, thanks for reading this wall of text.  &nbsp;  <strong>Decklist</strong>  <strong>Monsters (22):</strong>  3x Cyber Dragon  3x Cyberdark Chimera  1x Cyberdark Keel  1x Cyberdark Horn  1x Cyberdark Edge  2x Cyberdark Cannon  1x Attachment Cybern  3x Cyberdark Cannon  3x Cyber Dragon Core  3x Cyber Dragon Nachster  1x Cyber Dragon Herz  &nbsp;  <strong>Spells (16):</strong>  2x Overload Fusion  2x Power Bond  3x Cyber Emergency  3x Cybernetic Horizon  1x Cyberdark Impact!  1x Eternal Cyber  1x Cyberload Fusion  2x Cyberdark World  1x Cyberdark Inferno  &nbsp;  <strong>Traps (2):</strong>  2x Cyberdark Invasion  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck (15):</strong>  2x Cyberdark End Dragon  2x Cyber End Dragon  1x Cyberdarkness Dragon  1x Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon  1x Chimeratech Overdragon  1x Cyber Twin Dragon  2x Cyberdark Dragon  1x Chimeratech Rampage Dragon  1x Cyber Dragon Nova  1x Cyber Dragon Infinity  1x Cyber Dragon Sieger  1x Predaplant Verte Anaconda  &nbsp;  <strong>Side Deck (15):</strong>  2x Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju  1x Leng Ling  1x Cyber Eternity Dragon  3x Lightning Storm  2x Limiter Removal  3x Infinite Impermanence  2x Cybernetic Overflow  1x Cyber Network"

This decklist is pretty much the deck that I'm using and find success with at the time.  Ok let's start with the basic combo:  Hand: Alpha, Zeta and Delta.  Combo:  SS Alpha tributing Zeta.  Add Benten through Alpha's eff.  Tribute Benten to summon Zeta.  Zeta eff to add Meteonis Drytron.  Benten eff to add Manju (cause he is a fairy for some reason).  NS Manju and use eff to add Phul.  XYZ both Alpha and Zeta to XYZS Mu-Beta and use eff to send Gamma from deck to GY.  Use Meteonis Dryton to RS Phul, removing 1 meterial from Mu-Beta in the proccess.  Phul eff to get Benten from GY, to make Phul's LVL to go to 6.  Use Phul's eff to tribute Benten to RS from deck Ophiel.  Eff Benten (cause she was tributed) to add Idaten from deck.  Eff Ophiel to add either Bethor or Och from deck (depends on the rest of your hand).  Eff Ophiel to RS Idaten, tributing Ophiel and Manju.  Eff Idaten to add Meteonis Drytron from GY.  XYZ the LVL 6 Phul and the Idaten to XYZS Ptolemy (trust me here).  Detach a meterial to activate eff of Ptolemy to add Benten from GY (detach Idaten here).  Eff Gamma tribute Benten to summon.  Eff Gamma to SS a Drytron from GY.  Eff Benten to add Herald of Ultimateness.  Activate Meteonis Drytron to remove the 2nd meterial form Mu-Beta to RS Idaten.  You get back Meteonis Drytron from Idaten eff.  XYZS a random rank 1 monster (I'm using Lyrilusc-Recital Starling cause I'm broke).  Activate Meteonis Drytron to RS Benten from GY using Delta from hand as meterial.  Activate Benten to add Eva from deck.  Activate Delta to draw a card (reaviling a ritual monster).  Eff Meteonis Drytron from GY to reduce Mu-Beta's attack to add back the Meteonis Drytron from GY.  XYZS Utopic Future using the random RANK1 and Mu-Beta.  Activate Meteonis Drytron to RS Herald of Ultimateness.  And that's the basic combo of this deck. Next turn you can just loop Idaten to make Herald have 6K attack and RS Bethor to boardwipe your opponent's field. And the way to do this is :  Tribute Idaten from field (or Bethor from hand) to SS Gamma (if he is a meterial of Utopic Future just LS a link2) and this triggers Idaten's 2nd eff to boost all rituals by 1K  Then reduce a Drytron's attack by 1K to add Meteonis Drytron.  Then loop the Idaten another 3 times.  And in the end just RS Bethor to boardwipe.  You have enough DMG to win at this point.  That's the only combo that isn't played in a normal Drytron and it's pretty fun."

Rules of the challenge are the same as always: The Main Deck must be a 40-card Deck that uses at least 30+ cards that belong to the Structure Deck card list, with free control over the design of the Extra Deck.  &nbsp;  <strong>Archetype analysis</strong>  Despite technically covering two archetypes in this Structure Deck, similarly to the Cyber Style Deck, the main focus of the deck is around the “<strong>The Agent</strong>” archetype.  “<strong>The Agent</strong>” archetype consists of LIGHT and DARK Fairy monsters that most of them have either an additional effect or one of their effects is “boosted” when “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” is face-up on the field.  Before talking about Agents, let’s quickly talk about the Sanctuary. <strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong> is a rather old Field Spell card which only effect is to reduce to 0 any battle damage taken to the controller of a Fairy monster. In other words, if either you control a Fairy monster and it battles, you take no damage from that battle. Same goes for your opponent since this card benefits both. Many cards were released over the passage of time that revolved around playing it, for example having an omni-negate that only worked while that card was face-up (<strong>Divine Punishment</strong>) and a specific searcher (<strong>Zeradias, Herald of Heaven</strong>). Eventually, and including its new support, more cards where added that would treat themselves as “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” while face-up and brought additional and more useful effects; but it has proven to is still useful to run it at 3 alongside the alternatives.  Now we move to talk about the Agents. Since one of their themes is to represent the solar system, I’ll describe both current and new Agent monsters in order of the planets; but I’ll start with the Sun due to obvious reasons:  <strong>**Master Hyperion</strong> (The Sun): Before the new support from this Deck, <strong>Master Hyperion</strong> was the boss monster for the “The Agent” archetype, and a very memorable one if you happened to play some of the Yu-Gi-Oh! videogames and dueled against Kotori Mizuki/Tori Meadows. Is a Level 8 LIGHT Fairy with 2700 ATK/ 2100 DEF that can also be Special Summoned from the hand by banishing 1 “<strong>The Agent</strong>” monster in the hand, field or GY. It can banish 1 Fairy monster in your GY to target and destroy 1 card on the field. If “Sanctuary” is on the field, this effect can be used twice. Very handy removal, easy Special Summon, is a large body, multiple copies can be summoned and its effect is a soft once-per-turn, so it can be reused if your GY can pay the cost. A very good card in my opinion.  <strong>*Majesty Hyperion (new support):</strong> This is one of the new monsters added that, in my opinion due to its artwork, I think it represents a Solar Eclipse, idk. Is quite literally a counterpart to <strong>Master Hyperion</strong>, being DARK instead of LIGHT, its stats are flipped (2100 ATK/ 2700 DEF) and his effect being banishing 1 card from either player’s GY instead of destroying 1 card on the field. However, they share the condition that if “Sanctuary” is up, this effect can be used twice per turn. His unique thing is that in comparison to <strong>Master Hyperion</strong>, this one can also be Special Summoned from the GY with the same condition and his banish effect also works when “Sanctuary” is in the GY. That’s why I only run 1, since it can keep bringing himself back a lot of times.  <strong>The Agent of Wisdom – Mercury</strong>: Is a Level 4 LIGHT Fairy that during your Standby Phase, if you controlled this face-up card and had no cards in your hand at the end of the opponent’s last End Phase: Draw 1 card. Do I need to elaborate why this card is very slow to play and it isn’t played at all? Moving on.  <strong>***The Agent of Creation – Venus</strong>: This one is a card that had a lot of history in the game. Is a Level 3 LIGHT Fairy that, not once per turn, you can pay 500 LP to Special Summon 1 “<strong>Mystical Shine Ball</strong>” (a Level 2 LIGHT Fairy Normal monster with 500 ATK/DEF) from your hand or Deck. She and Mercury are the only card in this archetype that doesn’t have an interaction with “Sanctuary”, however that never stopped Venus from being played due to her good effect. While at first her effect looks underwhelming back in the day even through the monsters could be used as Ritual or Tribute Fodder, it was during the Synchro and Xyz era that Venus started to show its true potential, especially if paired with <strong>Archlord Kristya</strong>. During the Link era, however, this effect is really strong; as getting literally free link materials for just 500 LP is something some meta decks would die for, and this Deck has good targets for it. Definitely run her.  <strong>***The Agent of Mystery – Earth</strong>: Is a Level 2 LIGHT Fairy Tuner monster that when Normal Summoned, you can add 1 “The Agent” monster from the Deck to the hand. If “Sanctuary” is live, you can add 1 “<strong>Master Hyperion</strong>” instead. You run 3 of him due to being your main searcher and has a good level for a Tuner, even though he isn’t the main Tuner of the Deck. Also, the new support can directly search it.  <strong>**Guard of the Agents – Moon (new support)</strong>: This is the new support I just talked about. Is a Link-2 LIGHT Fairy with 1800 ATK, requires 2 Fairy monsters and points right and bottom-right. If it is Link Summoned, you can send 1 “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” or 1 card that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” in its text from the Deck to the GY. If “Sanctuary” is up, you can add 1 “<strong>The Agent of Mystery - Earth</strong>” from the Deck or GY to the hand instead. Also, you can Tribute 1 Fairy monster to target and destroy 1 card your opponent controls. Is a pretty good monster, it can be turbo-ed with a single Venus, offers a bit of removal and its generic. Run it.  <strong>*The Agent of Force – Mars</strong>: This one is funny. Is a Level 3 LIGHT Fairy with 0 ATK/DEF. If “Sanctuary” is up, and your LP is higher than your opponents, it gains ATK/DEF equal to the LP difference. This one has some OTK decks built around it, but the main reason its run at 1 is because the new boss monster can copy his effects.  <strong>**The Agent of Miracles – Jupiter</strong>: He has 2 soft once-per-turn effects. His normal effect allows him to banish 1 “The Agent” monster in the GY to target 1 face-up LIGHT Fairy monster you control and give it an 800 ATK boost. If “Sanctuary” is up, you can discard 1 Fairy monster to select one of your banished LIGHT Fairy monsters and Special Summon it. It has a pretty good recovery effect, giving that this archetype loves to banish their monsters and the ATK boost can sometimes help to run over some big targets; and as the same case with Mars, his effects can be copied to build more field presence.  <strong>The Agent of Judgement – Saturn:</strong> Is a Level 6 LIGHT Fairy monster which effect only works if “Sanctuary” is live. If your LP are higher than your opponents, you can tribute it to inflict damage equal to the difference; but you cannot conduct your Battle Phase that turn to activate it. While kind of unreliable, the new boss monster can copy its effect and maybe do that last bit of damage to end the duel, but the fact that it stops your Battle Phase means you have to use it in a turn you didn’t attacked. Not the “Cowboy for game” you expected.  <strong>**The Agent of Entropy – Uranus:</strong> This is actually the main Tuner of the Deck. Is a Level 5 DARK Fairy that can Special Summon itself from the hand is “Sanctuary” is up. Once per turn, it can send 1 “The Agent” monster from the Deck to the GY to copy its level. Is a free level-changing Tuner monster if “Sanctuary” is up and can setup the GY for more plays, while preparing itself for Synchro plays. Running 2 is fine since you could brick if you don’t open with “Sanctuary”.  <strong>***The Agent of Life – Neptune (new support):</strong> This is new support, meaning it has some good and kinda bloated effects to benefit the archetype it belongs. Is a Level 1 LIGHT Fairy with 0 ATK/600 DEF. You can discard it to Special Summon 1 “The Agent” monster from the hand or GY, OR 1 “Hyperion” monster if “Sanctuary” is up or in the GY and that monster can’t be tributed until the end of the opponent’s next turn. If it is banished, by any means, you can add 1 “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” from the Deck to the hand. Its effect can cheat out your monsters, it searches your homeland while doing regular plays with Agents and it can be searched by Cupid Pitch’s GY effect, as well as many cards added to this Deck. Running 3 is very optimal.  <strong>**The Executor of Hades – Pluto (new support)</strong>: Another new monster, this being a generic Level 5 DARK Fairy Synchro Tuner monster with 2300 ATK/0 DEF. It can banish 1 monster (anyone) from your GY to target 1 Effect monster on the field and flip it to face-down Defense Position. If “Sanctuary” is on the field or GY, this becomes a Quick Effect. Also, you can banish this card from the GY to add 1 “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” from the Deck or GY to the hand. Offers good disruption, and since it is a Synchro Tuner monster, it can be summoned during your opponent’s turn with <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax’s</strong> effect. It’s recommended to run it.  <strong>**Master Flare Hyperion (new support)</strong>: This is the new boss monster for the “The Agent” archetype, being a Level 10 LIGHT Fairy with 3200 ATK/2600 DEF that requires 1 Tuner and 1+ non-Tuner Fairy monsters. It can send 1 “The Agent” monster or one monster that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” in its name from your hand, Deck or Extra Deck to the GY to copy its name and effects for the rest of the turn. When your opponent activates a card or effect, as a Quick Effect, you can banish 1 Fairy monster from your field or GY to target 1 card on the field and banish it. It can copy very good effects since it also target monsters related to “Sanctuary” (<strong>Archlord Zerato</strong> and <strong>Neo-Parshath, the Sky Paladin</strong> are their best targets outside of Agents) and offers pretty good disruption, setup and presence when copying the right effects. A very fitting boss monster for this archetype.  Now, let’s talk about the new backrow:  <strong>***The Sacred Water of the Sky (new support):</strong> Is a Spell card that allows you to either activate 1 “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” directly from the Deck OR add 1 monster that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” in its text. If “Sanctuary” was up, you can also gain 500 LP for each “Hyperion” and “The Agent” monster you control. If a monster that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” in its text would be destroyed by battle, you can banish this card from the GY instead. Is a searcher for most of your archetype and your homeland, as well as healing your LP and protecting your monsters from battle destruction. Run 3 to boost consistency.  <strong>**Chorus in the Sky</strong>: This is a Spell Card that by paying 1000 LP you can target 1 Fairy monster in your GY and add it to the hand. If “Sanctuary” is live, you can also add 1 of your banished monsters that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” or 1 “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” that is banished. It offers a bit of recycling for the deck, due to the massive self-banishing it does. You can run 1 if you want, but 2 is also fine.  <strong>***Lost Sanctuary:</strong> Is a Continuous Trap card that when activated, you can set 1 Spell/Trap from the Deck that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” on its text; also, it is treated as “Sanctuary” while face-up on the field or in the GY. Lastly, you can banish 1 Fairy monster to target 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls and negate its effects for the rest of the turn. While a bit slow due to being a Trap, this is also a 3-of since is basically a backrow searcher and provides effect negation. And if you want to protect it somehow, <strong>The Sanctum of Parshath</strong> makes all Set Spells/Traps on the field undestructible and untargetable.  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck &amp; Side Deck</strong>  Besides the new Synchro monsters and Link monster, I added some cards that supports the Deck:  <strong>Synchro monsters</strong>: <strong>Angel of Zera</strong> is a Level 8 Synchro that can Special Summon itself during the Standby Phase if it was banished the turn before and it gains 100 ATK for each banished card of your opponents. I added for having a rather good beater that can be used as effect fodder without worries. <strong>Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</strong> is another Level 8 Synchro that on Synchro Summon excavates the top 5 cards of the Deck and add 1 excavated LIGHT or DARK monster, and the rest of the cards are milled. Also, it can bring itself back from the GY by banishing 1 LIGHT and 1 DARK monster from the hand or GY. Is a really good searcher, that also offers a large body and GY setup. <strong>Cupid Pitch</strong> is a Level 4 Synchro Tuner that when Synchro Summoned can increase or reduce its Level equal to the Level of the Tuner used for its Summon. Gains 400 ATK times its level. If it is used for a Synchro Summoned, it inflicts 100 damage times the Level of the summoned Synchro, and if you did, you can add 1 Level 8 or lower monster with 600 DEF from the Deck to your hand, which its only target in this deck is “Neptune”. Is kind of useful and it can also be brought with Halqifibrax’s effect.  <strong>Xyz Monsters:</strong> <strong>Sky Cavalry Centaurea</strong> is brought using the <strong>Mystical Shine Balls</strong> or “Earth”, and it’s mainly used to bring <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS – Sky Thunder</strong> and wipe the board. Since this deck runs a fair share of Level 8’s, I also added <strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong> for Spell negation and battle protection.  <strong>Link monsters:</strong> The Structure Deck also adds <strong>Celestial Knightlord Parshath</strong> to search 1 “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” or 1 card that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” from the Deck to the hand. Also, if another Fairy monster you control is sent to the GY, you can banish 1 Fairy monster from the GY to Special Summon another Fairy monster from the hand which Level is higher that the banished monster. <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax</strong> is added only to cheat out “Pluto” or <strong>Cupid Pitch</strong>.  As for the Side Deck, I mostly put cards that could aid the Deck: <strong>Archlord Zerato</strong> and <strong>Neo-Parshath, the Sky Paladin</strong> to give better targets to <strong>Master Flare Hyperion</strong>; <strong>Athena</strong>, <strong>Hecatrice</strong> and <strong>Vallhalla, Hall of the Fallen</strong> to Special Summon Fairy monsters; a set of Counter Trap cards to be recycled with <strong>The Sanctum of Parshath</strong> and <strong>Gren Maju Da Eiza</strong> to dealing the killing blow if the duels goes into late game.  &nbsp;  And that would be it for this decklist. For the next two entries, I decided to select one of the older Structure Decks and one of the more recent ones. And by doing so, the next entries for the Triple Structure Deck Challenge will be 2002’s <strong>Starter Deck: Kaiba</strong> and the <strong>Overlay Universe Structure Deck</strong>, which revolves around <strong>Number 39: Utopia</strong>. Until then, thanks for reading this wall of text; and I’ll leave the decklist down below if it doesn’t appear on the website.  &nbsp;  <strong>Main Deck:</strong>  <strong>Monsters (23):</strong>  3x Mystical Shine Ball  1x Archlord Kristya  2x Master Hyperion  1x Majesty Hyperion  2x The Agent of Entropy – Uranus  2x Zeradias, Herald of Heaven  2x The Agent of Miracles – Jupiter  3x The Agent of Creation – Venus  1x The Agent of Force – Mars  3x The Agent of Mystery – Earth  3x The Agent of Life – Neptune  &nbsp;  <strong>Spells (13):</strong>  1x Raigeki  1x Harpie’s Feather Duster  3x The Sacred Water of the Sky  1x Reasoning  2x Chorus in the Sky  2x The Sanctum of Parshath  3x The Sanctuary in the Sky  &nbsp;  <strong>Traps (4):</strong>  3x Lost Sanctuary  1x Divine Punishment  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck (15):</strong>  2x Master Flare Hyperion  1x Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon  1x Angel of Zera  2x The Executor of Hades – Pluto  1x Cupid Pitch  1x Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS – Sky Thunder  1x Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy  1x Sky Cavalry Centaurea  2x Celestial Knightlord Parshath  2x Guard of the Agents – Moon  1x Crystron Halqifibrax  &nbsp;  <strong>Side Deck (15):</strong>  1x Archlord Zerato  1x Athena  1x Neo-Parshath, the Sky Paladin  3x Hecatrice  1x Gren Maju Da Eiza  3x Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen  2x Solemn Judgment  2x Rebirth of Parshath  1x Divine Punishment"

Win rate is probably about 30% just owing to whether you get the few necessary cards to win.  &nbsp;  This deck has virtually no counter play capabilities in favor of trying to max out the chance of doing the FTK, so if the opponent goes first and manages to throw a couple of monsters out, you're probably already done for. You can try throwing in some lightning storms if you want to counteract this; just be careful not to brick yourself with too many counters.  &nbsp;  The side deck is just full of random cards that didn't make the cut in my mind, though tri-wight has high potential, just doesn't come out consistently.  &nbsp;  For those unaware, the FTK is to send a bunch of spell cards to the graveyard. Use Shien's Spy to give your opponent True Exodia. Then use Treasure Panda to bring out the 4 pieces of exodia in the deck and a link-2 monster. Use Treasue Panda and the Link-2 to make Knightmare Unicorn, then use it's effect on itself. And with that, you win via the effect of True Exodia. Sounds simple, but is really just pure RNG."

Their art is unique, and they've got some powerful mechanics to play around with. Unfortunately, unlike Subterror or Krawler World Legacy, they've never been good enough to see widespread play. Now, with the release of Dawn of Majesty, and Tindangle Jhrelth's arrival to the TCG, I believe Tindangle's ready to join the ranks of Yu-Gi-Oh's most memorable Flip archetypes!  <hr />  <strong>Deck Composition</strong>  With Jhrelth and Dholes available to the TCG, Tindangle has become a self-reliant archetype. As such, the main deck features almost no Tindangle-specific monsters (Danger!? Tsuchinoko? is an exception), Spells, or Traps. On the contrary, the Extra Deck is a mix of generic options. While Acute Cerberus is run at three, he's a poor boss monster that's much more useful as an extender. Before we discuss strategy, let's take a moment to go over some of the best cards present in this deck!  Hand Traps: <ul>  	<li>3X <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> - No surprises here. This isn't a meta deck, so I've sacrificed room for hand traps in favor of cards that make the entire deck more consistent.</li> </ul> Draw Power: <ul>  	<li>2X <a data-name=""Tindangle Protector"">Tindangle Protector</a> - He's not the best, but he's worth mentioning. Flip him at the right time, with the right combination of set monsters, and you can easily turn some games around.</li>  	<li>1X <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a>, 3X <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a></li>  	<li>1X <a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a>, 1X <a data-name=""Card of Demise"">Card of Demise</a>, 1X <a data-name=""Into the Void"">Into the Void</a> - All fantastic choices. Each of these Spells gives you more cards in your hand, filling your Graveyard at the same time.</li> </ul> Main Deck MVP's: <ul>  	<li>1X <a data-name=""Danger!? Tsuchinoko?"">Danger!? Tsuchinoko?</a> - Draw a card, or fill the Graveyard. Either choice is good!</li>  	<li>3X <a data-name=""Tindangle Dholes"">Tindangle Dholes</a> - Being a Level 5 monster, it's less than ideal to draw Dholes. However, he's incredibly powerful in conjunction with Jhrelth, and he's the reason I no longer run Foolish Burial Goods in my Tindangle decks.</li>  	<li>3X <a data-name=""Tindangle Jhrelth"">Tindangle Jhrelth</a> - He's the monster that makes Tindangle decks run smoothly. Fast to play, with fantastic effects (Including the ability to self-summon), Jhrelth is the Tindangle support that we've been dreaming about.</li>  	<li>3X <a data-name=""Tindangle Delaunay"">Tindangle Delaunay</a> - Tindangle's most powerful card, Delaunay shines brightest in the Graveyard. By constantly populating your field with monsters, Delaunay enables the deck to spam powerful Link monsters.</li> </ul> Extra Deck MVP's: <ul>  	<li>1X <a data-name=""Evilswarm Exciton Knight"">Evilswarm Exciton Knight</a> - With so many Level 4 monsters, it'd be a crime to not run at least one Xyz monster. Exciton is my go-to, but I'm sure there are more synergistic choices.</li>  	<li>1X <a data-name=""Subterror Behemoth Fiendess"">Subterror Behemoth Fiendess</a> - Sees play in every decent Tindangle deck. Many decks run her at two or three, but I don't find myself summoning her often enough to merit that sort of inclusion.</li>  	<li>3X <a data-name=""Tindangle Acute Cerberus"">Tindangle Acute Cerberus</a> - While he's very easy to summon, he's an awful boss monster (No built-in protection, he's a ""beatstick"" that caps itself at 4,000 ATK). However, with his ability to summon a Tindangle Token after declaring an attack, he's a perfect extender for Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax or Unchained Abomination.</li>  	<li>1X <a data-name=""Unchained Abomination"">Unchained Abomination</a> - In my opinion, an absolute must-have  for any Tindangle deck, primarily due to his easy summoning conditions.</li> </ul> Notable Exclusions: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Stairs of Mail"">Stairs of Mail</a> - Decent support, but, for it's effect, it's not worth the space. I'd rather maximize on Tindangle's monster effects.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Spirit of the Fall Wind"">Spirit of the Fall Wind</a> - I see this card run at three in a lot of Tindangle decks. I don't get it. It's too slow, doesn't synergize well, and has to be Normal Summoned to use its effect, leaving you more vulnerable to attack. Avoid this one!</li> </ul>  <hr />  <strong>Strategy</strong>  Tindangle is a Link-spam deck that utilizes the Graveyard as a second deck. After a turn or two, you'll be able to put out a Link-4 monster every turn, with material to spare for a Link-2, or setup for the next turn. While it's relatively slow to play, Tindangle excels at filling the Graveyard in a short amount of time.  In terms of combos, there's not much to discuss. Tindangle monster effects are simple to understand; Once you've got them memorized according to monster, you'll be able to figure what to send to the Graveyard at a moment's notice. Here's an example of how Tindangle monsters work together:  Combo 1 (Dholes, Jhrelth in hand; Trinity, Intruder in Graveyard): <ol>  	<li>Activate Jhrelth's effect; Discard Dholes, send Delaunay to Graveyard.</li>  	<li>Special Summon Jhrelth; Intruder's effect activates; Chain Dholes, select Trinity.</li>  	<li>Special Summon Trinity, resolving Dholes's effect; Special Summon Intruder.</li>  	<li>Result: Jhrelth, Trinity, Intruder face-down on the field; Delaunay in the Graveyard.</li> </ol> Tindangle monster cards love to work together, and each brings a little to the table; Mill a monster, mill a Spell or a Trap, Special Summon from your Graveyard, or search a Tindangle card. Once you get the ball rolling, you'll find a good chunk of your Extra Deck out on the field, bringing the pain to your opponent... Good hunting!  <hr />  <strong>Tips and Tricks</strong> <ul>  	<li>Experiment with your Extra Deck composition. I've seen everything from Code Talker's to Topologic's... Have fun with it!</li>  	<li>Even being non-meta, this deck runs quite a few expensive cards (Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring, Danger!? Tsuchinoko?, I:P Masquerena, and Underworld Goddess of the Closed World are among the most costly). If you're looking to play this deck purely for fun, I'd highly suggest giving Magical Hats a try! It's a funny little Trap that helps put Spells and Traps into the Graveyard.</li>  	<li>If you're trying to play a Trap-heavy Tindangle deck, the Fiend Griefing engine is a must.

Essentially the aim is to go second and break the opponent's board with the many powerful blowout cards such as Raigeki and Harpie's Feather Duster, following up with a Suship board providing either a swift OTK or a close OTK with either a Zeus or negate+steal.  <strong>Main Deck Card Choices</strong> <ul>  	<li>3 of each Suship - 3 of all the Suship monsters allows max consistency.</li>  	<li>3 Rescue Rabbit and 3 Unexpected Dai - act functionally as 6 extra copies of Rice Suship for bonus consistency, or for extending combos allowing multiple xyz plays.</li>  	<li>3 Effect Veiler - bare minimum handtrap I used as a cheap version of Infinite Impermanence; feel free to replace with whatever handtrap you feel works best.</li>  	<li>3 Alpha - breaks tough boards going second by skirting around protection effects. Also good at soaking up a negate so you can make Suship plays.</li>  	<li>3 Parallel EXeed - very good card to use for extending further with XYZ plays or as link fodder. You usually summon this off of a spare Rice Suship linked into a Link Spider.</li>  	<li>3 Suship Field Spell, 1 Suship Trap - I feel this ratio works nicely as you will hit the field spell a lot when drawing allowing extended plays, and the trap card is searchable afterwards for recycling and setting up for a turn 4. The duels usually don't last long enough for more than 1 of the trap to resolve and so I don't feel another is necessary.</li>  	<li>2 Desires, 1 Upstart - 2 Desires so you see it but don't draw it enough to banish everything: banishing any number of Rice Suship is devastating as there is no in-engine way to recur them. Upstart for 39 card deck consistency, the extra LP should not be a problem with the damage you can output.</li>  	<li>1 Monster reborn - it's useful sometimes, whether it's used for stealing a dragoon or recycling a Suship.</li>  	<li>Blowouts: 3 Dark Ruler, HFD, Raigeki [Optionally you can run 3 Dark Hole if you don't mind cutting Veiler, or even adding 3 Lightning Storm over Alpha or the field spell] - break boards, win games.</li> </ul> <strong>Extra Deck Card Choices</strong> <ul>  	<li>2 of each Suship XYZ - these will never be summoned more than twice.</li>  	<li>2 Zeus - broken card, clears the field of anything you can't out, turns a dead Suship XYZ after the battle phase into a powerful interruption. Unlikely more than 2 will come up.</li>  	<li>Number F0 - Utopic Future and Number F0 - Utopic Future Dragon - mostly used as a turn 1 play if you are made to go first as a way to set up an interruption with protection. Negates and steals a monster with no downsides up to 3 times (OPT). Can be used instead of Zeus as an option in Main Phase 2 if you don't want to wipe your field.</li>  	<li>Link Spider - Rice Suship --&gt; Link Spider --&gt; 2 Parallel EXceed</li>  	<li>I:P Masquerena and Knightmare Unicorn - standard 3 card interruption engine if you have nothing else; simply end on I:P and a monster then you can quick effect bounce to interrupt an opponent's play, which can sometimes end their turn.</li>  	<li>Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops - many decks just cannot out this card and its powerful, annoying effect. A 3rd option to end a board on after dealing damage.</li>  	<li>Underworld Goddess of the Closed World - very nice removal card that Suship can easily make with their strong swarming game. It can sometimes win games on its own, but it is very situational so feel free to replace with an Apollousa or something.</li> </ul> For the side deck, consider kaijus as they can out anything your Suships or spells can't. Floodgates like Anti-Spell Fragrance, Imperial Order, etc work nicely too as the deck isn't too reliant on spells past its own turn. Floodgates are especially nice to replace the destruction staples/Dark Ruler if your opponent makes you go first. Overall though it is best to prepare your own sidedeck tailored to your own need with the deck and your local meta.  As for lines of play, the basic plays are very simple and can be figured out in a few test hands. The goal of the deck is to make the Suship XYZ monsters with Rice Suship and the respective topping Suship as materials for maximum advantage. Ending on the Rank 5 Suship, the Icefish XYZ Suship, and Zeus would be an optimal end board for example. There are some small pieces of knowledge that are harder to work out which I will list below: <ul>  	<li>Urchin Suship can shuffle Spells and Traps to summon itself, which can be used to get it out and put a dead field spell back in the deck.</li>  	<li>Try not to end your board with the Roe Suship XYZ (the red one) as it has no useful effects on your opponents turn, while the Icefish XYZ offers destruction protection and an attack buff.</li>  	<li>Multiple Icefish XYZ' buff effects stack , which can provide your field with a much larger OTK potential.</li>  	<li>Urchin Suship can target itself.</li>  	<li>Pot of Desires is very risky in this deck - don't use it unless you really need the extra cards as you risk making your deck unplayable.</li>  	<li>Likewise, Dark Ruler No More, while helping you establish a board, stops you from dealing damage and actually winning, which Suships need to do as fast as possible before they get crushed by a higher tier deck. So while it is nice to negate a field, try to use it as a last resort in this deck. Alpha can bait out negates at a much lower cost.</li> </ul> Thank you for reading and I hope you will enjoy the unique and fun style of gameplay Suship offers!"

While the Despia package slightly boost consistency as their Field Spell; it doesn't orchestrate the consistency of the deck, but rather carries the deck when no fusion spells are present in your hand; need a monster like Shaddoll Winda or Invoked Caliga for locking your opponent during the next turn; or you want to go an extra mile to expand your board. The Dino package also acts as fusion fodder and fuel to Special Summon Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, and link summon into Verte Anaconda (Especially with Giant Rex + Gold Sarcophagus). The Dragoon package is also present for OTK validation, negate wall (when paired with Invoked Mechaba or Shaddoll Shekhinaga), etc. As for Pot of Desires, I chose to play that over Allure of Darkness simply because I don't entirely need my whole deck to achieve necessary board building results."

The Deck uses a small <a data-name=""Super Polimerization"">Super Polimerization</a> engine made of <a data-name=""Predaplant Anaconda Verte"">Predaplant Anaconda Verte</a> and <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>, plus all the usual targets, including <a data-name=""First of the Dragon"">First of the Dragon</a>, very easy to make and can quit the duel.  The true core of the deck is <a data-name=""Number 29: Mannequin Cat"">Number 29: Mannequin Cat, which can summon any monster from Deck, Hand or GY, if </a><a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a><a data-name=""Number 29: Mannequin Cat""> is on the field. In order to make Number 29, we will use </a><a data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a><a data-name=""Number 29: Mannequin Cat""> and the Sacred Beast engine. </a><a data-name=""Raviel, Lord of Phantasms"">Raviel, Lord of Phantasms</a><a data-name=""Number 29: Mannequin Cat""> takes the place of </a><a data-name=""Legendary Maju Garzett"">Legendary Maju Garzett</a><a data-name=""Number 29: Mannequin Cat"">, being in addition searchable also by </a><a data-name=""Ahrima, The Wicked Warden"">Ahrima, The Wicked Warden, and it can tribute to OTK and generates a level 1 token for our </a><a data-name=""Ahrima, The Wicked Warden"">Linkuriboh.</a>  The Deck finds very good follow up cards in <a data-name=""Recurring Knightmare"">Recurring Knightmare</a> (which I am very happy to be able to play here) and <a data-name=""Opening of the Spirit Gates"">Opening of the Spirit Gates</a>. These two cards can recurr a Linkuriboh, a Number 29, therefore any monster from everywhere, including the floodgate <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Abiss"">Barrier Statue of the Abiss</a>.  The Deck is completed by one <a data-name=""Capshell"">Capshell</a>, in order to have some recurrable draw power, <a data-name=""Lost paradise"">Lost paradise</a>, more draw power, <a data-name=""Diabolos, Lord of The Lair"">Diabolos, Lord of The Lair</a>, just because it's great, and <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> plus <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>.  The use of <a data-name=""Mind Crash"">Mind Crash</a> is in my opinion mandatory, since it can be chained at <a data-name=""Crash Card Virus"">Crash Card Virus</a> or Epidemic Eradicator Virus to Complete the hand control opera. Basically any monster and the tokens are good fodders for CCV and all our big beaters, but also the super poly targets, are good for EEV.  I hope you will enjoy this version. I have many others, but I think this one is the one that will benefit the most from <a data-name=""Piris Reis Map"">Piris Reis Map</a> and <a data-name=""Small World"">Small World</a> once they are available.  Since the Deck is very weak on banishing, you may consider to add three <a data-name=""Chaos Hunter"">Chaos Hunter</a> in the Side Deck, maybe in place of <a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a>.

This deck can obviously play going first or second, but with Trap Trick and Red Reign, it's better to go first, especially since Red Supernova is a powerful negate the nukes the opponent's board.  There is another going first strategy with the side deck cards. Siding in the Synchro Calls in place of the Infinite Imperms allows the player to set up a first turn where they have the ability to synchro summon into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity on their opponent's turn and literally make them unable to play. Simply, the first turn end board is having Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend and two Creation Resonators (brought out by Crimson Resonator) sit in the monster zones, with Synchro Call sitting in the backrow (or Trap Trick to set Synchro Call on your opponent's turn) and ready to bring out your Red Rising Dragon from graveyard to immediately go into King Calamity.  The Clear Wing and Crystal Wing package is helpful in some scenarios and intended strategies, so I had them be placed in the side deck. The reason why they're not in the extra deck is because Red Rising Dragon's ability to revive Resonators locks the player into only synchro summoning DARK Dragon Synchro monsters for the rest of the turn, and it's a lot better to have Red Supernova (generated by Red Rising reviving Crimson Resonator from the graveyard) be your first synchro summon. However, there are obviously situations where you can't synchro climb through even numbers, and being locked into DARK Dragons leaves you the safe and ensured option of going to Ancient Pixie Dragon. Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth is also there as a Level 5 option, but it's also alright to run the Speedroid Level 5 synchro, too.  I've thought of playing the Rokket Synchro package to bust out more synchro monsters, but in today's meta, Hand Traps are definitely needed. Three of Ash Blossom, Three of Ghost Ogre, and Three of Infinite Imperm helped me play out of certain combo decks and allowed me to survive longer till I achieved victory, but three (or whatever proportions) of other hand traps is fine to play in this deck.  I don't focus on Link strategies in this deck, and of course I have ran into hilarious situations where I could have made certain Links if I put them into the deck, but those are <em>very rare</em> opportunities.  Red Dragon Archfiends will never be meta, but their extra deck cards have seen play in those high levels of gameplay. I've always loved RDAs and the purity of it with the Resonators and other Jack Atlas support, so I bring this deck to those to have the same joys and interests."

But they don't see any play in the meta (and will never see play). This deck ","Without a doubt, Ancient Gears are one of the most powerful OTK decks... But they don't see any play. This deck profile is meant for those who want to bring AG to the spotlight and win.  Of course, they're not built for the meta, but their ability to obliterate decks in a single turn is funny. I used to play <em>a lot</em> of Kaijus to remove annoying cards on the board, but I dropped the number down a little to see more of my fusion and special summoning spell cards. The main play strategy is revolved around bringing out the big fusion monsters for quick and brutal finishes, and one of the most powerful combos of doing that is with Ancient Gear Catapult.  Ancient Gear Catapult is amazing for being able to pop either one of your main piece spell cards, Geartown or Ancient Gear Fortress, or act as a bait to ensure your fusion or searching plays. Destroying a spell card with Ancient Gear Catapult allows you to special summon one Ancient Gear monster from your deck <em>ignoring its summoning conditions</em>. If you pop Geartown or Fortress, it's better to bring out the classical Ancient Gear Golem or the new one (Ultimate Pound), because the Field and Continuous Spell allow you to summon out your regular Ancient Gear cards, like Wyvern or Frame.  The usual play on your OTK turn is having no monsters on your field, with Catapult and either Geartown or Fortress in hand. Activate the Field Spell or Continuous spell cards first, then destroy them with Catapult to summon out Ancient Gear Golem or Ancient Gear Golem - Ultimate Pound. Geartown/Fortress's effects activate after their destruction, so use them to Special Summon Ancient Gear Wyvern to the field. Once Wyvern is summoned, use its effect to add Ancient Gear Box to hand, which will activate once it's searched from your deck to add Ancient Gear Frame to your hand. If you have a Fusion/Polymerization Spell Card in hand after all of that, immediately fusion summon into big finishers. If you do not have a spell card to Fusion Summon, instead of grabbing Ancient Gear Box with Wyvern's effect, add Ancient Gear Hunting Hound or Ancient Gear Fusion from your deck, which will allow you to access your fusions.  Before those plays, if you have a Kaiju in hand, you can rip away an annoying monster on their board with it. After that, proceed with the Catapult + Geartown/Fortress combo.  Of course, there are situations where you are going second, and you don't have Catapult and/or Geartown/Fortress. Luckily, there are Fusion Spell cards like Power Bond or Ancient Gear Fusion to draw into, and enough Ancient Gear monsters to allow you to play. Overload Fusion is great after you either use all of your monsters to already fuse, or they were all sent to the graveyard by your opponent.  Two Limiter Removals ensure that you get over big monsters and still be able to win with one attack.  Going first is a bad time for Ancient Gears, a majority of the time. So, I put in three Ancient Gear Howitzers, one Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy, and one Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon for protection and increasing survivability chances after your first turn. Bringing them out is easy with Fusion Spell cards, and the Catapult + Geartown/Fortress combo.  Sad thing about the Xyz plays is that Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon is a Level 9, but the card is great going second for OTKs and for removing backrow to ensure Main Phase 2 combos on turn 2.  Ancient Gear Ballista is in here because it's like another Catapult for going second, but it requires you to have two EARTH Machine Monsters already on the field. It's easy to do that if you do the Catapult + Geartown/Fortress combo first, and then if you have an extra Geartown/Fortress, destroy it with Ballista to keep extending and <em>really</em> ensure that OTK.  Ancient Gears will never be meta, and will never see meta play, but the gameplay of the deck is so much fun. It's just generate big numbers with absurd effects behind them, and swing for game in one turn. This deck profile and strategy is just for those who want to experience the same joys as I and my friends do playing this deck."

For those of you who want to have a FUN game of Yu-Gi-Oh, or are broke as fuck like me, welcome back.  Compared to the version I made back in April, this deck has gone through a few alterations now that a couple of cards have come out. For starters, the link engine I ran has changed from Evil Eye to the much better and more versatile Scrap engine. This gives the deck some access to a few level 9 Synchro plays that do see their play from time to time. If you want some level 8s I recommend against it, as you always want to use the scrap engine to get out your Artifact Dagda, otherwise you'll struggle getting enough Artifacts onto the board. I've also replaced the 3 Varja with the much better Beagalltach. This give you much more control over what you want to pop, as we've now geared to a much more trap heavy lineup. Whilst Varja was explosive, I often found myself popping too many of my useful traps, so the change is much more useful with the slightly reduced Artifact lineup. To improve consistency, I've added 3 Pot Of Duality which are very helpful in a starting hand and if you do draw them later, can prove their use when you've Xyz Summoned and are just looking for more plays in the late game. MST has been replaced with the much more useful Heavy Storm Duster. I often found that MST was not giving me enough mileage, as I would have to choose between my opponents backrow or my own Artifacts to trigger. HSD allows you to get more bang for your buck, with both triggering your Artifact effects, but also giving you the option to pop your opponents backrow if need be. The battle phase skip is nothing to worry about, as you'll only every activate it on your opponents turn anyway. I've also rejigged the Artifact lineup slightly, utilising a slightly smaller number and only 1 of the 'other' Artifacts that I deemed useful. I also replaced Fail naught with Mjolnir as it just gives you quicker access to you Artifacts' effects, rather than having to wait a turn to pop them. The lock in to Artifacts is not too bad, as you'll only really be activating it late game to bring back one back. In replace of Breakthrough Skill is the outright denial in Solemn Strike. Hand traps ruin my fun and I'm not having it, no sireee no. The Xyz lineup has also slightly changed, some cards have fallen out, whilst others have come in for reasons you can probably guess.  And there u have it. My pure Artifact deck 2.0 As always, any feedback or tips you guys have is always appreciate, hope you guys enjoyed."

Generate tons of res,"Normal Pendulum combines the power of the “normal” monster support racked up over the years with the power of pendulum summoning! This deck is a casual budget deck (about $30 without the non-mandatory expensive cards) that is easy to use, has a lot of future potential and customizable to your liking. Normal Pendulum functions as a swarmy beatdown deck that can generate resources constantly and summon gigantic boss monsters every turn.  &nbsp;  The<span> <strong><u>BREAD AND BUTTER COMBO</u></strong></span> for this deck turbos out Draco Masters of the Tenyi, which gives you 3 link arrows to use for a pendulum summon. Once you pendulum summon using Draco Master's link arrows, you can create your board from there, depending on the situation. After establishing your scales of 2 and 7, this combo requires only two cards, Hallohallo, and a level 4 normal monster/Unexpected Dai. <ol>  	<li>Get a normal monster other than Hallohallo on the field (either by normal summoning it or using Unexpected Dai).</li>  	<li>Link summon Link Spider with your normal monster.</li>  	<li>Activate Link Spider’s effect to summon Hallohallo to it’s link arrow.</li>  	<li>Link both for Halqifibrax, summoning another Hallohallo.</li>  	<li>Link Halqifibrax and Hallohallo to summon Draco Masters of the Tenyi. Now you have three link arrows to pendulum summon!</li>  	<li>Pendulum summon both Hallohallos and your level 4 monster from your ED, as well as any other left over monsters in your hand. Now you can make your board however you like according to your situation.</li> </ol> My favourite endboard going first is Avramax + Moonlight Dragon, giving you protection with a beefy hard to kill boss and a monster bounce. Going second, once you summon Draco Masters you can pop 3+ effect monsters due to your army of normal monsters on the field, then you can OTK once you clear their board!  If you have extenders or additional material on the board, you can potentially make a 4 material Apollousa complete with Black Rose Moonlight Dragon/Stellar Wind Wolfrayet/Tornado Dragon. You also can put all your eggs in one basket and potentially make a 4000-6000 attack Arrival Cyberse @Ignister, practically ensuring your link arrows for next turn's pendulum summon.  The end boards possible for this deck is extremely variable. Be creative!  &nbsp;  Normal Pendulum features 6 <span><strong>DRAW CARDS</strong></span> specific to normal monsters that can + like crazy, giving this deck a lot of resource generation which allows you to catch up to other players despite your weaker cards.  <strong>Shatter the Darkness</strong> (unreleased card, current “earthshattering event"" in my list as a placeholder) gives you a draw once per turn when you summon a normal monster. It also has very beneficial effects for your level 5+ normal pendulums and Extra Deck monsters using normal monsters as material, turning them into beatsticks with it’s “Honest” like attack boost effect!  <strong>Heart of the Underdog</strong> is an ancient card that is not once per turn. This deck features 22 normal monsters, so this card can draw you many cards in one go! This card can also be used in multiples in the field, so the effect stacks allowing for more draw power! It’s not unusual for this card to allow the player +3 or +4 card advantage during their draw phase!  <strong>Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi</strong> turns your normal monsters into mini “towers” rendering them UNAFFECTED by monster effects. Also, this modern age of Yugioh basically guarantees an opponent special summon an effect monster so you can draw two cards easily. Consider this card a pot of Greed that provides monster protection.  &nbsp;  Nine<span><strong> CONSISTENCY CARDS</strong></span> tailored to support normal monsters ensure that you never brick with this deck (in playtesting I’ve only bricked once in 20-ish games). If you’re missing proper pendulum scales, search for it! Need Hallo-Hallo or a level 4 normal monster for the combo? Add it from the deck or summon it!  <strong>Painful Decision</strong> is ROTA on crack for normal monsters, since it’s also a foolish burial. Throwing a normal monster in the graveyard enables more destruction ability for Draco Masters of the Tenyi which depends on normal monsters in the GY.  <strong>Summoner’s Art</strong> is simple, adds a level 5 or high normal monster to the hand. Ideally, you’d want Sky Dragoons of Draconia as your pendulum scale 7 since it’s pendulum effect of card destruction is very helpful.  <strong>Unexpected Dai</strong> summons from the deck a normal monster. If you’re missing either part of the bread and butter combo, summon it! If you already have both of them, this acts as an extender, netting you a 4 material Apollousa, 5000 attack Arrival Cyberse, etc.  &nbsp;  Normal Pendulum features a army of 22 <span><strong>NORMAL MONSTERS</strong></span> which are all Pendulum monsters. Make sure you set the scales 2 and 7, and pendulum your way to victory! Many of these monsters have pendulum effects that are relevant to your normal monsters:  <strong>Dragoons of Draconia</strong>’s pendulum effect adds any normal monster from your deck to your hand if your normal monster destroys an opponent’s monster by battle.  <strong>Sky Dragoons of Draconia</strong>’s pendulum effect target destroys 1 card on the field when your normal monster inflicts damage.  <strong>Sea Dragoons of Draconia</strong>’s pendulum effect summons a normal monster from your hand if a monster is destroyed by battle. I only opted to use 1 of this card because it’s effect isn’t useful most of the time since your hand tends to never have monsters anymore. Also level 3 isn’t a very good level for making synchros and XYZ in this deck.  <strong>Dragon Horn Hunter</strong>’s pendulum effect boosts your normal monster’s attack by 200. Every normal monster cannot be destroyed by battle.  <strong>Lancephorhychus</strong>’s pendulum effect gives all your normal monsters piercing verses defense position monsters.  Other relevant pendulum effects:  <strong>Foucault’s Cannon</strong>’s pendulum effect is this deck’s backrow destruction.  <strong>Antihuman Intelligence ME-PSY-YA</strong>’s pendulum effect is extremely strong, banishing every spell and trap that is sent to the graveyard. This free to summon effect monster also is very nasty going first. This card sends every single monster summoned while it is on the field during the end phase, even if it leaves the field, disrupting combos and set-ups the opponent tries to make. This card is slightly not budget friendly, so it can be replaced by Rescue Rabbit, which works very well too.  &nbsp;  Normal Pendulum is very good at generating materials necessary to summon a lot of extra deck <span><strong>BOSS MONSTERS</strong></span> to the field, due to the pendulum summoning mechanic and card nigh broken drawing ability for normal monster support. They’re mostly self-explanatory, but here are my favourites to summon in this deck:  <strong>Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</strong> functions as the “towers” for the deck. Since he is so difficult to remove (especially with the support of I:P Masquerena) your link arrows for pendulum summoning are fairly safe with him around.  <strong>The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister</strong> can also be turbo’d out first turn in this deck as a 4000 ATK monster (just make sure you have 4 attributes when you pendulum summon)! This deck features all 6 attributes, so you can potentially make a 6000 attack final boss monster. Your opponent generally cannot out this monster, and you straight up win.  <strong>Cyberse Quantum Dragon</strong> and <strong>Black Rose Moonlight Dragon</strong> are the go-to dragons in this deck, depending on the situation. Rose Dragon is ideal going first, allowing the player to potentially disrupt a combo by bouncing a key monster. Cyberse Quantum Dragon is better going second, breaking apart boards with the bounce effect in the battle phase as well as attacking twice.  <strong>Unchained Abomination</strong> RIP AND TEARS boards apart with it’s rage! Nuff’ said.  <strong>Dhampir Vampire Sheridan</strong> is my personal pick since this deck has easy access to rank 6 toolbox. It’s the best Rank 6 monster in my opinion, allowing for a targeted send removal + an ability to monster reborn your opponent’s strong monster.  &nbsp;  The <strong><span>SIDE DECK </span></strong><span>features other cards that once can potentially use in the deck to change playstyle or for budget options. </span>  <span><strong>Skill Drain, Heat Wave Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi (Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon can be summoned with this card),</strong> and <strong>Tyrant's Throes</strong> allow for a more ""stun"" focused playstyle of this deck. I chose not to use them, since I like to play aggressively. Feel free to use these cards in your version of the deck!</span>  <strong>Rescue Rabbit</strong> is a good budget replacement for Antihuman Intelligence ME-PSY-YA and it works very well, generating resources and increasing consistency. <strong>Denko Sekka</strong> is also a good budget replacement, since this deck does not really normal summon much.  <strong>Lyna the Light Charmer, Magician of Hope, Majester Paladin</strong> and <strong>World Gears</strong> are perfect budget options to replace the more expensive monsters in the extra deck like Halqifibrax, Apollousa and Avramax.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</span> </strong>  I have a confession to make, I’m one of those weirdos who <strong><em>HATED</em> </strong>the pendulum mechanic for “ruining” Yu-Gi-Oh, especially during the infamous PEPE format. This is my first ever pendulum deck I’m making and getting IRL, so it’s kind of a funny apology to all the hate I’ve unjustly dished out to pendulum over the years. I was a close minded Yugi-Boomer with nostalgia tinted glasses at the time, forgive me pendulum enthusiasts.  Anyways, this deck was super fun to make and playtest! Since it’s a non-archetypal deck, it reminded me of making a deck when I bought packs as a little kid and smushing every sort of card together into a deck until it functions (badly lol). It’s also pretty cool since everything comes together and actually works out! Normal Pendulum is super customizable too, and I made this deck the way I like playing Yugioh – boss monster turbo beatdown (that doesn’t involve long combos).  There is so much support coming out for normal monsters with Magikey, Tenyi, Token, Blue-Eyes/Dark Magician stuff coming out, so this deck has upwards potential. All in all, Normal Pendulum is a fun casual budget deck that is easy to use for those new to the pendulum mechanic.

The archtype’s strategy caught my eyes because it resembles a lot of link plays, two monsters to make one. The only problem that I have with this strategy is speed, only because it is an old strategy in a modern format. So the tri-brigade in conjunction with the test panther are here to make this deck great once again like the Roman Empire (probably will fall too hehehe).</span>  <span><b>Inside The Gladiator's field:</b></span>  <span><span>The final goal with the gladiator beast’s strategy is to make a final board with </span><b>“<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a>”, “<a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>”</b> and<b> “<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"">Gladiator Beast Heraklinos</a>” or “<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a>”, “<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>” </b>and the<b> “<a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a>”</b><span>. These two boards are decent, each one in its one way.  The first one gives you 4 to 5 monster’s negates (3 to 4 by Apollousa and one by Domitianus) and one spell/trap negate (Heraklinos). The second one can give you one monster negate plus a lock down in a form that negates every monster’s summons but wind ones.</span></span>  <span><span>To make this board, the vital piece is “</span><b><a data-name=""Test Phanter"">Test Panther</a></b><span>''. Why? You can ask me and I will happily answer. The role of this piece is to search any gladiator card: it can be a monster that is missing, a spell to extend or the only trap for the next turn. This card effect goes even further, shuffling a gladiator beast monster to search for another one. This effect counts as summoning by a gladiator beast effect, so any gladiator beast’s effect that needs this to activate will activate. With that being said let’s go to combos:</span></span>  <span><span>First of all, </span><b><a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Kerass"">Tri-Brigade Kerass</a></b><span> or any other tri-brigade need to hit the field. It can be easily fulfilled by the normal tri-brigade combo. Second, a gladiator beast needs to be on field too. For that, </span><b>3x <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andal"">Gladiator Beast Andal</a></b> <span>plus the normal monster support like</span><b> <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a> </b><span>and</span><b> <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a> </b><span>are here to speed things up. With this set up, </span><b>Kerass</b><span> will cheat </span><b><a data-name=""Test Phanter"">Test Panther</a></b><span> from the extra deck, so it can search any Gladiator beast’s card, preferably </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attorix"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a>. </b><span> After that, Test Phanter’s second effect can shuffle the Andal or any other gladiator beast to summon any gladiator beast ,counting as a summon by a gladiator beast’s effect. Soo, counting as you searched </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attorix"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a>,</b><span> you need to summon </span><b></b><a data-name=""&lt;b&gt;Gladiator Beast Augustus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;""><b>Gladiator Beast Augustus</b><span>,</span></a><span> in this way by the effect of him </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attorix"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a> </b><span>will be summoned, dropping (by her effect) in the GY </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Vespasius"">Gladiator Beast Vespasius</a></b><span>, gaining his name and level.</span></span>  <span><span>With two level 5 or more Gladiatores Beasts on field, by contact fusion, </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a></b><span> can hit the field. He can cheat any fusion Gladiator Beast, soft once per turn. This is a good way to do what you need to do:</span></span> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span><span> If you want to destroy any card  you can bring </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a> </b><span>(destroys two card on the field upon summon)</span><b>,</b><span> using him and </span><b><a data-name=""Test Phanter"">Test Panther</a></b><span> to bring </span><b><a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>, </b><span> locking the opponent with  the </span><b><a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a>;</b></span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span><span>If you want bring as much negation as possible and have </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast's Comeback"">Gladiator Beast's Comeback</a> </b><span> in the hand you can summon </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a> </b><span>(one monster negate and a body of 3500), using </span><b>Kerass</b><span>, </span><b>Tamer Editor </b><span>and </span><b><a data-name=""Test Phanter"">Test Phanter</a> </b><span>as link material for</span><b> “<a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>” </b><span>will have 3 negates, after that resurrecting </span><b>Tamer Editor</b><span> with  </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast's Comeback"">Gladiator Beast's Comeback, </a></b>you can cheat<b> <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"">Gladiator Beast Heraklinos</a>, </b><span>to finish the board;</span></span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span><span>If you want lock plus one negate you can bring </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a>,</b><span> using </span><b><a data-name=""Test Phanter"">Test Panther</a></b><span> and Nerval to bring </span><b><a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>,</b><span> locking the opponent with the </span><b><a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a>.</b></span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""></li> </ul> <span><b>For the Tri Brigade battle:</b></span>  &nbsp;  <span>The Tri Brigade Combo is simple as everybody already knows.

As if we don't have enough of that already. Oh, well. And no, I did not mispell the deck. That's what I chose to name it: ""Dank Magician.""  &nbsp;  So, here is my first Dark Magician deck, including two of the newest support cards from Battle of Chaos! Magician Salvation is good for getting Eternal Soul on the field without Dark Magical Circle, and Illusion of Chaos helps unbrick your hand and get you Magician's Rod or Magicians' Souls.  &nbsp;  Your goal here is to go first and sit on either Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon or Illusion of Chaos --Ideally both. And this deck can consistently summon on both of them in one turn. It also has one copy of Sauravis in case your opponent tries to use Veiler or Imperm on your monsters, and one copy of Dark Magic Attack because Trap decks are the spawn of Satan."

Sadly, Zombie World deck is one of the main counters to this deck strategy because it makes all the cards turn into Zombie monsters.  I usually use Urgent Schedule as soon as possible to bring Super Express Bullet Train and Infinitrack Harvester, then link Infinitrack Goliath using Harvester in order to send it to the graveyard and use Infinitrack Trencher on my Graveyard (if able) to bring back Infinitrack Harvester and use its effect to mix its level with Super Express Bullet Train and get 2 level 12 monsters to XYZ summon Number 77: Seven Sins, or ZEUS, but I prefer Seven Sins because Zeus is easier to summon just by using a low rank XYZ monster like Gear X Gigant.  Also we can use Machine Duplication to multiply the number of Harvesters instead of sending it to the Graveyard, in order to have more monsters to tribute and activate effects. There are many strategies to play in this deck, but I will let you find them out. (I need to work so I can't stay for long writing, sorry)."

You search for Aleister with the Magical Meltdown, and on normal summon he searches an Invocation, which is like a Miracle Fusion for Invoked monsters. You can then link him into a Magistus woman or Almiraj (the first 2 ED cards) and fuse them into an Invoked fusion monster (the next 4 ED cards). This should bait out some disruption and you can move to...  <strong>Step 2: Do Dogmatika Stuff</strong>  The <strong>Dogmatika</strong> engine is 3 Dogmatika Ecclesia, 1 Dogmatika FleurdeLis, and 1 Dogmatika Nexus, 3 Nadhir Servant, and 1 Dogmatika Punishment. The purpose of these cards is to (1) dump cards from the extra deck for spot removal and (2) search disruption. Ecclesia can be normal or specialed if there's an ED monster on the field, and on summon can search one of the Fleur de Lis, Nexus, or Punishment, which are a Veiler, double extra dump, and Raigeki Break, respectively. The cards to dump are the next 5 cards, and do stuff like searching, popping, and reactive removal. If you didn't open the Nadhir Servant or couldn't summon Ecclesia, you can move to...  <strong>Step 3: Do Eldlich Stuff</strong>  The <strong>Eldlich/Golden Land</strong> cards are the backbone of this deck. As in, even if you're hit with a bunch of disruption, you'll always have Eldlich stuff to do. The idea is that you summon (1) Eldlich the Golden Lord with Scarlet Sanguine, or with its own effect, (2) use the Golden Land continuous traps as disruption (specifically a Raigeki Break and D.D. Crow) and (3) banish the Golden Land and Scarlet Sanguines from the grave to set the other from the deck. Just a nice, consistent resource loop to fall back on. The last 2 ED cards are for Eldlich and are a pseudo-cowboy, a way to get a Golden Land trap from hand to GY, a way to get a Golden Land trap from field to GY, and a beefy boy.  <strong>Gotchas:</strong> <ol>  	<li>While you have Cursed Eldland up, you can only attack with zombies, so it's common to use big boy Eldlich's in-hand effect to pop it.</li>  	<li>A lot of summoning restrictions <ol>  	<li>After you resolve Ecclesia or Nadhir Servant, you can't summon from the ED <em>for the rest of the turn</em>.</li>  	<li>After you resolve Dogmatika Punishment, you can't summon from the ED until the <em>end of your</em> <em>next</em> <em>turn.</em></li>  	<li>After you resolve Scarlet Sanguine, you can only summon zombies for the <em>rest of the turn</em>. Don't wanna make any illegal summons.</li> </ol> </li> </ol>"

First remember always that the Dogmatika cards block in the current turn the Despia Fusion Summons, so u need of think what to do in sequence and this deck have much combo. Second is hard to use this deck because u need of to know all the cards effects (all the cards have 2 or 3 effects) and think also the cards to send to grayeard. This is a Chaos version because 2x of BLS and BLS work great in this deck. Dramaturgia of Despia is a great card, when u fusion summon with him, go in autoreborn and if ur opponent summon a Fusion, Syncro, Xyz or Link un select a monster of opponent field and negate his effect and is level 8. Albion the Blackclad Dragon is a +1 card in hand or a level 8 special summon. Ad Libitum of Despia in a reborn if u fusion summon with him, don't is much playable how Dramaturgia, but 1x is good in a Despia Deck. Albèrt, Jester of Despia is a engine of Despia deck, when u normal or special summon him (effect Ad Libitum, effect of First Darklord, Monster reborn etc..) u can add a spell/trap Branded, is a fusion monster is crashed for battle or effect u can reborn him form GY and negate 1 effect monster. Fallen of Albaz is wonderful, with him u can fusion summon (-1 card in hand) with opponent monster and this card work great with the magic Fusion Deployment (summon form deck and fusion with oppenet monster). Despian of Tragedy is nice card because if is sent to GY , banished BY EFFECT, u can add Despia monster from Deck and u can banish this card from GY for to set a magic/trap Branded from the deck. 3x Effect Veiler is good in Despia deck because work always and is light for fusion summon. Ecclesia (Dogmatika) is engine of dogmatica, but in this deck is ok to have only 1x, with she if is special or normal summoned (special summoned also for Ecclesia effect) u can add a Dogmatica card (monster, trap, magic) and this card cannot be destroyed by battle with a monster summoned from extra deck. Dogmatika Maximus work fine because is special summoned if u remove a extra deck card in ur GY (also for this is important think what do u send in GY form Extra Deck) once per turn u and ur opponent send 2 extra deck monsters to GY. Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted is special summoned from hand, u can special summon him and negate 1 monster effect, when attack u can (for always) +500 atk all dogmatika cards. If u can, for inflict much damage, xyz summon rank 8 for number 97 (ur opponent don't can target this card), effect number 98 and special summon numebr 100, effect and 9k or more of atk. If u can and want protect u form 1 opponent magic and future attacs special summon rank 8 numebr 38. The firts of darklords is a very good card in this deck because opponent don't cat target and u can special summon from the GY one time for turn, this card work better in Despia pure version, look for my <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/despia-competitive-version/"">Despia (Good Version)</a>. Despia, the Branded Theather is field card for fusion summon, you can add this card from the deck with despia effects cards and when 1 faity monster is destroyed for attack/effect you can special summon 1 level 8 fusion monster from the GY (all levels 8 fusion monsters and no only Despia!) The shaddols extra deck monsters, despia, brigrand, titaniklad ect.. have all 2nd effect that work in GY and work fine with Dogmatika cards and the trap Shaddoll Scism. Don't send to GY from extra deck Despia cards, fusion fummon 1st this cards, for example Masquerade, the Crimsongleam Dragon if fusion summoned inflick ALWAYS -600 for EVERY card your oppenet use, is normal with this card inflict from 2k to 4k of damage in only 1 turn and Despian Quaeritis every turn make atk 0 for all monsters (no fusion 8 stars) and opponent cards how Ritual Blue Eyes and much, much others are unusefull with this monsters.  Branded in Red is a nice card, but dont' is the best start with this card in hand the first turn, for this is in 1x, with this magic u add to hand 1x Despia or Fallet of Albaz card from GY and after this fusion a 8 stars or more monster, but this fusion summoned monster don't can direct attack (no FTK), but for example if u summon Albion the Branded Dragon u can continue with another fusion summon without limitations for attacks, or fusion summon the card u need without direct attack. I remember (again) that is very important to know in perfect mode all the affects of extra deck (also normal deck ok..) for use this Despia Deck. Test is and u will see how work fine. I accept (after u have tested the deck) all suggestions. TYVM for all."

Making 2 means they have to pay 1200 to activate effects. 600/1200 LP to pay is actually pretty significant and pretty satisfying to watch it tick down.

Every Exorsister xyz monster has unique ability when they xyz summonned and they are really good at putting multiple interruptions for your opponent on their turn  <strong>Deck Description</strong>  Beside this archetype is really good at xyz summoning on your opponent's turn, they still need some conditions to actually work and create multiple interruption to prevent your opponent from doing their stuff. So if your opponent doesnt really use their graveyard, maybe just cheat some big monsters and battle like some otk strat out there, you will definitely stuck and then lose. So to prevent that, i add few engine for rank 4 xyz and most importantly is the trap card called ""Wonder XYZ"". This trap basically just allow you to xyz summon on your opponent's turn, and it has synergy with Exorsister's Trap too (Exorsister Vaids), so it will makes this Archetype more playable than before. Also i put some generic card on the side deck like kaiju and dark ruler no more for going second, and few hand traps depends on the condition. This archetype is really simple, so for the combo or gameplay, you can just learn it yourself and explore it for more.  But despite all that, this Archetype will still be very overwhelmed against Meta Deck. I hope konami will release more support for this archetype in the future."

My complete breakdown for how to build and pilot starry knights.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Unlike normally where I just list my card and reasonings I decided to write a little info on every starry knight card and how many copies of those cards, from my experience, you should play so you can build your own Starry Knight deck!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight is a deck with a play style that is actually kinda similar to zombie world where you have a big boss monster and everything else is meant for utility and recursion.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Let’s start</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Night Starry Dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The face of the deck! Starry Night Starry Dragon is a card that is completely required when piloting starry knights, it has a few effects that I’ll explain.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">First off it has an effect when it hits the field provided it was in your hand, upon entering it gives you the option pop a card Which is really handy, there is no opt on this so juggling it for repeated pops is a thing, in fact that’s what the deck is meant to do!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s second effect is actually really good for certain matchups, the dragon here has a continuous effect that makes it immune to all dark monsters from both battle and card effects, it’s third effect is the cherry on the top though</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The last effect is the only effect that has any opt on it, but it’s a soft opt. If Starry Night Starry Dragon attacks a monster you’re able to just banish that monster and attack again, no targeting, no destruction, this means that Starry Dragon is literally anti dragoon, it’s able to out it and can’t be negated by it or effected by it.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When it comes to how many of this mighty dragon you should play I suggest one or two, I like two because I get a backup if my opponent manages to disrupt it, and three is a little excessive because you got enough ways to get it so two is enough, you can play one but that does come with the issue of not having a backup.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Rayel</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rayel is probably one of the best cards Starry Knights have to offer, it comes with two helpful effects.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">On normal summon Rayel gets to search any Starry Knight spell or trap to add to your hand, it’s a hard opt, likely because of Starry Sky which I’ll explain later.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rayel has a second effect that’s commonly overlooked but you can banish it from your graveyard to summon a Starry Knight from your graveyard for a lot more recursion and utility.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rayel should be played at 3 and you shouldn’t play any less than that, it does so much by providing a really good normal summon and has a built in graveyard effect that helps you in the grindgame.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Orbitael</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The newest card to be released in burst of destiny, Orbitael does it’s job and it does it well</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s really good with utility and has an ashproof search effect, to cherry top it that ashproof search is a quick effect so you can collect two spell or traps really easily.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The first effect on Orbiteal is a quick effect, you can tribute a light monster and in return set one Starry Knight spell or trap from your deck, it’s really helpful for a steady stream of resources when combined with its second effect.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The reason orbiteal is probably the best starry knight card is because of the fact that it has the second effect that it has, if a level 7 light dragon you control is returned to your hand Orbiteal is able to summon itself from your graveyard instantly allowing you to recycle it and keep on gaining card advantage every turn, it doesn’t banish when summoned this way either! Despite both of these effects being hard once per turns it’s a extremely good card that you will use a lot when playing Starry Knights.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 3 Orbiteal, it is far better than pretty much any other Starry Knight in the game at the moment and makes your life so much more easy when playing Starry Knights.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Astel</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Astel has two effects, each useful in their own way</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The first effect Astel provides is a quick effect to tribute a light monster to summon a level 7 light dragon from your hand</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The other effect is a graveyard effect where Astel can banish itself to provide 1000 attack to a level 7 light dragon you control, this is a quick effect and has caught players by surprise.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">All Astel really does is it’s job, but that’s all I ask of it</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As far as Astel goes I actually recommend 2-3, I’ve lost duels playing one Astel because I couldn’t summon Starry Dragon because I ran out of Astel</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Ciel</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Ciel is a lightning overdrive card, it can bounce a Starry Knight or level 7 light dragon on your field back to you hand in return for summoning it</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If Ciel is in your graveyard and you don’t own a monster you can banish it to summon a level 7 light dragon from your hand, this effect doesn’t come up that often but it’s neat to have</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The amount of Ciel played is completely up to preference but you should play at least one</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Flamel</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Flamel isn’t as good as the other Starry Knights but I’ll explain this one regardless</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you’re being attacked you can pitch Flamel from your hand or field to summon a level 7 light dragon from your hand. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In the graveyard Flamel can banish itself to take a level 7 light dragon on your field or graveyard and return it to your hand.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Flamel is either played at 1 or cut entirely, sometimes it’s effects can help but it doesn’t push forward the strategy of your deck much, I play one for the sake of having it just in case</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Sky</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The field spell for Starry Knights, the two effects are decent</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You get to normal summon a Starry Knight or level 7 light dragon in addition to your normal summon every turn, mediocre at best</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you bounce a level 7 light dragon then Starry Sky draws you one card, resource flow is neat but Starry Knights already have a second hand in form of the graveyard</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Copies? Your choice, it’s cool but not good enough to run terraforming</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Ceremony</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You can collect a level 7 light dragon with this card making it a good card alone, but summoning that money upon your opponents effect is a really helpful tool,</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 2-3 of this, it’s a great tool to have in general but you can definitely get away with 2</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Bellfire</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rota with a built in gimmick summoning effect, though there’s not much more to say about it it’s a great card in general</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 3, maximize on this card always, it’s your main searcher and makes Rayel able to search any Starry Knight card in the game</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Arrival</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You can bounce or summon a level 7 light dragon, this trap is a really helpful card and helps you in so many ways despite how simple it is</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Run 2-3 copies of this card, it’s such a useful tool to have</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Blast</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">By bouncing a level 7 light dragon on your field you can negate a card which is cool but that’s all there is to say about it</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card is completely up to you, I really can’t say more</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Ok that’s all of the Starry Knight cards!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Now for some techs to list</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Bahalutiya, the Grand Radiance:</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One of if you want to play it for it’s gimmick, helps tremendously sometimes</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 barrier statue is the heavens and 3 ties of the brethren</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">90% of Starry Knight gameplay is on your opponents turn but adding in a floodgate is also super brutal.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Strengths include</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Very good at outing problem monsters like dragoon via starry dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Very resilient because of it’s second hand in form of the graveyard allowing it to take multiple negates and still play</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You get to have tons of backup options in case your first idea is negated.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Really good at control.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Weaknesses include</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A little underwhelming</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Insanely hard to pilot</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If your opponent still plays through everything you toss at them then it’ll be really hard to bring back a game</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Has to go first</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Below is the build I’m currently using, please enjoy.</span></p>"

First, there is the one you will usually have, lantern shark and any level 4. Summon lantern shark, use its effect, and special summon the other level 4 from hand. Use them to make Bahamut Shark, and activate its effect to summon Shark Caesar, and overlay that into Full Armored Black Ray Lancer. You can then overlay Bahamut and FABRL to make F0: Utopic Future. Then overlay that into F0: Utopic Future Dragon.  Cant be asked to write more, figure it out yourself. <h4 class=""engine-dark-box""></h4>"
