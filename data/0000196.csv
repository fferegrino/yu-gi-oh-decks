Step 1: Evil Eye, if you've got Serziel in your hand you could try summoning him/her. Doing so allows you to grab whatever Evil Eye you want which could be Basilius or Selene or even the Field Spell if you've got Selene already.  Step 2: Unchained, I'm not to sure about the names but you want the traps to be in your hand, plus a way to destroy them so that you can use their effects. Aruha is the one that can Special Summon itself by destroying a card you control (maybe the trap card? hint hint).  Step 3: Now that you've got Serziel on field plus Aruha and whatever you summoned off the trap card you destroyed (or spell) You can summon that Basilius you grabbed or activate the field spell to get one. That's 4 monsters ready and waiting to be used for Link Summoning. Make the Blue Dog using your summon from the trap + Basilius or Aruha, equip the Eye of Selene to Serziel and use whatever other cards are in your hand to bolster your defenses.  This end board definitely won't win games or lock your opponent out of anything too important but on their turn if they Special Summon you can Link their card away with the Blue Dog and you've got Serziel who is immune to things while equipped with Selene so you can use their effect to destroy another of your opponent's special summoned monsters, which will make it so you need to destroy a card on your turn (per Serziel's effect), luckily if you've got another Unchained trap or that Aruha still around you can summon another Unchained from the deck.  Every time you use Serziel or another Evil Eye spell/trap your Serziel gains 500 ATK and you lose 500 LP, this is how you can make Big Serziel using a monster with 2600 or more ATK so that Big Serziel can attack twice.  Sorry if I've not explained things well enough, but I think this deck is more fun to experience yourself rather than having someone explain every step to you.  Enjoy!"

Obviously this is a budget/casual deck, but if you wanted to improve it you could add some more copies/searchers for Mystic Mine, Summon Limit, Threatening Roar, etc.  ...  There are 5 clowns added (making this a 45 card deck) just so I could reasonably keep the name ""Carnival of Horrors"". Surprise your friends and neighbors by playing Crass Clown and Dream Clown in current year. Shock them even more by adding Poly and Bickuribox into the mix. Or just take them out entirely.  Chain Energy and Cauldron of the Old Man to supplement your timelord burn. It makes the duel more exciting when there's a time limit on things.  Only 1 copy of Mystic Mine because it's relatively expensive, and because you want your casual friends to continue to duel with you.  Extra deck optional, but will obviously boost consistency.  Have fun out there!"

There's definite room for improvements.  The main strengths of Archfiends include their access to Falling Down, the high attack power of their monsters, and their easy recyclability. Some of the Archfiends have no OPTs too. The deck is surprisingly well suited for grind games and can potentially be tweaked to lean more in that direction.  All of the links are good generic fiends, with Masterking Archfiend being a centerpiece; Tour Guide + Fiendish Rhino Warrior can summon him, FRW can send an Heiress, and Masterking can trigger his ability on Chain Link 1 to put an extra body on the field, or give you back a resource while you get a search. Zombiestein is the most reliable option to beating over Dragoon; Dingirsu is good for removal and can be ranked up into Pain Gainer and The Seven Sins. Leviair is for recycling.  Archfiends are less reliant on the Extra Deck than other archetypes, so Pot of Prosperity and Pot of Extravagance work well here. You can cut Curse Necrofear and the Allure of Darknesses for three Prosperities if you'd like. Side deck consists of anti-meta and board wipe cards which Archfiends can profit from.  Proof of Pruflas might be worth playing around with in this deck. Other promising builds for Archfiends include a level 6 focused variant, using XYZs like Jinzo - Layered, Beatrice, Dhampir, and Constellar Ptolemy M7, a trap heavy build that makes extensive use of the viruses, or a fusion build that uses Summoned Skull, Super Polymerization, etc."

Key cards: Bar,"The Decks main strategy is to go first is to use <em>""Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda""</em> to set up a 2 material <em>""Springans Merrymaker""</em> (with a <em>""Springans Captain Sargas""</em> if you drew it or searched it off <em>""Springans Watch""</em>) then use floodgate cards such as <em>""Barrier Statue of Inferno""</em> &amp; <em>""Anti-Spell Fragrance"" </em>to lock your opponent out of playing the game. Now, you may say that ""Well they can just normal summon a monster with 1000 or more ATK to beat over the barrier statue"" but that is where you're wrong! Because <em>""</em><em>Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda"" </em>is a recent field spell it has 3 effects, one of those being that when an Xyz Monster leaves the field by a card effect, it can target 1 monster your opponent and prevent it from attacking. It wins in the grind game due to you being able to continuously pop your opponent's cards with <em>""Springans Ship - Exblower""</em> and <em>""Barrage Blast""</em>, always have an omni-negate only with <em>""Springans Interluder""</em> and always be able to resummon the Xyz with <em>""Salamangreat Sunlightwolf""</em> recycling your Springans for discard fodder.  Going second the Deck isn't nearly as strong, however, it has <em>""Springans Ship - Exblower"" </em>to help- bait out negates and, in the scenario where they don't have them, pop a ton of their cards. If playing the deck you should make sure to pack your side deck with tons of cards to accommodate for this weakness of going second. The deck also plays 8 hand traps in the main deck which is the optimal number if you want to draw 1 per hand. They also only summon once or twice allowing them to play under winda and Summon limit extremely easily.  Explanation of the important cards in the deck:  <strong>Springans Captain Sargas:</strong> drident on your opponents turn by detaching material from an xyz.  <strong>Barrier Statue of the Inferno:</strong> You can Special Summon, your opponent cannot.  <strong>Springans Watch: </strong>Terraforming, OR: ROTA and foolish.  <strong>Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda:</strong> Cheats out xyzs and prevents attacks.  <strong>Springans Interluder:</strong> omni-negate every turn.  <strong>Barrage Blast: </strong> Salamangreat Rage if it was a continuous Trap.  <strong>Anti-Spell Fragrance:</strong> No Spells, No harpie's, No lightning storm.  <strong>Springans Ship - Exblowrer:</strong> BOOM!  <strong>Springans Merrymaker:</strong> Armageddon Knight, then sends Titanklads on your opponents turn.  Thanks for reading. Bye."

You can Summon “Borrelsword Dragon” if your opponent monster has high ATK, “Borrelguard Dragon” if your opponent has a lot of like “Dark Hole”, “Mirror Force” or something else, “Borreload Dragon” if they have a lot of powerful monsters, or “Topologic Zeroboros” if there are a lot of banished cards.  - Mirror Force series: It can protect you so much. But if you have a lot of Mirror Force in your hand, just set half of them to your field, because if your opponent destroyed all Spell/Trap you control, you still have Mirror Force in your hand.  - Waking the Dragon: You must believe the heart of cards when using them. You should wish, wish, and wish that your opponent destroy that card you control. And if it does, you can Summon “Ultimate Falcon”, “Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon”, “The Last Warrior from Another Planet”, “Cyber Dragon Infinity”, “Number C69: Heraldry Crest of Horror”, or above Link monsters, depends on the situation of the Duel.  - Starlight Road: You can combo this card with “Twin Twister”. But if you have this card and “Waking the Dragon”, JUST ACTIVATED (This is your optional).  - Magic Cylinder: The most powerful Trap in this Deck. It makes your opponent take a lot of damage that you would take, and also can make you win a Duel! If you have 3 “Magic Cylinder”, you can also still Set all of them! Because when your opponent declares an attack, you can activate 3 “Magic Cylinder” at the same time. But carefully!  - Solemn series: You can use this to protect your Spell/Trap from ""Mystical Spece Typhoon"", ""Twin Twister"", ""Lightning Storm"", ""Jinzo"" or something that your opponent plays.  <strong> *Side Deck:</strong> Depends on your opponent, carefully use them!  <strong>*Tips:</strong>  + You can also use ""Mystic Mine"", ""Swords of Revealing Light"", or something that you want to upgrade this Deck.  + If your opponent uses ""Royal Decree"", ""Jinzo"", etc, you must have ""Timelord"", ""Twin Twister"", or any Spells in your hand. If you do not have any of them, you must believe the heart of cards!"

Shaddoll Trains have been outclassed by Infinitrack/Machina combo Trains, but I miss the old straightforward spam-and-beatdown style of rank-10 trains (and rank-10 trains are a lot cheaper to build, too)  This deck is intended to be a casual/budget altertnative to modern Train decks  ...  Jizukiru is a level 10 Kaiju with Light typing that opens up playing El Shaddoll Construct.  Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord is a level 10 and can be useful for recovering monsters.  Skill Drain will disrupt your opponent and turn your main deck monster lineup into massive beaters.  Urgent Schedule is at 1 because the card is relatively expensive and doesn't really mesh well with the level-10 spam style of this particular build. It could probably be omitted entirely.  Have fun out there!"

But if you're playing modern Yu-Gi-Oh, this probably isn't the case.  The entire Jinzo archetype seems strangely over-balanced, and not particularly good, but it oozes with style.  In short, get out a bunch of Jinzos, support them with extra deck monsters, and hope it's enough to win.  This is intended to be a casual budget deck, so I didn't include Hand Traps, Kaiju engines, Dragun, Gamma, etc.  ...  Spice up the party with Desperado Barrel Dragon and Heavy Metal Raiders, since your deck is mostly Dark Machines anyways. Since we're main-decking Super Poly, I threw in a little Time Wizard just for extra style points (and because it's searchable by Desperado).  Various ""Brain"" and ""Mind"" cards for that Espa Roba flavor. Jinzo - Layered is also included for style, though you should probably never play him.  I'm not quite sure why Konami made half the archetype around trap hate and the other half around taking control of your opponent's monsters, but it doesn't quite work together.  Have fun out there!"

The archetype lacks good protection and usually benefits from your opponent having monsters on the field, so you will probably want to go second.  Gimmick Puppets... aren't very good, but they hold a special place in my heart. I've been playing them casually for about 7 years.  This particular build is a budget deck that was made during Master Rule 4, so I am sure there are several updates that could be made (eg. Girsu, Zeus, Hand Traps, etc.).  ...  I prefer Inferno Reckless Summon to Machine Duplication in most cases, since it allows you to get out Magnet Doll and Bisque Doll and can set up the field for a board wipe with Dark Strings or Pain Gainer. (If you're already playing Magnet Doll, you've submitted to the fact that you are be dependent on your opponent's board anyways)  Desperado Barrel Dragon and Heavy Metal Raiders are in there just for jollies, since most your deck is mostly dark machines with low Attack.  I never understood why Konami made Gear Changer an EARTH monster that can't be searched from the deck. I guess they were just scared that Pups would be TOO GOOD.  Have fun out there!"

Basically just summon four monsters with Uka in hand however you can.  I wanted to include Okami and Kaku, but sadly they're too bricky because they require more board setup to summon (We don't talk about Yata)  If you don't own/run Apollousa, you can replace necroface with Barrier Statue of the Abyss and summon that with Uka, then do your regular link plays but end with I P Masquerena for Knightmare Unicorn and something like Zeroboros (sadly even less budget :/ )  You could also use Reprodocus in place of Akashic/Security, and link into Simorgh with Barrier statue of the stormwinds.  You can play around with extra deck options, there's versatility for more rank 8  XYZ or dark Links if you want to run the barrier statue strategy. There's a lot more potential for Gizmeks with the new support and between Makami and Uka searching/summoning over 825 cards you can run some interesting tech."

You want to get a Melody of Awakening Dragon on your first turn, so that you can retrieve a Blue-Eyes White Dragon and a Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon. You then special summon Alternative. With this, all you need is Polymerization and another Blue-Eyes White Dragon to fusion summon Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon. This is the main power of the deck, being unaffected by effects and can destroy 3 cards per turn. This deck has several potential strategies in it, ones involving Links, Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX, and the Five-Headed Dragon.  Another major strategy is to have a Blue-Eyes White Dragon on the field and a Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon in your hand. You then Link summon Imduk the World Chalice Dragon by sacrificing the Blue-Eyes (I know that card is not in this deck, replace something with it). You can then banish Imduk to special summon Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon. Then, using Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon's effect, you can bring back the Blue-Eyes White Dragon you sacrificed earlier. The reason to use Imduk is that it is a useless card to banish, instead of having to banish a precious Blue-Eyes."

This is a going first deck that relies on your Spell Card effects such as Ojama Country to keep your opponent from attacking. there is also Triple Ojama Trio and Ojama Duo in the deck to stop your Opponent from summoning on their first turn. There are three ways to winning with this deck. <ol>  	<li>Deck Out. this deck is a slow deck that ramps up the more you get into your deck, so use cards like Ojama Pajama to search your deck for certain cards, as well as Ojama Blue's effect on battle destruction, for the Ojama Blue Effect to be possible without your opponent using their own monsters, simply give your opponent a Token with the Ojama Duo or Ojama Trio along with Ojama Country being on the field, Thus they can use the Token to Destroy Blue and allow you to search.  note the Polymerization Cards are not searchable, i have tried this deck with Verte but you do find yourself locked into only certain types of monsters when using Obedience Schooled so be careful of that. but Obedience Schooled can be coupled with any Ojama Monster to Allow you to Summon two Number 64: Ronin Raccoons to protect yourself from being attacked. since Ronin Raccoon can not be destroyed by battle or card effect when another Beast monster is on the field, two Raccoons on the field will protect you from being destroyed by lightening storm or any destruction, but do note, they can still be targeted for none destruction effects to keep a watch out for those, plus with the Token Generation from the Raccoons the Tri-Bridge monsters are easy summons, just not on the same turn as when Obedience was activated.</li>  	<li>Classic life point hits, while this deck offers nothing in negation, outside of stopping your opponent from summoning monsters, there is plenty of disruptions in the deck, such as the before mentioned Monster summoning disruption, but if you find yourself with the Three Ojama Brothers (Yellow, Black and Green) a Ojama Red and Ojama Delta Hurricane you can blow your opponent's entire field away, leaving them open for a straight on attack if you have Ojama Country on the field, if they are below 4000 life points you will win the duel. you can also speed up this progress with cards such as Ojama Party, Ojamagic, Ojama Blue, Ojama Pink, Ojama Country, and Ojama Duo's second Effect to search out the needed cards, and this can all happen while you complete Win Scenario 1.</li>  	<li>Burn Damage?! I know what your thinking, ""An Ojama Burn Deck? Really?"" and Yes its true, this deck has the Potential to burn your opponent's life points away, While you are trying to do either of the before 2 Win Scenarios, you will end up with Ojama Tokens on your Opponent's field. a little known fact about these tokens are, they deal 300 damage when they leave the field, i know not much, but surprisingly these cards can actually be recyclable too, may i introduce to you, Necroface, a Level 4 Zombie Effect Monster, with the effect to return Banished cards to the deck and gain attack points for it when it is normal summoned. while this card is annoying on your side of the field, you can simply link it away for Verte after you summon it, but do be careful, Necroface's effect is a double edged sword returning your opponent's banished cards to the deck as well, so Necroface works against Tri-Bridge Omen, and the first Win Scenario of Decking out your Opponent but, with your opponent having a full field of tokens and you either having Ojama Delta Hurricane or five monsters to attack over them, you can deal a minimum of 1,500 life point damage to your opponent. not much right? well  look at it like this, in general you have Three Copies of Ojama Duo and Ojama Trio in the deck, that's a potential of 4,500 life point Damage, but if you use the second effect of Ojama Duo to banish them to summon two Ojama Monsters with different names to your field, you can abuse Necroface's effect to recycle the three of them granting you a potential of at least 1,800 more adding up to 6,300, and do not worry about decking yourself out either, because Melffy Hide and Seek allows you to reshuffle 3 Beast monsters from your graveyard with different names to your deck and allows you to draw a card as well. Adding another Necroface to your deck from the side deck is your own choice, but this Win Scenario is the most unlikely and requires the most set up, which allows for more chances to mess up with the setup for it and the more potential to lose the duel.</li> </ol> So those are the three win Scenarios for the deck, the easiest would probably be the Deck out Scenario, but the Attacking Scenario is a close second while the Burn Scenario does have the most setup, needing to go into the side deck for more copies of Necroface or  Melffy Hide and Seeks, which isnt a bad thing, because game one you can employ either of the other two win Scenarios to get game. the deck is actually pretty strong if you use it correctly,but just remember the weaknesses of the targeting none destruction removal."

One of the best combos in the deck is <a data-name=""Superheavy samurai soulpiercer"">Superheavy samurai soulpiercer</a>, normal summon soulpiercer then link off into <a data-name=""Superheavy samurai Scarecrow"">Superheavy samurai Scarecrow</a>, soulpiercer effect goes off to add a monster from deck to hand like <a data-name=""Superheavy samurai soulpeacemaker"">Superheavy samurai soulpeacemaker</a>, use Scarecrow effect to discard and bring back soulpiercer to then target it with soulpeacemaker, use soulpeacemaker to special summon any monster from your deck to the field then add monster to hand with soulpiercer again because it was sent to the graveyard.  With this you can special summon tot he field <a data-name=""Superheavy samurai Big Benkei"">Superheavy samurai Big Benkei</a> for example and then add to hand <a data-name=""Superheavy smaurai trumpeter"">Superheavy smaurai trumpeter</a>, special summon it and synchro summon <a data-name=""s&lt;a data-name=&quot;uperheavy samurai warlord susanowo&quot;&gt;uperheavy samurai warlord susanowo&lt;/a&gt;"">s</a><a data-name=""uperheavy samurai warlord susanowo"">uperheavy samurai warlord susanowo</a> and then attack them. because you generally want to go second for draw and attack.

""Venom"" as an archetype can be rated as one of the worst group of cards in the game of Yugioh, since they feature a mechanic of distributing counters that do almost nothing regardless of board state while also being incredibly restrictive and slow to get out. On top of that, the boss monsters have absolutely nothing to do with the aforementioned mechanic and instead go for an alternate win option that is inconsistent and slow. However, they are an archetype that I would still deem playable, so I tried making the most of it.</p> <p>The ""Venom"" monster part is really limited if you do not want to work with ""Venom"" counters, so aside from three copies of ""<a data-name=""Venom Cobra"">Venom Cobra</a>"" to summon via ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"", three copies of ""<a data-name=""Vennominon the King of Poisonous Snakes"">Vennominon the King of Poisonous Snakes</a>"" as a recurring monster and potential beatstick and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Vennominaga the Deity of Poisonous Snakes"">Vennominaga the Deity of Poisonous Snakes</a>"" as the card with the alternate win condition, there is not that much that I would deem playable in the monster department. They got help from various other Reptile-type monsters though: The ""Reptilianne"" archetype provides ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Vaskii"">Reptilianne Vaskii</a>"" as a Kaiju-esque beatstick with a removal effect and ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Lamia"">Reptilianne Lamia</a>"" for her easy Special Summon condition and for setting opposing ATK values to 0. The ""Aliens"" provide ""<a data-name=""Alien Stealthbuster"">Alien Stealthbuster</a>"" as a monster that still has an effect by simply hitting the graveyard, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Alien Overlord"">Alien Overlord</a>"" is easy summonable with the help of some A-counter usage. Alongside one ""<a data-name=""Danger?! Tsuchinoko?"">Danger?! Tsuchinoko?</a>"" for two helpful effects, there is one copy of ""<a data-name=""Ipiria"">Ipiria</a>"" to give us more resources upon revival and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Yamorimori"">Yamorimori</a>"" for further control and destruction effects.</p> <p>The Spells consist of three copies of ""<a data-name=""Snake Rain"">Snake Rain</a>"" to setup the various effects of the Reptile monsters as well as providing stats to both ""Venom"" boss monsters. Two copies of ""<a data-name=""Ogdoadic Water Lily"">Ogdoadic Water Lily</a>"" can make use of the graveyard-filling, one ""<a data-name=""Card of Demise"">Card of Demise</a>"" allows us to fill the backrow and can possibly still be helpful when the cards in hand have to be discarded due to the graveyard effects, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" to revive monsters from the graveyard, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>"" since the deck has plenty of Dark Attribute monsters and since, weirdly enough, ""<a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>"" is part of the archetype due to naming shenanigans. The Trap line-up starts with two ""<a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>"" that can fetch almost any other pair of Traps in the deck, two ""<a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>"" as board resets, two ""<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>"" since they are massively useful effect blockers, make it easy to get over opposing monsters and can pretty much always played twice, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Offering to the Snake Deity"">Offering to the Snake Deity</a>"" for more removal and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a>"", which cannot be searched via ""<a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>"" but help stopping certain plays to opponent might go for.</p> <p>The Extra Deck includes one copy of ""<a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>"" as previously mentioned, which is a solid monster all around, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Hydra"">Reptilianne Hydra</a>"" as a situational option to summon using ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Lamia"">Reptilianne Lamia</a>"", one ""<a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a>"" as a Reptile monster searcher, one ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" for backrow removal, one ""<a data-name=""C&lt;a data-name=&quot;astel the Skyblaster Musketeer&quot;&gt;astel the Skyblaster Musketeer&lt;/a&gt;"">C</a><a data-name=""astel the Skyblaster Musketeer"">astel the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" to get rid of monsters that you cannot handle using the destruction effects in the Main Deck, one ""<a data-name=""Evilswarm Exciton Knight"">Evilswarm Exciton Knight</a>"" to reset the board, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Echidna"">Reptilianne Echidna</a>"" as a very solid searcher, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame"">Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame</a>"", which is basically the Reptile version of ""<a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a>"" and is easily capable of filling your board since the graveyard should be rammed full with various monsters to summon, one ""<a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a>"" helps running over bigger monsters, the entire ""Knightmare"" package for obvious reasons, and one ""<a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>"" as a generic boss monster to kick the opponent with.</p> <p>One criticism with this deck might be the lack of the ""Venom"" archetype, since  only a small part of the deck even belongs to the archetype and it looks more like ""Reptile Goodstuff"". And I cannot deny that that is the case; however, I think this is as far as you can go with ""Venom"" while still having a playable deck, since using their counter mechanic is certainly too flawed to work. However, if you would like to give a ""Venom"" deck a shot, feel free to get some inspiration on the rest of the cards from my ""Archetype Analysis: Venom"" article on my blog, which you can find here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/05/22/archetype-analysis-venom/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/05/22/archetype-analysis-venom/</a></p>"

With the rules changed to be closer to the <a title=""Yu-Gi-Oh!

Additionally, he wins more rare cards from the duels he wins in the preliminaries.  The number of tough <a title=""Warrior"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Warrior"">Warriors</a> and <a title=""Beast-Warrior"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Beast-Warrior"">Beast-Warrior</a>-<a title=""Type"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Type"">Type</a> monsters decreases and he includes a few cartoon-like warriors, while many more luck based cards are added, a trait that leads <a title=""Esper Roba (manga)"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Esper_Roba_(manga)"">Esper Roba</a> to dub it a <b>Gamble Deck</b>. Also his deck is fortified with the monsters he won per ante at the tournament; again there's no major archetype.  Although Yugi manages to win back Joey's ""Red-Eyes"", Joey refuses to take it back and says he'll earn it when he becomes a better Duelist (in the English dub, he lends it to Yugi to help defeat <a title=""Marik Ishtar"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Marik_Ishtar"">Marik</a>). In later arcs of the anime, he is shown to have it again, which means one of three things. The first being Yugi/Atem beat Joey and gave Red Eyes back to Joey because he deserved it. The second is both Yugi and Joey had a draw and neither of them won or lost but Joey earned back his Red Eyes, or lastly he defeated Yugi in the Duel following the tournament, earning back his Red Eyes. The true result is left for the viewer to decide. In the manga Jonouchi does not use it again, except in <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Millennium World"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Millennium_World"">Millennium World</a>, where he wouldn't necessarily need the actual card, but it is eventually confirmed that he has re-obtained it when he shows the card to Aigami in <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!

Originally this was a pauper deck for a challenge but I modified it and threw some inexpensive cards in.  The Idea behind that deck is to go blind 2nd and break your opponents board. The Tenyi monsters are pretty good extenders and Nahata is able to shine in this case because it basically allows all your vanilla monsters to run over most of the cards your opponent will throw at you.  The Treacherous Trap Hole is in there if you either are forced to go first or the OTK fails.  Giant Ballpark is just a win-condition on it's own. Not only does it allow you to swarm the field for an all out attack, but it also has the ability to save you from OTKs because you can stop 1 attack, send Gokipole and the use it's effect to special summon a vanilla and then pop a monster.  Overall the deck is pretty simple to pilot. You just throw all your stuff at your opponent and hope that it works and if it doesn't make Rafflesia and ontop of that Picofalena increases your grindgame massively because not only are you able to recycle your cards and then draw but on top of that she also allows you to equip a Resonance Insekt or a Gokipole on another Insect which both will trigger their effects if your opponent decides to remove the equipped monster."

Nowadays most cartoons look like garbage, but this isn't an animation review, it's a deck review.</span>  <span>Anyone familiar with Maximillion Pegasus' playstyle in any video game should already have an idea of how this goes, only this time, it's much better. Toons have always been a unique set of monsters, transforming from a gimmicky effect type into their own archetype, and when utilized properly, they can be extremely broken. This deck focuses on summoning Toon monsters, keeping them alive at all costs, and using their special ability of attacking your opponent directly for a win in as little as 2 turns.</span>  <span>Before we begin, there are 3 important factors that ALL Toon monsters share with one another. #1). They cannot attack the turn they are summoned. #2). If <span>Toon World</span> is active and your opponent doesn't have any Toon monsters of their own, they can attack directly. #3). When <span>Toon World</span> is destroyed, all Toon monsters are destroyed. Oddly enough, factor #3 only applies to 3 of the monsters in this deck.

While this card is active, your Toon monsters cannot be targeted by card effects, and if one (or more) would be destroyed by battle or effect, you can simply banish another card from the top of your deck for each one, and keep them alive. When you have <span>Toon World</span> active early on, and 1 or more powerful monsters on the field, banishing cards isn't a big problem; by that time you're probably only a turn or 2 away from getting the dub.</span>  <span>Literally every card in the main deck aside from <span>Necroface</span> and <span>Jar Of Avarice</span> are Toon cards. (<span>Comic Hand</span> works with Toon cards, but is not considered a Toon card). The Spells/Traps offer additional protection and search power, while the monsters all have effects similar to their non-toon counterparts. Aside from the 3 factors mentioned earlier, here </span><span>is what each monster can do:</span> <p><em><strong><span>~Just a reminder, Toon Kingdom's name is treated as Toon World while active on the field~</span></strong></em></p> <span><em><span><span>Red-Eyes Toon Dragon</span></span></em>: Once per turn, Special</span><span> Summon any other Toon monster from the hand, (other than copies of itself) ignoring their summoning conditions. An easy way to bypass Tribute Summoning.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Ancient Gear Golem</span></span></em>: One of the strongest monsters in the deck. Rocking 3000 ATK, when this monster attacks, your opponent cannot activate Spell/Traps until the end of the damage step, and it also inflicts piercing battle damage to defense position monsters; useful when <span>Toon World</span> is not present.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Barrel Dragon</span></span></em>: My personal favorite of the toons. You can target any card on the field then toss a coin 3 times. If at least 2 of the results are heads, the card is destroyed. This can be done once per turn. <span><em><span>Toon Black Luster Soldier</span></em></span>: This guy is busted in just about every aspect. He has 3000 ATK, can banish 1 card every turn if it wants, and is the only Toon monster that can attack the turn he's Summoned. He can only be Special Summoned however, in the same manner that all <span>Ritual Monsters</span> are summoned, by sending monsters from the Hand or Field to the Graveyard whose combined <span>Levels</span> equal 8 or more. <span>Level 4</span>'s work nicely, or if you have your <span>Jar Of Avarice</span> ready, <span>Toon Ancient Gear Golem</span>.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Cyber Dragon</span></span></em>: Can be Special Summoned if you control no monsters and your opponent controls at least 1. This monster can be used to Special Summon <span>Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</span> if your opponent decides they want to Summon monsters to the Extra Zone.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Dark Magician</span></span></em>: By discarding 1 Toon card, you can either Special Summon any other Toon monster from the deck, (other than copies of itself), ignoring their summoning conditions, or add 1 Toon Spell/Trap from the deck to the hand. Easily the most useful monster other than <span>Red-Eyes Toon Dragon</span>.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Gemini Elf</span></span></em>: Discards 1 card from the opponents hand upon inflicting battle damage.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Goblin Attack Force</span></span></em>: Switches to DEF position after attacking, and cannot be switched back for an entire turn. Not a useful effect, but a <span>Level 4</span> monster with 2300 ATK is always a nice thing. Since it has 0 DEF, this guy usually acts as a wall and doesn't attack until a Tribute Summon using it can be performed during Main Phase 2.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Harpie Lady</span></span></em>: Can be Special Summoned while <span>Toon World</span> is active, and if you control at least 1 other Toon monster when you do this, you can destroy 1 of your opponents Spells/Traps.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Mermaid</span></span></em>: Can only be Special Summoned while <span>Toon World</span> is active. This monster doesn't do anything particularly useful, but is a free 1400 ATK Special Summon and be used as Tribute fodder if you already have another monster ready to go.</span>  <span><span>Toon Kingdom</span> has already been covered. Here are the deck's other Toon Spells/Traps:</span>  <span><em><span><span>Comic Hand</span></span></em>: If you control <span>Toon World</span>, use this to steal an opponents monster and turn it into a toon, allowing it to attack directly under the same circumstances as all the other Toon monsters.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Bookmark</span></span></em>: Searches for <span>Toon World</span> or any card that lists <span>Toon World</span> in it's text, aside from itself, and can be banished from the GY to prevent <span>Toon Kingdom</span> from being destroyed once. Extremely useful.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Page-Flip</span></span></em>: Choose 3 toon monsters with different names from your deck, and your opponent picks one for you to Special Summon, ignoring it's summoning conditions, while shuffling the others into the deck. The best options to go with are obviously <span>Red-Eyes Toon Dragon</span>, <span>Toon Dark Magician</span>, <span>Toon Black Luster Soldier</span>, or <span>Toon Ancient Gear Golem</span>.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Table Of Contents</span></span></em>: Add any single Toon card from the deck to your hand.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Briefcase</span></span></em>: While you control a Toon monster, when your opponent summons a monster, shuffle it into the deck. Save this for top-tier threats you cannot overcome, or for disrupting your opponents Extra Deck Summons.</span> <span><em><span><span>Toon Mask</span></span></em>: While <span>Toon World</span> is active, you can Special Summon a Toon monster from the hand or deck whose <span>Level</span> is less than or equal to the <span>Level</span> of one monster they control, ignoring it's summoning conditions.</span>  <span>The last 3 cards left to mention are <span>Necroface</span>, <span>Jar Of Avarice</span>, and <span>Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</span>. These 3 are not Toon cards but serve a unique role in the deck. <span>Necroface</span> exists in this deck as a way to return any of the cards banished by <span>Toon Kingdom</span> (or your opponent's dirty tactics) back into the deck, and it gets a nice ATK bonus for each card returned. <span>Jar Of Avarice</span> is a nice way to recycle cards from your Graveyard, in case all 3 <span>Toon Kingdom's</span> somehow get destroyed, as well as your other Top-Tier Toon cards. Lastly, <span>Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</span> is a <span>Fusion Monster</span> that doesn't require <span>Polymerization</span>, but rather your <span>Toon Cyber Dragon</span> and any monster in the Extra Monster Zone. You can use one of your opponent's monsters, and not only rid the field of a potential nuisance, but have a nice 2400 non-Toon attacker at your disposal. Good stuff mah dude. </span>  <span>That about wraps it up. Beware, if you don't already own some of these cards, mainly the spells, and you don't have a well-paying job or parents who give a generous allowance, then LOL, you probably won't be using this deck.</span>"
