If not, either of the other two <strong>Adamancipator Crystal</strong> monsters will do.  <strong>Adamancipator Researcher</strong> Special Summons herself when you have another Rock-type monster on the field then excavate and special summon <strong>Adamancipator Crystal - Raptite</strong>. If not, the other two will do.  <strong>Admancipator Seeker</strong> summons himself if you have another ""Admancipator"" monster is on the field. Then once again excavate and special summon <strong>Adamancipator Crystal - Leonite</strong> if possible, other wise like the other two go for the other <strong>Adamancipator Crystal</strong> monsters.  Once you have used any of your Tuners' effects, Synchro summon for any of the <strong>Adamancipator Risen</strong> monsters. Your main boss monsters are in order.  <strong>Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</strong>. Not only does he give a strong field advantage when using his excavation skill allowing you to return opponents cards to their hand up to the No. of excavated Rock-type monsters by this effect. During your Opponents turn he can negate any one effect and destroy it as long as you have a WATER monster in your graveyard. Making him a great disruption card.  <strong>Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</strong> allows you to add 1 excavated ""Adamancipator"" card to your hand, and if you have a FIRE monster in your graveyard during your opponents turn you can special summon any Rock-type monster from your graveyard. <strong>Leonite's</strong> first ability is great to add a little extra padding if you are in need of it, or setting up for your next turn.  <strong>Adamancipator Risen - Raptite</strong> is much like the Adamancipator ""Tuners"" in the aspect of special summoning an excavated monster, but this time its not limited to only ""Non-Tuner"" monsters. If you have a WIND monster in your graveyard you can banish one of your opponents cards in their graveyard during their turn. This card is best candidate to Syncrho summoning <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong> using any level 2 ""Tuners"" you may have on hand.  <strong>Adamancipator Laputite</strong> the field spell card allows you to stack your deck and gives a nice 500 ATK and DEF boost to all your Rock-type monsters. So if you are able to summon<strong> Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</strong>, <strong>Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</strong>, and <strong>Adamancipator Risen - Raptite</strong> and have <strong>Adamancipator Laputite</strong> on the field on your first turn. Is a perfect set up for ant FTK. Use <strong>Adamancipator Laputite</strong> to stack the top of your deck with five ""Adamancipator"" monsters then useing <strong>Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</strong> effect to return practically all of your opponents cards to their hand. Basically leaving your opponent wide open for 9,100 worth of damage ending the dual.  If you don't have <strong>Analyzer</strong> in your hand but you have <strong>Doki Doki</strong> plus any of the <strong>Koa'ki Meiru</strong> monsters. This sets you up to search out and summon <strong>Analyzer</strong>. By first normal summoning <strong>Doki Doki</strong> then using <strong>Doki Doki's</strong> effect by discarding the <strong>Koa'ki Meiru</strong> and then proceed to search and summon <strong>Analyzer</strong>. Then excavate, summon and Syncrho summon.  If your <strong>Adamancipator Risen</strong> monster are defeated don't worry too much. As long as their corresponding <strong>Adamancipator Crystal</strong> monster is in the graveyard you can return them to the extra deck as long as they are not banished also recycling the<strong> Adamancipator Crystal</strong> back to the top of your deck.  As for the <strong>Adamancipator Crystals'</strong> first effects. <strong>Dragite's</strong> is the best, when it is special summoned by one of the Apamancipators' effects allows you to draw a card. <strong>Leonite</strong> will allow you to recycle any ""Adamancipator"" card to the top of your deck from your graveyard or your hand. Great for recycling used spell or trap cards. <strong>Raptite</strong> will recycle any Rock-type monster to the top of your deck from either the hand or graveyard. I believe this doesn't need to be said but <em><strong>ALWAYS</strong></em> leave at least one of each <strong>Adamancipator Crystal</strong> monster in the graveyard so you can utilize the Synchro monsters' second effects and you'll have the recycling effects of the Crystal monsters if its needed.  The other extra deck monsters are situational cards or just because I think the look cool (The Red Dragon cards). Generally the deck is consistent enough for the first strategy to fire quickly and fast enough to not be in those situations.  Major weaknesses are cards that prevent Special summoning, Search prevention, and banishing.  Edit: So I took out some cards out of the extra and add different ones. So the main change is that <strong>Old Entity Hastorr</strong> has been added. This was to make <strong>Red Supernova Dragon</strong> viable. However, <strong>Supernova</strong> is still tricky to get out. So summoning <strong>Supernova</strong> is mostly gimmicky but is doable, and if your starting hand is <strong>Doki Doki</strong>, <strong>Analyzer</strong>, <strong>Researcher</strong> x2, or <strong>Seeker</strong> x2, or one of each, and<strong> Adamancipator Signs</strong>. If you go first summon <strong>Doki Doki</strong> and use his effect discarding <strong>Analyzer</strong> to summon another one from your deck. then use <strong>Researcher's</strong> and/or <strong>Seeker's</strong> effect to special summon themselves. You could use the second effect of <strong>Researcher</strong> and/or <strong>Seeker</strong> to excavate. Then synchro summon <strong>Old Entity Hastorr</strong> using <strong>Doki Doki</strong> and which ever tuner you used to excavate. Then use <strong>Adamancipator Signs</strong> to bring back the Turner you used to summon <strong>Hastorr</strong>. Then Syncrho summon for <strong>Red Supernova Dragon</strong>. Then Enjoy your 6000 (due to having 4 tuners in the graveyard) destruction immune beat stick. If you go Second just do the same thing."

The ""Jurrac"" is from way back during the Duel Terminal/Hidden Arsenal era and, even though it pains me to say that, their overall age shows in the power level of the cardboard in question. The archetype itself is consisting entirely of Fire Dinosaur monsters, who (except for some rare cases) do not manage to get over 1700 ATK without a tribute or Extra Deck access and try to lower the opposing life points over the course of multiple turns, since they will most likely not have enough fighting power to OTK to opponent. They also focus on fighting monsters and various members of the archetype profit from destroying opposing monsters in form of being able to use various effects. But despite their shortcomings, they can be used as an effective albeit slow beatdown deck that is easy to play and has some fun plays up its sleeve.</p> <p>The ""Jurrac"" part of the deck is three copies of ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Aeolo"">Jurrac Aeolo</a>"", your Level 1 tuner and a ""<a data-name=""Circle of the Fire Kings"">Circle of the Fire Kings</a>"" on legs exclusively for ""Jurracs"", three copies of ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Guaiba"">Jurrac Guaiba</a>"", since it is the most used and useful beater who Special summons other ""Jurracs"" when destroying monsters in battle, two ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Monoloph"">Jurrac Monoloph</a>"" who can be cloggy due to the low ATK of 1500 but can become a ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" in monster form with ATK boosts or ""<a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>"" and two ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Velo"">Jurrac Velo</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Dino"">Jurrac Dino</a>"" respectively, who are both not that useful but one can potentially still fetch monsters while the other is a Level 3 Tuner monster.</p> <p>Help for the deck comes in form of various other Dinosaur monsters. ""<a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a>"" is really good in any Dinosaur-based deck, which high stats, easy summoning condition, helpful setup and disruption at Quick Effect-speed. One copy of ""<a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>"" is also Special summonable with high stats and can destroy stuff by tributing a ""Dinowrestler"" monster, which in this deck is even possible without ""<a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>"" killing itself due to the Special summonable Level 2 Tuner ""<a data-name=""Dinowrestler Coelasilat"">Dinowrestler Coelasilat</a>"". Two copies of ""<a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a>"" are both setup and search, while I personally like ""<a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a>"" at three, since it not only protects your board but can also just banish itself from the graveyard during your turn to Special summon an ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Aeolo"">Jurrac Aeolo</a>"" from your deck at no additional cost.</p> <p>The Spells and Traps are mostly for consistency and ATK manipulation. On the consistency side of things, we have one ""<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>"" (as either cheeky removal via ""<a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>"" or added material for Synchro summons by summoning ""<a data-name=""Pragtical"">Pragtical</a>""), two ""<a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>"" (since card draw is important and this is the best option to play in this deck since you will miss none of the cards if they are removed), a copy of ""<a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>"" (easy ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Aeolo"">Jurrac Aeolo</a>"" search, who can then either be used for Extra Deck summons or to revive a ""Jurrac"" monster from the graveyard, possibly even the one you discarded as cost), two ""<a data-name=""Fossil Dig"">Fossil Dig</a>"" (Dinosaur searcher) and one ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" (as setup for ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Aeolo"">Jurrac Aeolo</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a>"") . On the ATK manipulation side, we have ""<a data-name=""Lost World"">Lost World</a>"" (protection for your Dinosaur monsters, easy monster summoning to the opponent's side of the field for later battle destruction and ATK decrease for pretty much every your opponent is going to play), two ""<a data-name=""Rocket Hand"">Rocket Hand</a>"" (ATK booster with added removal) and two ""<a data-name=""Rising Fire"">Rising Fire</a>"" (slightly weaker ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" effect, but adds 500 ATK to the revived monster and banishes something when being destroyed).</p> <p>The Extra Deck usage is rather situational. There are Link, Xyz and Synchro monsters, which a lot of monster combinations in the deck being able to summon something useful to the field, but due to the nature of the deck, you cannot always go into the same options since you will not have the necessary resources to do so. ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Dolkka"">Evolzar Dolkka</a>"" are really good Stun monsters and relatively easy to summon in this deck, the Link monsters really just cover your bases when the monsters combinations on the field don't allow for anything else (""<a data-name=""Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze"">Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze</a>"" as a recovery tool, ""<a data-name=""Duelittle Chimera"">Duelittle Chimera</a>"" as a stat booster, and the ""Knightmare"" monsters for graveyard setup and destruction effects). The Synchro line-up consists of ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Velphito"">Jurrac Velphito</a>"" (kills certain ""<a data-name=""Marshmallon"">Marshmallon</a>""-esque monsters if necessary) and ""<a data-name=""Hi-Speedroid Chanbara"">Hi-Speedroid Chanbara</a>"" (double attacker which gets more powerful for every attack) for Level 5, ""<a data-name=""Coral Dragon"">Coral Dragon</a>"" for Level 6 (more of a filler, since combinations like ""<a data-name=""Dinowrestler Coelasilat"">Dinowrestler Coelasilat</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a>"" rarely happen, but offers a destruction effect and card draw when destroyed), and ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" (board-wipe) and ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Giganoto"">Jurrac Giganoto</a>"" (alternative beatstick) for Level 7. The last two monsters are ""<a data-name=""Dinowrestler Giga Spinosavate"">Dinowrestler Giga Spinosavate</a>"", who plays very well in the deck by aggroing opposing attacks while offering 3000 ATK and a solid set of effects, and ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Meteor"">Jurrac Meteor</a>"", which is the actual boss monster of the ""Jurrac"" archetype and offers the same effect as ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" for more costs, but summons a ""Jurrac"" Tuner from your graveyard afterwards. I would only ever go into ""Meteor"" if the opponent is weak enough to be finished by a 1700 ATK ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Dino"">Jurrac Dino</a>"", otherwise it is probably not worth summoning it.</p> <p>And that is the deck. ""Jurracs"" are sadly not even close to being a viable archetype, but they are easy to learn and understand, which could make them a nice first deck for beginners.

The deck wants to go first. It doesn't brick much at all and since it has so many engines built into it the deck has so many recovery plays its insane. By using <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> to send the Shaddoll engine to the grave to search and recover <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism. And all the Golden Land cards have graveyard effects plus are tribute fodder for the True Draco monsters which is amazing. The engines have so much synergy with each other. Not to mention that sending the True Draco spells and traps using the Golden Lord triggers their effects which is really good. Also, for those who are confused about why Crystron Haqlifibrax is in the extra deck, its because its a Cherry's target since basically every deck is playing it right now. In my opinion using Cherry's to get rid of it makes your opponent at a huge disadvantage especially for those synchro variant decks where they go into </a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon with Haqlifibrax and another machine monster... Without Haqlifibrax they'll need some other machine monster(s) to go into full synchro combo. I hope you guys enjoy the deck, and stick around for more!</a>"

It's fairly consistent but suffers from interruptions, which is why the deck is not going to be meta in its current iteration. It's too reliant on Magistus Zoroa (the tuner that allows searching through Artemis, special summon, AND Halqi access) to pull off its shenanigans. That is why the deck does not have enough hand traps; they reduce the consistency with which you can play Zoroa turn 1. Hard draw, summoner monk, Artemis search through Endymion, foolish burial or Crowley + Vritra Magistus—these are the ways for getting to Zoroa.  &nbsp;  The strategy is to somehow have Masquerena and Halqi on the field (Zoroa search and special summon helps with this a lot). Your target for Halqi is O-Lion. Then, you get Linkross from Halqi, which will grant you two tokens. Then, link summon Metal Marcher and get a level 3 token plus revive your Zoroa. Then, you can synchro summon Savage from the 2 tokens (3+1) and Zoroa (4). You can summon Crusadia Avramax with Marcher, Masquerena, and Linkross.  &nbsp;  If you have an extender plus a Dogmatika in hand or if you have Reborn, you can even summon Halqi a second time for shenanigans during the opponent's turn. For instance, after negating with Savage, you can summon Formula Synchron for a draw, then you can synchro summon using Formula's effect for Stardust Warrior, which will give you a summon negation and a floating effect if it gets removed.  &nbsp;  If you have only one extender (like a spare Dogmatika), you can change the play around a bit. With Linkross, just summon 1 token instead of 2. Then, do the combo normally until you get Crusadia Avramax. Afterwards, alongside Avramax, you will have Zoroa, O-lion token, and your extender (Dogmatika for example). Summon your second Halqi with Zoroa and level 4 extender (NOT TOKEN). Then, next turn, summon Wonder Magician with Halqi for S/T pop, after which you can summon Savage dragon with Wonder Magician's effect and your level 3 token. If you want, you can change your ED so that with Halqi, you can summon Desert Locusts into Ravenous Crocodragon. Personally, I prefer getting Savage for negation but in some matches, the card ripping effect of Locusts may become relevant.  &nbsp;  Overall, the deck is obviously not going to compete with the meta decks, because of its vulnerability to interruptions. Also, because it has a hard time going second due to the lack of hand traps. However, it's a really fun deck to pilot because of the complexity and the satisfaction of beating opponents down with Avramax.  &nbsp;  Please feel free to suggest edits, both for the Main Deck and the ED/SD.  &nbsp;"

You would activate Black Garden, then normal summon a musket. That would then trigger Black Garden to give your opponent a token. Once you do that, you can go into Max. Due to how the chain works, you can have Black Garden be Chain Link 2 to give your opponent the token, then use Max effect to search 2. The only problem with this strategy is that it leaves Max somewhat vulnerable, so I would recommend playing cards that can restrict your opponent from killing your Max, preferably Mystic Mine, although you could use anything that protects Max from battle. Outside of the musket cards and black garden, you could run essentially whatever other cards you wish for the deck. This build uses eXceed for Bagooska plays in case you either need a floodgate that can help protect Max if you don't have access to Mine and Extravagance adds needed draw power to a deck that needs it. If you can't afford Extravagance, you could play Desires instead and doing so could also allow you to have a more open extra deck while also allowing some musket effects to go off. Do keep in mind that banishing the targets for Max does suck, so be careful with that. It isn't a perfect list by far, but I think it does add a going first option for Muskets that I felt like they lacked. If there is any advice you could give me, that would be great. I hope you enjoy the build and have fun! :)"

My first thought about the <strong>Armed Dragon Thunder</strong> monsters were that ""Holy crap, this is so good (for a retrain)."" We are using <strong>Armed Dragon Thunder LV 3</strong> and <strong>Armed Dragon Flash</strong> as a <strong>Rokket Quick Launch</strong> substitute with<strong> LV 3</strong> being more card advantage if it is discarded. This deck (from what I got out of testing) can make at least 2 negates and some large bodies (I'm not the best combo player so don't take my word for it; a good combo player can find ways to make more negates).  This deck needs grave set-up early game to have some revival effects be used.<strong> Dragunity Remus, Dragon Shrine, Dragon Ravine</strong>, and<strong> Cards of Consonance</strong> allow for this. Possible starters for this deck include any of the effects that activate upon a normal summon. These include <strong>Dragunity Aklys, Dragunity Dux, Dragunity Guisarme,</strong> or <strong>Armed Dragon Flash</strong> (to get to <strong>Romulus</strong> or <strong>Guardragons</strong>). Your follow-up is using <strong>Dragunity Arma Mystletainn</strong> to get a possible Synchro material and a <strong>Dragunity</strong> Tuner from when it specials after being equipped. <strong>Dragunity Divine Lance</strong> does the same thing by equipping a <strong>Dragunity</strong> tuner from the deck.  Extenders include literally any non-opt summon from spell/trap zone <strong>Dragunity</strong> Tuner, <strong>Dragunity Arma Gram, Dragunity Remus</strong>, and <strong>Dragunity Legatus</strong>. These special summon themselves for you to get extra link or synchro material. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Barcha</strong> is a great extender, but it's difficult to make once you get deep into your <strong>Guardragon</strong> combo since it needs Winged Beasts.  Searchers include <strong>Dragunity Glow, Dragon Ravine, Dragunity Knight - Romulus</strong>, and <strong>Dragunity Divine Lance.</strong>  Extra Deck includes <strong>Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana</strong> which is a decent option instead of <strong>Barcha,</strong> but it's only here if you can't make<strong> Barcha</strong>. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Luin</strong> is the better option than<strong> Vajrayana</strong> if you can make it. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg</strong> is a searcher and grave set-up. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Barcha</strong> is the best play extender, but is hard to make after your <strong>Guardragon</strong> combo. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Ascalon</strong> is a potential removal option going second, but is a way better floater going first. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Areadbhair</strong> is one of your negates and a <strong>Heavy Storm</strong> when destroyed. <strong>Borreload Savage</strong> because it's an omni-negate, but it does not destroy (WTF???). <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong> is another negate and is an okay choice of negation in this format. <strong>Borrelsword Dragon</strong> is for going second big brrrrrr damage. <strong>Saryuja</strong> is a play extender and another choice for a play extender. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Romulus</strong> is the major extender in this deck. <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres</strong> is a bounce and a floater. <strong>Triple Burst Dragon, Guardragon Pisty</strong>, and <strong>Guardragon Elpy</strong> are for your <strong>Guardragon</strong> Combo.  Side Deck has<strong> Koa'ki Meru Drago</strong> for prevention of <strong>Golden Lord</strong>,<strong> Borreload Savage</strong>, <strong>Borrelsword</strong>, and <strong>Chaos Dragons</strong>(?). <strong>Dragunity of the Hurricane</strong> is for going second or playing on your opponent's turn. <strong>Cosmic</strong> is for more backrow removal. <strong>Called By the Grave</strong> is here if you go against a handtrap-ccentric deck. <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> for the negations.  I really want to make an<strong> Armed Dragon Thunder</strong> deck, but I'm still thinking of a possible engine to put in instead of just simply<strong> Guardragons</strong>.  &nbsp;"

Instead of making a level 5 ressing an Infernoble monster, I'm opting to make Cryston Quandax. However, rather than just enabling a path to True King of All Calamities, I've made the board Savage + Crocodragon + Charles, with Savage + Charles as reasonably anti-nibiru combo when you have access to Gearfried, by summoning the Plaguespreader off of Halqifibrax, and using Cryston Quandax + a level 4 to make Power Tool Dragon to ressurect it.  For those unfamiliar with the deck, Infernoble is a combo deck, which has a gameplan largely resolving around using Infernoble Emperor Charles in combination with Smoke Grenade of the Thief to be a big boss monster (with potentially good protection) that pulls cards out of your hand, and protects this with negates. These are generally Isolde turbo decks, that aim to take advantage of all the good combo cards available in the format. This particular version can turn 1 Isolde into True King of All Calamities + a Borreload Savage Dragon (Or Crocodragon + Charles, useful when you pick back up Smoke Grenade to loop hands a second time).  Combo #1 - Bread and Butter  1 - Summon Isolde, add a card to the hand  2 - Isolde effect, send 4 (including Phoenix Blade and Smoke Grenade), summon Armageddon Knight, send Plaguespreader Zombie  3 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens  4 - Put 1 card from your hand on top of your deck - summon Plaguespreader Zombie (don't use Phoenix Blade)  5 - Synchro Zombie + 1 token into Martial Metalmarcher. Since zombie is banished it summons nothing. This feels bad, but making Power Tool a tuner is important.  6 - Synchro Metalmarcher + Arma Knight into Power Tool Dragon, add D.D.R to your hand  7 - Link Power Tool + Linkross into Halqifibrax, summon Deskbot 001  8 - Link Deskbot + Halqifibrax into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens, summon Deskbot from the GY  9 - Synchro Deskbot + the level 1 token + 1 level 3 token into Roland  10 - Auroradon effect, tribute the 2 tokens, summon Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing, Coltwing effect summon 2 tokens, Deskbot effect summons itself from GY  11 - Synchro Deskbot + 1 token into Herald of the Arc Light  12 - Because of its effect, Coltwing will be a level 7 monster. You can use Phoenix Blade's effect to add itself to your hand, then discard it for D.D.R. which summons Plaguespreader Zombie.  13 - Synchro Plaguespreader Zombie + Coltwing into Charles  14 - Synchro Roland + token into Savage.  This is the combo that you're going to end on a lot of the time, and is the go-to when you know it is safe. It puts the most # of negates on the board, and takes the slightest toll on your hand. It uses up all of your zones, so when you see Gearfried, go for an anti-nibiru combo.  Combo #2 - True King + Negate (or Hand Snipe)  1 - Summon Isolde, add a card to the hand  2 - Isolde effect, send 3 (including Phoenix Blade and Smoke Grenade), summon Crusadia Arboria  3 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens  4 - Link Linkross + Arboria into Crystron Halqifibrax, summon Plaguespreader Zombie  5 - Synchro Zombie + token into Martial Metalmarcher, summon Arboria  6 - Synchro Arboria + token into Crystron Quandax  7 - You CAN use the Quandax to link into Auroradon, leaving Metalmarcher on the field, and there are combos in the deck that do that, but for this combo, Link Metalmarcher + Needlefibre into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens  8 - Synchro Quandax + token into Power Tool Dragon, add D.D.R to the hand  9 - Auroradon effect, tribute 2 tokens, summon Coltwing, summon 2 tokens  10 - Put on card from you hand into your deck, summon Plaguespreader Zombie (Do no use the Sword!)  11 - Synchro Plaguespreader Zombie + Power Tool Dragon into Charles  12 - Use Phoenix Blade's effect, add it to the hand  13 - Activate D.D.R., discard Phoenix Blade, summon Plaguespreader Zombie  14 - Synchro Plaguespreader + Token into Roland  15 - Summon Plaguespreader Zombie with its effect (you can use Phoenix Blade this time, but you aren't guaranteed the monsters, and often Infernoble monsters are more valuable in the GY)  16 - Since Coltwings effect makes it a level 7, synchro into Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys (you pick back up what you put in your deck)  17 - Synchro Roland + token into Savage  This combo is good for when you know you're going up against a monster mash deck. Adamancipator is the best example of this, but against a lot of decks a True King is just G.G. The other time you'll use this combo is to snipe hands with Crocodragon, for when you see a Smoke Grenade naturally, or can pick one up with Renaud. Here we see the weaknessess and strengths of Plaguespreader Zombie in full effect - it isn't once per turn, but putting cards into the deck is not fun. But if you're feeling the card disadvantage, and you have Smoke Grenade of the Thief in your hand, this is a targeted way to snipe an extra card from their hand, or an extra disruption on their turn. The negate is generally more valuable than this, but it could vary, especially if you snipe hands early and see multiple outs, or think Calamities is good in the matchup. (he has to be more valuable than Charles + an interaction, or the equivalent of 3 interruptions, which is hard)  But what if you want to play Gearfried? Let's face it, Infernoble has many strengths, and Gearfried is one of them. Well, you can start combos with Gearfried pretty easily, any time you see it alongside an equip, or see the right Infernoble cards together, especially since we're running Ingnoble Knight of High Laundsallyn to secure that Renaud + Ogier play. When you do see Gearfried, summon him as normal, and go through the following combo.  Combo #3 - Anti-Nibiru Savage + Charles  1 - Isolde, search a card  2 - Isolde effect, send 4 for Oliver (by now you should realize how important Phoenix Blade and Smoke Grenade are)  3 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens  4 - Link Oliver + Linkross into Halqifibrax, summon Plaguespreader Zombie  5 - Synchro Plaguespreader Zombie + token into Martial Metalmarcher, summon Oliver  6 - Synchro Oliver + token into Roland (effect)  7 - Link Metalmarcher + Needlefibre into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens  8 - Synchro Oliver + token into Borreload Savage Dragon  9 - Summon Plaguespreader Zombie with its effect, putting a card from your hand into your deck  10 - Tribute Auroradon + token into Coltwing (since you put a card into your deck before this, it could be coltwing). Its effect doesn't activate.  11 - Coltwing is a level 7, so badabing, badaboom, you have Oliver.  12 - You just have an extra token here, so you can make Herald if you have an unused Oliver or Renaud in your hand.  This combo changes by the hour. I've figured out a way to get to Charles + Savage that puts up an extra token, and uses Coltwing, so 1 fewer brick. This combo also goes through Oliver, so better protection on Charles.  I've added in the Tatsunoko and Omega to the main deck, by cutting Ignoble Knight and Isolde. Ignoble Knight is only good for anti-Nibiru combos in this deck, and only for some of them, so I'm fine cutting it, and the back-up Isolde isn't really as good turn 2, or useful if they negate Isolde's second effect. I hate losing Ignoble Knight, but I like having even more hand-looping potential. I've added a second Living Fossil so that we can add a second copy after sending a copy, in case we Monster Reborn or somehow D.D.R a Power Tool Dragon.  Cut the Calamities combo to put back in Ignoble Knight, for more Gearfried starts, as well as Instant Fusion with Invoked Raidjin as an extender. I kept the tutorial in, in case somebody wanted to run the combo. I almost never made Calamities that way anyways, and having extra extenders helps the deck play through interactions. I'm liking 2 Aqua Dolphin, 2 Living Fossil. Aqua Dolphin is a very good normal summon in the deck in its own right, and Living Fossil is a good extender. D.D.R. is similarly not a brick, and can actually extend you through hand traps.  There's definitely some play to these combos. I've found Power Tool is not always necessary to make your ultimate board, but I do like the consistency boost and combo potential it and D.D.R add to the deck.  I'm up to 2 Power Tool Dragon now. Pak is right, it's useful for comboing off through bricks, or for extending combos further. I replaced Instant Fusion with E-Teleport. While this forces you to go through Needlefibre (I'd always rather start with Isolde+Linkross) it also extends into Needlefibre, and even just the Needlefibre combo is pretty sweet. With good play and correct extenders, you can make some pretty insane boards through interruptions while hand looping for multiple cards."

One tricky part of the deck is that Moulinglacia NEEDS to be summoned for the combo to work, but the nice thing about this combo is that it leaves plenty of space to play around in the extra deck. On the other hand, other combo decks have been hit pretty hard, and between Deep Sea Minstrel, Triple T, and Moulinglacia it can hand loop for 4 cards while setting up Calamities, which is pretty hard to out.  Deep Sea Diva is full combo, as is Abyssteus + Dragoons, Neptabyss + Moulinglacia, Neptabyss + Dragoons, Deep Sea Minstrel + Dragoons, and a slew of 3 card combos, especially involving Deep Sea Aria."

Here comes what will certainly be this format's darling for combo players, Karakuri Shogun.  The deck certainly doesn't have Block Dragon anymore. But now instead of your basic Halq combo ending on Raptite + a couple of monsters, it can end on Raptite + Savage/Dragite. The huuuuge downside is that this combo uses up all of your zones, so ideally a Linkross combo will be discovered to replace this, but in the meantime it gives you a chance to actually get on the board with Adamans, without getting lucky on your hits. The other big downside is no Apollousa for you, since Auroradon locks you out of Links, so in all probability, this is just a stop-gap. Having said that, the deck wasn't hit quite as hard as I thought it was.  I lied, you do have exactly 1 monster slot open for Koa'ki Meiru Guardian. That's awesome."

First start is mainly about getting mechaba and an ecclesia out so you can start searching dogs while still having a negate. Ideally want to get shaddoll schism first turn so you can go into winda on your opponents turn. If your board is still intact after the second turn it is pretty easy to go into invoker of madness or BLS. Plenty of hand traps for going second. I like playing three knighted because you can actually throw it out there on your opponents first turn so if you have another in your hand you already have a negate set up or it sets your field to go into invoker of maddness next turn by linking something into almiraj. Anyway, any feedback would be much appreciated, and thanks for taking a look!  &nbsp;  Also looking for advice on side deck options if you cannot tell!"

Plaguespreader Zombie forcing you to put a card back on top of the deck is much worse than discarding, especially in Edlich, and you have to run a lot more bricks. It also doesn't leave a lot of room to play around with, you're basically just running Eldlich cards and a zombie synchro combo with hand traps. On the other hand, you only have to run 1 of each brick, since Zombie lets you put them back into your deck, and Uni-Zombie is an incredible starter option in Eldlich, since it can discard Eldlich cards for free while sending Plaguespread, and vice versa.  Sorry combo doesn't work, took out the one that did. Wish you could take these down.  &nbsp;"

This is achieved through control with hand traps and, hate to say this, Mystic Mine  Sky striker cards are exceptional when going second through popping your opponents monsters and backrow with afterburners, and negating and stealing your opponents monsters.  Hand trap lineup is extremely flexible although I effect veilers are mandatory as a 2-of at least.  Book of Moon is there to provide some first turn plays by shutting off your opponents synchro and link plays, and forcing out negations and reactions going second.  Instead of Triple Tactics Talent you can easily play with either 3 Pot of desires or (my favorite) 1 Averice and 2 desires. Arguably it could be better to ditch TTT since it hardly does anything for Sky Strikers going first.  Forbidden droplet can be switched for Dark Ruler No More or Evenly Matched depending on the meta at your locals or regionals.  &nbsp;"

They piqued my interest during the ""Create-a-card"" contest Konami is still holding at the time of writing this. The archetype, unfortunately, did not manage to get out of the first round, but it certainly sparked some interest in people. ""Hazy Flame"" is an archetype that consists entirely of Level 6 Fire monster with their unique shared effect being that they all cannot be targeted by the opposing card effects. The goal is to summon multiple of those Level 6 monsters to summon various Rank 6 Xyz monsters and win the game using the effects of your assembled Extra Deck force.</p><p>The combination of needing both Level 6 and the Fire Attribute is fairly restrictive, meaning that you will have to stay in the archetype to gain access the Extra Deck. But thankfully, there are some options to work with on that end. ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Peryton"">Hazy Flame Peryton</a>"" is your main playstarter and can be Normal summoned via ""<a data-name=""Hazy Pillar"">Hazy Pillar</a>"" without tribute, who can Special summon two ""Hazy Flames"" by tributing itself and discarding another Fire monster. This allows you to search for any combination of ""Hazy Flame"" monsters, but an especially useful combo is picking double ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"", which locks you into summoning Fire monsters but not only can be used to summon the very powerful ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Solda"">Evolzar Solda</a>"", but also give whatever monster you Xyz summon using them additional Xyz materials from the graveyard (which you already setup via the effect of ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Peryton"">Hazy Flame Peryton</a>"").</p><p>""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Griffin"">Hazy Flame Griffin</a>"" can be Special summoned from the hand if your opponent controls a monster and if everything in your graveyard and on your board is Fire Attribute, but can also be cheated out via ""<a data-name=""Fire King Island"">Fire King Island</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Cerbereus"">Hazy Flame Cerbereus</a>"" has a handy effect to Normal summon itself without tribute and is your main searcher in the deck who is triggered by being destroyed; something that both ""<a data-name=""Fire King Island"">Fire King Island</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Goka, the Pyre of Malice"">Goka, the Pyre of Malice</a>"" happily do for it. ""<a data-name=""Fire King Island"">Fire King Island</a>"" can even destroy it in hand and therefore allows you to access the first combo I named without losing the Normal Summon slot to ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Cerbereus"">Hazy Flame Cerbereus</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Sphynx"">Hazy Flame Sphynx</a>"" has no summon help itself, but can potentially fetch a monster by guessing the top card of your deck correctly (since the deck is mostly monsters, I would suggest guessing that most of the time).</p><p>Further summoning options in the deck are ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"", since ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Cerbereus"">Hazy Flame Cerbereus</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hyppogrif"">Hazy Flame Hyppogrif</a>"" have 200 DEF. This is also the only reason why ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hyppogrif"">Hazy Flame Hyppogrif</a>"" is in the deck at one copy. ""<a data-name=""Fire King Arvata"">Fire King Arvata</a>"" is the searchable card for ""<a data-name=""Fire King Island"">Fire King Island</a>"" and provides effect negation in addition to being a more summonable monster if you cannot access anything else. ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Megachirella"">Evoltile Megachirella</a>"" might seem weird, but it can trade itself against ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"" with relative ease while also potentially refueling ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Solda"">Evolzar Solda</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Hieratic Dragon of Tefnuit"">Hieratic Dragon of Tefnuit</a>"" is not a Fire monster, but can Special summon itself if the opponent controls a monster and also fetches the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Tyhone #2"">Tyhone #2</a>"" when being used as tribute, which together with ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Peryton"">Hazy Flame Peryton</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"" could summon your boss monster at maximum power with five materials.</p><p>The backrow was mostly mentioned already: ""<a data-name=""Fire King Island"">Fire King Island</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Hazy Pillar"">Hazy Pillar</a>"" are there for consistency reasons, while ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" not only has the task of providing Xyz material but also could accrue a full board of ~2000 ATK monster, which can be used for a surprising beatdown strategy. ""<a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>"" searches for ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Megachirella"">Evoltile Megachirella</a>"" (albeit this way of accessing ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"" will cost quite a few hand cards), ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" is the usual graveyard summoning tool while ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" allows for graveyard setup. The two ""<a data-name=""Hieratic Seal of Convocation"">Hieratic Seal of Convocation</a>"" allow for the search of ""<a data-name=""Hieratic Dragon of Tefnuit"">Hieratic Dragon of Tefnuit</a>"" and further boost the otherwise weak consistency and ""<a data-name=""Celestial Observatory"">Celestial Observatory</a>"" can add copies of ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"" or other monsters you potentially do not need in the hand to the deck and refreshes your hand.</p><p>Since I already mentioned the boss monster: ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Basiltrice"">Hazy Flame Basiltrice</a>"" was (and still is) the main goal to summon in ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame"">Hazy Flame</a>"". This fiery chicken has sizeable stats, a banish effect and added protection at five materials, but sadly dies rather easily to ""Kaijus"". Other than that, the Extra Deck is filled with a variety of options to go into in certain situations: ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Beyond"">Number 39: Utopia Beyond</a>"" supports the beatdown strategy by lowering the opposing monster line-up to zero attack, ""<a data-name=""Constellar Ptolemy M7"">Constellar Ptolemy M7</a>"" bounces monsters you can not destroy, ""<a data-name=""Photon Strike Bounzer"">Photon Strike Bounzer</a>"" is a potential turn one play which can block opposing monster effects, ""<a data-name=""Number 6: Chronomaly Atlantis"">Number 6: Chronomaly Atlantis</a>"" is just a beatstick, ""<a data-name=""Jinzo - Layered"">Jinzo - Layered</a>"" is a ""<a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a>"" on legs and therefore steals opposing monsters/defenses and ""<a data-name=""Fairy Knight Ingunar"">Fairy Knight Ingunar</a>"" bounces the entire field except himself. ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Solda"">Evolzar Solda</a>"" was already mentioned, but it is probably the best control option you can get on the field turn one and, since you normally use ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"" to summon it, will have four materials attached to it instead of the usual two. The Link options mostly stay untouched, but ""<a data-name=""Duelittle Chimera"">Duelittle Chimera</a>"" can be useful for the aforementioned ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" beatdown while they all serve as easy options to go into if you do not have any better options to go into with the ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" resources (since those monsters are banished at the end of the turn).</p><p>So much for the strategy. I have to add that ""Hazy Flame"" is pretty bricky due to the usage of Level 6 monsters and being without any good Attribute support cards to boost their consistency (since Fire does not provide much helpful generic support). The deck can be stopped with relative ease if the opponent can throw a negate into your plays and there will be times in which your starting hand does not provide any playable solutions at all. Also, the archetype has problems with doing anything other than putting some Xyz monsters on the field (not unlike the ""Battleguards"", which do essentially the same but with Rank 5 Xyz). All of these things are good reasons for Konami to re-visit the archetype in the future with some support.</p><p>If you are interested to read more about the ""Hazy Flame"" archetype (or various other archetypes), feel free to visit my blog via the link here: <a href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/09/13/archetype-analysis-hazy-flame/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/09/13/archetype-analysis-hazy-flame/</a></p>"

With Infinity, Sieger and the Borel Dragons you have some back role, if you can't finish the game in one turn. Power Bond doubles the ATK of the summoned monster but inflict damage to you based on the original ATK by the summoned monster. In the best case you summon Cyber Twin Dragon with it. It has 5600 ATK with two attacks. Sieger helps you surviving by it's effect. Infinity is a very good interupt and it's effect is once per copy, so you can use multiple Infinitys. I added Yata to the decklist. The reason is very simple. If you normal summon ""Cyber Dragon Core"" to use it's effekt, you can't use the effect of e.g. ""Cyber Dragon Drei"". Also it's just lv 2. Yata allows you to tribute Core and specail summon Yata instead. Yata is Lv 5 and a good way to go for Infinity, if necessary. Cyber Load Fusion and Cybernetic Overflow has a very good synergy. You have some hand traps to stop your opponent making plays and Called by the Grave to avoid hand traps. The combopotential is very hughe so you should take some time and test around. But always remember: This decks wants to kill your oponent in the first turn you can attack."

(to get into your other draitrons)                                                                                  Activate nova and summon alpha from the deck, then link off alpha into linkuriboh                                                  Activate cyber emergency, search for zeta, then activate alphas effect pitching zeta and searching for cyber angel benten.                                                                                                                                                                          Now you have a level 1 on the field, you can activate where arf thou and search for delta                                          Activate Zeta and send delta to search for your ritual spell                                                                                                Then activate gamma and send benten, special summon delta using gammas eff and search for diviner of the herald off of benten's eff  Moving on to the second part of the combo:  Normal summon diviner of the heralds and send herald of the arc light to the GY, then search for the ritual you want to summon (normally DRA)                                                                                                                             Link off linkuriboh and diviner of the heralds to summon halqifibrax, which goes into PSY-gamma (DON'T ACTIVATE FAFNIR IN RESPONSE TO PSY-GAMMAS SUMMON IT'LL STOP THE COMBO)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Use PSY-gamma and delta to summon metalmarcher, and resummon gamma                                                            Now use halqifibrax, PSY-gamma, metalmarcher and one of your draitrons to summmon 4 neg apollousa  (the normal combo doesnt go into delta i was just very lucky so you would go into 3 neg apollousa and spare the other draitron)                                                                                                                                                                              Activate delta's eff in the GY to send DRA and summon itself, you can then reveal your ritual spell and draw 1   Now you can activate your ritual spell and summon DRA from the GY using gamma and alpha                               Recur your ritual spell by lowering the attack of zeta then resummon linkuriboh.  &nbsp;  ===Follow-Up Plays===  In your next turns you can load up your graveyard with more ritual monsters to easily summon using the engine you've developed, these plays can do a lot of different things depending on what the board state is like  By summoning alpha from the grave using its eff and sending your summoned ritual monster (or rituals or draitrons you've used for turn) you can search for a ritual monster (take your pick). You can send that searched ritual to grave to summon gamma which can resummon another one of your draitrons. then you can use your ritual spell to go into any of your rituals and if you need to you can recur it the same turn and summon two rituals (although this normally requires you to draw into a draitron for turn). Rinse and repeat to keep building up your board.  Additionally during your follow-up turns or your first turn if you can't go into standard combo, you can go through your invoked plays for extra bodies and mechaba interuption.  ===Invoked combo===  The invoked combo is fairly simple, normal summon aleister to search invocation, link off aleister into almiraj and then into secure gardna. Use aleister and secure gardna to summon mechaba then recycle aleister for next turn. Then next turn you can use almiraj in the GY to summon purgatrio or if mechaba was outed you can use mechaba in GY to summon another one.  &nbsp;  ===Other Plays===  By searching and sending Cyber angel natasha during your follow-up plays (or first turn if you draw into it) you can banish your benten from the grave to summon natasha and take control of one of your opponents monsters, then natasha can give you some free life points (always nice to have especially if you used where arf thou)  If you have sauravis you can ritual summon it off of 2 draitrons (one with 1000 less ATK from recurring meteornis) which so you can negate one of your opponents special summons by bouncing sauravis to your hand, by discarding sauravis you can negate an effect from your opponent which targets. (sauravis is normally going to be sided out because its quite situational but if you want to take it out the main deck completely feel free to do so, i haven't had a change to evaluate it much)  If your opponent manages to deal with your board, and you can get out 2 of your draitron monsters, you can easily go into Negalogia AA Zeus via Lyrilusc to wipe the board and get a big beater on the board  I've also thrown in Masquerena and unicorn for some extra interruption as well as borrelsword if thats your thing.  ===Side Deck===  The side deck in this decklist is more for other plays and mini combos you can run (you could even side the 6 card invoked engine instead of maining it)  The Nekroz monsters provide powerful going first and second effects which are great at dealing with your opponent. (I havent really played much nekroz so there may be other cards that would work in the deck better than these ones)  If you want to you can run waking the dragon to summon out powerful extra deck monsters without much effort (doesn't really work here because i don't run any traps so just swap it out for generic side deck cards if you want to)  &nbsp;  ===Other Notes===  I don't play linkross or the V.F.D synchro package because i don't personally like them and i find them to be very O.P and quite toxic, but thats just me.                                                                                                                           I didn't run dragoon cuz my friends bully me for always playing it.  &nbsp;  ===Updated=== <ul>  	<li>Added Invoked Augoeides for more options with the invoked engine</li>  	<li>Fixed the startegy guide so its readable</li>  	<li>Increased the size of the Draitron Package for better Consistency</li> </ul> &nbsp;  If you've read this your probably intrigued by this deck so please give it a like and share it so i have something to brag about i guess"

It's somewhat synchro based, but the fusion aspect of Amazoness is still there. I tried to keep overly expensive cards out of the deck, but couldn't get it as cheap as I would have originally liked. Some of the cards are pretty expensive; mainly the Knightmare Links, Red-Eyes Darkness Dragoon, the Predaplant link, and Crystron Halqifibrax. The deck will cost around 200 dollars USD, but that's mainly due to the engines. Garden Rose Maiden is a nice side deck option but is not necessary especially when considering her price."

A new set, a new Time Thief-related deck, and a new outlook on things to come. I dunno what's gotten into me or what has me so attached to these win-pilfering boogers, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  So what's new? Well, I'd say a good bit. For one, Phantom Rage is on its way to grace us with new support for practically any DARK Xyz build (basically my immediate thought when seeing the list was ""Indirect Time Thief support""). For another, Rusty Bardiche is FINALLY playable again after the madness that was early Orcust decks, although it came at the cost of two CBtG's and freedom from Harpie's Feather Duster. And for a final, I'd say along with my new experience and outlook in life in general, so too has mine towards these guys become.  Without further ado, here it is. My latest Time Thief build, with friends new and old to really push them to the next level. Capable of card-snatching, non-targeting bounceback, and a way of using Traps that just really, really tends to get me. We'll go in order of archetypes this time, to really go over each component of the deck and their roles in what we aim to do; pop off with these bad boys by messing with heads and firing back if our foe tries anything nasty. <h2>Time Thieves</h2> These are the handsome devils debuting in Savage Strike the OCG was starved for quite a bit, but then they starved all ten of us players of it back with another key Xyz support monster until Ignition Assault. Fortunately that conflict's come and gone, and now it's time for them to get to work with some fellow DARK monsters of all walks of life. As follows are the Doctor Who, Persona 5, whatever kind of lookalikes you think them to be dorks in full. <ul>  	<li>Who's a good boy? It's <a data-name=""Time Thief Regulator"">Time Thief Regulator</a>, the first of our pilferers and a key one at that. Bringing him out while you have a barren field allows you to Tribute him so he can fetch two of his fellow Time Thieves with different names from the deck. Beware of the looming Ash Blossom, Ghost Ogre, and Effect Veiler however, because if any of these come this pooch's way, your heist is bound to end in seconds. But fret not, we run a certain tribe of beasts as a backup plan.</li>  	<li>What's a dog without his trainer? The aforementioned Regulator is best friend to our next main three-of, <a data-name=""Time Thief Winder"">Time Thief Winder</a>. Summoning him in any way will do for his effect well, which adds any Time Thief card other than himself from deck to hand. What you search for may depend on what's already in your hand or GY. Speaking of hands, he can summon himself from the hand just by detaching a material from an Xyz monster you control, so Xyz Summoning just before bringing him out is a good application as well.</li>  	<li>The Time Thieves are nothing without their technological know-how and doodads, one of which happens to be the <a data-name=""Time Thief Bezel Ship"">Time Thief Bezel Ship</a>. More often than not you'll want to try and get it in the GY for when your Xyz monsters hit the field, because it can then revive itself by detaching a material from one of them, though you'll want to use it for an Xyz Summon immediately after as removing it from the field without doing so will banish it. Hence why a summon of an Xyz monster, detaching Bezel Ship with a Winder in hand, then reviving Bezel Ship by detaching the remaining material is A-OK. Alternatively, its on-field effect is great during your opponent's turn, where it Tributes itself to snatch a card from your opponent's GY and attaches it to Time Thief Xyz monster you control. It's much more useful than you think, actually. It's a Quick Effect for one, so it can be chained to pretty much anything, and your opponent can't use what's no longer in their GY. Try it out for yourself and you'll see what I mean!</li> </ul> <ul>  	<li>Though maybe not always as considered, <a data-name=""Time Thief Chronocorder"">Time Thief Chronocorder</a> can put in some good work like its fellow tools of the trade. When your Xyz monster leaves the field by a card effect (including a certain boss's own), it revives itself from the GY with the same ""don't not use me for another Xyz or I'm history"" syndrome as Bezel Ship, though this one can Tribute itself as a one-time reflection of battle damage your opponent tries to inflict on you for a turn. Its revival effect, however, is definitely at the forefront, and really just goes to show how recursive these guys can be.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>The leader at the helm is none other than <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>, famous for snatching opponents' cards in the Standby and being very, very hard to kill in the right hands. Depending on what you detach from him (Monster, Spell, or Trap), he'll bounce himself out until the End Phase to dodge attacks and disruptive effects, net you a free draw, or bounce back your opponent's face-up card without even needing to target. Pilot him wisely, as he's about as good as the one who brought him to the field in the first place.</li>  	<li>The main man's lovely assistant is <a data-name=""Time Thief Perpetua"">Time Thief Perpetua</a>, who does her whole team a lot of favors. In Standby, she detaches a card to revive any Time Thief in the GY, including Redoer! Though if you ask me, you'll likely want to get Bezel Ship back out on your opponent's turn for more snatching and Winder on your turn for more searching if Redoer is already up and running. Other than that, she has a Quick Effect at any time to attach a Time Thief card from deck to any of your Xyz monsters, effectively reloading their resources. I urge you not to sleep on this card, given all it can do.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>We've spoken about Time Thief tools of trade before, but what about backrow? Those are just as important! The first of which is <a data-name=""Time Thief Flyback"">Time Thief Flyback</a>. On field it attaches a Time Thief card from deck to your Redoer or Perpetua as material (most often another Flyback), but it can also banish itself from GY to play Bezel Ship's snatching game. That being said, it's not the end of the world if your opponent pops this card, so make them pay by swiping one of their GY resources!</li>  	<li>Speaking of backrow, nobody likes to be on the receiving end of the kind that really, really doesn't want you to play through your setups. But hey, that's why we run <a data-name=""Time Thief Retrograde"">Time Thief Retrograde</a>, which uses Redoer or Perpetua's mere presence to negate a Spell or Trap and attach it to them as material. If it's a Trap that Redoer happens to snatch, you pretty much kill two birds with one stone, since you get to do his bounceback effect immediately after.</li> </ul> <h2>Phantom Knights</h2> Those of you that have seen ARC-V (I sure haven't, one way or another) may remember a certain chap named Yuto who piloted these steely specters. Others may remember their signature Link monster as a splash into another kind of deck that took all its competition by storm some time ago, prior to some of its most important tools getting hit on the banlist. Now that Bardiche has atoned for Orcust's sins, it's time to welcome him back into the limelight with a new set of friends to help accomplish what he sets out to.  A quick note before starting: these DARK Warriors are VERY recursive and easy to make good Extra Deck material out of or search with. It goes without saying that just like all the other Main Deck monsters, they're very thankful to have Armageddon Knight by their side so their GY shenanigans can take place. Though the same goes for their Spells and Traps, some of which banish themselves to revive their users. <ul>  	<li>It goes without saying that <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a> is quite the staple to run at three. From the hand, he can summon himself for free provided you control a fellow Knight of his. This includes a monster or backrow unit, but other than that he banishes himself from the GY to search for a ""Phantom Knights"" Spell or Trap, just in case you can't set it just yet using the archetype's Link boss. So try Normal Summoning another PK and then this guy from your hand, I promise it'll be worthwhile.</li>  	<li>Silent Boots' usual partner is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a>. He swaps his own position on-field to amp up the ATK and DEF of a DARK monster of your choice by 800, but that's only a drop in the bucket in terms of his utility. You'll mainly be using him to search for a card when banished much like Silent Boots, though instead he looks for any ""The Phantom Knights"" card, including monsters with those words in the title. Just pay very close attention to the word ""The"" and you'll be fine.</li>  	<li>In an interesting twist of fate, a new Main Deck recruit for the shady sword-slingers comes in the form of <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Tear Scale"">The Phantom Knights of Tear Scale</a>, and boy howdy can he be a team player. While he's on the field, he lets you discard any card (including non-PK's with beneficial effects in the GY) to act as a Foolish Burial or Foolish Burial Goods for a Phantom Knights card of your choosing from deck. In the GY, however, he can be even more useful. If any Phantom Knight card whatsoever is banished from there (for its effect or other such things), he revives himself to provide utility for further Extra Deck summons. So essentially, by banishing one of the two main Traps for PK's to revive one of their monsters, you can revive this card as well and make an instant Rank 3. Just be sure to use him for one of those, because he has the same ""banish if it leaves the field"" syndrome as some of the Main Deck Time Thieves tend to.</li>  	<li>One more main deck PK that'll surely extend your plays, <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves"">The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves</a> is an odd beast, but superbly useful. Should you summon a fellow PK, he summons himself from hand and gives you the option to amp its level up by one. So just by setting up Brigandine, that's an instant double-bouncing Redoer for free! Alternatively, he banishes himself from the GY to summon a PK friend of his from hand for free, also with the option to amp up its level by one. Always helps to have a RotA or Armageddon Knight handy to get this bad boy up and running with his friends.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>The main Xyz monster for PK's you'll most often go into is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Break Sword"">The Phantom Knights of Break Sword</a>. And I gotta say, for a Rank 3 he puts in some serious work. His effect lets you pop a card on your field (9/10 times himself for his own second effect) and any card of your choosing from your opponent's field. Popping himself may sound silly, but that actually activates his destruction effect that revives any two Phantom Knight monsters from your GY and increases their Levels by 1, letting you go into yet another Xyz Summon but only locks you into bringing out DARK monsters for the rest of the turn. You'll want to run two just in case, because more destruction and revival simultaneously just goes to show all the more recursion these guys have.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Raiders' Knight"">Raiders' Knight</a> is another interesting choice. It looks to be a Break Sword retrain, and it definitely counts as both a PK and Raidraptor, though the latter is pretty much the only mention of them you'll find in the deck. Detaching a card from it lets you Rank-Up or Rank-Down the guy by one into a DARK Xyz of your choosing, so likely either Break Sword or another big bungus DARK Xyz monster rolling about soon.</li>  	<li>But the head honcho of these guys, free from the shackles of Forbidden at last is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>. Words can't describe how important this guy is, only requiring three generic DARK monsters to bring out and essentially acting as a Foolish Burial or Foolish Burial Goods for any of your PK cards a la Tear Scale, while also being able to set one of its backrow directly from the deck. That, and summoning a DARK Xyz monster of any kind to a zone it points to lets you pop any card on the field, so a RUM Quick-Play Spell during your turn is applicable in this regard! I repeat, do not sleep on this monster.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Rounding off the backrow or arms these guys take up is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a>. It brings itself out as a Level 4 DARK Warrior, allowing for material of a Rank 4 Xyz of your choosing, but it's worth noting that its effect lets you activate it the turn it's set, provided your GY is free of Traps. Believe me when I say that Time Thief Redoer LOVES being summoned with this card under it, since then it gets its floating and bounceback effects online right out the gate. You'll want to run one because, well, later in the game you'll definitely have a Trap or two in the GY for one reason or another, so it's best to use those extra slots for cards like the next entry.</li>  	<li>That next one being <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a>. It's pretty much a tribal Fiendish Chain, targeting a monster of choice to prevent it from having its effects, attacking, or being attacked. But its utility doesn't stop there, since it banishes itself from the GY to revive a Phantom Knight of your choosing. That latter one was a boon that I'd overlooked for the longest time, but now I see the full scope of what this baby does for the deck.</li>  	<li>As far as this next backrow slot, <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Sword"">Phantom Knights' Sword</a> and <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Wing"">Phantom Knights' Wing</a> are practically the same card, equipping to a monster to power it up and offer destruction defense and reviving a PK by banishing themselves from GY. I personally say run whichever of these two you prefer, or both. I just choose to run Sword 'cause, well, I dunno. Guess I'm a big sword doofus or something.</li>  	<li>Another card that PK's are thankful to have unbanned (albeit a couple months or so back) would be <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a>. Sure, <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Phantom Knights' Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Phantom Knights' Force</a> is also a thing, but it's moreso for a build of PK and Raidraptor and stuff like that or if you really, REALLY wanna go for Arc Rebellion that badly. But in this case, we'll be running Launch so we can go into a certain stained-glass bungus, or if we're feeling crazy and wanna promote Break Sword into Redoer or Perpetua if we need. It also banishes from GY to attach a PK from hand to an Xyz of your choice, but obviously the promotion takes center stage here.</li> </ul> <h2>Xyz Dragon</h2> Not quite Phantom Knights, not quite Raidraptors, but still very much considered to be key parts of DARK Xyz stuff. Hoo wow, take a shot every time I say ""DARK Xyz"" in this article and your liver will implode. Anyways, when you need a good beatstick or some strong bungus control options, these guys have your back. <ul>  	<li>And it all starts with <a data-name=""Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon"">Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon</a>. Pretty much the definition of a beatstick, he detaches both his materials to slurp up half the ATK of an opponent's monster and gives it to himself. Pretty standard stuff, but that's only to enable his Rank-Up into...</li>  	<li>...a guy who's surprisingly lacking a golden heart-shaped arrow, <a data-name=""Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon"">Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon</a>. Aside from looking like he belongs on a goth album cover, provided that he has Dark Rebellion under him as material, he can either slurp up ALL of an opposing monster's ATK for himself, or more often, detach a material as a Quick Effect to negate a monster effect, destroy the one who attempted to use it, and optionally revive an Xyz from the GY. Not only does he only add to PK's recursiveness, but he's the real big reason we tend to run RUM Launch.</li>  	<li>And now for Phantom Rage's very own cover card, though let's hope he doesn't cost too much once he pops up stateside. <a data-name=""Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon"">Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon</a> provides the best of both worlds from his brothers, and is made all the more easy to go into by Raiders' Knight, which you'll more often than not be using as the sole method or bringing him out. Detaching a material only locks you into attacking with him for the turn, but has it gain the ATK of all other monsters on the field while also negating all their effects (including your own) while it has a DARK Xyz attached to it. And that latter part remains, so really only bring this guy out as a coup de grace to smack your opponent for well, well over lethal.</li> </ul> <h2>Danger!</h2> Hoo boy, remember these guys? The set of creepy-crawly cryptids that certain decks tend to run as a draw engine and way to get bodies for extra summons on the board? Thankfully, you'll be spared from the mass Thunderbird! and Bigfoot! plops in hopes of making Hope Harbinger, as the Danger! monsters here are pretty much for, well, making other Xyz, albeit at lower ranks and maybe also to use as material for Bardiche.  Pretty much every Danger! monster has the primary effect of randomly discarding a card and bringing itself out if it was unhit to draw one, so I'll spare the repetition there and go for the secondary effects in listing each of these out. <ul>  	<li>First of which is <a data-name=""Danger! Mothman!"">Danger! Mothman!</a>. It'll be one of your main means of aiming for a Rank 4, though its discard lets you draw one and then discard one, so if summoning it didn't work out, you can pitch another card of choice from your hand for their own effect.</li>  	<li>Speaking of pitching Danger!s, that's where <a data-name=""Danger! Chupacabra!"">Danger! Chupacabra!</a> comes in. When he hits the GY upon discarding, he revives a Danger! of choice other than himself, though you'll likely be going into Mothman! for more Rank 4's or in the case of the next pick, for Rank 3's.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Danger!? Tsuchinoko?"">Danger!? Tsuchinoko?</a> pretty much summons itself regardless of whether or not it's hit with its own effect, since its secondary one brings itself out if discarded. A pretty good pal for all the Main Deck PK's in this regard, since they can make Break Sword and the like.</li>  	<li>The other Level 3 happens to be <a data-name=""Danger!? Jackalope?"">Danger!? Jackalope?</a>, which four out of five times you'll want to discard, along with the last Danger! on this list. Main reason being that it summons a Danger! directly from deck, making it all the easier to go into either Mothman! or Tsuchinoko? if you're lacking L3's or 4's to build stuff out of.</li>  	<li>And last but not least, the searcher comes in the form of <a data-name=""Danger! Nessie!"">Danger! Nessie!</a>. This final must-discard searches any Danger! monster of choice, so more often than not you'll want to empty your hand of all but this, activate its effect to search for Jackalope?, then use that guy to bring out a L4 or 3 right away. Pretty easy stuff, right?</li> </ul> <h2>Other Main Deck Staples</h2> The next four cards really don't belong to a set archetype, but have totally earned their places here one way or another. <ul>  	<li>After all, what would a DARK-based deck be without <a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a>? Searchable with RotA and a simple summon Foolish Burial's a DARK monster of choice. That, and he's a L4, so you can go into Redoer or any of your staple R4's with ease.</li>  	<li>Speaking of, <a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>! Just as any DARK deck has a mandatory Armageddon, any Warrior deck lacks completion if it lacks this card. And this Spell gives you the choice of Armageddon himself or any of your PK's.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> is, well, what Armageddon, Tear Scale, and Rusty Bardiche tend to be minus the tribalism or xenophobia. Any monster in your deck can step right up to be sent to the GY this way, including the next spot here.</li>  	<li>A bird in a set of knights, armor and machines? Outsiders to how DARK Xyz decks run may scratch their heads at the sight of <a data-name=""Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite"">Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite</a> here, but he's got a pretty decent niche. At the cost of 400 LP, he bounces a face-up card of yours back to your hand to revive himself for a very, very odd ""once-per-Duel"" thingie. Something crazy I've been able to do a couple times is bring out a Danger! with its own effect, bounce it back to my hand with Zephyros, and use the Danger!'s effect in hand AGAIN for another free summon and draw. You likely won't get to do that often, but it feels oddly satisfying when it does.</li>  	<li>Other than that, though, feel free to swap out any Main Deck card you'd prefer as something else for anything in the Side Deck. <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> for generic revival, <a data-name=""Time Thief Startup"">Time Thief Startup</a> to get another Time Thief out of your hand for free, all that good stuff.</li> </ul> <h2>Extra Deck Staples</h2> Let's not forget about all the other Extra Deck stuff, though! Time Thieves and PK's fill their roles well here, but what about all the others? <ul>  	<li>Like, say, <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>! It's a walking Mystical Space Typhoon once a turn, popping a backrow by detaching a material. Your Time Thief cards can make this thing easily, as can your Danger!s. But there's another generic Rank 4 that can do that job as well.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> may not see too much play nowadays, but can be pretty situational by shutting off your opponent's ability to use GY cards for the whole turn, during ANY phase of ANY turn. You won't bring it out too often, but when it does its job, it can really pay off.</li>  	<li>Upset that your banished PK's can't be of use anymore? Well, that's no longer the case with the little ditty known as <a data-name=""Leviair the Sea Dragon"">Leviair the Sea Dragon</a>! A generic Rank 3, detaching a card from him lets you bring back any banished Level 3 or 4 monster of your choice. PK gone? No problem! Bezel Ship, Regulator, or Chronocorder down for the count in the same way? That too's a thing of the past! See what I mean by incredible recursion?</li>  	<li>Speaking of generic Rank 3's, <a data-name=""Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss</a> makes his appearance, though it's not likely you'll be bringing him to the field outside of general milling or just to get some extra ATK to go for lethal or something.</li>  	<li>With all these Level 3's running around, what would this deck be without <a data-name=""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss</a>? It is just about the only other one of its kind here, aside from Dante, and he's got a much more useful effect. Any monster he points to can't be axed off by card effects, and he can protect himself by letting you send another card you control to the GY instead. Not only that, but he also acts as a Foolish Burial for any Level 3 of your choosing to power himself up (though the first half of that is what you're aiming for) and a way to get two Level 3's into the GY from field so their effects can take place. Boy, am I thankful this guy got reprinted in the 2020 Tin of Lost Memories. Among all the Extra Deck tech reprints and the questionable addition of yet more support for DM's two vanilla lovechildren, I'll try and look out for this guy solely. Well, him and the next card.</li>  	<li>A machine, in a group of master criminals and ghostly warriors? Yeah, a big boss in many Xyz decks and something that can be situational yet very worthwhile here is <a data-name=""Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops"">Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</a>. Requiring 3 Xyz monsters of any kind, any attempt for your opponent to walk over this guy or bash it with monster effects from anything besides an Xyz monster is futile. Not only that, but his activated effect revives an Xyz of choice from your GY, then attaches any card your opponent has to it as material. Imagine the shock on their face when you revive Redoer with this guy, attach your opponent's Trap to it, and then use Redoer to</li>  	<li>Don't let all these Extra Deck placements stop you from using other cards, however. <a data-name=""Bujinki Ahashima"">Bujinki Ahashima</a>, for example, is pretty much a lite version of Rusty Bardiche that can revive two cards of the same level to immediately use for an Xyz, and <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a> can be your emergency button if you're lacking in options against your opponent's main tools, and any Link monster of yours is safe from it and free to pop off to pick off those threats.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  So that's the deck as a whole. But before I close, just wanna give you some good tips to help play to the best of your ability. <h2>Handy Notes for Play</h2> <ul>  	<li>With Regulator, you'll want to go into Winder and Chronocorder typically, though if Winder's in your hand change it to Chronocorder and Bezel Ship. When you summon Redoer using these two, use Winder to detach a material to summon itself, then Redoer's effect to detach the remaining monster on it and bounce out. That way, Chronocorder will revive itself and you can then use it and Winder to go into another Rank 4, like Perpetua or Tornado Dragon. If you can get another Level 4 body on the field, you can then revive Bezel Ship from the GY by detaching a material from that other Rank 4, then use it and the other L4 for another Rank 4. So it's definitely possible to get three Rank 4's up turn one, and then use Perpetua during your opponent's turn to revive Bezel Ship from GY so it can use its Quick Effect snatch.</li>  	<li>Redoer can be a Swiss army knife, with the way he lets you draw, bounce back, and avoid disruptive effects. Just know where and when to proc them, like if Redoer himself is being targeted for a disruption or if your opponent's about to bring a big mean boss to the field that'll spell danger for you if you don't detach a Trap right there. That being said, if you're going to proc his effect to bounce himself out and dodge stuff, make sure to also detach Spells and Traps on him at the same time to get the most out of his momentary exit. Just watch out for Ash's, Ghost Ogres, or things of the sort that can stop him dead in his tracks.</li>  	<li>It's not the end of the world if Phantom Knight cards end up in the GY before you want them to. That's where stuff like Tear Scale and Rusty Bardiche come in. These two could send Fog Blade or Sword/Wing that way to then banish themselves to revive the PK's you desire. Bonus points if Tear Scale is in the GY with them, since it revives itself in the process without necessarily needing either of those Traps to do so.</li>  	<li>RUM Launch is primarily for Ranking-Up Dark Rebellion into Dark Requiem, but don't forget that you can use Break Sword on the field to make Redoer or Perpetua in a pinch when you need, including reviving Break Sword during your opponent's turn with Fog Blade or Sword/Wing.</li>  	<li>Perpetua puts in quite a bit of work as well. Don't take for granted the fact that she can attach any Time Thief card from deck to any Xyz monster you control to reload their resources. Putting another Flyback or Retrograde on Redoer's just as important, but don't forget to keep Dark Requiem and Tornado Dragon going strong in the same way, too!</li>  	<li>Again, only use Arc Rebellion as a game-ender, because after you get off his effect, there's not really any going back seeing as how everything on the field, including your own stuff, has essentially been Skill Drain-ed and your opponent may or may not have a nasty backrow card pop up during battle that would put every hole in your plan possible. Sure, it's a great closer, but not without its risks. And you don't have to rely solely on it as a wincon, either.</li> </ul> All in all, Time Thieves and Phantom Knights are a fun deck with cool nonlinear combo lines and methods of snagging a win, in my personal opinion. It might not shatter things like Adamancipator, Dogmatika, or any of the umpteen Eldlich builds as quick as a snap anytime soon, but I like to think that it can hold its own and shatter expectations in the right hands and mindset. If I were to cap the strategy as a whole off, I'll say that experience is the best teacher when it comes to this deck, so feel free to give it a whirl for yourself and see just how many heads you can make spin with these DARK doofuses. Either that, or splash Dogmatika in place of certain things if you're feeling crazy or just one of <strong>those</strong> people. Regardless, I hope you have fun the way I did learning and optimizing this deck over the past several months or so.  Thanks for giving my decklist a read, as well as my other ones! I honestly wasn't expecting my last Time Thief/Phantom Knight build to reach the amount of clicks it got or wind up as the top Google result for ""time thief phantom knight"" if I'm reading it right. Don't mean to toot my own horn, but I'm glad I got as far with these guys as I did. Maybe they'll reach meta relevancy, maybe not. But either way, you won't see me quitting on them anytime soon."

Imagine a 8k atk monster (at best) with 3 attacks; <strong>Liebe</strong> would be shaking. The<strong> Meklord</strong> part of this deck hits hard while the <strong>Orcust</strong> part is good at controlling the game and protecting your<strong> Meklords.</strong>  Usually, I would talk about the side deck near the end of a breakdown like this, but I'm gonna discuss it now. Side in card according to the environment of your locals or the popular decks your opponents play online. If there are more combo decks, <strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong> and <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> are the better choice instead of <strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong> or <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>. If there are more control decks,<strong> Lightning Storm</strong> and <strong>Cosmic</strong> would be better. <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> is at one in the main deck for the option to go into <strong>Selene Accesscode Talker</strong> combo.<strong> Fallen of Albaz</strong> is a target for<strong> Nadir Servant</strong> which sends <strong>Infernoble Knight Captain Roland. Roland</strong> equips himself to a warrior. <strong>Triskelia</strong> turns into a warrior when made one with<strong> Reprodocus</strong>. Now,<strong> Triskelia</strong> has the opportunity to become at least an 8000 ATK monster with 3 attacks. <strong>Triskelia</strong> gains ATK equal to the combined ATK of the monsters equipped to it.  Look, this deck can fall to <strong>Ash Blossom</strong>. It's a complete glass cannon. Since <strong>Called By the Grave</strong> is limited since the last banlist (to SELL <strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong>), it's more of a brick in this deck than a form of protection. Full combo is<strong> Meklord Astro Dragon Triskelia</strong>,<strong> Meklord Army Arsenal of Obbligato</strong>, and <strong>Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</strong>. <strong>Obbligato</strong> is a one card <strong>Platinum Gadget</strong> which gets you to <strong>Girsu</strong> and sets up <strong>Triskelia</strong> also. <strong>Plat Gadget</strong> summons <strong>Girsu</strong> to do your<strong> Orcust</strong> combo and it gets your <strong>Galatea</strong> co-linked to prevent it from being run over to turn off<strong> Crescendo</strong> (if you went first). With the amount of <strong>Orcust</strong> extenders you have, your first turn board is decently protected and it provides a feasible amount of protection for you to OTK with <strong>Triskelia</strong>.  <strong>Orcust</strong> engine consists of <strong>Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</strong>, <strong>Orcust Knightmare</strong>, <strong>Orcust Brass Bombard</strong>, <strong>Orcust Cymbal Skeleton</strong>, <strong>World Legacy - World Wand</strong>,<strong> Galatea, the Orcust Automaton</strong>, <strong>Longirsu, the Orcust Orchestrator</strong>, <strong>Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</strong>,<strong> Orcustrated Return</strong>, and <strong>Orcust Crescendo</strong>. <strong>Crescendo</strong> is nice as you can banish it to search a dark machine like <strong>Girsu</strong> or <strong>Triskelia</strong>. <strong>Foolish Burial Goods</strong> can send<strong> Crescendo</strong>.  The <strong>Meklord</strong> part consists of <strong>Meklord Astro Dragon Triskelia</strong>, <strong>Meklord Army Arsenal of Obbligato</strong>, <strong>Meklord Army of Wisel</strong>,<strong> Meklord Army of Skiel</strong>, and <strong>Meklord Assembly</strong>. We aren't playing <strong>Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core</strong> since this isn't a pure <strong>Meklord</strong> deck where you are also playing the<strong> Meklord Emperors</strong>.  Spell and Trap lineup get you to your combo pieces quicker. <strong>One for One</strong> might be dead most of the time since you are only playing one <strong>Brass Bombard</strong>, so you could replace it with like <strong>World Legacy - Succession</strong> or <strong>Monster Reborn.</strong>  Extra Deck consists of<strong> Salamangreat Almiraj</strong> and <strong>Linkuriboh</strong> for simple grave set-up.<strong> Reprodocus</strong> and <strong>Infernoble Knight Captain Roland</strong> for the <strong>Triskelia</strong> meme. <strong>Galatea, Longirsu, Dingirsu,</strong> and<strong> Platinum Gadget</strong> for the<strong> Orcust</strong> stuff. <strong>Gear Gigant</strong> for searching <strong>Girsu</strong> if you have another way to summon him. <strong>Titanikland the Ash Dragon</strong> and <strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong> as targets for<strong> Nadir Servant</strong> and a target for<strong> Fallen of Albaz</strong>.<strong> Accesscode Talker</strong> and <strong>Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</strong> since we are playing <strong>Effect Veiler</strong>.  You can play <strong>Halqifibrax</strong> in this deck, but just take out <strong>Reprodocus, Roland</strong>, and the <strong>Nadir Servant</strong> and <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong> along with <strong>N'tss</strong> and <strong>Titaniklad</strong>. We aren't playing <strong>Meklord Army of Granel</strong> since you know, we have better normal summons in this deck."

As per usual, your Main Deck <strong>Shiranuis</strong> are 3 <strong>Spiritmaster</strong>, 3 <strong>Squire</strong>, 3 <strong>Solitaire,</strong> 1<strong> Samurai,</strong> and 2 of both <strong>Spectralsword</strong> and <strong>Spectralsword Shade</strong>. You are of course playing 3 <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong> and 3 <strong>Mezuki</strong> for that generic zombie support. You would rather have <strong>Solitaire</strong> or <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong> be your Normal Summon with<strong> Squire</strong>, <strong>Spiritmaster</strong>, and <strong>Samurai</strong> be in the grave for you to reborn and use as synchro material.  Your <strong>Shiranuis</strong> also have their banished effects. <strong>Spiritmaster</strong> is removal, <strong>Solitaire</strong> and<strong> Samurai</strong> are for recycling, and <strong>Squire</strong> refreshes your hand and sets up your grave. Your <strong>Spectralswords</strong> do what they do. They use your graveyard as an opportunity to get more advantage through banishing and synchro summoning. They also allow you to get to the <strong>Plaguespreader</strong> synchros without having to use <strong>Plaguespreader</strong> specifically.  Spells and Traps in the main deck are for basic set-up. <strong>Gold Sarc</strong> banishes your <strong>Shiranuis</strong> from deck so that you can get their effects off. <strong>Ghost Meets Girl - A Shiranui's Story</strong> gets you to <strong>Solitaire</strong> which gets you to <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong> and it sets up your grave. <strong>Mayakashi's Manuscript</strong> is a better<strong> Shiranui</strong> card than a<strong> Mayakashi</strong> card. It's basically a reborn for any <strong>Shiranui</strong> in your gy or that is banished.<strong> Foolish Burial Goods</strong> has 2 targets:<strong> Shiranui Style Success</strong> and <strong>Return of the Zombies</strong>. <strong>Style Success</strong> is a trap that gets a zombie on field, but it can banish itself from the grave to make a zombie a <strong>Towers</strong> for the turn. <strong>Return of the Zombies</strong> is only a <strong>Foolish Goods</strong> target for now as it can recycle banished zombies and it can get you to your<strong> Shiranui's</strong> banished effects. If you go first, you can use this along with <strong>Zombie World</strong> to be monster removal.  Extra deck has your generic <strong>Shiranui</strong> Extra Deck cards and more possible synchro targets. <strong>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</strong> is a beater and it takes your opponent's monsters. <strong>Sunsaga</strong> is of course your boss monster. <strong>Shogunsaga</strong> is to get out some damage, <strong>Samuraisaga</strong> is a recycler, and <strong>Squiresaga</strong> is probably the best low level<strong> Shiranui</strong> Synchro. It's good removal in general. <strong>Lavalval Salamander</strong> is a good choice going second since its grave set-up, a way to access your <strong>Shiranui's</strong> banished effects, and it has a <strong>Book of Moon</strong> effect. <strong>Psy-Framelord Omega</strong> since this deck does banish cards. <strong>Archfiend Zombie Skull</strong> to prevent board wipes. And <strong>Revived King Ha Des</strong> since hes a good beatstick (feel free to swap him out for like a different synchro). <strong>Yuki-Onna</strong> since it is an amazing card if you manage to make it. <strong>Skillsaga Supremacy</strong> for more protection. And <strong>Vampire Sucker</strong> since this is a Zombie Deck. The link monsters are very limited since there isn't much recursion that they alone provide compared to the synchro monsters in the deck.  Side Deck has <strong>Nibiru</strong> since <strong>Shiranui</strong> doesn't break massive boards. <strong>Neo Flamvell Lady</strong> as a<strong> Uni-Zombie</strong> replacement if you use <strong>Burning Draw</strong> and it's also a pseudo <strong>D.D. Crow</strong>.<strong> Burning Draw</strong> to draw 3 or 4 cards usually. <strong>Zombie World</strong> since it is a great floodgate that this deck can manage to play. And <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> for more disruption.  &nbsp;"

The Eldlich suite is still the same, 3 of each trap monster to take advantage of the deck's grind game, 3 red and 2 white eldlixer, the red is an important one, but when you're focusing on the grind game you want a second copy to search, 3 of the searcher and Golden Lord, obviously key to the deck's strategy, and 1 of the counter trap, the deck's main omni-negate.  Lost Wind still makes the cut, but Magicians' Souls does not. In this meta, sending your Solemn and Red Lotus is really really bad, given Harpie's Feather Duster is in the meta. The deck runs Extravagance with virtually no cost anyways. The Red Lotus is a meta call, I'm expecting Harpie's to be in a lot of mains for the first little while, and it is a very good check on Eldlich. With Block Dragon gone, Called By The Grave is just a more generically useful way to banish Golden Lord, with a lot of varied applications. I honestly wouldn't run more than 1 anyways, but it's a good one of, to negate an Eldlich while banishing another, or even just stopping Ash. With Called at 1 and Numerons not represented at all, I think it is safe to shift back to Ash from Gamma, especially given this is a going first grind game deck that wants its hand traps to stay live late into the game. Imperm is also obligatory in any backrow deck, and in most main decks. 1 negate is good, the potential second negate is useful, and it is a hand trap that distracts from your other back row.  In the Side Deck there are 3 Waking the Dragons, for game 2 and 3, when the hoard of backrow removal comes in to attack. I don't think you need it in the main deck, given that game 1 most people will only have Harpie's, if that. We also have Harpie's and Red Reboot. Red Reboot is game if you can get your trains going in the mirror, and Harpie's is obligatory. I've also got 3 Cosmic Cyclone, to banish Eldlich trap monsters, which as continuous traps actually negates - also good against Cursed Eldland. Ra is our normal summon. Since we don't have one, we might as well take advantage of Sphere mode to out combo boards. 3 Forbidden Droplet and 1 Dark Ruler No More are also for combo decks - even just getting set up under their monsters, maybe break their board a little, is huge advantage, and Droplet's effect to discard is often upside in the deck. Dark Ruler No More is basically just copy #4.  Added Dogmatika Punishment, with 3 N'tss, for the double pop, over maindeck Appointer of the Red Lotus, a card that is only good going first and only necessary games 2 and 3. I'd considered Compulse, and if you have the Extra Deck space and don't need the extra deck, Punishment is just better."

Anti-Meta Stun is the perfect budget choice! Slow the game to a halt by stopping special summoning and b","The philosophy behind Anti-Meta Stun is that most decks nowadays are woefully under-prepared if they cannot special summon, and usually do not have easily accessible outs to spell and traps, unless they draw into it. This deck's goal is to protect and enhance it's anti-special summon monster floodgates with backrow support.  The <strong>equip cards</strong> are to boost our floodgate's lacking attack and to provide situational effects. (Moon Mirror Shield and Mage Power for beating over stronger monsters, Mordschlag to destroy special summoned monsters, Power of the Guardians to provide destruction protection and White Veil for backrow destruction. Armory Call essentially adds 3 more copies of each card in the deck.)  9  <strong>draw cards</strong> to facilitate consistency. This deck's price can be cut substantially by replacing Pot of Extravagance with something else and not including an extra deck.  <strong>Prohibition</strong> is to disallow certain cards to be used crucial to a deck (For example, vs. Eldlich you prohibit Eldlich the Golden Lord). Prohibition can also be called to prevent the use of backrow removal (For example, prohibiting Twin Twisters, Cosmic Cyclone of Harpie's Feather Duster.)  <strong>Counter traps</strong> are to prevent field wipes and destructive backrow cards from being activated such as Lightning Storm, Harpie's Feather Duster and Twin Twister. They are also useful for preventing negation cards like Infinite Impermanence from shutting off the our floodgate monsters for a turn.  This deck <em>excels</em> at going first, as most meta decks cannot play through a hard to destroy special summon floodgate. Most of the time, they are forced to set and pass.  This deck is <em>particularly weak</em> against destruction effects from spell/traps, and may likely suffer versus oppressive boards going second. The 10 traps in the deck can be replaced by handtraps to make it easier to go second."

Everyone thinks they can't do anything, and it's true that often they rely on the field spell. However, there are multiple strategies and ways to play through various negates as well as just create different boss monsters depending on the situation!  First of all, the monster 3-ofs. You've got a lot here, Pikari is your spell searcher (usually A.I. Land but also A.I.dle Reborn for graveyard recursion and TA.I. Strike for battle phase shenanigans), Balancer Lord allows synergy with Cyberse Wicckid, Parallel eXceed furthers your Link plays, and Achichi serves as a monster searcher. Along with these, Bururu at 2 is needed for Synchro plays but you don't want to see it in your hand (it's not a Garnet by any means, but is more useful in Wicckid combos from the deck). Doyon is run at 2 in order to recycle your @Ignister monsters and spells (very versatile), while Gatchiri is an extender that protects your Link monsters if used as material or just your Cyberse monsters when on the field. Doshin and Hiyari are also one-of extenders that special summon themselves for free, but they can be cut if need be.  Moving on to spells, I run 3 Cynet Mining (needed for any Cyberse deck) as well as 3 A.I. Land with 1 Terraforming (as I said above, really helps your plays). I also run 2 A.I.dle Reborn and 1 Monster Reborn for GY recursion (you could run 3 A.I.dle Reborn, but I feel safer at 2). I also run 2 TA.I. Strike for Battle Phase shenanigans (always fun to kill a Link God Dragon with a Pikari), and 2 Pot of Desires for draw power (you don't have much).  This leaves room for hand traps and other fun spells, I personally run 2 Cosmic Cyclone, 1 Called by the Grave, and 3 Ash Blossom in my main deck, but these can be exchanged with anything that's relevant for the current format.  Your Extra Deck is extremely tight, not because you're limited to a few options, but because you have so many plays that you can pull off. Starting with relatively common combo starters, I run 1 Cyberse Wicckid and 1 Splash Mage. Cyberse Wicckid is very useful with Balancer Lord to add from the deck and then special summon a Bururu from the hand, while Splash Mage is good to go into if you don't have that Balancer Lord in the GY. I also run 2 Linguriboh, because you need easy special summons from the Extra Deck as well as an easy way to free up the main monster zones if needed. 2 Dark Templars are necessary for this deck, being the main combo extender, but after this you can get extremely creative (as long as you use Cyberse Extra Deck monsters).  If you need to safely break a board and OTK, the 1 Accesscode Talker is a very good option. If you need to destroy opponent's monsters while providing protection for your own, summon one of the 2 Light Dragon @Ignisters. If you need to destroy opponent's spells and traps, summon the 1 Wind Pegasus @Ignister. If you wipe the board with Wind Pegasus and Light Dragon, go into the 1 Firewall Dragon Darkfluid with 2 counters to not only negate monster effects if need be but also just OTK. If you just need a Towers, summon the 1 Arrival Cyberse @Ignister. If you need to protect your Links (usually Accesscode), Synchro into Cyberse Quantum Dragon. And finally, if it's turn one or you really need to out an opponent's monster, go into the 1 I:P Masquerena and then the 1 Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax.  The side deck is pretty simple, just fill with whatever hand-traps you have at the time to fight the Meta (my current list is just what I own currently). However, leave 2 spots for Earth Golem @Ignister and A.I. Love Fusion. If your opponent is using a Link-heavy deck like Salamangreats or Sky Striker, simply side this in and watch your opponent's fast as you fusion summon using their own Link monsters. Think Super Polymerization but without the discard.  &nbsp;  And that's @Ignisters! I'll explain the main combo piece that you want to get out with your deck. Normal Summon Balancer Lord, use his effect, and then Normal Summon Pikari. From here, go into Cyberse Wicckid and Special Summon any Ignister or Parallel eXceed from hand, banish Balancer Lord using Wicckid, and then Special Summon the Bururu you add off of Lord. Link into Dark Templar using 3 different named monsters, then special summon any monster to a zone it points to (either turn an eXceed into Linguriboh or special summon another Ignister from hand). From here, you can do pretty much anything you want to go into! This combo runs very similarly if you go into Splash Mage, it really just depends on what cards you're working with. I hope y'all learned something about this new Cyberse powerhouse, good luck Duelists!"

The card is designed to augment the effects of ""Vampire Lord"", ""Vampire Lady"", ""Vampire Duke"" and ""Vampire Grace"". The Trap Card, ""Vampire Takeover"", is very handy for getting ""Kingdom"" onto the field, and as well as a free Special Summon from your Graveyard.</span>  <span>""Vampires"" make an effective Xyz Monster Deck. Using the effects of ""Shadow Vampire"" and ""Vampire Duke"" to Special Summon Level 5 DARK ""Vampires"" (such as each other or ""Vampire Lord"") and Overlay for the boss of the Deck: ""Crimson Knight Vampire Bram"". You can also use ""Vampire's Curse"" and ""Vampire Grace"" for Rank 6 plays (such as the unorthodox, yet still thematically fitting Number 24: Dragulas the Vampiric Dragon).</span>  <span>""Vampires"" obtained new support revolving around paying Life Points as costs to Special Summon themselves from the Graveyard and search other ""Vampire"" cards and taking control of the opponent's monsters, often by Special Summoning opposing Monsters that were destroyed by battle with a ""Vampire"". This also facilitates the Xyz Summon of ""Damphir Vampire Sheridan"" as it can treat monsters the player controls that are owned by the opponent as Level 6 when used for its Xyz summoning. The Life Point costs can then be recovered with the use of ""Vampire's Domain"".</span>  <span>""Vampire Domain"" allows an additional Normal Summon of a ""Vampire"" monster, this works in tandem with the Link Monster ""Vampire Sucker"", which allows the player to tribute the opponent's Zombie type monsters for the Tribute Summon of a ""Vampire"", it can also special summon a monster from the opponent's Graveyard to their field as a Zombie type so it can be used as tribute.</span>"

Sometimes i dont have the 2 warriors so i use miscellanosaurus to summon aeolus and have halqifibrax and continue the combo but i will prefer to summon borreload savage dragon decreasing phonon pulse dragon to 2 instead of summoning charles as there will not be smoke granade in the graveyard.  you can use the dragun of red eyes path using isolde to summon armageddon knight and sending overtex qoatlus to graveyard and searching double evolution pill, next you link for predaplant verte anaconda and summon ultimate conductor tyrano before using its eff to bring dragun of red eyes.  &nbsp;  the Stardust charge warrior and the tatsunoko are still ways to try but i will replace them with knightmare phoenix and accesscode talker."

Eldlich Dogmatika is my favourite Eldlich Varient. I'd just built it poorly before.,"I decided to give the Dogmatika engine a second go in Eldlich. The first time I hadn't incorporated Dogmatika Punishment, (or Titaniklad) but after thinking about the card a bit I think it is so generic to run, and gets you so much value on its own, that I was thinking of incorporating it into pure Eldlich, but if I was trying the card I wanted to try it with the searchers first.  The Eldlich package is very much my standard set. Sometimes you wish those white eldlixers were black, but generally, I prefer to see white, and you need 2 non reds to search. 2 Solemn Judgement seems essential, especially right after the ban list, with 1 Harpie's Feather Duster a lot of people will have main deck back row sweeping potential, which can result in getting OTK'd if you have no response. Judgement is still the best generic response, and a couple main for that lone Harpie's seems good.  Nadir Servant is the nuts, there's a lot of value here. On the face, you can send Titaniklad to search Ecclesia, which in turn searches you Punishment and Fleurdelis. That's 2 interruptions on 1 card, without a lot of commitment to the main or extra deck. However, it can also send ANY card from the extra deck. We've got 1 main Shaddoll Schism, and 1 Apkallone, meaning Nadir Servant can discard a card to search an extra card. Having the option to discard Golden Lord while getting him Fodder is pretty huge, and so is the ability to discard Golden Land trap monsters to search red Eldlixers. This also gives us access to the Winda combo game 2, but the real purpose game 1 is just to recur the trap a few times and use it to summon Golden Lord, as well as giving the deck a way to discard off of Nadir Servant. Ecclesia is an important tool for getting Nadir Servant's full value - you aren't taking full advantage of its capabilities by using it as a normal summon, but it's good enough of a normal summon to be a 3 of. Fleurdelis sucks, but you need to run 2. Needing a Dogmatika monster on the field is annoying most times you see him naturally, but you need a couple copies - this is a control deck, and being able to search a second copy in the game is really essential. The card is better once you know it is safe to side in Maximus - even with just 1 Maxmius in the deck it feels less like a brick, so this card gets better with Maximus. 2 Punishment seems obligatory, and I might want to try 3 of these with 3 N'tss in random control decks (if they have the space), including ""pure"" Eldlich. 2 pops for 1 is really good, and having other good targets to send makes the card much better. Hand traps should be standard - I don't like Gamma in control decks very much, so it's Ash, Effect Veiler and Impermanence.  The extra deck has a few packages. One is the Dogmatika Send package: 2 Dragon Bastards, 2 Elder Entity N'tss, 1 Skull Knight, plus 1 each of Shaddolls Apkallone, Winda, and Construct. The deck can turbo out Winda game 2 when this is a viable strategy, and can make Construct while popping a Light monster game 1 pretty easily, but mostly these cards are here to send with Dogmatika cards for fun and profit.  The next package is the trains. Choo choo! OTK! I love that Eldlich cards are level 10, because I like trains.  After that is a small link package. Vampire Sucker is good card advantage once you've simplified the game state, and can be made with Eldlich cards. The Knightmares give you some extra removal out of the extra deck. You are locking yourself out of the extra deck a fair amount of the time, but you might as well run a few links for those turns where you can link summon.  In the Side Deck there are 3 Appointer of the Red Lotus and 1 Solemn Judgement. Appointer is very good going first, and can really help in game 2 when the Lightning Storms come in, which is also what Solemn is here for. If you know you're going first game 2 or 3, you should make space for these cards.  2 Maximus is fine, you have 9 searchers and not a lot of space. The card is really pushed, so if you're against a deck that seems really like a heavy combo deck with no space for meta calls to hurt Maximus you can gain insane advantage while disrupting plays a little. Also helps make Winda in matchups where Winda is really good.  3 Forbidden Droplet is great against Combo, especially post-ban. Sure, Infernoble, and like the Water deck, will basically make this card useless, but it is a Dark Ruler No More that can be fired off chained to a lingering effect to negate it, and our deck wants cards in the GY anyways. The rest is Backrow removal for other control matchups."

Remember, Archfiend will not activate effect if you invoke it with ZERO-MAX.  Rusty is not that difficult to summon and can give us some extra negates.  You have to learn with the deck to know which are your bests fields and the ways to get to them.I like the Deck a lot and I hope you too  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This deck is pretty basic and straight forward. Use <strong>Red-Eyes Fusion</strong> to summon <strong>Dark Dragoon</strong> using <strong>Dark Magician</strong> and <strong>Red-Eyes Black Dragon</strong> to utilize <strong>Dark Dragoon's</strong> effect to its fullest.  <strong>Red-Eyes Insight</strong> is great to search out <strong>Red-Eyes Fusion</strong>. <strong>Red-Eyes Wyvern</strong> is great card to send to the graveyard for the coast.  Using <strong>Dragon Shrine</strong> you want to send one of the <strong>Red-Eyes Black Dragon</strong> to the grave then sending <strong>The Black Stone of Legend</strong> to graveyard. Then use <strong>The Black Stone</strong>'s effect to shuffle <strong>Red-Eyes Black Dragon</strong> back into the deck and add <strong>The Black Stone</strong> into you hand. <em><strong>Keep in mind</strong></em> the you can <strong><em>only use one</em></strong> of <strong>The Black Stone of Legend</strong>'s effect per a turn so you'll have to wait for your next turn to use it's other effect.  <strong>The Black Stone of Legend</strong> has a few good targets for it's first effect. <strong>Red-Eyes Archfiend of Lightning</strong>, <strong>Meteor Dragon Red-Eyes Impact</strong>, <strong>Red-Eyes Black Dragon</strong>, <strong>Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon</strong> or <strong>Red-Eyes Alternative Black Dragon</strong>.  <strong><em>Gemini Monster Effects</em></strong>- Upon their re-summoning  <strong>Red-Eyes Archfiend of Lighting</strong> is basically crowd control destroying your opponents monster who have less DEF than 2500.  <strong>Meteor Dragon Red-Eyes Impact</strong> becomes protection for your Red-Eyes monsters  <strong>Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon</strong> inflicts 2400 damage to your opponent at the end of the battle phase as long as damage calculations is done involving Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon.  Use the Virus cards when you are about to lose any card that can't be saved but can be the activation coast for them.  <strong>Eradicator Epidemic Virus</strong> will take care of spells and traps that you opponent has in their hand, field or draw for 3 turns.  <strong>Deck Devastation Virus</strong> will take care of low ATK power monsters on the field, hand, and drawn for 3 turns.  <strong>Full Force Virus</strong> will take care of low DEF monsters on the field, hand, and drawn for 3 turns.  Extra Deck Monsters  <strong>Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack </strong>is great to remove pesky cards using his effect by removing tokens that are summoned by removing Xyz materials from the card. Also having immunity while you control a token.  <strong>Beast-Eyes Pendulum Dragon </strong>is mostly there for a 3000 beat stick that is easy to summon due to the contact fusion ability 1 DARK Dragon-type monster and a Beast-Type Monster thus the reason <strong>Kinka-byo</strong> in the deck.  <strong>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</strong> is just perfect for a deck that has DARK monsters to spare."

The goal is to use the Thunder Dragon cards to break boards, gain advantage, play through handtraps, and summon out a Thunder Dragon Titan. The Predaplants are to search out fusion spells and get a plant on board for Crossrose Dragon. Titan gains advantage when protecting itself from Black Rose Dragon on the opponent's turn, and hopefully get a large amount of advantage from the board wipe. The artifact engine is to use any extra bodies to search Artifact Scythe, who can be popped by either Titan or Black Rose to lock the opponent out of the extra deck."

This deck isn't for the faint of heart Monarchs have always lacked consistency but Pantheism at 3 gives bo,"I have always been a nostalgic person and I have always played monarch decks since I returned to Yu-gi-oh one year ago. I loved monarchs because it revolved around one of the oldest yugioh mechanics always excited me. I have only recently started back playing Yu-gi-oh but I have never been a fan of the tier-0 meta decks and I would only suggest this deck for those who like to win in style. There are several variants of this deck profile, but this version gives the greatest consistency with more than enough firepower to decimate your opponents. in an environment where you are likely to be blown up in an FTK or confront an unbreakable board in your first turn the ability to disrupt your opponents flow is critical that is what this deck focuses on. Be warned however- your success with this deck relies heavily on your knowledge of your opponents likely moves but picking the right time to intervene can completely disrupt their flow and give you an avenue to take complete control of the game from that point on. Your psyframes are your first line of attack disrupting their pesky cards- if you are lucky: you may have your field card in play to synchro summon into a boss monster - I personally prefer Omega and Draco however there are a quite a number of useful options the real beauty begins however if you have Ehther in your graveard or were able to set escalation- after tribute summoning Ehther and loading your graveyard with dynamite for your turn you can escalate into Erebus or my favorite Zaborg unleashing your extra deck unto the field. Elder Entity N'Tiss, zeta and omega are often my go to targets but the possibilities are endless. At the end you are left with a clear field to start the process all over again should they dare to play on their turn.  Monarchs are back... its time to take your throne."

Yes, this is a Burning Abyss deck, post-banlist.","  So, Konami put Tour Guide of the Underworld to 3, and Graff and Cir to 2 on the September 2020 TCG banlist. Since the two main characters of Devil May Cry are named ""Dante"" and ""Virgil"", I believe this is an appropriate name for a Burning Abyss deck.  And because I am a degenerate with no real concern for my opponent's enjoyment of the game, this deck uses 9 hand traps and Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon(Konami, PLEASE don't ban this card). My first turn-strategy would be to end on a board of Verte Anaconda, Dragoon, and Beatrice, which is a lot easier for Burning Abyss to do now that the deck is almost at full power.  &nbsp;  Personally, in my duels with this deck, I've done better going first. Maybe you'll have different experiences than me and do better going second."

Archetypes are &lt;strong&gt;Bolded Black&lt;/strong&gt;. Extra Deck monsters are indicated with ⌈Half-Brackets⌋)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deck obviously heavily revolves around the &lt;strong&gt;Charmers&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Possessed&lt;/strong&gt; monsters, and obviously there's a lot of cards here. First thing to note is that there aren't very many multi-copy cards. In fact, the only Main Deck cards with multiples are &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Angraecum Umbrella&quot;&gt;Angraecum Umbrella&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(x3), and the &lt;strong&gt;Charmer/Possessed&lt;/strong&gt; Spells/Traps, although there is the option of swapping out attributes from the Side Deck based on your opponent's deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the main objective of this deck is to try and get out ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2), which is objectively the Deck's strongest card, especially while &lt;span style=&quot;color: #008080;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Awakening of the Possessed&quot;&gt;Awakening of the Possessed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is out, and also because it's the only Generic &lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady &lt;/strong&gt;monster, not requiring any other &lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady &lt;/strong&gt;cards to activate its effects. This takes a while at first and it will likely catch the opponent by surprise. The only Tuners in this deck are the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Angraecum Umbrella&quot;&gt;Angraecum Umbrella&lt;/a&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. However, the useful part is that they have the same stats (ATK/ 500, DEF/1500) as the &lt;strong&gt;Charmers&lt;/strong&gt;, so they can be easily summoned from the Hand/Deck/Graveyard by the effects of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Unpossessed&quot;&gt;Unpossessed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;T&lt;a data-name=&quot;eamwork of the Possessed&quot;&gt;eamwork of the Possessed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familiar Possessed - Lyna&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Eda the Sun Magician&quot;&gt;Eda the Sun Magician&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;Awakening - Nefarious&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Not only that, but its own effect can allow you to bring one of your &lt;strong&gt;Familiar Possessed&lt;/strong&gt; (Lv 4) monsters from the GY, allowing you to easily summon &lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every. &lt;/strong&gt;Since most decks run &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&quot;&gt;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, another way of summoning ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; involves getting out ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze&quot;&gt;Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Since &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ash Blossom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a (Lv 3, FIRE) Tuner, whenever your opponent uses &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ash Blossom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, try to prioritize getting out &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiita, Ablaze&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as quickly as possible. Then you can just summon any of the &lt;strong&gt;Familiar Possessed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Charmers &lt;/strong&gt;to bring out ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. You can also use ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;to help bring back your Tuners, so you can summon the other Synchros, or even bring back ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; without having to banish. Actually, another sort of situational technique is using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Spiritual Light Art - Miyabi&quot;&gt;Spiritual Light Art - Miyabi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, tributing ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to summon a Banished monster, and since ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; comes back, it's no real loss. You can make summoning ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; even easier by using &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;DNA Surgery&quot;&gt;DNA Surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

It's not a Spellcaster, but it can be useful in conjunction with &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness&quot;&gt;Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to keep banishing your opponents' cards without having to banish yours.

Since it has ATK/1500 and DEF/1500, many of your Spell/Trap effects will work in conjunction with this monster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt; 104:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt; Masquerade&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Like &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800080;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Alchemic Magician&quot;&gt;Alchemic Magician&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, requiring 3 Lv 4 monsters, although they don't have to be Spellcasters.

Also since half of your monsters are Lv 3, this card isvery easy to Summon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chocolate Magician Girl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Especially useful if you already have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;Unpossessed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;out. You can use this monster to not only get an extra draw, but if the card you discard is a &lt;strong&gt;Charmer&lt;/strong&gt;, then you can use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;'s effect next turn to bring that &lt;strong&gt;Charmer&lt;/strong&gt; back and potentially even deal some chip damage due to the &lt;strong&gt;Charmers'&lt;/strong&gt; decent DEF.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800080;&quot;&gt;Magical Broker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Very useful, especially since it has ATK/1500 DEF/ 200, so you can use &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800080;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008080;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Grand Spirit Art - Ichirin&quot;&gt;Grand Spirit Art - Ichirin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'s effect to swap &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800080;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dharc the Dark Charmer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt; out to get it. Since your deck would have a lot of Continuous Spells/Traps, this card could be very hard for your opponent to get rid of. Then you could of course use it to get an extra draw if you happen to have multiple &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008080;&quot;&gt;Awakening of the Possessed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpossessed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cards out, or if you already have &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teamwork or the Possessed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in your GY, you can just use its effect to bring that card you just sent to the GY back to the field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explosive Magician&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arcanite Magcian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;(Synchro Magicians)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Though not recyclable like &lt;span style=&quot;color: #800080;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ffcc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune Lady Every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and ⌈&lt;span style=&quot;color: #99cc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&quot;&gt;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot; data-name=&quot;Datascape Fox - Xianxian&quot;&gt; if either of the latter two get somehow Banished, or if they're already on the field, you can instead use the Synchro Magicians for sweeping.

The important thing is to take note of the dominant Attributes of your opponent's deck, then swap accordingly. There are less &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiita the Fire Charmer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cards, simply because FIRE monsters are the least common. You can also swap the &lt;strong&gt;Spirit Art&lt;/strong&gt; Traps, since all have useful effects. Since your Deck would have predominantly WATER monsters, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;Spiritual Water Art - Aoi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;is likely your go to swap, especially if you find that your monsters aren't getting Banished enough to need&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Spiritual Light Art - Miyabi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;. I would always leave &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Familiar Possessed - Hiita&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #99cc00;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familiar Possessed - Wynn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #800000;&quot;&gt;Familiar Possessed - Aussa&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;in the Main Deck. Since WATER is the dominant Attribute in this deck, it's much easier to Link Summon ⌈&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3366ff;&quot;&gt;Eria the Water Charmer, Gentle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #3366ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;⌋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; than the other three Link &lt;strong&gt;Charmers&lt;/strong&gt;. Otherwise, swap out the other &lt;strong&gt;Familiar Possessed&lt;/strong&gt; monsters as you see fit. If necessary, you could also swap out &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #99cc00;&quot;&gt;Wynn the Wind Channeler/Medium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;with one of the &lt;strong&gt;Familiar Possessed&lt;/strong&gt; monsters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"">This deck obviously heavily revolves around the <strong>Charmers</strong> and <strong>Possessed</strong> monsters, and obviously there's a lot of cards here. First thing to note is that there aren't very many multi-copy cards. In fact, the only Main Deck cards with multiples are </a><span><strong><a data-name=""Angraecum Umbrella"">Angraecum Umbrella</a> </strong></span>(x3), and the <strong>Charmer/Possessed</strong> Spells/Traps, although there is the option of swapping out attributes from the Side Deck based on your opponent's deck.  <span><strong>Primary Strategy:</strong></span>  So, the main objective of this deck is to try and get out ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> (2), which is objectively the Deck's strongest card, especially while <span><strong><a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a></strong></span> is out, and also because it's the only Generic <strong>Fortune Lady </strong>monster, not requiring any other <strong>Fortune Lady </strong>cards to activate its effects. This takes a while at first and it will likely catch the opponent by surprise. The only Tuners in this deck are the <span><strong><a data-name=""Angraecum Umbrella"">Angraecum Umbrella</a>s</strong></span>. However, the useful part is that they have the same stats (ATK/ 500, DEF/1500) as the <strong>Charmers</strong>, so they can be easily summoned from the Hand/Deck/Graveyard by the effects of <strong><span><a data-name=""Unpossessed"">Unpossessed</a></span>, <span>T<a data-name=""eamwork of the Possessed"">eamwork of the Possessed</a></span></strong>, <span><strong>Familiar Possessed - Lyna</strong></span>, <span><strong><a data-name=""Eda the Sun Magician"">Eda the Sun Magician</a></strong></span>, and <strong><span>Awakening - Nefarious</span>. </strong>Not only that, but its own effect can allow you to bring one of your <strong>Familiar Possessed</strong> (Lv 4) monsters from the GY, allowing you to easily summon <strong>Fortune Lady Every. </strong>Since most decks run <span><em><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></em></span>, another way of summoning ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> involves getting out ⌈<span><strong><a data-name=""Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze"">Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze</a></strong><a data-name=""Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze""><span>⌋</span></a></span>. Since <span><em>Ash Blossom</em></span> is a (Lv 3, FIRE) Tuner, whenever your opponent uses <span><em>Ash Blossom</em></span>, try to prioritize getting out ⌈<span><strong>Hiita, Ablaze</strong><span>⌋</span></span> as quickly as possible. Then you can just summon any of the <strong>Familiar Possessed</strong> monsters to bring out ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span>. You can also use ⌈<span><strong>Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</strong><span>⌋ </span></span>to help bring back your Tuners, so you can summon the other Synchros, or even bring back ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> without having to banish. Actually, another sort of situational technique is using <strong><span><a data-name=""Spiritual Light Art - Miyabi"">Spiritual Light Art - Miyabi</a></span></strong>, tributing ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> to summon a Banished monster, and since ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> comes back, it's no real loss. You can make summoning ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> even easier by using <span><strong><a data-name=""DNA Surgery"">DNA Surgery</a></strong></span>. Then if you have <span><strong><a data-name=""Ranryu"">Ranryu</a></strong></span>, <span><strong><a data-name=""Inari Fire"">Inari Fire</a></strong></span>, <span><strong><a data-name=""Jigabyte"">Jigabyte</a></strong></span>, or <span><strong><a data-name=""Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness"">Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness</a></strong></span> (the <strong>Familiars</strong>) in your hand, while the Tuner is out, you can just Special Summon the <strong>Familiars</strong>, and since they'll automatically be Spellcasters, you can just as easily get out ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span>.  <span><strong>Alternate Strategy:</strong></span>  Another Synchro Monster to pay attention to is <span>⌈</span><span><strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian"">Datascape Fox - Xianxian</a></strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian""><span>⌋</span></a></span>. If you have 2 <strong>Charmers</strong> out along with <span><strong>Angraecum Umbrella</strong></span>, it's an easy Summon. It's not a Spellcaster, but it can be useful in conjunction with <span><strong><a data-name=""Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness"">Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness</a></strong></span> to keep banishing your opponents' cards without having to banish yours. Just tribute <span>⌈</span><span><strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian"">Datascape Fox - Xianxian</a></strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian""><span>⌋</span></a></span> to Summon <span><strong>Nefarious</strong> </span>from the GY. That way you can use <span><strong>Nefarious</strong></span> for another Synchro, Xyz, or Link summon. Then, before you end your turn, just bring <span>⌈</span><span><strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian"">Datascape Fox - Xianxian</a></strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian""><span>⌋</span></a></span> back from the GY with its effect. Then, even if you banish <span><strong>Nefarious</strong></span>, you can bring it back to the GY with <span>⌈</span><span><strong><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian"">Datascape Fox - Xianxian</a></strong><span><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian"">'s</a></span><a data-name=""Datascape Fox - Xianxian""><span>⌋</span></a></span><span> other effect, making this, along with ⌈<span><strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong><span>⌋</span></span> both truly recyclable monsters.</span>  <span><strong>Other Useful Monsters:</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Blizzard Princess"">Blizzard Princess </a></strong><a data-name=""Blizzard Princess""><span>Due to its effect, it's a fairly easy monster to summon, considering the whole deck is Spellcasters, and it's also the strongest card in the Main Deck, so it's a plus to have either way.

Draitron can make Dragoon with frightening efficiency so long as they have access to Draitron Ban-Alpha, which they effectively have access to 13 copies of with all the searching they can do. from there, go off as hard as possible, setting up a graveyard full of Cyber Angel Benten (which you probably got off of Alpha) eventually summoning Cyber Angel Natasha, linking it away with something else for an Anaconda and viola! You have a graveyard full of snatch steals for link plays on your next turn, at least a Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and maybe a Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon (or insert your favorite ritual monster here, I just like big heckin' chonkers).  In the extra deck, there are probably three extra spots. Apollusa doesn't get made a ton, you probably don't need a second Verte, Cerberus is...fine at best, and Black Luster Soldier is pretty much only ever getting made by stealing stuff with Natasha, which is fun, but maybe not super consistent. Have some fun with it.  It probably wouldn't be bad to try 3 Where Aft Thou to find more Draitrons, so that might be a change I make going forward, but it is a bit more situational than the others. If you only have one other draitron and don't have a ritual, it's just dead. Nothing else is dead like that (outside of the obvious garnets). Then again, this could just be me justifying a bad decision after the fact.  This whole post has two caveats.  First, you may have noticed something about this deck, and you're right. There is not a single normal summonable monster in this whole thing. You will lose to someone putting up a barrier statue when you're on the draw in game one. I don't think that's a big enough problem to sink this iteration of the deck, but I could be wrong.  Second, I don't know if this is ever going to be a deck that you can actually put together. Draitrons are set to come out in Genesis Impact, which is in December. Dragoon centralizes power in a way that probably isn't healthy for the game, and might not make it much past when the main part of the deck actually comes out. Heck, the OCG just banned it this week. If the TCG follows their example, we might not have this toy much longer. After that, invoked does good stuff, but it's not anywhere near as consistent or as powerful. It's a lot of fun on simulators for the moment."

Go second, summon Shooting Star and pray you at least reveal 2 or 3 tuners. Our synchro tuner is Shooting Riser Dragon.  Junk Synchron, some way to summon Psi-Reflector, and some way to get a level 4 on the field is one Shooting Star Dragon. Junk Converter and a tuner is one Red Supernova Dragon.  Normal summon Junk Synchron or summon a tuner and activate Starlight Junktion. Emergency Teleport or One for One into Psi-Reflector. Add Assault Beast to hand with Psi-Reflector. Discard Assault Beast to add Assault Mode Activate from deck to hand. Reveal Assault Mode Activate with Psi-Reflector to special the Assault Beast back and increase it's level by 3. Synchro Assault Beast and Psi-Reflector to make Stardust Dragon. Then, you need a way to summon a level 4 monster. Monster Reborn or Synchro Chase to bring back the Assault Beast or Junk Servant Special summon itself from hand. Synchro that level 4 and Junk Synchron into Shooting Riser Dragon. Shooting Riser send Quickdraw Synchron to decrease its level by 5. Now, if you synchro the level 2 Shooting Riser Dragon with Stardust Dragon, you get a Shooting Star Dragon or a Satellite Warrior.  Discard Junk Converter and a tuner to add Junk Synchron to hand. Normal Junk Synchron and special back the Junk Converter. Synchro those into Junk Speeder and special back the Junk Synchron by Converter's effect and then Special, Junk Synchron, Cyberse Synchron, and Quickdraw Synchron from deck (mandatory to summon as many). Synchro with the 2 Junk Synchrons, the Cyberse Synchron, and Junk Speeder. (3+3+1+5=12) This gets a Red Supernova Dragon which banishes your opponent's field and itself. Then, it specials itself back after your next turn.  The other Synchros in the Extra Deck are for the moments where you have not other options. You can take out something like Junk Destroyer, Quasar/Blazar, and Stardust Charge Warrior to add in some link monsters I'm lazy to do so.  The side deck gets you to your combo easier.  Desires is somewhat good and bad in this deck. You get to combo pieces easier, but you are banishing names that are Junk Speeder targets, you are banishing parts of the Assault Mode stuff, and possibly banishing your Quickdraw Synchrons that are your Shooting Riser Dragon targets. I just didn't want to put in random ""one of"" cards that are very situational for this deck."

Not the inconsistent ""hoping-to-have-2-Crimson-Nova"", we're using Duza for double Crystal Wing w","Not your regular Aigami deck, Cubic is so inconsistent in OTK thanks to Crimson Nova ridiculous requirement and needs super specific setup to boost that buffoon to OTK. This deck is using <strong>Duza</strong> instead to establish board because it's a searchable Reborn Tengu, <strong>just add 1 random extender</strong> and we're good to go. So we need max copies of Duza, Summoner Monk, and Foolish Burial Goods (send Karma search Duza). To maximize the advantage, we need to use compatible extender like Summoner Monk (best, summons Duza from deck), Magicians Souls (super great, dumps your useless Cubic s/t on hand and draw), Apprentice Illusion Magician (same logic, but without draw), Danger Mothman (same logic, but the hand dump is random). Also we need to max Karma (for searching Duza) and Unification (combo piece).  Combo is summon Duza + 1 extender, use Duza dump Unification, make Barricadeborg (can use its effect to dump Unification in hand, so combo is still running even if we draw it), use Unification 2nd Duza, use Duza dump 2nd Unification, make Auroradon, use Auroradon ss 3 tokens chain 2nd Unification summon 3rd Duza, use Duza dump 3rd Unification, use Auroradon tribute itself and 1 token ss Warbluran, make Phonon Pulse, make Bureido, use Bureido chain 3rd Unification, ss Shinkuro and Vijam, make Martial Metal Marcher, ss Shinkuro again, make Garden Rose, use Garden Rose add Black Garden (save it for Tzolkin requirement), make Crystal Wing, make Tzolkin using Crystal Wing (now tuner cus Marcher) + Bureido, use Garden Rose GY eff ss Crystal Wing from GY, set Black Garden use Tzolkin ss yet another Crystal Wing.  You can use Black Garden to halve opponent's monster atk, but it makes Crystal Wing miss timing against on-summon effect because Black Garden activation is mandatory. The rest of the main deck is staple while extra deck is combo pieces and generic stuff, can use more Tzolkin target if you want.  <img src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/a/af/Aigami.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: New approach for Cubic, consistent, big monster, with staple too.  Cons: Only has monster negate, lack follow-up (can include Roland for Gearfried as follow-up by replacing Phonon Pulse, but needs brick like equip and Gearfried itself)."

Handtrap-heavy.,"As Jet-Synchron and O-Lion got banned, Orcust now has to rely on Crystron Rosenix for the first extender off Scrap Recycler, with Called by the Grave being limited, this combo is extremely fragile against hantraps, especially Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and D.D. Crow. Since I do not like luck factors, I've decided to not have Called by the Grave as a weird One-Of in this list and simply do not play it for the time being, instead I've decided to up the number of handtraps from Six to Ten, this way opening one handtrap is basically guaranteed and opening two is probable. I've also cut out Machina Fortress for the standard Danger!-package, as by being Dark attribute, they help making The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche and gain more advantage by drawing a card when accordingly triggered. With Bardiche obviously also comes The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots and two The Phantom Knight's Fog Blade. You could also play The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak and The Phantom Knight's Rank-Up Magic Launch to summon VFD over a Dingirsu if you want to play more of a blowout. This list also uses the Gadget-Combo for optimizing any hand with 2+ Starters with the exception of only drawing multiple Girsu The Orcust Mekk-Knight and no Scrap Recyclers, as Girsu has a hard OTP condition.  If uninterrupted, this decks optimized combo ends on four Apollousa negates, two set Fog Blades, a quick effect non-targeting spin trough Lib and I:P Masquerena, a quick effect non-targeting send trough the Dingirsu + Babel + Cymbal Skeleton setup and interruptions trough any handtraps you might have available.  Enjoy playing.  &nbsp;"

I'm not complaining yet, the card speaks for itself, or if your opponent can't play around it, they speak for the card. Basically, same strategy, except for searching for Block Dragon, you are looking for Red-Eyes Fusion while excavating cards with your Adamancipator engine to dig up materials and Fossil Fusions to hit big damage. The Koa'Ki engine also has some minor negation effects to help along the way! If anyone has any suggestions (other than not playing Adamancipator), please, feel free to comment! Let's chat!"

How is it legal? Is it the best deck? The answers to those questions is yes this deck has 2 of each ruler and the baby rulers, it is legal in the Trinity Format a long with the other Dragon Good Stuff, and no funnily enough this deck is Rouge in the current format dominated by Chaos Thunder, Plants, and Dragma. The goal of this deck is to abuse the amount of grind the Rulers can provide on top of accuse to the Rank 7/8 and Synchro 8/9 toolbox. The deck wants to abuse power cards such as Chaos Ruler (can be made with 1 card by foolishing Absorouter)  to set up the GY, Eclipse Wyvern (All the Rulers can banish him) to search any Chaos Monster, REDMD just to summon big bodies, Spheres to set up turn 1 disruption on top of toolboxing the entire deck , and Number 95 just to net so much advantage. This is a Semi-Highlander deck that follows the Banlist and Rules of Trinity Format Link to Discord for more information on the Format https://discord.gg/zPdfWhM"

Infinite Negates or Barrier stun, + a good grind game, and some truly unbeatable set-ups.","Harpie Lady deck. I think Elegant Egotist and Harpie's Feather Storm are the best cards so I built around them. Sidedeck plan includes a way to out Forbidden Droplets and Dark Ruler No Mores going first, by making Wynn the Wind Charmer and drawing 1 of 6 cards. Neither are perfect answers but I like it.  Remembered Imperial Order exists, so it got added to the anti-spell package. It's worse in some situations against Forbidden Droplet, but better when seen alongside Feather Storm, (because it leaves Harpie Lady on the field) and it doesn't need to use up the Linkuriboh if you don't have an extender. You can activate it at Spell Speed 2 before Dark Ruler No More, or in response to a Forbidden Droplet that didn't discard a trap, but mostly it is here to preserve Linkuriboh.  2 Harpies = Infinite Negates. Channeler adds Abyss Dweller or Cyber Slash Harpie into the mix. You can summon Barrier Statue game 2, or use Barrier Statue with Gizmek Uka, when you see combos that incorporate Martial Metalmarcher, Dragunity Romulus, or other wind bricks (Barrier Statue can even be made into Simorgh, opening up combo plays from this)  I'm onto Secret Village of the Spellcaster over other spell negation options now, because while it is vulnerable to random Magicians' Souls and Spellcaster archetypes (like Pendulums), it is still generally better than the other options against Dark Ruler No More and Forbidden Droplet. Since Simorgh can't be targeted by Impermance, Feather Storm protects from all generic hand traps, and your end boards are generally going to be either infinite negates or a Barrier Statue + Bagooska, this tech eliminates the remaining options to out you besides Sphere Mode (the big normal summon Kaiju.

You guys thought Gouki was dead? Hell no. I've made this deck almost unbrickable plus the combos are ridiculous. The deck always wants to go first and if you go first you will most likely win unless you get handtrapped more than twice but the deck can go second because maining Dark Ruler is really good (trust me). I figured out how to ""bypass"" the banlist for the synchro turbo engine. <a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a><a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie""> does the job perfectly. As well as </a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Warbluran"">Mecha Phantom Beast Warbluran</a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Warbluran"">. I also came up with using </a><a data-name=""Attack Gainer"">Attack Gainer</a><a data-name=""Attack Gainer"">. This card is so good. Going second it makes your opponent constantly lose attack during your combos to allow for an easier OTK and since it is earth it can be used for </a><a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> with <a data-name=""Gouki Suprex"">Gouki Suprex</a>. Two Gouki monsters + any other warrior is full combo. Two warrior monsters is full synchro combo. <a data-name=""Heritage of The Chalice"">Heritage of The Chalice</a> is full synchro combo and possibly full combo in general depending on your hand because you add Durendal, then equip it to any warrior and search <a data-name=""Fire Flint Lady"">Fire Flint Lady</a> which gives you two warrior monsters. I will now explain full combo... First you want to have three (two works too, this is just the full power combo) warrior monsters, two Gouki monsters + any other warrior extender work best. Normal summon the Gouki monster then if its Suprex special summon another Gouki from your hand and use the other warrior extender. Go into Isolde using one Gouki and the warrior extender. Isolde chain 1, Gouki chain 2 (to chainblock ash and ogre). Gouki adds Headbatt and Isolde adds Riscorpio. Headbatt activates to send Riscorpio to summon itself targeting the other Gouki on the field. Isolde effect to send Divine Sword to summon Attack Gainer. Isolde into <a data-name=""Linkross"">Linkross</a>. Linkross summons two tokens, Attack Gainer + 1 token into <a data-name=""Formula Synchron"">Formula Synchron</a>. Formula with other token to make Metal Marcher. Metal Marcher summon Attack Gainer (only if Suprex is in grave, if not then summon Formula). Then Marcher and Linkross into Haqlifibrax. Effect to summon Plaguespreader. Plaguespreader + Headbatt into <a data-name=""Herald of The Arc Light"">Herald of The Arc Light</a>. Headbatt effect to search Rematch. Use Rematch to summon Suprex and any other Gouki (Headbatt for this example). Suprex + Attack Gainer into Nat Beast. Use Plaguespreader in grave, summon itself, Plaguespreader + Headbatt + Halqifibrax into Apollousa. I'm pretty sure your opponent won't be able to get over that... Also you can make Borreload Savage Dragon by making Auroradon with Formula Synchron + Haqlifibrax and then the two Phantom Beast tokens (without Nat Beast on the field) by using Auroradon to tribute himself and Plaguespreader (that was summoned from thee grave via its own effect) to summon Warbluran and use his effect to tribute a token to make him level two. Then Warbluran plus the other two tokens is Borreload Savage! Theres so many combinations and end boards with this deck its crazy. I hope you guys enjoyed and stick around for more awesome decks by yours truly."

I included 3 <a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin"">Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphins </a>because you will want to use its effect as much as possible, to remove any hand traps your opponent may have, and it can make Isolde with any warrior that can be Special Summoned.  -<a data-name=""Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade"">Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade</a>--<a data-name=""Arcana Force XXI - The World"">Arcana Force XXI - The World</a>: These cards are part of the main combo, as detailed above.  -<a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>--<a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a>: These cards are used to counter anything that might threaten the combo.  They can be changed out based on the current meta &amp; personal budget.  Extra Deck:  -<a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a>: This is the best Warrior I could find that can be summoned with Instant Fusion., with the ability to flip an opponent's monster face-down.  -<a data-name=""Millennium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a>: If you have Instant Fusion but you can summon Isolde without it, use it to summon this card instead. You never have 5 main monster zones taken up at a time, so you can use this card to protect your entire combo. Can be replaced with something that is useful in more duels.  -Everything else: These cards are part of the combo. I have a second Isolde in case the first one gets negated<a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">.</a>  Side deck: These cards are useful against a variety of decks, and can be switched based on the meta &amp; your budget. More info on them below.  Support Cards:  -<a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>: Useful against <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">A</a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">sh Blossom</a> and <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>.  -<a data-name=""Prohibition"">Prohibition</a>: This card can stop any specific card that poses a threat to the combo, unless it is already on the field.  -<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>: Good for stopping other combo decks, or <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Gamma</a>. Will also be good to have when/if we get <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>.  -PSY-Framegear Gamma: Good for stopping an opponent's combo, or to stop <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich from being summoned</a>.  -<a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>: Shuts down combo decks, but relatively ineffective in other matchups.  Side Deck:  -<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>: Destroys opponent's entire backrow, staple against Spell/Trap based decks. You do not need to worry about the Eldlixer/Golden Land GY effects because your opponent will not have another turn to play them on.  -Book of Eclipse: This card works against Eldlich and Dogmatika by flipping the monsters face-down, preventing them from resolving the Golden Land continuous traps or summoning <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis the Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis the Knighted</a>  -<a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a>: This card works well against combo decks. May also work in the main deck.  -<a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>: Works well in certain matchups, but may be replaced.  -<a data-name=""Heritage of the Chalice"">Heritage of the Chalice</a> and <a data-name=""Super Quantum Red Layer"">Super Quantum Red Layer</a>: These cards can be sided in after losing a duel (so you know you're going first) because your opponent won't have any setup to counter. These increase your ability to set up the combo with Isolde.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Can cause a lot of decks issues trying to get around, also really good discard fodder for switchyard and redeployment  Fortress: Can summon itself with ease, it's also an inherent summon so doesn't start a chain. When destroyed by battle it pops a card, so you can crash it to get rid of problem cards with ease. When targeted by a monster effect you can pitch a card from your opponents hand for free, this is also a continuous effect so can't be negated by cards like Borreload savage or Apollousa. Finally it is a level 7, so when combined with Harvester it allows for rank 9 plays.  Redeployment: Gives you 6 copies of Metalcruncher and if you discard a Machina card you can also search the trap card which is a very underrated card in this deck.  Overdrive: Really brings the whole deck together. You can use it to either special summon Citadel, or if Citadel is already in the GY either of the other Machina monsters. If Citadel is already in the GY it will also trigger it's effect. Due to it being a summon and then if you do destroy effect, you can protect your target with Super Dora and get the summon for free. Due to it also being able to recycle monster banished or in your GY. it lets you either recycle the whole Inifitrack combo or the Citadel if your opponent banished it.  Infinitrack:  Harvester: It's the bhest normal summon in the deck every other turn, allows for rank 9 and rank 12 plays.  Brutal Dozer: One of the decks best extenders  Trencher: Same as Dozer, not a complete garnet as Dozer can summon a Harvester for you to tribute if you do draw it, but much better in the deck.  Heavy Forward: Either gets you to your normal summon or acts as an extender if you already have 1 in hand.  Trains:  Bullet Train: The best extender in the deck. Not only is it a free summon but during the end phase you get a monster back from your GY. Essential to any deck that can use it.  Derricrane: Another really good extender, as well letting you chain block. Pops a card when detached to help you control the game  Pegasus: You mostly want to be summoning this off Switchyard, but in the later turns it is a respectable normal summon.  Night Express: Due to this deck relying on having a normal summon to get started, Night Express is needed because it adds 5 more normal summons to the deck due to being searchable off Switchyard.  Switchyard: Either gets you to 1 of your level 10's or acts as an extender. With this an d Anger Knuckle, you can put up very good defensives on your opponents turn that will set you up to pressure for game.  &nbsp;  Reason For No Urgent Schedule:  In the current format, Trains can't really blind second anymore, as they can't make the most use out of cards like Nibiru as this will lock you out of the normal summon of metalcruncher as well as the summon of bullet train, and DRNM and Evenly will prevent you from OTK'ing which is you main goal when going second. Due to this urgent schedule is a total brick going first, and will likely just get negated going second.

Goal: Good ol' classic beatdown  Example combos:  Tour Guide -&gt; Rhino Warrior -&gt; Verte Anaconda = Heiress pitch to search Summoned Skull = Archfiend's Manifestation via Anaconda's effect  Special Summon two BA monsters for a similar combo, or go into Dante or a Link-2  With Manifestation on the field, tribute over it for Archfiend Commander to Special Summon it back, then overlay into Archfiend's Ascent, activate Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force to summon D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga  Similar effects can be achieved by destroying Archfiend Cavalry"

This is something I created as an improvement from my last deck, still allowing you to go first and gain even more advantage from cards like Max. I did need to put in Mekk-Knights to make this strategy work, however I don't think it deters from the strategy, rather improves it. Furthermore, I was able to establish a way to summon Lib effectively and link summon another max during your opponent's turn if you have the luxury of extra musket monsters. Is it perfect? No, not at all. One hand trap is sure to stop this deck in its tracks. However, I do think this is a fun take on Muskets that I think people will indeed enjoy."

Hand traps are pretty much staple and you need to be able to stop opponent plays so this deck runs 9 total.  &nbsp;  This deck is pretty straightforward. I know some do not like to run Pot of Avarice however it is very much needed vs any other control/mid-tempo decks to cycle back your Shaddoll fusions once they out all of it. The goal is to lock and/or disrupt opponent plays and when an opportunity arises, you can actually OTK via Purgatrio/Shaddoll Combo with Ariel and Resh/Augoeides. Learning when to use/summon your cards and disruptions pays off with this deck.  &nbsp;  This deck has been very consistent with several ways to finish the opponent. At most, a Mid-tempo deck and should not be in a grind game for too long as it will reduce your resources without any way to recycle them unless you use pot of avarice.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

I found myself not being able to get 2 monsters on the field without it. The only good normal summon for my pure version was Destiny HERO - Drilldark and I had to have another Destiny HERO in my hand, which isn't that hard but not good enough. Now I added my favorite engine of 3 Predaplant Orphys Scorpio and 1 Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra. 2 monsters on the board AND a free destiny fusion? Doesn't get better than that!  This deck is ever changing. Destiny HEROs are my favorite deck and I just really want to find a way to  break Fusion Destiny and D - Tactics. I have been testing many different versions that I will post inevitably. One of the biggest problems with this deck was that I needed my opponent to destroy my Destiny HERO - Dominance. Most of the time (if my opponent knew what it did) they would just ignore it and OTK me by killing my weaker monsters like Predaplant Verte Anaconda which I HATE leaving on the board. So I looked for a way to just get rid of Anaconda and destroy my own Dominance. That is when I stumbled upon Rapid Trigger. Never have I heard about this card and when I found it I thought it was the perfect card for my deck. I was looking for a quick play fusion card so I could summon Destiny HERO - Dystopia on my opponent's turn to trigger D - Tactics since D - Fusion sucks. So this card lets me fusion summon any monster on my opponents turn by destroying my monsters instead of sending them, triggering Doninance's effect? And it makes them unaffected by monsters summoned from the extra deck on top of that? Sign me up.  Okay so the deck's main strategy is to summon 2 monsters onto the field and make Anaconda. I have a 40 card deck and a lot of draw power in order to find Rapid Trigger and D - Tactics. Hard drawing Fusion Destiny is good because if the opponent negates your normal summon you can play through it. Normally you want to summon Dominance with Fusion Destiny by sending Malicious, Disk Commander, and Dreadmaster. Malicious because you want him in the grave, Disk for draw 2, and Dread for level 8 that when its special summoned Destiny HEROs cannot be destroyed and you take no damage from battles with them. Summon Dystopia with Anaconda by sending Drawhand and Dynatag. Monsters you send always change but those are best choices for both monsters.  For what to summon with Rapid Trigger: <ul>  	<li>If its your turn and all you have is Fusion Destiny and 1 Destiny HERO in hand, summon Dusktopia by destroying Dominance and the other monster on the field. You can trigger Dominance's effect and special summon 3 monsters. Link 2 of them into Xtra HERO Cross Crusader and bring back another monster to tribute to search for Destiny HERO - Plasma. Special summon a Malicious from the grave and tribute the Malicious, Cross Crusader, and the other monster for Plasma. You should have a Dusktopia still on the field who can protect Plasma and is partially protected itself from the effect of Rapid Trigger.</li>  	<li>If its your opponents turn and all you were able to summon was Anaconda and Dominance, summon Predaplant Dragostapelia for 1 monster negate.</li>  	<li>If its your opponents turn and you have 3 monsters on the field summon Predaplant Triphyoverutum for 1 extra deck special summon negation.</li>  	<li>Experiment yourself.</li> </ul> Cards to side/take out: Butterspy is an extender that can chainblock, Dreamer can protect from the grave, Dark angel is not that good but is spicy spell negation, Duster and twister for spell destruction (I keep facing Domain Monarchs and Mystic Mine).  Overall its not the most competitive deck but it is spicy and a lot of fun. I don't have any handtraps or other staples in the deck but feel free to add them. I would probably run 3 Called by if it were at 3....."

Before starting to talk about what the deck actually does, I want to clarify two things: First off, this is a Gemini deck, which means that you need to normally summon monsters twice to give them their printed effects; they also count as Normal monsters in the graveyard, which the deck makes use off quite a lot. Secondly, I use a small ""Red-Eyes"" and a small ""Tenyi"" engine to make the deck run smoother; I will further explain what cards I use and for what reasons I use them, but I can tell you from the start that a pure ""Chemicritter"" deck faces a few hurdles that I would rather like to solve with outside support.</p> <p>Which brings me straight to the deck: The ""Chemicritter"" core consists of two copies of ""<a data-name=""Chemicritter Carbo Crab"">Chemicritter Carbo Crab</a>"", which is both graveyard setup and a searcher as soon as you get its effects live. ""<a data-name=""Chemicritter Oxy Ox"">Chemicritter Oxy Ox</a>"" also clocks in at three copies, since it is the most convinient way to get Rank 7 and Rank 8 monsters on the board. ""<a data-name=""Poly-Chemicritter Dioxogre"">Poly-Chemicritter Dioxogre</a>"" is the main beater, who is able to make the summons of Gemini monsters unnegatable while also sporting a removal effect, while the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Poly-Chemicritter Hydragon"">Poly-Chemicritter Hydragon</a>"" is less powerful, but can have uses by boosting and protecting your monsters. You need both to make the most out of the copies of ""<a data-name=""Burnout"">Burnout</a>"" in the deck, which can be very helpful in a pinch while also having a seriously useful effect when banished from the graveyard. Three copies of ""<a data-name=""Catalyst Field"">Catalyst Field</a>"" since you need this Field Spell on the board to make any respectable plays, and while the previous build had both one copy of ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Metaverse"">Metaverse</a>"", I have take them both out in this version due to the new ""Chemicritter"" support card in form of ""<a data-name=""Dimer Synthesis"">Dimer Synthesis</a>"", which is better than the Field Spell searchers by a mile in this deck. The combination of being able to summon Level 5 or higher Gemini monsters without tribute, summon Gemini monsters twice and also have a removal effect at your disposal is very powerful and pretty much needed at any point during the game.</p> <p>Engine-wise, the ""Red-Eyes"" engine is mostly there to fill the graveyard with revivable monsters. The pure version of ""Chemicritters"" always suffered from not having enough targets in the graveyard to work with, a problem that is easily solved by the ""Red-Eyes"" cards. The main idea is to either draw the single ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Insight"">Red-Eyes Insight</a>"" to search for ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>"", or simply start the combo with the Fusion spell. Do not worry if you think that this is simply going to end up in ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>"" again like in pretty much any other deck in existence at the moment: In this deck, the combo is summoning ""<a data-name=""Meteor Black Comet Dragon"">Meteor Black Comet Dragon</a>"" via ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>"" by using a ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon</a>"" and a copy of ""<a data-name=""Mana Dragon Zirnitron"">Mana Dragon Zirnitron</a>"" from the deck and then using the effect of the Fusion monster to ditch the single ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Archfiend of Lightning"">Red-Eyes Archfiend of Lightning</a>"" for 1250 burn damage and further graveyard setup. If you started by playing ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Insight"">Red-Eyes Insight</a>"", you end up with the Fusion monster and every single ""Red-Eyes"" card in the deck in the graveyard, ready for numerous revival effects to target them. Drawing into the ""Red-Eyes"" monsters is no big deal, since you can use them with ""<a data-name=""Chemicritter Oxy Ox"">Chemicritter Oxy Ox</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Catalyst Field"">Catalyst Field</a>"" and both of the Main Deck options are rather helpful when their effects go live. Only drawing ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Insight"">Red-Eyes Insight</a>"" after using the Fusion Spell has no further use, but that is a small price to pay.</p> <p>The ""Tenyi"" cards in the deck are two copies of ""<a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda"">Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda</a>"", who combines an easy summoning effects for some swarming, another monster for Rank 7 plays and a handy bounce effect in one card. The deck also runs two copies of ""<a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a>"" to stop your opponent from doing certain things to the board. The Extra Deck monster ""<a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a>"" is only really in the deck if the opponent triggers the second effect of ""<a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a>"", but it can technically be summoned using the normal way aswell. I included a few Gemini support cards, namely ""<a data-name=""Supervise"">Supervise</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Gemini Ablation"">Gemini Ablation</a>"", into the mix since they help the deck with consistency and tempo. The only generic monsters in the deck are ""<a data-name=""Darkstorm Dragon"">Darkstorm Dragon</a>"", who is a technically a ""<a data-name=""Heavy Storm"">Heavy Storm</a>"" on legs and therefore very helpful in certain situations, and ""<a data-name=""Mana Dragon Zirnitron"">Mana Dragon Zirnitron</a>"", a monster that not only serves as Fusion material for ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>"", but also has an extremely helpful summoning condition while also recycling backrow. Since the opponent will try to destroy ""<a data-name=""Catalyst Field"">Catalyst Field</a>"" to slow down the deck, you will often have a chance to summon this monsters and plus off its effect.</p> <p>The Extra Deck is mostly a colorful mix of options you can use in various situations. The two Fusion monsters I have not talked about so far are ""<a data-name=""Superalloy Beast Raptinus"">Superalloy Beast Raptinus</a>"", who gives all Gemini monsters their effects as long as it is on the field, and ""<a data-name=""First of the Dragons"">First of the Dragons</a>"" who is helpful against deck with a lot of Effect monsters; so all the time, really. They can be summoned via ""<a data-name=""Dragon's Mirror"">Dragon's Mirror</a>"", which makes use of the monsters in the graveyard. The Xyz options are the archetypal boss monster ""<a data-name=""Vola-Chemicritter Methydraco"">Vola-Chemicritter Methydraco</a>"" (revive effect, removal and attack/target protection for Gemini monsters), ""<a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>"" (beater with added Spell negate), ""<a data-name=""Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon"">Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon</a>"" (beater with effect negation, ATK boost and bonus attacks), ""<a data-name=""Thunder End Dragon"">Thunder End Dragon</a>"" (""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" on legs), ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Metal Flare Dragon"">Red-Eyes Metal Flare Dragon</a>"" (burn card with added revive for ""Red-Eyes"" Normal monsters) and ""<a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>"" (steals the opposing monsters for the cost of one material and ""Big Eye"" attacking in the same turn). ""<a data-name=""Defender of the Labyrinth"">Defender of the Labyrinth</a>"" is a surprisingly good card that provides attack boosts for your board, lowers the ATK of opposing monsters and revives a non-Effect monster (and therefore, you guessed it, a Gemini monster) from your graveyard when it leaves the field. ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" is handy backrow removal, while ""<a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>"" can help with issues with the Field Spell.</p> <p>I personally think that ""Chemicritters"" are very fun to play in a more casually-minded environment. The deck has little to no reaction to the opposing plays on its own, but very much likes to just do its own stuff and see how it works out. The problem with Geminis in general is that every monster over Level 5 is a potential brick that you can only really get around by drawing into another copy of your Field Spell. In addition to that, they cannot keep up with decks that carefully manage their resources and will recover cards on a regular basis, since they will run out of cards rather quickly. But despite being Geminis and therefore being the slowest possible summons in the game, the archetype works rather well and is certainly quirky.</p> <p>If you want to know more about the ""Chemicritter"" archetype (or other archetypes for that matter), please feel free to visit my blog here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/09/19/archetype-analysis-chemicritters/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/09/19/archetype-analysis-chemicritters/</a></p>"

Rusty provides effect and attack negation, and a weird sort of grind game with 3 Fog Blade, the ability to recover Rust with Fog Blade, while Tri-Gate gets us an omni-negate that banishes. You could make Savage, but since we can banish, I think we should.  Since the pile of bricks was so huge, I wanted to run as many extenders and starters as possible, and I wanted to run 60 cards, hence the Dragonmaid engine. Since I knew the hand trap count would be light, and since I really wanted extenders, I incorporated Phantazmay. Ghost Mourner makes sense in this deck - generic effect negation is just good in the meta right now, and not having Imperm's restrictions makes it better when we're digging for answers with Phantazmay.  Updated the combo, to incorporate Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and Borreload Savage Dragon. Full board is Apollousa with 3 negates, 1 Rusty Bardiche with 1 Fog Blade, Borreload Savage Dragon, and Dragoon. If you can see a single extender, and don't need to burn it, you can extend to 4 negates on Apollousa or a second Fog Blade. With Dragoon, if your combo gets interrupted you can make an emergency Dragoon, but the deck is fully capable of playing through negates."

But this list is both different from the average Trickstar strategy and helps it thrive.  It can be a struggle to resolve Reincarnation+Droll combos, especially with Light Stage to 1, but this list mitigates that issue with the use of Generaider Boss Fight. The ability to summon Harr or Nidhogg in combination with ripping your opponent's entire hand is a powerful tool that the deck can abuse very, very well. Simply opening Droll+Boss Fight+Reincarnation (or any extension that can retrieve these cards), similar to the Reincarnation+Droll combo, will rip your opponent's hand while also establishing an extra negate body on your field. Among other things, cards like Trap Trick only make this more consistent.  However, even without the use of the Droll combo, the Generaider engine provides Trickstar with more board presence and utility than they could ask for. The ability to establish a full board of tokens while also being able to hand rip/negate a card effect with Harr/Nidhogg gives Trickstar room to breathe and be less vulnerable to cards like Lightning Storm or handtraps. If they waste their interaction on Candina or Light Stage, they're still going to have to deal with the Generaider portion and vice versa."

Charmers with a splash of orcus"" and you're wondering how could ""Zoodiac Majespector feat. Charmers with a splash of orcus"" work.  <em>it doesn't.</em>  here's my best guess  Step 0: give up save yourself  Step 1: Just say no  as you probably noticed most of the monsters in this deck die if you blink at them so you need to protect them. then you probably noticed that there isn't much to go around in this deck so what do you do? Just say no. Ash blossom and Droll &amp; lock will save you from the turn 1 ftk you deserve to deal with if you're playing with this deck and after that you need to set up the majespecter shuffle. What's that you ask? a loop that let's you lock down you're opponent from playing the game and search your entire deck till you barf xyz's trying to do you're best impressions of all those cool arc types that work.  Step 1 ex1: Set up scales  you need pendulum scales set up to do the shuffle and the ideal monsters for that is cat and frog cause cat is a slow searcher and frog is bad and only there for another 5 scale and as a tornado victim.  Step 1 xe2: have the god damn racoon  you need this stupid racoon to do anything in this dumb arc type including the shuffle cause apparently racoons are great dancers as well as the only thing making this deck function.  Step 1 ex3: WE NEED THE GOD DAMN RACOON'S TRAP CARD TOO DON'T WE  tornado says no to like half of major combo enders and it will be your primary stall tool as you do the shuffle, remember to always kill the racoon with it also remember you're daily dose of ash blossom... well... make you're opponent take their's  Step 1 ex4: get every card  do this over and over until you get fox, crow, supercell, storm and then you finished the majespector shuffle! now spam all the rank 4s you want with all that time you got to set up with zoo! go into beeg hole digger or Wynn, wait she has a link ver!  Step 2: win  great job, you did it. now, bravo. are you happy?"

Personally i would like to add dragoon in side and cards like Kaina and apollousa but gottastick with the most meta used.Borrelsword could be nice i guess.I would add triple tactics but desires makes sure you get your cards(unless opponent ash of course).Mind control could be good if you find yourself having trouble link climbing.  The plan is to stop opponent from playing(duh..)with nibiru -there can only be one ,for BA,dragon link,adamancipator,salads.Evenly matched for altergeist as well as lightting storm.Feel free to add MST/twin twisters/cosmic cyclone.Mask of restrict for monarchs.KILL elderich will accencode or if you side dragoon.Every handtrap for numeron really.Dark ruler no  more/droplet for dragoon,kozmo.

Utopia package in side deck is for whether or not you wish to build the Kali Yuga lockdown variant, in which case you need Utopia Kaiser, Kali Yuga, Big Eye, and Utopia Double+Double or Nothing.  Other than that, go wild. It's better to experiment and find out what build suits your playstyle and/or meta.  PK Fire is a very unique deck that combines the use of the Phantom Knights as an easy level 3 engine that can provide relevant forms of offensive and defensive plays, namely being able to set multiples of one of the best trap cards in the game: Phantom Knights' Fog Blade. On top of this, the Burning Abyss monsters provide an easy link climbing route and can also be utilized for Phantom Knights plays, such as summoning Break Sword and (more relevantly) Rusty Bardiche.  Not to mention, the Burning Abyss cards allow you to play through disruptions and can help pick apart an established board, or at the very least force bait negations/interruptions."

If you discard LV7 first you can get LV5 and then get Tempest. Gusto Griffin is your other best discard to summon itself and make Romulus  Artillery Catapult Turtle lets you get a LV5 on field to start your combos, but can also get Gaia the Magical Knight to summon the LV5 back from grave if you get it there first. Gaia is level 7 for an easy synchro.  Lightning is your best starter. It will trigger your Armed Dragons (or Gusto, which is the easiest way to full combo) when summoning Tempest, and will also set up the grave to summon Tempest again with his own effect. Opening Darkness Metal will even let you banish Tempest to search any Armed Dragon. Tempest can also search Darkness Metal, by discarding a card you want too!  Effect Veiler can be a surprisingly good normal summon, to make your Level 8 synchros at the end of your combo, or once Tempest is summoning itself every turn.  &nbsp;  Basically the combo goes:  Romulus &gt; ss Phalanx&gt; Linkross &gt; Martial metal&gt; summon back Phalanx &gt; (herald here if u want) &gt; Halqifibrax &gt; ss Rokket Synchron or Effect Veiler&gt; (make formula synchron if you didn't make Herald)  then it kinda varies. If I drew Guardragon I usually activate it here to get something for elpy then move it to get Darkness Metal and 1 more dragon for Saryuja. (Tempest can also be the better card to get off Elpy, for easy Level 8 synchros, especially since it will come back every turn.)  If you don't have Guardragon, it's usually best to go for Formula Synchron, because you need one more extender to make Saryuja with four.  If Saryuja draws you Armed Dragon LV7, summoning it here is the very best way to get to LV10, (NOTE: If you have Herald you can NOT discard to summon LV10) especially since it usually draws you a good discard for it too, or another quick launch (btw Reasoning is a 7th quick launch 80% often)  From here Saryuja's arrows let you use Elpy to get a low level or Darkness Metal (if you didn't already) for Pisty, and Pisty usually gets either a Rokket Synchron or a Level 7, but can also revive Romulus to get you one more link material for an Apollousa. (Try to save Tempest's revive for around here to make your synchro)  Once you use your Guardragons, use Protector Whelp to link them off. You can then finally Link that and Saryuja for Union Carrier.

Grind your opponent out or quickly dispatch their life points with a swift Double Summon turn.  Trade with everything your opponent tries to do and you will end up with more cards left with all of you +1's. Hand traps galore, as well as more traditional forms of board interaction. Pair this with a massive toolbox of some of the best XYZ monsters in the game and you've got a formula for a potent anti-meta deck.  42 cards is the classic formula for a 6 gadget deck. It gives you the most consistency while also helping to spread your gadgets out more."

Dragoon</a> + Backrow:</h6> Typical Salamangreat setup using <a data-name=""Salamangreat Gazelle"">Salamangreat Gazelle</a> that usually requires either <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> or <a data-name=""Will of the Salamangreat"">Will of the Salamangreat</a> to SS <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>. <h6>Board #2 Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf + <a data-name=""Dragon Buster Destruction Sword"">Buster Lock</a> + Backrow:</h6> Same Salamangreat setup with Salamangreat Gazelle. For this setup, instead of Link Summoning Predaplant Verte Anaconda you will go into <a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a>. You'll need one additional Cyberse on the field than you need for Board #1 to Link Summon <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> to equip the <a data-name=""Dragon Buster Destruction Sword"">Dragon Buster Destruction Sword</a> to. A Buster Lock will be better against ED-heavy Decks than Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon but since it's not a consistent endboard you could instead end it on Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf + <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Bagooska</a> + Backrow. <h6>Board #3: Red-Eyes D. Dragoon + Buster Lock:</h6> This is were this deck becomes more consistent. Sometimes you either won't be able to summon Salamangreat Gazelle to access your backrow or a Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf with <a data-name=""Salamangreat Roar"">Roar</a> or <a data-name=""Salamangreat Rage"">Rage</a> alone just won't be enough to stop your opponent. This setup works without Salamangreat Gazelle. Instead of going into Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf you go straight into Union Carrier and then use your extenders to SS Predaplant Verte Anaconda, equip Dragon Buster Destruction Sword to Predaplant Verte Anaconda and SS Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon.  &nbsp; <h6>Miscellaneous:</h6> I play 3 <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> with <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> since Dragoon is easily splashable and even if your opponent doesn't play him this card is still a great way to deal with an already established board (especially combo deck boards) using <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a>.  You still have your typical OTK as a win condition using <a data-name=""Update Jammer"">Update Jammer</a> and <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>. Accesscode Talker can be swapped for <a data-name=""Topologic Zeroboros"">Topologic Zeroboros</a>.  The afore mentioned boards aren't highly consistent and are rather a show of what an endboard with this Salamangreat deck could look like. There's a plethora of other board states you could pass your turn with including everyone's favorite: hard drawing Red-Eyes Fusion to SS Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and pass   like drawing handtraps and Parallel eXceeds only   for example having your Salamangreat Gazelle Ash'ed or your NS's effect Ghost Ogre'd with little to no follow-up  ."

Or maybe you're a new player and missed out on the reign of terror that was the Destiny Hero engine. Well strap in, because this is gonna be a blast from the past!  I won't lie to you, much of this deck's strength comes from leveraging the extremely easy access it has to Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon. It's the central play of the deck. We have a ton of chains that can end with positive value leading into a Verte Anaconda to set up your powerhouse boss monster.  Starting the game with any line into a Malicious into the GY gives you easy access to a Link 2 monster. Doing so with Dark Grepher, Armageddon Knight, or a Stratos into D-Draw will leave you with 2 warriors on the field, letting you link into Isolde. This is the best way to start the game, so if you have a line to get to an early Isolde that is where we begin.  Isolde then can grab you any card, generally I go for Disk Commander since he's the monster I'm the least likely to need access to later in the turn. Isolde can then dump ideally 4 equipment to special summon Stratos to then grab another card from the deck. If you've drawn into one of your equipment already, just summon whoever you can instead. Now you're back to 2 monsters and can Link into Verte Anaconda and summon your Dragoon. Isolde also conveniently sets up Divine Sword Phoenix Blade for you to get back and have a free pitch to your Dragoon every turn!  Now, that's the most basic line. If you find a way to get to 4 monsters in play (not too tall an order with all the special summons available to the deck), you can also go into Skull Dread for some extra value and then Link into Anaconda. Skull Dread is also excellent to get into play due to all of the effects we have that want cards in the deck, which he can help fix if we draw too many.  Cross-Sheep can also be accessed before going into Anaconda if you've gone 2nd and have access to Instant Fusion. This also gives an easy way into a Skull Dread link summon.  Doom Lord gives you another D-Draw target as well as a level 3 to find with Isolde. He's also lowkey pretty good on his own, getting around a lot of problematic cards."

Series, yet it doesn't seem to be able to compete with today's meta decks.  In this HERO build, we will explore on how can this deck will be able to compete or (hopefully) beat with today's meta.  The main starter for this build is <em>Vision HERO Faris</em>, with this card in your hand including 1 any other HERO monster will surely bring you victory considering your opponent doesn't have any negation. Even if you didn't draw this card, have no worries because there are many searchers in this deck that can lead you to this card. <em>Elemental HERO Shadow Mist</em>, <em>Xtra HERO Cross Crusader</em>, and<em> Elemental HERO Stratos</em> can search for your main starter. Wait, there's more, this additional cards can also help you search for you missing HERO cards <em>Reinforcement of the Army</em>, <em>Fusion Destiny</em>, <em>E-Emergency Call</em>, and <em>A Hero Lives</em>. With that many cards as your searcher, have no doubt that <em>Vision HERO Faris</em> will be in your hands most of the time  One of the most important thing to keep in mind is that you should always bait your opponent's negation so you can execute your combo without distraction. These cards are going to be your bait cards: <em>A Hero Lives</em>, <em>E-Emergency Call</em>, <em>Reinforcement of the Army</em>, <em>Lightning Storm</em>, <em>Elemental HERO Stratos</em>, <em>Foolish Burial</em>, and F<em>orbidden Droplet</em>. When you successfully baited your opponent, their board will be gone in no time and game will be finished in your favor  So this is going to be your main combo: <ul>  	<li>1. Use <em>Faris</em>' effect to discard <em>Malicious</em> or <em>Shadow Mist</em> to the GY</li>  	<li>1.1 If you discarded <em>Shadow Mist</em>, always chain link 1 shadow mist then chain link 2 <em>Faris</em> to prevent <em>Shadow Mist</em> from being negated by <em>Ash Blossom</em></li>  	<li>1.1.1 Using <em>Shadow Mist</em>'s effect search for<em> Evil HERO Adusted Gold</em></li>  	<li>2. Use <em>Faris</em>' effect to place <em>Vision HERO Increase</em> to the spell/trap zone</li>  	<li>3. Use <em>Incease'</em>s effect to send <em>Faris</em> to the GY, then special summon <em>Vision HERO Vyon</em> to the field, activate <em>Vyon</em>'s effect to send a copy of<em> Malicious</em> or <em>Shadow Mist</em> to the GY (whoever is the one you didn't discard from Faris' effect)</li>  	<li>3.1 If you sent <em>Shadow Mist</em> to the GY, activate it's effect to search for <em>Evil HERO Adusted Gold</em></li>  	<li>4. Use <em>Vyon</em>'s second effect, banish <em>Shadow Mist</em> to search for a copy of <em>Polymerization</em></li>  	<li>5. Link summon <em>Xtra HERO Cross Crusader</em> using <em>Increase</em> and <em>Vyon,</em> then use <em>Crusader</em>'s effect to special summon <em>Malicious</em> from the GY, activate <em>Crusader</em>'s second effect to tribute <em>Malicious</em> then search for<em> Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier</em></li>  	<li>6. Use <em>Adusted Gold</em>'s effect to search for <em>Dark Calling</em></li>  	<li>7. Use <em>Malicious</em> effect in the GY to special summon another copy of itself from the deck</li>  	<li>8. Fusion Summon <em>Elemental HERO Sunrise</em> using <em>Malicious</em> and<em> Liquid Soldier</em>, always chain link 1 <em>Liquid Soldier</em> then chain link 2<em> Sunrise</em></li>  	<li>9. Through <em>Sunrise</em>'s effect you can search a copy of <em>Miracle Fusion</em>, use this to fusion Summon <em>Elemental HERO Escuridao</em>.</li>  	<li>10. Activate <em>Dark Calling</em> to fusion summon <em>Evil HERO Malicious Bane</em> (as much as possible banish monster's that are not Destiny HERO, since you can still use them through the second copy of <em>Cross Crusader</em> in the Extra Deck)</li> </ul> Purpose of Side Deck Cards <ul>  	<li><em>Nibiru, The Primal Being</em> - Good against pure going 1st decks like zefra, infernoble knights, megalith, etc.</li>  	<li><em>Dinowrestler Pankratops</em> - Good against anti-meta decks and backrow decks</li>  	<li><em>Artifact Lancea</em> - Good against Invoked, Dogmatika, and Banish decks</li>  	<li><em>Mask Change</em> - If you're forced to be going 1st against certain type of decks, siding this in will give you a higher chance to have <em>Dark Law</em> or perform the <em>Absolute Zero</em> to <em>Acid</em> combo</li>  	<li><em>Forbidden Droplet</em> - Good against going 1st decks, side this in then take out 1 <em>Mask Change</em></li>  	<li><em>Prohibition</em> - Pretty Spicy card that i put in here (At first I was planning to use <em>Crossout Designator</em> but due to being bricky, I decided to use <em>Prohibition</em>) always call <em>Nibiru</em> when using this card unless you're pretty sure that you're opponent doesn't have one. If you're opponent doesn't have one you can just call a keypiece to his combo.</li>  	<li><em>Vanity's Emptiness</em> - Pretty self explanatory card, great card against combo decks.</li>  	<li><em>Anti-Spell Fragrance</em> - This card is just a less broken version of Imperial Order</li>  	<li><em>Imperial Order</em> - Broken card against especially against Sky Striker</li>  	<li><em>Red Reboot</em> - Since we're using an OTK Deck this card is a must</li> </ul> Things to remember: <ul>  	<li>If your opponent uses a targeting negate to your monster, you can chain mask change, <em>Vision HERO Increase</em>, or <em>Forbidden Droplet</em> to dodge the negation.</li>  	<li>Always chain <em>Forbidden Droplet</em> to any of your bait cards in order to force your opponent to activate the negation. Example: You activate <em>A Hero Lives</em> then your opponent chains <em>Borreload Savage Dragon</em>, you can chain f<em>orbidden droplet</em> to send <em>A HERO Lives</em> from your field to the graveyard in order to prevent it's effect being negated</li>  	<li>When using <em>Vision HERO Faris</em>' effect, always discard <em>Destiny HERO - Malicious</em> or <em>Elemental HERO Shadow Mist</em> (Though it's more preferable to discard <em>Malicious</em>) so that you can trigger their effect in the graveyard. <em>Malicious</em> is more preferable to discard since if<em> Faris</em>' effect has been negated you can still use <em>Maliciou</em>s' effect to summon another copy of it from the deck then Link Summon Xtra HERO Cross Crusader.</li>  	<li><em>Fusion Destiny</em> is the last bait card that you should use due to it's restriction that you will be limited that you can only special summon Dark Hero Monster on the whole turn (I prefer to use this card as a last resort if <em>Faris</em> has been negated, in that way you can still put up a decent board).</li> </ul>"

Theologia also allows Magistus as an engine. Easy Apol","LET'S GO!  Main concept here is to play regular pendulum spellcaster good stuff (Pend Magician, Majespecter, and Endymion) while having access to Magistus via 3 Theologia, 3 Verre, and Magistus Endymion. There's no streamlined combo, you gotta work with what you draw. <strong>Need a lot of practice to gain full advantage on each hand you draw</strong>. The Theologia route is the most common way to access Magistus, any random low lv spellcaster can be an Artemis which you can slap Theologia on for another Artemis but as equip to search Verre. Verre can be pend summoned to search fusion spell for Aiwass. To extend the play, pend lineup comes in handy. Usually we use Cross-Sheep (Aiwass can trigger it) and Selene (best link climber).  Magistus: 3 Theologia and Verre (best cards), 1 each Magistus Endymion (Spell Power Mastery another target and Artemis equip access), Magistus Invocation (combo piece), Vritra (Verre another target, dead if drawn double of it with no Magistus in GY).  Pend Magician: Harmonizing, 3 Duelist Alliance, and Pendulum Call (best cards). Dragonpulse (Dai, Harmonizing, and Call target while being low lv for Artemis), White Wing (same reason and is a wind spellcaster for Majespecter), and Chronograph-Timegazer. Double Iris is there as another Duelist Alliance and Call target.  Majespecter: 3 Bunbuku (best card), 1 each of Kyubi, Ogama, and Tornado. We dont play the Majespecter spell lineup because of scaling problem. Yata, the spell searcher has same 5 scale with Ogama while Kyubi is scale 2 giving Bunbuku versatility. The spells also cant be used going first which means cant help Servant Endymion anyway.  Endymion: 3 Spell Power, 1 Servant (low lv for Artemis and wind spellcaster for Majespecter), 1 Mighty Master (free spell negation), 1 Magister Endymion (another servant target, low lv for Artemis, and has good scale). We dont run Jackal King as it has bad scale and monster negation is covered by Apollousa already (doesnt prevent Nibiru tho).  The rest of it is just good spells for Servant spell counter and Selene requirement like Spellbook engine (insta 2 spells), Unexpected Dai (free Artemis), Instant Fusion (free Artemis while triggering Cross-Sheep), Upstart, and Called by the Grave.  Extra deck is combo pieces with generic stuff. 3 Artemis (as spare, we use 2 in first turn), 2 Selene (combo piece and Accesscode follow-up), Masq (low effort interruption), Crowley (for plus).  Side deck depends on matchup.  &nbsp;  Pros: Best deck. Majespecter is immune to Impermanence and Veiler.  Cons: Pend mechanic bad, need cards to put in scale and pend summon from extra deck is limited by extra/link zone. UNBAN KIRIN."

Fe,"It's difficult to tie charmers down to a specific strategy because it seems they are all over the place and don't have one defining style. This deck is a real life deck I plan to use and play in a casual setting when I finally get these cards. Thought I'd share some of my theorycrafting with everyone else who plans to play Charmers!  In this deck I tried to bring several spellcasters together with 1500DEF make use of the charmer spell/traps cards such as <strong>Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin</strong> (OPT monster negate), <strong>Unpossessed</strong> (Summon from deck) and <strong>Teamwork of the Unpossessed</strong> (Reborn + Non-Target Destruction).  <strong>Angraecum Umbrella</strong> is for level 7 synchro plays mostly for <strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong>, a self-resurrecting 3200ATK spellcaster. <strong>Cyberse Quantum Dragon</strong> are for monsters hard to remove.  A <strong>Dogmatika</strong> <strong>(Ecclesia, Theo, Punishment and N'Tss)</strong> engine is added (I didn't include Nadir Servant, it's too expensive. I'll add it one day when it's cheaper T_T.) 1500DEF Dogmatika spellcasters are added to synergize with Charmer S/T. Fortune Lady Every can be sent to the graveyard with Dogmatika cards and cheated out to the field without synchro summoning because it can resurrect itself easily.  <strong>Terraforming, Metaverse</strong> and <strong>Set Rotation</strong> search for our strongest Charmer card, <strong>Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin</strong>, which sets up a OPT monster negate with most of our spellcaster monsters. <strong>Secret Village of Spellcasters</strong> is also searchable as a control option for shutting down your opponent's spells.  <strong>Mind Control</strong> and <strong>Brain Control</strong> is added to provide link material from your opponent's field to the matching attribute Charmer, providing a form of removal and a way to resurrect your opponent's monster to your side of the field to link climb into Selene. (This can be cut if you feel first if you want to run handtraps or if you feel the deck is too big).  A link combo I've been experimenting on ends on an untargetable and un-destroyable <strong>Avramax    </strong> <em>or   </em> an unaffected 5000ATK <strong>Five-Headed Link Dragon</strong>, and only requires a Link Charmer to summon a monster from an opponent's graveyard to link climb into<strong> Selene, Queen of Master Magicians.</strong>  Example:  1. For this example, we will use <strong>Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze</strong> -&gt; Summons from opponent's graveyard their fire monster (ex. Ash Blossom or Almiraj). Link climb to<strong> Selene, Queen of Master Magicians.</strong> 2. <strong>Selene, Queen of Master Magicians </strong>-&gt; Resurrects any spellcaster in face up defense position. Make sure you meet the requirements to fulfill Selene's effect! 3. Link away <strong>Selene, Queen of Master Magicians </strong>-&gt; <strong>Linkross</strong>. Summon 3 Linkross Tokens with Linkross' effect. 4.  If you plan to make un-destroyable link 4 boss monster, link away two Linkross Tokens into <strong>I:P Masqurena,</strong> then link up to a link 4 like<strong> Avramax.</strong> Otherwise, link away five monsters on the field (Linkross, 3 Linkross Tokens, and the resurrected spellcaster) into <strong>Five-Headed Link Dragon.</strong>  Other generic boss link monsters such as Apollousa, The Bow of the Godess, Borrelsword Dragon or even Unchained Abomination can be summoned with this combo. I just happen to use Five-Headed Link Dragon and Avramax because they're my favourites.  The win conditions in this deck are our generic boss Link monsters, <strong>Five-Headed Link Dragon</strong> or <strong>Avramax</strong>. Also, this deck can play a mean grind game with <strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong>. As this deck works towards these monsters, you have some control, destruction, and removal options. Overall, this deck is meant for casual duels, and it isn't too strong. One day, maybe there will be a way to break this deck and make it absolutely broken. For now, we'll enjoy casual duels with Charmers! :)"

I will go through the decklist card by card to tell you how and why they are used along with what they can be replaced by from the side. at the end of the list i will add a list of good water cards that you can use aswell. This deck is susceptible to hand traps and called by the grave.  <strong>Atlanteans:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Neptabyss, The Atlantean Prince.</strong> - This card is your main <em>pitcher</em> to activate your Dragoons. It also adds another Atlantean card to your hand giving you a <em>+1</em> when his effect is allowed to go off and you pitch dragoons. Besides that he has a a <em>High likely hood of being in your starting hand</em> (either as this card or as 4 different options). Just like other Atlanteans he has a ditch effect, which special summons an Atlantean from the grave which makes him a good <em>floater / extender.  </em>Even if this effect is negated it will still send a Dragoon to be <em>sent for cost</em>.</li>  	<li><strong>Atlantean Dragoons.</strong> - These are run at three because you cant run more than three. Honestly this card is amazing! He can be <em>ditched for cost by any water </em>monster and he will <em>add any sea serpent type </em>monster from the deck to hand making him a <em>hand floater </em>and makes Neptabyss a +1. He is also a combo starter for multiple combos including an anti nibiru combo.  His second effect is useless 99.9% of the time. He is a level 4 water monster meaning he can xyz into Bahamut Shark.</li>  	<li><strong>Atlantean Heavy Infantry.</strong> - This is one of 2 Atlantean cards that has a destruction effect upon <em>ditching for cost. </em>This one pops a face-up card your opponent controls. Due to this effect being mandatory it can be used to chain block so that Atlantean Dragoons cant be ashblossomed this usually only works when paired with megalo. and this isnt the only card that can chain block for dragoons. Anything with the mandatory effect can chain block so you are guaranteed your search. Heavy Infantry's secondary effect is rather good too and can actually enable a play if Crystron Quandax was being used - to go into an easy toad (as 6th summon). I run this at 2 to prevent bricks as running at three bricked me a little too much for my liking (if i wasnt running the Ronintoadin and Swap Frogs I would run this at 3).</li>  	<li><strong>Atlantean Marksman.</strong> - This is the second of the destruction Atlanteans that I run. It can pop 1 face-down card on the field and is primarily used to pop pesky traps and trigger them at disopportunate times for your opponent. Just like with Atlantean Marksman this card effect doesn't need a target to trigger and as such can be used to chain block for protection of Atlantean Dragoons. Also similarly to Dragoons its secondary effect is not used very often at all and I often forget about it but it is able to search for any of the Atlantean monsers I run, so it is technically an eigth way into Atlantean Neptabyss. Due to the brick potential of this card and the fact that there are better spell/trap destruction that I could run, I only run the singular copy of this card.</li> </ul> <strong>Deep Sea:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Deep Sea Diva. </strong>- This sea serpent is essentially 3 more copies of Atlantean Neptabyss as when it is normal summoned it can special summon <em>any level 3 or lower sea serpent </em>monster from your deck (usually Neptabyss). Not only this but it is a level 2 <em>tuner,</em> which is a great way of getting Crystron Halqifibrax out on the field. This card is <em>VERY </em>susceptible to hand traps like Ghost Ogre, Ash Blossom, Effect Veiler and Infinite Imperminence. When Diva's effect gets negate it stops your neptabyss being so easy to bring out as you have used your normal summon. Luckily there are multiple other ways to bring him out besides a normal summon or Diva effect. I run 3 of her because she makes getting Atlantean Neptabyss in the starting hand more consistant.</li>  	<li><strong>Deep Sea Minstrel.</strong> - The second of 2 Deep Sea cards in this deck is another <span><em>combo enabler</em></span> but it can also deal with pesky <em>hand traps</em> like Nibiru, Ash Blossom, etc that we don't want interupting our set up. When paired with Atlantean Dragoons in the starting hand you can start the game with a nibiru in their banished pile or a combo that cant be stopped because the hand trap you hate the most is out of their hand. The fact you get to see their hand is incredibly powerful aswell. Due to the fact you know whats in their hand you can predict what they are going to do with those cards and play around that to back them into a corner. And thats just the first effect! Its second effect enables all of our Atlantean monsters and recycles 1 level 4 or lower water monster from grave to the deck when its special summoned.  Since Called By The Grave has been limited I have been running 3 of these because you want to see them often.</li> </ul> <strong>Mermails:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Mermail Abyssmegalo. </strong>- Now we are getting into some big bois. Megalo can special summon himself from the hand by sending to water monsters from hand as cost (Atlantean enabling) with 2400 attack he is one of the only monsters from the main deck that will be doing any attack. Especially seeing as when he is summoned this way he can search for 1 abyss- spell or trap (Abyss-scale Of The Mizuchi) to boost his attack to 3200. But wait he still has 1 more trick up his scale. As an activation he can send 1 face-up <em>attack</em> position monster you control to the GY as cost to allow him to attack twice in a turn. You cannot use this effect however if you go first. As a level 7 he can also enable the deck to go into level 8/9 synchros as wellDue to Megalo being a sea serpent meaning he is easily searchable I only run 1 of him, this also stops him cloggin the hand too often.</li>  	<li><strong>Mermail Abyssteus. </strong>- The other level 7 card used in the Mermail archetype is Teus. He only requires 1 discard for his special summon which can start combos really nicely with Dragoons as you wont lose any card advantage due to Teus' second effect (when special summoned this way he can add 1 level 4 or lower Mermail monster from the deck to hand). You want to see this card in every starting hand with a Dragoons. Unfortunately there is no way to make seeing him in your hand more consistant at the moment and as such I have to run 3 of him in hopes of seeing him often.</li>  	<li><strong>Mermail Abysspike.</strong> - Our level 4 Mermail card is called Abysspike he is searchable via Teus and can support the combo into a Toadally Awesome. When he is normal or special summoned he can ditch a water monster for cost and then add any level 3 water monster from deck to hand - with no Marincess Sea Horse in the main deck you only have 2 options (Deep Sea Minstrel or Mermail Abyssgunde). I only run 1 of this guy as he can be a clog and he is searchable through our combo.</li>  	<li><strong>Mermail Abyssgunde.</strong> - To round off our Mermail monsters, Abyssgunde is used to special summon your other Mermails that are in the grave. This can extend your plays with an extra synchro monster or you can use that monster as link / Trish bait. This effect does not require Gunde to be discard for cost and can be discarded in anyway. Because of how chaining works, we can chain block our opponents optional effects with Gunde in order to keep our own optional monster effect from being negated. I only run her at 1 because I haven't used her much ever and when i do its just to extend my bored, otherwise she gets stuck in my hand.</li> </ul> <strong>Frogs:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Swap Frog.</strong> - This level 2 aqua monster is actually a good extender, it requires a discard of 1 water monster to be discarded so that he can special summon himself (this <em>does not trigger Atlanteans</em> but it will trigger Gunde and Bluebeard). Whenever swap frog is special summoned he can send one level 2 aqua monster from the deck to the grave (usually Ronintoadin as it means you cant draw him later on as a brick). He can also target one monster you control (even himself) to the hand to normal summon an extra frog this turn (<em>except himself</em>). He usually sends himself unless you have a monster you want as a normal summon next turn (Diva) as all of his effects are a soft once per turn, so he can special summon himself again and send the other swap frog from deck to grave. Now this is useful as it enables Ronintoadins effect. I have played around with different ratios of Swap Frogs but I found that having 2 was better than having 3 (regardless of the fact that having only 2 limits Toadally Awesomes effect) as it bricks your hands a lot less.</li>  	<li><strong>Ronintoadin.</strong> - As I was saying above Ronin is usually sent to the grave by Swap Frogs effect as it enables him. Ronins effect is: he can banish 1 Frog monster from your grave and then special summon him to the field. He can be used for and xyz summon of Toadally Awesome along with Swap Frog. I have also used this recursion effect once toadally awesome has died to special summon Ronin as an <em>extender</em> for link play because sadly he cannot be used as a synchro material</li> </ul> <strong>Other Water Monsters:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Moulinglacia The Elemental Lord. </strong>- Moulin is a tricky card, he has a great card effect and a fairly easy summoning condition however... he does have one hell of a down side. His summon conditions are that he can be special summoned from the hand when the number of water monsters in your grave is <em>exactly </em>5, this is very easy for this deck to do with the amount of cards that like being sent to the grave and link summoning a link-2 can sometimes be helpful to fulfill these requirements. When he is special summoned this way he can discard 2 cards from your opponents hand at random, this essentially means your opponent starts their turn with 4 cards instead of 6. Be careful with this effect however as alot of cards in the game like to be in the grave (Burning Abyss and Shadoll trigger when sent). Lastly his effect reads that when he leaves the field (by any means) you have to skip your next turns battlephase (essentially meaning you cant attack for 2 turns if you went first). With a 2800 attack value he is the monster with the strongest original attack in my deck and is often used as a beater alongside Megalo. Moulin is a sea serpent which means he can be searched by Dragoons and as such I only run 1 of him (just like Megalo) however if u see him in your hand its a good sign.</li>  	<li><strong>Lappis Dragon. </strong>- Despite his name Lappis is a sea serpent which means he is searchable like Moulinglacia is. These two cards have been honourary Mermail / Atlantean cards for a long time as they just fit in so well. Especially Lappis as his effect reads that when he is add from deck to the hand (via Dragoons) he can Special summon himself. this is a super useful effect as it means you can get Halqifibrax out when you dont summon a Diva due to Lappis being a tuner. Not only is he a tuner but he i s a level 5 tuner, this means 1 Neptabyss and Lappis can also summon Brionac, Dragon of the Ice barrier. The fact he can special summon himself means he can be used for link bait and for a lvl9 synchro aswell if paired with a lvl4. His secondary effect is a little less useful as he can special summon himself from the when he is added from the grave especially seeing as you can only use 1 of the 2 effects per turn. i run him at 1 because he is searchable and i can bring him back with Coral Anemone if desperately required.</li>  	<li><strong>Gameciel, The Sea Turtle Kaiju. </strong>- Gameciel is a kaiju... enough said. all jokes a side he is amazing at outing cards like Avramax, borrelsword, Accesscode Talker and Borrelload Savage Dragon. even if i get 2 in my hand he is a water kaiju so i can Moray Of Greed him back to the deck or use the second gameciel as link bait or synchro material. We dont use any of his other effects (what a surprise) as they are specifically for the kaiju archetype. I run 3 of them in my starting main-deck as you never know what to expect from your opponent and they are usually the things to be sided (especially against Mystic Mine) for Cosmic Cyclone or other side deck cards.</li>  	<li><strong>Fishborg Launcher.</strong> - Fishborg Launcher is a great target for Halqifibrax to summon due to its recursion effect. This monster does nothing on the field except be a lvl1 tuner however whilst it is in the graveyard and all other monsters in your grave are water monsters it can special summon itself onto the field once per turn however when it leaves it has to be banished. This recursion effect allows the deck to synchro summon multiple times a turn or it can be used link bait. He is a great extender for the deck. He is definetely the best synchro for this deck as all of my synchros are water type so the limitation fishborg has on itself to only summon water synchros is pretty irrelevant. I run this little dude at 2 as it grants me more plays later in the game and gives my Foolish Burial an extra target.</li>  	<li><strong>Barrier Statue Of The Torrent. </strong>- This is our lock out monster. He has a continous effect that prevents both players from special summoning anything but water monsters, by the time this is out I dont need the very few monsters in my extra deck that aren't water so this doesnt hinder me in the slightest. However my opponent will be forced alot of the time to summon a monster and skip their MP1 to get rid of the Torrent. Torrent is also super easy to summon once he is sent to the grave by any means as Marincess Coral Anemone can special summon it due its attack being sub 1500. This is usually how i get the Barrier Statue out on the field.</li>  	<li><strong>Bluebeard, The Plunder Patrol Shipwright. </strong>- This Card could be deemed my signature for this deck as I have never seen any lists, or any other player use it. I will admit its a little cruedly placed in the deck but I promise you there is a reason. His effect activates when he is <em>sent</em> to the grave from the field or monster zone. When he is sent he can discard <em>for cost</em> another card from the hand to draw 1 card. If the sent card is Dragoons you cycle through your deck that much faster at a +0 card advantage. having this effect means that I can essentially trigger Atlantean effects with a Swap Frog by sending the Bluebeard as the discard. The rest of his effects are Plunder Patrol based and arent useful to this deck in the slightest, I may play around with having a second Bluebeard at some point but for now I am running him at 2 to avoid bricks and I just dont have enough space to put another in. Love this card.</li> </ul> <strong>Spells:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>One For One.</strong> - OFO is in essence another Neptabyss summoner however it can be used on Fishborg Launcher too and in the OCG this card is also useful to summon Crystal Girl which will be going in the deck when that gets released. Ditching Bluebeard will trigger it. Run 1 cause its limited...</li>  	<li><strong>Moray Of Greed. </strong>- Moray Of Greed is my draw power of the deck and it allows me to send unwanted water monsters from hand back to the deck. It is a +0 draw power. that just means it cycles through the deck well but not great. Running these at 3 because they <em>are </em>good cards no doubt no doubt.</li>  	<li><strong>Pot Of Avarice. </strong>- Avarice is a brilliant card to draw after first turn. and its also a great card to have first turn with Moulinglacia having the same requirements that Avarice does. I dont have enough space to put a second Pot in as it would throw off the consistancy.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish Burial.</strong> - Used to chuck 3 targets into the grave and if none of those 3 aren't in the deck when you activate this card so you can thin out the deck for your next draw.</li>  	<li><strong>Abyss-scalle Of The Mizuchi. </strong>- Gives Mermails it is attached to a boost of 800. I usually use this card on Mermail Abyssalacia unless im going for an OTK with Megalo. This card also has a mandatory effect to negate your opponents first spell that is play but will be destroyed doing so. This effect doesn't destroy so field and continous spell effects are still going to be on the field. Field spells are worse to deal with as most of there effects are activated once the card is on the field.</li> </ul> <strong>Extra Deck:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Trishula, Dragon of Icy Imprisonment. </strong>- I use this card to go into True King of All Calamaties due to it being a level 9. Thats all this card is value wise to me. Its a level 9 monster that I can summon by banishing any 3 monsters on the field that I wont use. Linkross and a linkross token gets me 2 different monsters, so that leaves 1 monster left to banish. As long as you synchro one of the two lvl9's (preferably Ravenous Crocodragon if you know your opponents hand is free of hand traps) before you play Linkross you will also have a Fishborg Launcher to summon back then banish that fishborg because it would be banished anyway. That way you don't banish a 4th monster that is unnecessarily banished. Running only 1 because of how steep the summoning cost is.</li>  	<li><strong>Trishula, Dragon Of The Ice Barrier.</strong> - Another lvl9 synchro monster used for multiple thhings. When it is summoned you can Banish 1 card from your opponents hand, GY and field. This does not target cards meaning it is a great out to Avramax and other troublesome monsters that can't be targeted or destroyed. Seeing as it rips 1 card from the hand paired with Moulinglacia, your opponent will start with 3 cards in hand to play with.</li>  	<li><strong>Ravenous Crocodragon.</strong> - Again its another lvl9 except it has many more uses than the other 2. Because its a lvl9 it can be xyz material for Calamaties or use its effects to gain an advantage over the opponent. When he is synchro summoned he can draw cards equal to the amount of non-tuner synchro materials used for the summon. This trigger effect can give you more resources to play on, or keep them to deal with your opponents counter plays. The second effect of Crocodragon is a destruction quick effect that requires the discard of 2 cards (as cost) from the hand to destroy 1 card on the field. Running 1 because lvl9's are hard to summon.</li>  	<li><strong>Adamancipator Risen - Dragite.</strong> -  This lvl8 synchro is another card that we only use half of its full effect because it isn't as generic as other cards. The effect we do use is a negation effect for spell or traps once per turn. Besides the negation its a 3000 atk beater. I only need to run 1 of these as it is a hard once per turn negate (no need for multiple on the field) and they are hard to get the resources to summon. Use this card if you are going 1st.</li>  	<li><strong>White Aura Whale.</strong> - Another lvl8 synchro with an effect we can fully utilise in this deck and none other! its requirements are stiff for most decks but not a water deck. When this card is synchro summoned it can destroy all face-up attack position monsters your opponent controls. Great destruction effect for clearing large boards your opponent has. His other effect is a revival effect which can be used to prevent damage to your face by summoning in defense. This card is great for clearing boards even when the opponent builds a new board due to its 2800 atk and piercing battle damage. Use this card if your opponent goes first and sets up a board.</li>  	<li><strong>Brionac, Dragon Of The Ice Barrier. </strong>- Another useful card going 2nd to clear boards and trigger Atlantean effects. This cards attack isn't anything to ride home about so isnt often used for attacking other monsters.</li>  	<li><strong>True King Of All Calamaties.</strong> - The best combo in this deck ends on this card and 3 cards ripped from the opponents hand. VFD negates monster effects your opponent controls stopping their combos before they can react. With 3000 atk and 3000 def VFD is an amzzing card to special summon in defense as most monster will struggle to get over it.</li>  	<li><strong>Bahamut Shark. </strong>- A rank 4 xyz that summons Toadally Awesome and can then be linked off as a water material. I only use 1 of these because the deck doesnt churn out lvl4's all too often.</li>  	<li><strong>Toadally Awesome. </strong>- Best hand trap counter. Due to the lack of frogs Toadally Awesome can't use his effect to special summon more targets for his negate effect but he can send; Gameciel, Gunde and Barrier Statue Torrent. When Toadally Awesome is sent to the grave he can add 1 water monster from the grave to the hand, this can be used to recycle extra deck monsters and Teus as it cannot be searched by any of our cards but Mermail Abyssalacia. I run 2 copies as 1 can be summoned by Bahamut Shark and 1 can be summoned by Swap Frog and Ronintoadin.</li>  	<li><strong>Marincess Marbled Rock.</strong> - This card can be used with the 4 side deck Marincess cards to make a 4500 atk unaffected card. Which is fun! Based on the main deck however Marbled Rock is used for recursion of Coral Anemone and is part of the ""Marincess Loop"".</li>  	<li><strong>Marincess Coral Anemone.</strong> - 1 of the better link monsters in the extra deck with a recursion that special summons any 21/33 of the monsters in the deck including Barrier Statue Torrent for the Lock of your opponents special summon. This card is also able to recycle Marincess Marbled Rock for the ""Marincess Loop"".</li>  	<li><strong>Mermail Abyssalacia.</strong> - Link-2 that searches any Mermail monster from deck by sending (for cost) a water monsterfrom hand to grave. This cards second effect sends (for cost) a water monster from deck to special summon a water monster from grave. Usually used to special summon Teus, White Aura Whale or any other heavy hitters.</li>  	<li><strong>Crystron Halqifibrax.</strong> - Starts the synchro plays and can be summoned multiple ways usually via (Diva + Neptabyss) or (Neptabyss + Lappis). Halq can be used to counter Mystic Mine with a side in of T.G. Wonder Magician by chaining Halq's banish effect.</li>  	<li><strong>Linkross. </strong>- This card has 1 singular use and that is to be used as banish materials for Trishula, Dragon Of Icy Imprisonment.</li> </ul> Side Deck: <ul>  	<li><strong>Marincess Sea Horse.</strong> - Used as an extender and as a secondary target for Marincess Marbled Rocks recycle effect. This cards is part of the ""Unaffected Rock"" combo.</li>  	<li><strong>Marincess Battle Ocean.</strong> - This card gives Marbled Rock its bonus to its attack and make it unaffected in the combo.</li>  	<li><strong>Marincess Sea Angel. </strong>- part of the ""unaffected Rock"" combo</li>  	<li><strong>Marincess Crystal Heart.</strong> -  part of the ""unaffected Rock"" combo</li>  	<li><strong>Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood. </strong>- This card is only used against decks that special summon and only in the 3rd round and only in timed matches. so that you can win by life points at time. Its a very cheeky way of winning but its funny.</li>  	<li><strong>T.G. Wonder Magician. </strong>- Sided in against mystic mine as a counter to the field spell.</li>  	<li><strong>Dark Ruler No More.</strong> - sided against strong board makers so you can make a field of your own to destroy theirs paired with gameciels its 6 ways to get rid of their field.</li>  	<li><strong>Cosmic Cyclone.</strong> - side in against spell and trap decks / fluffals</li> </ul> Anything you think needs changing about the deck comment I will be looking at comments and testing things constantly."

Plenty of extenders help you get to the deck's real playstarter, Isolde, and a deck thick enough to bury your potential garnets among the extenders. You even have the option to #mill9 for Gearfried straight from the deck, thanks to all the equip spells Isolde can use! This deck also allows you to take the alternative Three Warriors path by using King Artorigus to grab any Infernoble Arms spells that you need from the deck. The Halq plays utilize the Rose Dragons to easily go into your Captain Roland and Charles with a reduced chance of bricking, and you can use the leftover Halq and another material to go into Dragoon, or if you draw the fusion spell, use Halq to bring out Quandax and make a Savage Dragon on you opponent's turn.</span>"

The entire archetype is made up of Dark Warrior monsters with low stats, who trigger their effects whenever they deal battle damage to the opponent. The cards are fairly old, which also shows in their overall power: ""Dark Scorpions"" have almost no synergy, are fairly cloggy and pretty slow since most of the time they cannot summon more than one monster. Nonetheless, here is my take at making them passable.</p> <p>I decided to run the ""Dark Scorpions"" monsters at the following ratios: Three copies of ""<a data-name=""Don Zaloog"">Don Zaloog</a>"", since he is the biggest beater the archetype has to offer that you can Normal summon without a tribute while also having the best effect by forcing the opponent to discard cards if he runs through; three ""<a data-name=""Dark Scorpion - Meanae the Thorn"">Dark Scorpion - Meanae the Thorn</a>"" allow you to search other ""Dark Scorpions"" with relative ease while she is equipped with ""<a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>""; two ""<a data-name=""Dark Scorpion - Cliff the Trap Remover"">Dark Scorpion - Cliff the Trap Remover</a>"" since he is backrow removal on legs, even though his effect is incredibly slow in comparision to other Spell/Trap removal cards; one ""<a data-name=""Dark Scorpion - Chick the Yellow"">Dark Scorpion - Chick the Yellow</a>"", since he is probably the worst of the bunch, but the deck manipulation effect might come handy one in a while; and lastly one ""<a data-name=""Dark Scorpion - Gorg the Strong"">Dark Scorpion - Gorg the Strong</a>"", who's bounce effect is actually pretty nice but is held back by the fact that you need to tribute a monster to summon him.</p> <p>While the archetype itself might not have tons of consistency, they can get help due to the fact that they have the Dark and Warrior combination. ""<a data-name=""Destiny Hero - Malicious"">Destiny Hero - Malicious</a>"" is an easy Special summon and can be used as Link material, ""<a data-name=""Dark Grepher"">Dark Grepher</a>"" can be Special summoned while setting up ""<a data-name=""Destiny Hero - Malicious"">Destiny Hero - Malicious</a>"" in the graveyard and ""<a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a>"" is further graveyard setup in the Attribute/Type combination. The most important generic monster of the deck is definitely ""<a data-name=""Dark Armed Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a>"", who can be summoned with relative ease since you can control the number of Dark monsters in the graveyard via the previously mentioned monster plus ""<a data-name=""Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade"">Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade</a>"", and he can be a supreme clean-up crew who gives the ""Dark Scorpions"" the chance to run through unimpeded.</p> <p>In terms of Spells and Traps, the ""Dark Scorpions"" can also make use of their typing and Attribute. ""<a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>"" is a powerful draw option, while the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>"" allows you to search the right Warrior monster for the case. ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>"" are obviously there to clear out front- and backrow respectively, while ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" serves as a swarming tool or even allows you to take opposing monsters from their graveyard to work with. The rest of the Spells consists of Equip Spells, which can boost the stats of your ""Dark Scorpion"" monsters into preferable regions while also ensuring that you will cause battle damage to the opponent. They can also be used for ""<a data-name=""Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights"">Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</a>"", which is yet another way to gain more monsters than you would normally be able to. Trap-wise, the focus lies on stat manipulation, with both ""<a data-name=""Wall of Disruption"">Wall of Disruption</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Mirror Wall"">Mirror Wall</a>"" weakening opposing monsters so far that they die in battle against ""Dark Scorpions"" and therefore trigger their effects, and the searching of Equip Spells via ""<a data-name=""Armory Call"">Armory Call</a>"", which can also cause any opposing monster to lose the fight by choosing ""<a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>"" or simply cause quite a lot of damage via cards like ""<a data-name=""United We Stand"">United We Stand</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Mage Force"">Mage Force</a>"".</p> <p>The Extra Deck tries to give the deck coverage in various situations. Backrow removal exists in form of ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse"">Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"", cards that can deal with opposing monsters include ""<a data-name=""Number 101: Silent Honor ARK"">Number 101: Silent Honor ARK</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Akashic Magician"">Akashic Magician</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>"". The last effect block is themed around stat boosts, which are provided by ""<a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a>"".</p> <p>The deck is still pretty underwhelming in comparision to what other decks are able to do, but I think this is playable while also staying true to the ""Dark Scorpion"" playstyle.

I picked this name for my deck, in reference to <em>Beelzebufo</em>, an extinct frog whose name roughly translates to ""Devil Frog"". You might recognize <em>Beelzebufo </em>from the 2017 game Ark: Survival Evolved. And to be honest with you, that name is fitting for this animal, because it was 16 inches long--about as large as a beach ball--and ate baby dinosaurs for breakfast! Oh, and it had horns.  &nbsp;  As for this deck itself, it's not that much different from other Paleo Frog decks. It's either go first or burst, set a bunch of cards, and try to summon Toadally Awesome as quickly as possible. Actually, there is one small difference. This deck uses a small Fiend engine. 3 copies of Lilith, Lady of Lament to search out your Normal Traps, and 3 copies of Dark Sacrifice. Dark Sacrifice helps protect your field from any effects that would nuke your backrow. It also sets up your Graveyard by sending a Level 3 or lower DARK monster like, let's say...Absolute King Back Jack?  &nbsp;  Absolute King Back Jack and Dark Sacrifice are both good tech choices for Paleo Frogs, since this archetype loses to Harpie's Feather Duster and Lightning Storm. When Back Jack is sent to the Graveyard, you can look at and rearrange the top 3 cards of your deck. And during your opponent's turn, you can banish it from the Graveyard to set a Normal Trap from the top of your deck--and you can activate it on that same turn!!"

Runs 2 copies of Ancient Gear Golem, Ultimate Pound, and Reactor Dragon, as they have some brick potential, but need at least a few of each. 3 copies of Wyvern, and Gear Frame to get what you want into the hand. 2 copies of Ancient Gear Gadget for some added protection. Polymerization is run at 2 because of Ultimate Pound's effect but it can still be pretty useful. Ancient Gear reborn is very useful for keeping yourself alive when no monsters are on the field and can recycle Wyvern's and Hunting Hound's effects. Cross-Dimensional Duel can be useful for protecting your monsters from certain effects or destruction. Ancient Gear Catapult can take advantage of Geartown's and Ancient Gear Fortress's floating effects while also being an easy way to get a Golem onto the field. When fusion summoning, use Howitzer to deal 1000 damage and get an easy Golem if destroyed by battle, whether by you or your opponent.

This deck takes advantage of the new God Slime card being an extra deck monster so the dogmatika cards can play off of him. There are a bunch of traps (the slow part) but I will say they are effective at getting you through a turn or two and setting up the slime. I doubt it would work too well vs the top tier decks but it could be effective against lower tiers. I did not post my side deck, I am still trying to figure that out so any advice would be helpful. Anyway this is a fun deck that just uses some of the new cards from the recent sets!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  P.S.  You could also replace some of the traps for TTT."

The Opening of the Spirit Gates engine gets a Dragoon of Red Eyes, while looping Continuous spells to the hand and being fodder for Golden Lord, and gives the deck another discard engine, which creates a Special Summon that brings the deck through I:P to Rusty, who can, in turn, extend with Shade Brigandine into Verte Anaconda after getting a negate on the board. I'm running Dogmatika Punishment still, with the idea being you can try and combo off on your first turn, but if you're interrupted I want to play the grind game as efficiently as possible. I'm running 1 Omega over a 3rd Nt'ss, for those situation where you only need to pop 1 monster, to get a little extra grindy value. The deck does have a bunch of ways to close games without ever going into the extra deck, so the idea is to get things into a simplified game state, and go for the kill when it is assured."

Negation-heavy, graveyard heavy. ","As the title suggests, this deck revolves around Endless Decay as the boss monster, and utilizes the effects of Zombie World to access the GYs (as well as slow your opponent down). Zombie World will prevent some opponents from running their decks properly, as it changes all monsters in the GYs and on the field to Zombie type. Endless Decay is works best when it is summoned early, as it's ATK is whatever your opponent's LP are, divided by 2, at the time of summon. It is especially potent in 2v2, where if summoned first turn, it has 8000 ATK. Watch out for Solemn Judgement, as a well-timed use will almost completely negate the firepower of this deck.  There are quite a few negate cards that will give you some breathing room to summon ED and the other powerful powerful monsters. Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend is especially potent and relatively simple to special summon (so long as you can keep alive at least one of its synchro materials. Always try to have Zombie World on the field. It will make a handful of summons very easy as well as mess up your opponent when they need to tribute. Red-eyes Zombie Dragon becomes more powerful with each Zombie monster on the field and in the GYs, so it can be a very reliable late-game Synchro monster it's too late to summon an Endless Decay or too difficult to summon Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend.  &nbsp;  A few tips:  Special summon Endless Decay as early as possible. Use Pyramid Turtle to bait opponent into attacking for a special summon from the deck of a 2000 or less DEF Zombie Monster (Endless Decay, Doomking Balerdroch). Use Mezukis and then Burial From a Different Dimension to ensure that the useful effect monsters can continue to be summoned from the graveyard. Fusion Summon Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon with SuperPoly after placing Zombie World in a field zone.  Use Tatsunecro, Glow-Up Bloom, and Jack-O-Bolan to Syncro-Summon Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend (when Zombie World is on the field), and wipe the field during MP1.  Negate opponent's Summons with Enma's Judgement, Doomking (during a chain) and Ash Blossom.  Use Foolish Burial to put an Endless Decay in the GY as soon as possible, then Mezuki, Monster Reborn, Book of Life, or Jack-O-Bolan to Special Summon.  Banish Necroworld Banshee to put Zombie World on the field, then use Burial From a Different Dimension to put NB back in the GY, then Special Summon it onto the field to protect Zombie World.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Note: This is my first post to ygoprodeck but I have been utilizing this deck (and older variations of it) for almost 2 years and I believe it is now fun and effective enough to share with the world."

This Deck strategy is more or less the same. However, t","<span><strong>*[EDIT: Check ""Ideal Starting Hand"" Section]</strong></span>  An update to my original ""Charming Magicians"" Deck, which seems to have gotten fairly popular. This Deck strategy is more or less the same. However, there are now 50 cards, and I got rid of some of the fluff, removing many monsters that didn't work in tandem with the ""<strong>Possessed</strong>"" Spell/Traps (<span><strong><span>Ichirin</span> <span>[F]</span></strong></span><span>,</span> <strong><span><span>Awakening</span> <span>[</span></span>∞]</strong>, &amp; <span><strong>Teamwork</strong></span>, <span><strong>Unpossessed</strong></span> <strong><span><span>[</span></span>∞]</strong>), and actually replacing them with monsters that have more combo potential with this Deck in general.  <strong><span>Changes:</span></strong>  The Deck's goal is still to try and get out <span><strong><span>⌈<span>Fortune Lady Every<span>⌋</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>, and then <span><strong>⌈<span>Datascape Fox - XianXian<span>⌋</span></span></strong><span><span><span>. I ended up removing <span><strong>⌈<span>Explosive Magician<span>⌋</span></span></strong><span>, because while its effect is useful, unlike <strong><span>⌈</span><span>Arcanite Magician</span><span>⌋</span></strong>, it doesn't give itself Spell Counters upon summoning, making its effect useless if it's the only monster on the field. Plus, <strong><span>⌈</span><span>Arcanite Magician</span><span>⌋ </span></strong>is just better anyway, since you aren't limited to just Spell/Traps. I also removed <strong>⌊<span>Leviar the Sea Dragon</span>⌋</strong> and swapped it for <strong>⌈<span>Time Thief Redoer</span>⌋</strong>. I actually haven't tested this change out yet, and I may even end up switching it up again, but I found myself NEVER using <strong>⌊<span>Leviar the Sea Dragon</span>⌋</strong>, even when it may have worked. I also wanted to put in an Xyz monster that required less monsters to Special Summon, since both of the Spellcaster Xyz monsters require 3 Level 4 monsters, which can be difficult for a single turn. I ended up side-decking <span><strong>DNA Surgery</strong><span> <strong>[∞] </strong>and</span><strong><span> <span><span>Chocolate Magician Girl</span><span>.</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> I also ended up removing <strong><span>Wynn the Wind Medium</span></strong><span><span>/</span></span><strong><span>Channeler</span></strong><span><span>, <span><strong>Magical Exemplar</strong></span>, <span><strong>Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane</strong></span>, and <span><strong>Dark Spirit Art - Greed</strong></span>. <span><strong>Wynn</strong></span> was occasionally useful, but any time I had the choice to Special Summon or add a Charmer to my hand, I would just end up going for the ""<strong>Familiar Possessed</strong>"" monsters. They are objectively more useful in this deck for 2 reasons. For one, they are Level 4, so they are not only easier to summon, but are much more useful for Xyz and Synchro Summoning. Second, there aren't too many WIND monsters in this Deck, so using <strong><span>Wynn</span></strong>'s effect to Summon it isn't readily useful, unless you have multiple <span><strong>Wynn the Wind Charmer</strong></span> monsters in your deck. <span><strong>Magical Exemplar</strong></span> is in a similar boat, because it can be situationally useful, but its ATK/DEF don't mesh with the deck well. I got rid of <span><strong>Spritual Earth Art</strong></span> because <span><strong>Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness</strong></span> has basically the same effect, but it Destroys the monster instead of Tributing it, so it can activate <strong><span>Unpossessed</span></strong>'s <strong>[∞]</strong> effect with little cost. I got rid of <span><strong>Greed</strong></span> because it is SUPER risky to use since most decks run on Spells, whereas Traps are much rarer. Finally, I added <span><strong>Fairy Tail - Luna</strong></span>, <strong><span>Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</span></strong>, <strong><span>Dogmatika Theo, the Iron Punch</span></strong>, <span><strong>Archnemeses Protos</strong></span>, and one more <span><strong>Awakening of the Possessed</strong></span> <strong><span>[</span>∞]</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>  <strong><span>Ideal Starting Hand: </span></strong>(2nd turn)  *[Edit: I misread <span><strong>Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</strong></span>'s effect. Once you use its effect to add Monster to your hand, you cannot Extra Deck-summon. Also, I overlooked <span><span><span><strong>Angraecum Umbrella</strong></span></span></span><span>'s effect, which limits you to Synchro Summoning after you use its effect.</span>] <ul>  	<li><span><strong>Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin <span>[F]</span></strong></span>, (Either of these <strong>Familiar Possessed</strong> monsters: <strong><span>Eria</span></strong><span> or</span> <strong><span>Wynn</span></strong>), <span><strong>Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</strong><span>, <span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness</strong><span>, </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><strong>Angraecum Umbrella</strong></span></span></span></li> </ul> This hand is perfect if you go second.

Depending on the card you drew with <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Awakening of the Possessed</strong><span>'s</span></span> <span><strong>[∞] </strong>effect, at your own discretion, you can try using the monster's effect to resurrect a GY monster <em>(Remember from now on, you can only Summon Synchros from the Extra Deck)</em>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>  	<li>(13B) Then Synchro Summon <span><strong><span>⌈<span>Fortune Lady Every<span>⌋</span> </span></span></strong></span>with your <strong>Lv 4</strong> Spellcaster (presumably <span><strong>Ecclesia</strong></span>) and <span><strong>Angraecum Umbrella</strong></span>.</li> </ol> If all goes well, both routes would start you off with <span><strong><span>⌈<span>Fortune Lady Every<span>⌋ </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>and another powerful monster, as well as card effect or battle protection with your Continuous Spell/Trap. They also both set you up next turn for more combos.</span></span></span></span></span>  For other useful strategies in this deck, check out my other Charmer Deck, because many of those strategies apply here."

I play three Fleur De Les because you can sometimes set him up on your opponents turn and then if you have another or draw into another you have a negate set up. Also, this card helps to bring out dragoon as when its effects activate it does NOT lock you out of your extra deck. You then could easily go into aliester and if you have a light in your hand or opponents gy you can link Aliester into Almirja and then fuse into mechaba anf then link Almirja and Fleur De Les into Predaplant. You would finish the turn with a mechaba and a dragoon possibly. Another great set up is getting winda and Dragoon or Mechaba on the field at the same time. This really makes it tough for your opponent to play if they do not have dark ruler or droplet. Foolish burial is huge for when you need to set up some Shadoll stuff or send aliester to the gy if you draw into invocation without him. I also really like siding in the Invoker of Maddness because his name changes to Aleister in the gy, so you can set your gy for next turn with nadir. Finally, I just wanted to shoud out ice dragon's prison. This card has been unbelievable for me so far. I think it is highly under rated and should be considered more for the called by the grave replacement people are looking for. Still need help with the extra deck so any suggestions would be welcome!"

Use Nadir Servant to set up by tossing Apkallone into the GY to search for any Shaddoll card THEN discard a shaddoll monster to proc their effect. The deck runs less hand traps (8) compared to the usual Invoked Dogmatika deck (12-15) but it can easily set up more aggressive pushes and a more consistent Winda.  Reason I use Veiler over Imperm because I would be able to use Veiler as fusion fodder for more consistent Mechaba/Construct (better this format because CBTG is at 1) but imperm works as well.  I do really like Schism because this build thins the deck out so well and you are able to get out easy Winda/Construct/Apkallone plays on opponent turns and act as a disruptor to remove 1 monster in the field (doesn't target or destroy).  -You can use Apkallone to negate monster effects/Winda as floodgate/Construct plays to dump cards like Ariel and Dragon which is really useful against banishing Eldlich from the GY and destroying Field Spells (Boot, Numeron Network, Ravine, etc) in this meta.  Alternative Builds:  -You can remove the Resh/Cross-Sheep for 1 more hand trap and replace Cross-sheep for a 5k ATK fusion monster (Five-Headed Dragon or Dragon Master Knight) for a higher ceiling atk removal for Dogmatika Punishment or Augoeides 8k ATK OTK. However, going against towers/Dragoon requires link 4s like Borrelsword or Accesscode to get over ATK threshold which resh/cross-sheep can help pump out.  -You can actually add more hand-traps and the deck can still run smoothly at 42-43.  -Add Predaplant in Extra but I did not really use the card often so I opted with a Cross-Sheep instead as an extender. If you still want cross-sheep with Predaplant, you can take out 1 Mechaba/Winda/Construct.  -Foolish burial is a great searcher (dump Hedgehog/Ariel) or a way to reduce opponent's resources in GY and S/T zone (Ariel/Dragon).  Overall, I am very happy with this build but if there is something I can improve, please let me know in the comments or your thoughts :)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

With Pantheism of the Monarch's moving from Limited to Unlimited in the recent Limited &amp; Forbidden List, it's time to revisit an old classic. This build of Monarch's focuses on the Field Spell ""Domain of the True Monarchs"" which restricts your opponent from Summoning Extra Deck monsters while boosting the ATK/DEF of your Tribute Summoned monsters as well as reducing the Levels of your higher-level Monarchs, allowing for you to Tribute Summon them using only one Monster.  </span>The main board you want to make if going first is Vanity's Fiend, Domain, and The Monarch's Erupt set. This stops your opponent from Special Summoning while protecting Vanity's from monster effects due to Erupt as well from battle due to Domain (Vanity's Fiend will gain 800 ATK from Domain, giving it 3200 ATK during combat only.) Erebus and Ehther are both at 3 in this deck due to their strong on-field effects and utility. Some small tech cards include Thestalos the Mega Monarch to give us information about the opponent's hand as well as disrupting their plays, Called by the Grave to prevent Edea from being Ashed, Foolish Burial to dump Erebus, Upstart Goblin for extra consistency, and one Kuraz for consistency as well as getting rid of The Prime Monarch.  Any suggestions for improvement are welcome in the comments. :)"

I've tried a lot of hybrid strategies with Fossils and I think this is the strongest one so far. The Invoked engine has decent synergy with the Fossil engine, as well as covering a good amount of Fossils' weaknesses.  Fossils are at their worst going 1st, whereas Invoked has gives you access to reasonable lines going 1st while not asking for too much deck space or many specific cards in hand. This is the biggest draw to this particular hybrid. I've also enjoyed using Fossils with other fusion archetypes because Weathering Soldier has good synergy with effects that send him to the GY, including fusion spells.  If given the choice we will go 2nd.  <strong>Main deck</strong>:  Nibiru - A big rock monster for Fossil Fusion, as well as a light to get access to Mechaba. He also has the benefit of setting up our opponent's GY for our Fossil Fusion and Invocation.  Kumongous - Kaiju's as a great way to both take care of annoying cards on our opponent's board as well as set up their GY for a Skullgios fusion. Kumongous gets the nod over Gameciel due to his Earth type. Extra deck space is limited in this deck and there is not room for the Water Invoked fusion. We're good at dumping attack onto the board, so the extra 200 attack from Kumongous won't be a problem.  Weathering Soldier - Our tutor for the Fossil archetype. Works when being fused with Invocation from the hand, as well as with Foolish Burial, Miracle Rupture, and Mathematician. He also beats down quite wel. Staple for all Fossil strats.  Aleister the Invoker - We're playing Invoked, so obviously we play him. Note he can choose any fusion monster, not just Invoked ones. This can lead to huge damage with Skullking, or even with a Skullgios if you played it off of Time Stream.  Mathematician - Aleister is obviously our #1 normal summon most of the time, but we won't always have him. Mathematician bulks up our count to help ensure we have a strong enabler to normal summon. Dumping Weathering Soldier or Keystone can be great, and he's also a 1500 attack monster to res off of Cross-Sheep.  Ash Blossom - Best hand trap in the game IMO. We are a going 2nd deck, so we want to be sure to load up on hand traps to disrupt our opponent from setting up an unbreakable board. She also gives access to Purgatrio.  Nemeses Keystone - An aptly named card, this is a key component in a lot of the plays our deck can make. Gives good value when fused off of Fossil Fusion or Invocation from the GY, helping to keep our hand stocked for Mechaba and Skull King. Not only that, but he's an easy access special summon to set up easy link summons (I'm looking at your, Cross-Sheep) and can recycle our fusions back into our extra deck.  Magical Meltdown - Tutors Aleister.  Dark Hole - I was running Lightning Storm, but the fact that we have Magical Meltdown in play a lot of the time made it a pretty big nonbo for the deck. We only get to play 1 Raigeki, so Dark Hole helps us get tasty fusion targets in our opponent's yard to set up our big plays.  Extra-Foolish Burial - The ultimate swiss army knife of the deck. It gets you missing combo pieces for fusion, or it can bin any of your fossils that work out of the GY. It has so many situations it's useful in that it's hard to list them all.  Fossil Fusion - Makes our Fossils.  Harpie's Feather Duster - This was another card that was Lightning Storm, but again that card was too much of a problem with Magical Meltdown. I wanted a main-deck out to Mystic Mine, and this is the best S/T removal in the game.  Invocation - Just 1 copy since Aleister can find it easily, and we have access to effectively 7 copies of him in the deck between him, Meltdown, and Terraforming.  Miracle Rupture - Sets up our GY as well as acts as a tutor when paired with Weathering Soldier. Don't leave home without 3.  Raigeki - The freshmaker. Easy, low-risk board removal. Raigeki is as Raigeki does.  Terraforming - Effectively copy #4 of Magical Meltdown, as we don't run any other field spells. Naturally if you wanted to side any field spells, this would act as a nice redundancy piece for them as well.  Time Stream - 3 may seem like a lot, but you really want to start with 1 in hand for the lines where you want it. If you can't easily make a big Fossil monster, you can make a Skull Bone, Time Stream it, remove if from GY to tutor another Time Stream, and then Time Stream the Skull Knight into either Skull King or Skullgios.  Impertinence - 2nd best hand trap in the game, and gives us some traps on the off chance we want them for Mechaba.  <strong>Extra deck</strong>:  Mechaba - Best Invoked monster. Easy access to it by normal summoning Aleister and linking him into Almiraj and then Secure Gardna.  Skullgios - Often the strongest Fossil Fusion. Not much to say here. Skullgios ends games.  Magellanica - We have a lot of Earth monsters, so this is an easy include. Nice and big to help us OTK. Conveniently also a Rock monster for Fossil Fusion.  Skull King - This is the fossil we most often will fuse in to, so we play 2. He's easier to access than Skullgios, and can often be better. He's also our strongest fossil monster to lead off with if we are forced to go first.  Augoeides - We make a lot of fusions, so this is a no brainer. Very often the best way to kill if our initial wave of fusions get answered.  Purgatrio - Ash Blossom and Almiraj give us access to this. Great on a lot of boards.  Skull Knight - Often just the in-between for Skull King or Skullgios. His remove from GY effect can also be relevant.  Skullgar - Less useful than his cousin Skull Bone, but sometimes exactly what you need. Notably the highest attack Cross-Sheep target in the deck.  Skull Bone - Sets up an easy Skull King or Skullgios with the aforementioned line using Time Stream.  Knightmare Phoenix - Having an MST in the extra deck is too useful. I never leave home without 1.  Secure Gardna - Almost strictly a Mechaba enabler, but he can sometimes clutch out a game by turning a simple Keystone -&gt; Linkuriboh into 1000 attack.  Cross-Sheep - Always be on the look out for lines involving this little guy! He easily can turn what would be a turn shy 8000 damage into an OTK. Too many ways to enable him in the deck to list, so just be looking for it.  Linkuriboh - We have easy to play 1 star monsters, so we play Linkuriboh. Sometimes it's also nice to be able to force a Keystone into the GY to set up a fossil fusion.  Almiraj - Only needed for the Secure Gardna -&gt; Mechaba line, which is extremely important."

The main goal is to get ""GP Dreary Doll"" into the GY asp. Until Maxx ""C"" comes back, going second sucks in this game and pure GP sucks to, so if this deck is to have a chance of being viable, it has to have as many board breaking cards as possible. The main combo is kaiju your opponent’s problem monsters, then SS “GP of Strings” or ""Dingirsu"" somehow, then upgrade it into #84, then clear the board with #84’s effect, then upgrade #84 into #77 for 4000 burst damage, then finish by upgrading #77 into ""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"" during MP2, which really throws a monkey wrench into your opponent's next turn. If you happen to have “Condolence Puppet"" in your GY, you can banish it to protect Divine Arsenal from being destroyed card effects. If you’re lucky you can bust out two #77s with “Inferno Reckless Summon” for game. I recently discovered the ""Zoo King Alpha"" card and tried it out. Initially, it did well but I had to boot the ""GP Gear Changers"" to make room for them. I've had alot of success with it especially since GP have low ATK and the kaijus I give my opponent have high ATK. The bane of this deck is back row and negates, so save your Feather Duster and Lightning Storms until you're sure you can compromise your opponent with Divine Arsenal for the rest of the game. I also tried #97 and It works pretty well to, but only if your opponent literally has nothing to stop that 9000 attack, which they usually do."

You can simply use <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> to gain LP and pop with <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Sweet%20Marjoram""><strong>Aromaseraphy Sweet</strong> <strong>Marjoram</strong></a>. <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Crystron%20Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></strong> can be used to accel synchro summon with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Sweet%20Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a></strong> during your opponent's turn: <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Formula%20Synchron"">Formula Synchron</a></strong> into <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Borreload%20Savage%20Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a></strong> for negate or <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Shooting%20Riser%20Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a></strong> into either <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Satellite%20Warrior"">Satellite Warrior</a></strong> for a double pop or <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Crystron%20Phoenix"">Crystron Phoenix</a></strong> to deal with a heavy backrow. Also, it is so easy to OTK with this deck thanks to the swarming ability of plant monsters and all the good synchro beatsticks got enough atk for an easy <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Borrelsword%20Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a></strong> OTK.</span>  <span>The main way to open your combo is to bring out 2 plants to make <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong> and another monster for the tribute of it's effect. There're multiple ways &amp; cards combinations in this deck that can accomplish this:</span> <ul>  	<li><span><strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Ophrys%20Scorpio"">Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</a></strong> + 1 monster: <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Ophrys%20Scorpio"">Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</a></strong> send 1 monster from the hand to the GY → ss <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Darlingtonia%20Cobra"">Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</a></strong> → add <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Instant%20Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a></strong> → ss <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Thousand-Eyes%20Restrict"">Thousand-eyes Restrict</a></strong>.

However, If you've already opened with one, this is a good way to start off your combos for that extra plus.</span></li> </ul> <span>There're still many ways to open the combo depending on your opening hand that I can't list all of them here but you'll eventually find the way playing the deck. Now to the main combo:</span>  <span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine""><strong>Aromaseraphy Jasmine</strong></a> tribute 1 monster to ss <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Lonefire%20Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a></strong> → <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Lonefire%20Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a></strong> tribute <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong> to ss <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Spore"">Spore</a></strong> → <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Spore"">Spore</a></strong> link into <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></strong> → ss <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Spore"">Spore</a></strong> using it's effect → make <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Crystron%20Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></strong> with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Spore"">Spore</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></strong> → <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Crystron%20Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></strong> ss <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Rose%20Girl"">Rose Girl</a></strong> → make <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Sweet%20Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a></strong> with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Rose%20Girl"">Rose Girl</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Lonefire%20Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a></strong> → search <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> → add back <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Rose%20Girl"">Rose Girl</a></strong> to the hand with it's effect.</span> <h2><span><strong><span>Decklist &amp; Ratios:</span></strong></span></h2> <ul>  	<li><span>The main deck is 48 cards because there are lots of bricks for the combos so I increased both the amount of starters and staples to reduce the chance of drawing into multiple bricks.</span></li>  	<li><span>This deck runs quite a lot of staples like handtraps compare to it's casual version because it usually takes you only 2-3 cards to get the combo going while there're not that many extenders available for plant archetypes and the only good ones I can think of are <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=One%20for%20One"">One for One</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Monster%20Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong>.</span></li>  	<li><span>The <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Called%20by%20the%20Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></strong> hit definitely hurted the deck since it's a rogue combo deck, thankfully <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=PSY-Framegear%20Gamma"">Psy-framegear Gamma</a></strong> still gives the deck some help protecting <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Lonefire%20Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a></strong>, <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Super%20Solar%20Nutrient"">Super Solar Nutrient</a></strong>, <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Evil%20Thorn"">Evil Thorn</a></strong> &amp;<strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=One%20for%20One""> One for One</a></strong> from getting handtrap. However, I personally don't like running <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Triple%20Tactics%20Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a></strong> as a replacement for <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Called%20by%20the%20Grave""><strong>Called by the Grave</strong></a> because, as I mentioned, the deck doesn't have that many good extenders to draw into after getting handtrap.</span></li>  	<li><span>2 copies of <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Darlingtonia%20Cobra"">Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</a></strong> instead of 1 because the Predaplant combo is quite important due to how much consistency it gives the deck. You'll still have about 10% chance of drawing into it if playing only at 1 copy in a 48 cards deck, but approximately 1% chance of drawing all copies of it if playing at 2 (Yes, I unironically did the math on <strong><a>yugioh.party</a></strong>).</span></li>  	<li><span>There are multiple lv3 to send with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Shooting%20Riser%20Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a></strong> for making <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Satellite%20Warrior"">Satellite Warrior</a></strong>, but the only lv4 for making <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Crystron%20Phoenix"">Crystron Phoenix</a></strong> I play is <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=World%20Carrotweight%20Champion"">World Carrotweight Champion</a></strong>. It's a plant with good stats so in case of drawing it, you can try to send it to the GY and shuffle it back with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> if needed for the effect of <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Shooting%20Riser%20Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a></strong>. It also has a useful effect for spamming the field that works really well with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Rose%20Girl"">Rose Girl</a></strong> since you can send <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Rose%20Girl"">Rose Girl</a></strong> to ss it then add <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Rose%20Girl"">Rose Girl</a></strong> back every turn. Otherwise there're not many lv4 I want to run in this deck.</span></li>  	<li><span>Casual Aromage builds usually run more LP gainers but in this build I only run 5 since my strategy doesn't rely that much on them thanks to the Predaplant engine and I don't like drawing too many of them. Aromages don't have a good way to protect their backrows so relying too much on them would be a big weakness in this format which spell/trap removals are very commonly seen. Also, I only run the ones that let me decide when to gain LP so my Aromages ain't triggered accidentally.</span></li>  	<li><span>3x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aroma%20Gardening"">Aroma Gardening</a></strong> because it's the best one for my strategy I believe. It can be used in either player's turn, works really well with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong>'s revival effect and has an extra defensive effect. Although it's only once per turn so drawing too many copies might be a bad thing but I think it's worth to increase the chance of having it.</span></li>  	<li><span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aroma%20Garden""><strong>Aroma Garden</strong></a> is more important in casual builds since the atk/def boost definitely helps a lot to prevent <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong> from being destroyed... but not that much in this build which doesn't end with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong> so I only run 1.</span></li>  	<li><span>2x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> so if the first one get blowed away (which happens a lot when I try playing against metas), I can try to make a 2nd <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Sweet%20Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a></strong> to search the other one since <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> helps out a lot during grind games. You can also run the other Aroma traps (<strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Humid%20Winds"">Humid Winds</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dried%20Winds"">Dried Winds</a></strong>), I just don't like playing too many backrows.</span></li>  	<li><span>2 spell/trap removals because this deck still struggles against backrows when going 2nd, especially floodgates.</span></li>  	<li><span>2 targets for <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Darlingtonia%20Cobra"">Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</a></strong> to search so it's easier to go +1 and <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Super%20Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong> is a very good one in this format.</span></li>  	<li><span>It's really up to you to choose <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Instant%20Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a></strong>'s target, I personally like <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Thousand-Eyes%20Restrict"">Thousand-eyes Restrict</a></strong> as a good way to deal with monsters that cannot be destroyed and it helps opening for an OTK too. You can also use <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Mudragon%20of%20the%20Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a></strong> as a 2nd <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Super%20Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong>'s target or <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Sea%20Monster%20of%20Theseus"">Sea Monster of Theseus</a></strong> as a good lv5 tuner,...</span></li>  	<li><span>You must have noticed that <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Verte%20Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a></strong> but without the <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Red-Eyes%20Dark%20Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong> engine, the deck can definitely run it well like most other rogue decks if you'd like to. It's just me, I've already run 48 cards to avoid bricks and I don't like any extra bricks. I run <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Super%20Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong> though and it works really well with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Verte%20Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a></strong> too thanks to it's effect. It's also a good way to link non-plant monsters into a plant one to make <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong> or to be sent to the GY with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> as a way to play around <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Mystic%20Mine"">Mystic Mine</a></strong>.</span></li> </ul> <h2><span><strong>Side Deck &amp; Tech Options:</strong></span></h2> <span>Giving the opponent LP advantage would be a big risk in this deck as it could potentially prevent <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromage%20Jasmine"">Aromage Jasmine</a></strong>, <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromage%20Laurel"">Aromage Laurel</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Angelica"">Aromaseraphy Angelica</a></strong>'s effects which are very important. That's why I'll be avoiding cards like <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Cosmic%20Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a></strong>, <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Red%20Reboot"">Red Reboot</a></strong>, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Solemn%20Judgment""><strong>Solemn Judgment</strong></a>,... despite how good they are. Here are what I'm currently using:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>1x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dinowrestler%20Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a></strong>: good for going 2nd, can definitely help for a <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Borrelsword%20Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a></strong> OTK.</span></li>  	<li><span>3x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Nibiru%2C%20the%20Primal%20Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a></strong>: good against most combo decks.

It can also be tributed for <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong>'s effect if necessary.</span></li>  	<li><span>3x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Artifact%20Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a></strong>: good against a lot of current top tiers like Virtual World, Dino, Invoked, Eldlich,... and may stop stuffs like <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Evenly%20Matched"">Evenly Matched</a></strong><strong>.</strong></span></li>  	<li><span>3x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Forbidden%20Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a></strong>: good against multiple negates and monsters that cant be targeted like <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Red-Eyes%20Dark%20Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong> or <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Mekk-Knight%20Crusadia%20Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></strong>,... which the deck definitely struggles to deal with. Running <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dark%20Ruler%20No%20More"">Dark Ruler No More</a></strong> may not be a good idea in this deck as you won't be able to use <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Evil%20Thorn"">Evil Thorn</a></strong>'s effect afterward.</span></li>  	<li><span>2x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Lightning%20Storm"">Lightning Storm</a></strong>: good against backrows.</span></li>  	<li><span>3x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Evenly%20Matched"">Evenly Matched</a></strong>: also good against backrows, the main deck is 48 cards so it's harder to get access to backrow removals than usual.

Or deal huge da,"Hello everyone, this my first deck profile I'm submitting so please pardon me if I do something wrong. The point of this Numeron deck is like most, turbo out Utopic Zexal or Megaclops with ease, but the Time Thieves provide some useful support. Time Thief Redoer can banish itself from the field allowing Numeron Calling to activate, and thanks to Time Thief Winder we can easily search Retrograde, which is an counter trap that can negate an S/T and attach it to a Time Thief xyz. This is particularly useful against the common Infinite Impermanance, which would render our S0 useless. The ideal first turn is to summon Redoer with Regulator bringing out Winder and Bezel Ship, search Retrograde with Winder, banish Redoer by its own effect, and then activating Calling either by Network or in your hand to summon 3 Gates and make S0. When Redoer returns in the end phase your Retrograde will be live. On following turns you can summon Perpetua and attach Time Thief cards from the deck to S0 as xyz materials, keeping its attack up and allowing it to continue using its effect. If you want to push you for damage you can simply summon the 4 gates and attack with them, which can net easy otks in simplified gamestates. Megaclops is a backup ""Towers"" that can also be bought out with the Gates and can recur xyzs from the gy but not turn its summoned.  &nbsp;  I won't pretend this a meta contender or the best use of the Numeron Engine, but I think it has some interesting synergy. I've been playing a lot of Time Thief variants so expect more of that in the future, especially with some of the fantastic cards in Phantom Rage and Genesis Impactors. Thank you for reading my ramblings."

Since the only Tuner in the Deck was <strong>Angraecum Umbrella</strong>, and most of the other monsters in the deck were either Level 3 or 4, unless you had any of the <strong>Awakening Possessed</strong> monsters out, you could only summon Level 6, 7, or 9 monsters. Not that it was particularly necessary to do so in the first place... With that being said, <span><strong>Zoroa </strong><span>b</span></span>eing a Level 4 Tuner means he's a perfect tool for summoning almost anything in your Extra Deck, no matter what other monster is out:</span> <ul>  	<li>If he's out with a Lv 3 <strong>Charmer</strong>, you can bring out <strong><span>⌈</span><span>Fortune Lady Every<span>⌋</span></span></strong> or <strong><span>⌈</span></strong><span><strong>Arcanite Magician<span>⌋</span></strong></span> easily.</li>  	<li>If he's out with a Lv 4, you can bring out <span><span><span><strong><span>⌈</span><span>Time Thief Redoer</span><span>⌋</span></strong><span>, <strong>⌈<span>Magistus Goddess Ninaruru</span>⌋</strong><strong>, </strong>or <strong><span>⌈</span><span>Magistus Dragon Vafram</span><span>⌋</span></strong><span><span>, easily.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>  	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If he's out with a Lv 5 <strong>Awakening Possessed</strong> monster, you can bring out <strong><span>⌈</span><span><span>Datascape Fox - Xianxian</span><span>⌋</span></span></strong><span><span><span> easily.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>  	<li>And of course he can easily bring out at least 1 of your <strong>Link Charmers</strong> with ANY monster out, since he is a FIRE monster.</li> </ul> <span><span><strong>Zoroa</strong><span>'s effect is super versatile as well. First of all, it's a Spellcaster with 1500 DEF, which is perfect for this Deck and is why I put him in here in the first place. Since its effect is a ""1 per turn"" effect, you can keep using it until you run out of Extra Deck cards to use on it.  Also, with the new cards <em>in</em> the Extra Deck, you can use <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span>'s effect for a variety of situations. If you use his effect on <span><strong><span>⌈</span><span>Magistus Maiden Artemis</span><span>⌋</span></strong></span>, you can bring out another <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span>, so that if something happens to your <strong><span>Zoroa</span> </strong>on the field, you can just Summon another one next turn. Or if you have <span><strong>Grand Spirit Art - Ichirin</strong></span> <span><strong>[F]</strong></span> on the field, you can then swap your other <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span> for your <span><strong>Inari Fire</strong></span>, which can set you up for an easy Link, Xyz, or Synchro Summon. If you're in a pinch where you opponent has a powerful monster out, as long as it can be destroyed by card effects, you can use <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span>'s effect on <span><strong>⌈<span>Magistus Dragon Vafram</span>⌋</strong><span>. Then, not only are you safe from most Spell/Trap effects, but you can destroy <em>almost</em> any opponent's monster, <em>nearly</em> risk free. <strong>⌈<span>Magistus Goddess Ninaruru</span></strong>'s<strong>⌋</strong> effect isn't nearly as versatile with <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span>'s effect as the other two, but if you're close to end-game and your opponent's field is weak, you can use it to clear the field, then let your powerful monster(s) attack.</span></span></span></span></span>  <strong>Now let's talk about the new Extra Deck monsters' stand-alone effects:</strong> <ul>  	<li><span><span><span><span><strong>⌈<span>Magistus Dragon Vafram</span>⌋</strong><span> has a very self-explanatory stand-alone effect. It makes your opponent hesitant to attack it, for fear of a full, one-sided, field-nuke. If you already have <strong><span>Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness</span></strong> in your GY, you can troll your opponent's fear by just using <strong><span>Nefarious</span></strong>'s GY effect. Since it <em>destroys</em> the monster you target, <span><strong>⌈</strong></span><span><strong>Vafram</strong></span>'s<span><strong>⌋</strong><span> will activate, anyway. That way you'll still have a versatile monster on the field, <em>and</em> you still get your field-nuke. Even better, if you already had <span><strong>Unpossessed</strong></span> <strong>[</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><strong>∞</strong><strong>]</strong><span> out, since </span><span><strong>⌈</strong></span><span><strong>Vafram</strong></span><span><strong>⌋</strong></span><span> was <em>destroyed</em>, you could use said Trap to bring out </span><span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span><span>. Then on your next turn, just use </span><span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span><span>'s effect to equip it with </span><strong>⌈<span>Magistus Goddess Ninaruru</span></strong><strong>⌋</strong><span>. Now, along with </span><strong><span>⌈</span><span>Ninaruru</span></strong><span>'s</span><strong>⌋</strong><span> effect, you get 3 Direct 1500-point Attacks.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>⌈</span><span>Magistus Goddess Ninaruru</span></strong><span><strong>⌋</strong> is slightly less useful. If you're out of <strong>Familiar-Possessed</strong> monsters when <span><strong>Awakening of the Possessed </strong></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>[</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><strong>∞</strong><strong>]</strong> is still on the field<span><span><span><span>, you can use </span></span></span></span><strong>⌈<span>Ninaruru</span></strong><span>'s</span><strong>⌋</strong><span> effect to bring one of them back. Then Summon it to get your Draw. If you already have <span><span><strong>Grand Spirit Art - Ichirin</strong></span> <span><strong>[F]</strong></span></span> on the field, you could use her effect to bring out one of your <strong>Charmers</strong> or other elemental Spellcasters, and swap <em>it</em> out with one of the <span><span><span><strong>Familiar</strong> monsters (</span><strong><span>Jigabyte</span></strong><span>,</span> <span><strong>Inari Fire</strong></span><span>,</span> <strong><span>Ranryu</span></strong><span>,</span> <strong><span>Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness</span></strong><span><span>)</span></span><span>. You could also use her effect on one of the <strong>Dogmatika</strong> monsters. Then just Special Summon it with its effect. Heck, even use it on <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span>, then you can just Summon him and use <em>his</em> effect to equip either <strong>⌈<span>Ninaruru</span></strong><strong>⌋</strong> or him with </span></span></span></span><span><strong>⌈</strong></span><span><strong>Vafram</strong></span><span><strong>⌋</strong></span><span><span><span><span>. Then you can keep resurrecting Spellcasters without worrying about Spell/Trap effects, </span><em>and</em><span> you can bulwark your opponent's monsters with some slightly higher ATK.</span></span></span></span></li>  	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>⌈</span><span>Magistus Maiden Artemis</span><span>⌋<span> </span></span></strong><span>is probably the least immediately useful monster when she is Summoned. In fact, it's likely best to avoid summoning her in most cases, and just use <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span>'s effect to equip her directly instead. There are a couple situations where her stand-alone effect would be useful. If your opponent already has an Extra Deck monster out, and you conveniently have both of your <strong>Dogmatika</strong> monsters and another Spellcaster in your hand, you could Summon all 3 (using <strong>Dogmatika</strong>s' effects to Special Summon them). Next, <em>first </em>Link Summon <strong><span>⌈</span><span>Artemis</span><span>⌋ </span></strong>with the non-<strong>Dogmatika</strong> Spellcaster monster, <em>then</em> Xyz Summon <strong>⌈<span>Ninaruru</span></strong><strong>⌋</strong> with the <strong>Dogmatika</strong> monsters. Then <strong><span>⌈</span></strong><span><strong>Artemis</strong><span>'s</span></span><strong><span>⌋</span></strong><span> </span><span>effect will activate and you can equip her to <strong>⌈<span>Ninaruru</span></strong><strong>⌋</strong>, use her effect to bring out <span><strong>Zoroa</strong><span>, and use <strong>⌈<span>Ninaruru</span></strong>'s<strong>⌋</strong> stand-alone effect to bring back one of the <strong>Dogmatika</strong>s. Then just Special Summon that monster from your hand using its effect again. Even better, if you already had one of the <strong>Familiar</strong> monsters in your hand as well, you could then use <em>their</em> effects to Special Summon any of them, allowing you to Xyz Summon <strong>⌈<span>Time Thief Redoer</span>⌋</strong> as a final move before a double Xyz attack.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>  	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>⌈</span><span>Puzzlomino, the Drop-n-Deleter</span><span>⌋ </span></span></span></strong><span>is a little difficult to figure out, at the moment. If you know you'll be summoning a lot of monsters in one turn, I think this card could be useful. Especially if you plan on Synchro or Xyz Summoning or if your opponent has a powerful non-Xyz monster. It lets you change any Special Summoned monster's level to any number from 1 - 8. Then you can also destroy that monster and an opponent's monster with the same Level. So depending on how you want to use it, you can either Extra Summon a monster or destroy an opponent's monster. If you have <span><strong>Teamwork of the Possessed</strong></span> set at least 1 turn before you use <strong><span>⌈<span>Puzzlomino</span></span></strong>'s<strong><span>⌋</span></strong> effect, you could destroy up to 2 cards in succession. Use said Trap to summon a Charmer with a different Attribute than <strong><span>⌈<span>Puzzlomino</span></span></strong><strong><span>⌋</span></strong>, destroy a card, and then change that monster's Level to your opponent's monster Level, and use <strong><span>⌈<span>Puzzlomino</span></span></strong>'s<strong><span>⌋</span></strong> other effect to destroy their monster. It works in <em>and</em> out of the Extra Zone, so you don't always have to sacrifice a Link monster to use the effect.</span></span></span></span></li> </ul> That's it for this deck. From here on, until there are any more support cards added, this will be my last Charmer Deck."

The cutest deck ever made meets one of the ugliest archetypes ever printed. Since Melffy and Ojama monsters are both Level 2, Beast-Type, and share the same affinity for swarming the field it should come as no surprise that the two are perfect for each other. The main goal with this deck is to resolve Ojama Red or Rescue Cat as early as possible to begin building your board of Rank 2 Beast Xyz monsters or Link monsters, from there you can have a board with Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax, Melffy Mommy with multiple materials, etc. Valerifawn can help to set up Ojama Red's effect for next turn by discarding Ojamgic for its cost, this will get you a Rank 2 Xyz (preferably Ronin Raccoon as it can not only survive for a long time will it has a Raccoon Token out, but that token can also later be used for more Link plays on your turn.)  As an additional option, instead of returning your Melffy monsters to the hand on your opponents turn, I have also included Wonder Xyz which will allow you to Xyz Summon on your opponents turn as well as being able to bait your opponent into using removal for it due to the threat of Playhouse (which is even more potent in this deck since Melffy Mommy will likely have +3 or 4 materials on her most any given time.)  As always, suggestions are welcome. :)"

I went into this project with little expectations, but lo and behold: the deck functins in the Meta! It doesn't win a whole ton, but it's annoying and can work around blockades with surprising effeciency. It also took me two weeks to tweek and perfect (I'm a perfectionist, OK?), but as a whole I am completely satisfied with how it turned out.  The basic idea is to be flexable with it. What you really want to get out is Time Pendulumgraph with Timestar Magician, so that you can get rid of two cards your opponent controls (notice: with Time Pendulumgraph's wording, you can destroy something and then SEND A CARD TO THE GY WITHOUT TARGETTING IT. An effective way to get rid of Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon or, I dunno, Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon). This is an ideal, as it also allows you to summon Zarc real easy, so obviously it can be negated  by any Ash Blossom or Ghost Ogre even. Heck, Haunted Mansion can negate Timestar's protective effect.  But any way you look at it, Timestar is your ideal. Get him, and your Pendulum scale and Pendulum monsters are saved. You can also use his effect to add Chronograph Sorcerer, who is nessecary to summon Zarc. Can you tell I really didn't understand much of the support Magicians have if you use it right?  Speaking of a Pendulum scale, PENDULUM SUMMONING IS UNDERRATED. It really can save your butt. Not to mention that Called By the Grave doesn't really against this deck because the monsters don't go to the Graveyard, but that doesn't really matter because it's limitted now anyways...  but hey, it's kinda nice you can summon some of your most powerful monsters back from the dead every turn. Also about Pendulum summoning: you usually want Oafdragon and Black Fang in you Pendulum Zones. Oafdragon's recycling effect is invaluble, especially when you need another Harmonizing Magician to power your combos. Black Fang was chosen because... he's got a good effect when he's destroyed? Has multiples? Yeah, I really don't know. Harmonizing Magician or Double Iris will suffice.  Now, TO THE EXTRA DECK! Oh, gosh, I spent AGES on this. Zarc is an obvious Why not? card. Borreload Savage is there 'cause EPIC NEGATION. Also, he's probably the strongsst monster in the deck... yeah. Need him. Enlightenment Palladen is nice for recycling those spells you need (ie. Pendulum Call and Duelist Alliance). Clear Wing's an obvious choice with Nobledragon OR Metal Marcher (your pick), and Meteorburst Dragon's second effect is so darn useful today. Metal Marcher can be summoned by Halqifibrax, and can summon those Level 7s. Norito is a given since Oafdragon and Chronograph exist. Timestar I've already described. Abyss Dweller's there because... Abyss Dweller (also Graveyard effects need to be negated at some point). Avarmax is there as protection and as the second-strongest (if not strongest) card in the deck. He also is significantly easier to summon with Pendulum monsters :/ . Saryuja is just nice, since you can summon 3 dead monsters with 300 extra ATK. Metaltron is nice with this deck, as it recycles AND gets rid of your opponent's key cards on the field for a turn for relatively cheap (considering Pendulum monsters can be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck). Triple Burst is and easy-out spell negater that can do some damage and also can produce good fodder for Savage when you return Day-Breaker to your field using Triple's third effect. Day-Breaker's there for ease of access and destructive potential, also allowing 2 rebirths from the Extra Deck, giving him power. Halqifibrax is there because all decks with synchro additions are considered worthless without him (also he's there for Metal Marcher to be summoned, in turn letting Meteorburst or Clear Wing to be summoned with ease).  Now the main deck. This makes more sense when you have the Extra Deck laid out for you, so here it goes: Kaijus, Ash Blossom, Triple Tactic, Luna, and Effect Veiler are all self-explanatory (Effect Veiler instead of Impernance because this is a Spellcaster deck! Also, when paired with Oafdragon or Chronograph, it can make those level 7s). Oafdragon and Chronograph's uses have been listed before (recycling and Summon fuel respectively). Black Fang is a great recycler for Timestar when it's destroyed, also usful for any Extra Deck fodder you want (and I do mean ANY). White Wing is there for the summoning of Zarc and link fodder, but no other reasons. Doble Iris searches Time and Star Pendulumgraphs and has an epic pendulum effect (hence the reason she was banned: use pendulum effect, search Pendulumgraph card). Also nessecary for Zarc (no Odd-eyes here!). Harmonizing Magician is a BEAST, openning up all of your key plays (Timestar especially, though. It gets around the ""banished when leaves the field"" part) and being generally awesome. Can also be recycled by Oafdragon's pendulum effect, so she's not useless in the Extra Deck. Nobledragon, because now you can't draw out of cards (also gets pretty epic synchros out)! She's pretty uefull for when Halqifibrax is summoned too. Left and Right Hands are in for negation, though they are decent discard fodder for Pendulum Call. Star and Time Pendulumgraphs are just plain amazing (especially together) and are relatively easy to search. Duelist Alliance searches Pendulum Call, the Pendulumgraphs AND Double Iris (she counts as a ""Pendulum Dragon"" card). It's a nessecity, because Pendulum Call is amazing, allowing you to search a Pendulim scale from your DECK, all for 1 discard. Not to mention the cards are protected until the end of the turn. It's pretty sweet.  Many of the Side Deck cards are self-explainatory. The only one that isn't (Timegazer) is there because of Chronograph Sorcerer's pendulum effect, should you ever need it.  You can mess with this deck idea all you want. In fact, you may want some Haunted Mansion's in your side deck, in case your facing a deck that uses the GY like an extra two arms. To make it cheaper (but still effective), you can swap Triple Tactic for pot cards (I'd go with Avarice od Aquisitiveness. Riches locks you out of your Extra Deck for the turn). You can also replace Savage with any number of level 8 Synchros (there's dozens of them). I've found that Norito doesn't really come out that often (and honestly his effect is already repeated b so many others in the deck), so you could switch him out if you want. I didn't, 'cause it's freak'n Norito, but what works for you works for me. I won't have to deal with it.  I'm looking at probably making a Fusion rendition of this deck in the future, along with an Insect deck, just because (wish me luck on that one!). I've made several other decks, but none are really noteworthy, so if you want to see them, look them up (I have a Tenyi deck and Super Quant deck, along with another, older Super Quant deck and a really old Magician and Odd-eyes deck that sucks).

Sounds good to me.,"So, this version of the Rokket list came out of my desire to incorporate Smoke Grenade of the Thief into the combos, to hand loop people for 1 targeted card. However, I didn't like that the combo route I'd seen required an additional extender. Instead, by incorporating Draco Masters of the Tenyi, we can burn the Herald (OR and extender to save it) and thus also get the combo even if we whiff on an extender, which to me feels a lot more reliable. It ends on Buster Lock + Savage + Dragoon, and with an extender also ends on Herald of the Arc Light (plus 1 hand loop, by summoning Vylon Cube, and synchro summoning Herald).  I think Dragoon is the best boss monster in Rokkets right now. It lets a deck that already plays through interruptions play through yet another interruption, and it helps break boards and contribute to absolutely insane ending boards. However, the dark Warrior package eats up too much space - it'd be fine to incorporate just the Codebreakers, but the Phantom Knights cards are really disruptive to the functioning of the deck (even if 10 negate boards are fun), and I don't think there are many worthwhile targets for the codebreaker package in the hand loop build. I'll definitely be trying using codebreakers to make Unchained Abomination in the future.  Chaos Dragon Levianeer helps break boards, but also contributes to the hand disruption, since it can be searched with Brotaur. The deck doesn't loop as many cards out of hands as Infernoble will, but even a single targeted snipe is great for providing the information you'll need to lock down games.  Go through the combo in the order it is played out in the Extra Deck and you should figure it out. You have to be mindful of zones for Triple Arrow with Tenyi link 3 and the Guardragons under them, pretty standard for decks running the guardragons. The real thing that might trip you up is you have to either make Herald + Halqifibrax into Draco Masters of the Tenyi OR you can use an extender here to end on an extra negate."

Can consistently set up multiple negates with Herald of Ultimateness, sometimes ","<h2>Introduction</h2> This deck aims to make use of the new <strong>Draitron</strong> Ritual archetype coming to the TCG in <strong>Genesis Impactors</strong>. Going first the goal is to set up as many negates as possible with <a data-name=""Herald of Ultimateness"">Herald of Ultimateness</a>, <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>. Going second, the deck can break boards with <a data-name=""Number 77: The Seven Sins"">Number 77: The Seven Sins</a> and easily OTK with it and <a data-name=""Draitron Meteornis=DRA"">Draitron Meteornis=DRA</a>. The deck is able to run in-theme handtraps like <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> and <a data-name=""Gnomaterial"">Gnomaterial</a> that double as discard fodder for Herald and help counter some of the top decks in the meta, particularly Phantom Knights or any deck that must banish cards. Since the deck also has many powerful Ritual monsters, it can play through Extra Deck lockout effects reasonably well too. And since the Draitron Ritual Spell allows summoning Ritual monsters from the Graveyard, the deck has surprising recursion and resilience so long as you have at least one Draitron or Ritual card in hand.  In anticipation of the inevitable ban of <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, this deck instead uses <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a> as a combo extender/mini Synchro engine.  Unfortunately the TCG does not yet have access to the key combo piece <a data-name=""Diviner of the Heralds"">Diviner of the Heralds</a>, which allows for Tzolkin plays and significantly increases the consistency and ceiling of the deck. Unless Diviner is released soon this deck is only playable in the OCG or in automatic dueling simulators. Until then <a data-name=""Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands"">Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</a> must be used instead.  Two card combos for this deck allow you to end on a Herald of Ultimateness with two omni-negates as well as a Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon and an <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>. Three card combos increase the ceiling significantly; high roll hands can end on not only Herald with 3-4 negates, Crystal Wing and I:P, but also make Herald immune to spell effects (including <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> !), and link into a 3-material Apollousa on your opponent's turn.  With <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a> now Limited, this deck can struggle against handtraps or well-established boards if you cannot access your ritual spell or combo pieces. It is fairly susceptible to Ash Blossom but can dodge some targeting effects like Effect Veiler because the Draitrons activate in the GY. Drawing any of the small Herald cards can also allow you to negate a handtrap and continue your plays. If you are looking for a Ritual deck that can build surprisingly strong boards and take games off of meta decks after the September banlist, and that doesn't utilize the combos we've all seen before with Halqifibrax, look no further! <h2>Draitrons</h2> Draitrons are a Ritual-based archetype of LIGHT Machine monsters with a unique mechanic: Ritual summoning using ATK values (of Machine-type monsters) instead of levels. All of them cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and activating their effects (from the hand or GY) lock you out of Special Summoning monsters that can be Normal Summoned for the rest of the turn. While this restriction seems unworkable, you are still allowed to normal summon and summon from the Extra Deck as well as Ritual Summon. As their Ritual spell <a data-name=""Meteornis Draitron"">Meteornis Draitron</a>is is generic, they are highly splashable and can support almost any Ritual archetype.  Each non-Ritual Draitron is level 1 with 2000 ATK/0 DEF, and their effects are activated by tributing another Ritual or Draitron monster from your hand or field, allowing you to Special Summon them in defense position with an additional effect. The 2 Ritual Draitron monsters are both level 12 with 4000 ATK/4000 DEF each and are untargetable by monster effects or Spell/Trap effects, respectively. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Ban-Alpha"">Draitron Ban-Alpha</a> is our main starter and searcher for the deck. You can tribute another Draitron or Ritual to search out a Ritual monster from the deck, usually <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> if you don't already have it or <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> otherwise. The biggest worry with this card is being hit by an opponent's Ash Blossom, as without access to Benten most of our plays are out of reach. Sometimes you can bait a potential Ash Blossom if you already have Benten in hand by tributing it with Alpha. Since it is tributed for cost you can still use Benten's effect after the chain resolves.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Al-Zeta"">Draitron Al-Zeta</a> is just like Alpha but searches Ritual Spells instead. Usually we'll want to use this card after having already used Alpha's effect, tributing the Ritual monster it just searched. We only run one Ritual Spell and access to it is crucial so this card is a three-of.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron El-Gamma"">Draitron El-Gamma</a> is an extender, not a searcher, allowing us to tribute a Ritual or Draitron monster to special summon itself and another Draitron in the GY. This is one of the only ways to summon a small Draitron in Attack position, which can be useful when you just need a bit more damage to OTK your opponent and all of your Draitrons are in defense. Although the card lets you extend farther, it is not as useful as Alpha or Zeta so we only run 2.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Meteornis=DRA"">Draitron Meteornis=DRA</a> is the first of the Ritual boss monsters. While it is untargetable by monster effects and has 4000 ATK/DEF, we will rarely summon this card unless we need to OTK or have no other options. Its effect--banishing monsters from your GY whose total ATK equal 2000 or 4000, to target and send to the GY up to two of your opponent's monsters--can only be activated during your opponent's turn. It's great that this effect sends to the GY rather than destroying, but unfortunately it targets and so is not the best removal. We'll most often use this card as tribute fodder for another Ritual monster since it can fulfill the ATK requirement on its own.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Meteornis=QUA"">Draitron Meteornis=QUA</a> is the second Ritual boss and is rather situational, being untargetable by spells and traps and destroying all of your opponent's backrow when summoned. You should side this to replace DRA when facing decks with heavy backrow like Altergeist, Dogmatika or Phantom-Knights.</li> </ul> In addition to the main deck monsters there are 4 Draitron spells we will make use of: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Meteornis Draitron"">Meteornis Draitron</a> is our Ritual spell, able to summon any Ritual monster from your hand or GY by tributing Machines whose total ATK exceed its ATK. For the cost of lowering the ATK of a Draitron monster you control for the rest of the turn, you can return it back to your hand to use it again. Since this card provides natural recursion and usually allows you to use it twice per turn, you generally don't need to run more than one copy.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Nova"">Draitron Nova</a> special summons any non-ritual Draitron from the deck, destroying it during the end phase. This is an amazing starter, since we can link off the monster summoned into Linkuriboh and activate its effects from the GY. You'll want to always run 3, and almost always summon Alpha off of its effect.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Fafnir"">Draitron Fafnir</a> is our Field Spell, almost like a Ritual version of Magical Meltdown, that primarily searches other Draitron spells/traps. It prevents your Ritual spell cards from being negated, but this is rarely all that useful as your opponent can still chain to their activation. It can also be very useful against Synchro or Xyz-based decks: When a monster is Special Summoned you can decrease its level by 1 for every 1000 ATK it has, once per turn, if you control a Draitron monster. If you time this properly you can prevent your opponent from Synchro or Xyz Summoning their intended monster by decreasing the level of the Synchro or Xyz material. Run 2-3.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Asterism"">Draitron Asterism</a> is an interesting Quick Play spell that provides targeted monster removal at the cost of decreasing a Draitron <em>or</em> Ritual monster's ATK by 1000. It can help you out of tight spots going second (for example, to destroy an opponent's Apollousa) and going first serves as another, searchable, disruption.</li> </ul> <h2>Fairies &amp; More</h2> The second half of our main deck monster lineup mainly consists of LIGHT Fairy monsters, mostly from the ""Herald"" archetype. In addition to their individual effects, all of them serve as extra discards/negates for Herald, so we want to run as many as possible, even for handtraps. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Herald of Ultimateness"">Herald of Ultimateness</a> is our big, non-once-per-turn omni-negate stick, discarding Fairy monsters to negate effects. With 2000 ATK/3000 DEF it can be summoned with one Draitron or a boosted <a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a> and expect to survive a battle phase against whatever your opponent can normal summon. This can negate Special Summons as well, meaning it can stop monsters with effects on summon from activating at all. However, while Herald can negate the activation of Spell/Trap cards, it cannot negate their effects, meaning your opponent can use S/T effects in the GY or the effects of continuous or Field spells already on the field. You'll want to sit on this with as many Fairy monsters in hand as possible and carefully say ""no"" to whatever your opponent tries to do.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Eva"">Eva</a> is a weird, alien looking Fairy that is the ideal discard fodder for Herald. When it hits the GY you can banish up to two other LIGHT fairy monsters from it to add that many other level 2 or lower LIGHT fairies to your hand. Using it to negate something allows you to search two more negates!</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> is the in-theme monster negate handtrap and our only hope of sometimes playing through Nibiru. Even though you have to go -2 to use it, discarding it and another Fairy, it is usually worth it if used on your opponent's key combo pieces or to save your board.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Herald of Purple Light"">Herald of Purple Light</a> is just like Orange but for Trap cards. It can save you from <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> or other Normal traps, but it cannot negate the effects of traps already on the field like Personal Spoofing, nor counter trap cards like <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Lee the World Chalice Fairy"">Lee the World Chalice Fairy</a> provides longevity in long games, returning itself to the hand at the cost of a monster from your hand or field, giving you a Herald negate each turn in combination with the Draitrons' effects. It's also another name to search off of Eva.</li> </ul> Next are the Fairy combo pieces, including the as-yet-unreleased Diviner: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Diviner of the Heralds"">Diviner of the Heralds</a> is a level 2 Tuner that sends a fairy monster from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard to gain that monster's levels. By sending <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> or <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'Tss"">Elder Entity N'Tss</a> we can fill our GY with Fairies and search a Ritual monster/spell or pop a card, respectively. This also sets up Diviner to be a level 6 Tuner which is how we'll summon Tzolkin. You could use this card to go into Halqifibrax, but we won't. It's also a Herald discard in a pinch.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> is what makes the deck go brrrrr. Its effect to search a LIGHT Fairy when Tributed is not once per turn, and we aim to activate it at least twice per turn. Search it with Alpha then Tribute it with Zeta to search Diviner, use it as Herald fodder at the worst, etc. The most broken card in the deck and one you'll always want at 2-3 copies.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyber Angel Natasha"">Cyber Angel Natasha</a> is Benten's little, level 5 sister. You can use it to steal your opponent's monsters (and its effect to do so is not once per turn!), but only if it has been properly Ritual Summoned and is in your GY with another Cyber Angel to banish. Since it only has 1000 ATK it's incredibly easy to summon and can turn the Duel in your favor if you take something big with it. You could probably cut this for another Benten or handtraps if you like.</li> </ul> Lastly are a few cards that raise the ceiling of the deck significantly: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> is a 500 ATK Ritual monster that returns a Ritual monster from the GY to the hand and gains its level. It can also tribute monsters to Ritual Summon a Megalith card from your hand or deck. This allows us to use Benten's effect a second time, by returning it to the hand and tributing it, and in the process it also becomes level 6 for Tzolkin. Later in the game it can also return a level 12 Ritual monster to gain its level so that you can make a Rank 12 Xyz.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> is another Earth Ritual that draws and discards 1 card when Ritual Summoned. You'll almost always want to chain Benten's effect to this and discard something that can be in the GY, making it essentially a free draw. We'll rarely use its second quick effect to Ritual Summon a monster (using levels). This is the only Ritual monster you don't want in your GY as it can only be summoned by Phul from the deck or hand.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""B-Buster Drake"">B-Buster Drake</a> is our insurance against Dark Ruler No More and Forbidden Droplet. Equip this to Herald with Union Carrier and rest easily when your opponent activates either of those cards, as it will be immune to all of their spell effects. Be careful when dealing with cards like Mystic Mine, however, as they effect <em>you</em> and not your monsters. Not truly a garnet because if you draw it and can't equip it (if you used Union Carrier for Eva), it is Machine-type so can be used as tribute fodder.</li> </ul> <h2>Staples &amp; Going First/Second Cards</h2> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended"">Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended</a>: Discards itself to negate an effect that targets your monster. Great against Impermance or Dogmatika Punishment.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyber Emergency"">Cyber Emergency</a>: HOPT searcher for any Draitron monster. Also if your opponent doesn't read and negates + destroys it, you can add it back and use it again.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>: Drop this on your opponent's board, banish it all with Seven Sins and set up with Herald, profit.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Execution of the Contract"">Execution of the Contract</a>: An equip spell that changes the levels of your monster to that of a Ritual in hand, and pops monsters if the equipped monster is tributed. The best way to make Sevin Sins and can be a quick effect pop if you tribute a Draitron with Linkuriboh's effect. Can provide an out to Apollousa or <a data-name=""Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops"">Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</a>, since Linkuriboh tributes for cost and Megaclops is susceptible to spell effects. Must run at 3 to be searchable with Power Tool Dragon.</li> </ul> <h2>Extra Deck</h2> <ul>  	<li>Diviner targets: <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> and <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'Tss"">Elder Entity N'Tss</a>: Arc Light searches Rituals and N'Tss targets and pops an opponent's card. Generally, only run as many as you can expect to send with Diviner.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a>: Level 12 monster made with Diviner + Phul. You can usually summon it two turns in a row, but you can cut one for something else if needed.</li>  	<li>Tzolkin targets: <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Power Tool Dragon"">Power Tool Dragon</a>: The former negates and runs over things, the latter searches Execution and is a Machine, so can be tributed.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Number 77: The Seven Sins"">Number 77: The Seven Sins</a>: Banishes all your opponent's Special Summoned monsters. Usually made with Tzolkin and a monster raised to level 12 with Execution, but can be made other ways. It also has huge ATK and one-time destruction protection.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>: OTK potential. It's possible to replace this with <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> if you prefer.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>: Even more negates!</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Nephthys, the Sacred Flame"">Nephthys, the Sacred Flame</a>: Sometimes you get disrupted and this is all you can make. Can be strong when made with 2-3 Rituals if your opponent can't remove it.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a>: Can equip Eva to itself and be used to summon Herald, activating Eva, or can equip Herald with Buster Drake for spell immunity.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>: Use this and Union Carrier to make an Apollousa on your opponent's turn.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a>: In a pinch, this can get you the card you need if you summon a Ritual monster to its arrow. Also nice for climbing.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>: Incredibly easy to summon with any Draitron. Great synergy with Execution since it tributes, and you can pretty much use it every turn.</li> </ul> <h2>Combos</h2> NS = Normal Summon  SS = Special Summon  RS = Ritual Summon  CL = Chain Link  You'll usually want to go first and set up Herald with as many Fairies in hand as you can get, preferably with protection for Herald. <h4>Nova + Zeta</h4> End board: Herald with 2+ negates, Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, Linkuriboh and Megalith Och <ol>  	<li>Activate Nova to SS Alpha and link into Linkuriboh.</li>  	<li>Activate Alpha to tribute Zeta and search Benten.</li>  	<li>Activate Zeta to tribute Benten, searching the Ritual Spell and Diviner of the Heralds.</li>  	<li>NS Diviner, sending Arc Light to search Phul.</li>  	<li>RS Phul tributing Alpha, activating it to return Benten to the hand.</li>  	<li>Return the Ritual Spell to hand and RS Och with Phul's effect, tributing Benten. Don't do these in the same chain in case you get Nibiru'd.</li>  	<li>CL1 Och, CL2 Benten, searching Herald of Ultimateness (if you don't have it) or Eva (if you do).</li>  	<li>Get a free draw off Och and discard Ultimateness.</li>  	<li>SS Ultimaya Tzolkin with Diviner &amp; Phul.</li>  	<li>Set the Ritual spell to activate Tzolkin's effect, SS Crystal Wing.</li>  	<li>Link Tzolkin + Linkuriboh into Union Carrier, since both are DARK.</li>  	<li>Activate Union Carrier to equip either Eva, Gamma, or whatever you want in the GY to itself, bringing its ATK to 2000.</li>  	<li>RS Ultimateness using Union Carrier.</li>  	<li>Activate Eva in the GY, banishing Diviner &amp; Arc Light to search two Herald negates.</li> </ol> If you already drew Eva, you can summon Power Tool Dragon instead and summon Herald with it, after using its effect, then equip <a data-name=""B-Buster Drake"">B-Buster Drake</a> to Herald to give it spell immunity.  If you drew the above but also Benten and another Fairy, you can tribute the first Benten with Alpha to search a second and a Herald of Orange Light (for protection from Nibiru), then tribute the second with Zeta to go into Diviner as normal. <h4>Nova + Zeta + Gamma</h4> End board: Herald with 2+ Negates, Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, Linkuriboh, Union Carrier and I:P Masquerena.  Proceed as above, but discard Gamma instead of Ultimateness in step 8: <ol>  	<li>SS Ultimaya Tzolkin with Diviner &amp; Phul.</li>  	<li>Set the Ritual Spell to activate Tzolkin's effect, SS Crystal Wing.</li>  	<li>Link Tzolkin + Linkuriboh into Union Carrier, since both are DARK.</li>  	<li>Activate Gamma, tributing Ultimateness SS itself and Alpha. Take note on zone placement, ideally Union Carrier should be above the 1000 ATK Zeta.</li>  	<li>Equip Eva to Gamma if you didn't draw it.</li>  	<li>RS Ultimateness with Gamma, activating Eva's effect if necessary.</li>  	<li>Link into I:P Masquerena with Zeta and Och.</li> </ol> On your opponent's turn, you can activate Linkuriboh's effect tributing the Alpha on field, or you can make a 3-material Apollousa with I:P, Union Carrier and Alpha. <h4>Nova + Zeta (Going Second)</h4> End board: Number 77: The Seven Sins, Herald of Ultimateness, Linkuriboh, Draitron Zeta  Proceed as in the going first Nova + Zeta combo, but keep Ultimateness in hand and discard something else in step 8.  Hopefully you have already turned off your opponent's board with Dark Ruler No More. <ol>  	<li>SS Ultimaya Tzolkin with Diviner &amp; Phul.</li>  	<li>Set the Ritual spell to activate Tzolkin's effect, SS Power Tool Dragon.</li>  	<li>Activate Power Tool's effect to search Execution of the Contract.</li>  	<li>Equip Execution to Och, using its effect to reveal the Ultimateness in hand and make it level 12.</li>  	<li>Xyz Summon Number 77 with Tzolkin and Och.</li>  	<li>RS Ultimateness with Power Tool Dragon.</li>  	<li>Activate Number 77's effect to banish your opponent's board.</li> </ol> From here you can try to OTK or link into Union Carrier with Number 77 &amp; Linkuriboh to protect Ultimateness, etc. <h2>Side Deck</h2> It turns out there are a lot of great Fairy-type handtraps and floodgates as well as Kaijus that work well with Draitron: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>: Draitrons lock us out of Special Summoning monsters that can be normal summoned, like most of the Kaijus. Since Lava Golem cannot be Normal Summoned, it is perfect for tributing your opponent's board, although it does lock us out of our Normal Summon for that turn.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Vanity's Ruler"">Vanity's Ruler</a>: A powerful floodgate searchable off of Benten that prevents your opponent from Special Summoning. Side this in against decks with lots of Kaiju-based removal or if you know your opponent cannot out it. You can get a second Tribute off of Benten by summoning it then tributing it for this card, so with a good hand it's also possible to make this card immune to Dark Ruler No More like we would for Herald.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>: Instantly shuts down any deck that must banish unless they can negate it. This includes common engines like Invoked, Phantom Knights, and anything running <a data-name=""Gren Maju Da Eiza"">Gren Maju Da Eiza</a>. And it's searchable off of Benten!</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Gnomaterial"">Gnomaterial</a>: Unfortunately EARTH attribute and so isn't searchable, but only needs to discard itself to make one of your opponent's monsters unusable for Link, Fusion, etc material. If you can resolve this against an opponent's Halqifibrax or another combo piece they needed to get rid of into the GY, you can sometimes simply end their combo. Also very good in mirror matches--use it against your opponent's Alpha summoned with Nova, and they'll have no way to get it off the field to use its effect.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>: Backrow hate.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Card Advance"">Card Advance</a>: Probably unnecessary but useful if running Vanity's Ruler. If you chain Phul's effect to summon Och to this, you can stack the top of your deck and then choose whether to draw off the top or shuffle first when the chain with Och and Benten starts. This gives you the potential to summon Ruler and still combo after as well as drawing any 1 of the 5 cards on top of your deck.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a>: Mostly good against Fusion or Pendulum-based decks.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Royal Decree"">Royal Decree</a>: We're not running any Traps and this can stop Trap-based decks like Eldlich or Altergeist in their tracks. You could also run <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> instead.</li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> Thank you for reading my first attempt at a deck article! I love this archetype and Ritual archetypes in general, and I hope that you enjoy playing the deck as much as I have. Hopefully Diviner finally gets imported to the TCG by the time Draitron come out so that we can see how well they perform against the meta!  There are a few other cards I considered including, namely <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a>, because it can be summoned easily with Och, but this build is what I've found to the most consistent at playing first or second and I'd rather not cut some of the handtraps/handtrap protection for it."

Card destruction and draw power.,"This deck utilizes 3 main engines to fuel your draw power to reach you scales and monsters.  The deck runs the Spellbook draw Engine 2 x Spellbook Magician of Prophecy, 2 x Spellbook of Secrets, and 1 copy of Spellbook of Knowledge. This is the correct ratio as you are effectively running 4 searchers for knowledge and the duplicate searcher you end with can be sent for cost of knowledge.  The magician engine  Double Iris Magician x1 (duh hes limited) -  1x  Harmonizing Magician - 1x Purple Poison Magician -  1x Dragonpit Magician -  1x Performapal Celestial Magician  With all the searching power this deck has you only need one copy of each. Purple is the best low scale to have after using the searches from Servant of Endymion and Reflection The Damage boost eff procs the destruction effect.  Harmonizing in hand searches Dragon pit for the level 7 xyz or whatever magician you need most  Double iris is really here since its searchable off of duelist alliance since he's technically a pendulum dragon.  &nbsp;  2x Pendulum Calling - 2x Duelist Alliance The searching as mentioned above.  Pendulum Calling is great for unclogging parts of your hand.  It can setup your time pendulumograph.  Duelist alliance searches your pen call, double iris or time pendulumograph.  &nbsp;  Endymion Engine. Servant of Endymion - 3x Spell power mastery - 3x Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic - 3x Magical Abductor - 2x Mythical Beast Jackal King  Abductor is really versatile here.  He can search your boss monster or Jackal for Negate.  Abductor on the field can search for your magicans soul.  Generic Draw  3x Allure of Darkness - 1x Into the Void - 1x Upstart Goblin  Magicians engine  3x magicians soul - 2x magicians restage - 1x magicians right hand.  Souls is so good it is a body and unbricks your hands.  Restage I'm running at two since the inclusion of the other magician engine reduces the effectiveness of this.   Restage is a great extender. Magicians right hand is yet another negate.  Extenders: Magicans Restage - instant fusion - magicians souls - Selene  restage is a very good extender.  Brings back out souls or blue boi.   Say you dont have 2 spells to burn for magicians soul. you can link it off do some combos and bring it back with selene to pop cards in your hand/field.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Extra deck.  Millennium-Eyes Restrict -  Drawing instant fusion almost essentially guarantees your board and can be recycled by selene  Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon and Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon. - free negates and recycles your pendulums in the extra  Abyss Dweller - With the prevalence of GY strategies its a good include but Ill side it out for Tornado Dragon to deal with backrow decks  Timestar magician - Decent body good protection for your scales and can recycle your pendulums  Apollosua Bow of the Goddess - Great negation Great arrows what else do you want  Crowley, the first propheseer - starter for the spellbook engine  Daybreaker the Shinging Magical Warrior - its effect is okay the spell counter can be useful and its a decent target for selene to link climb  I:P masquerena - Super versatile great link into unicorn on your opponents turn for more disruption.  Ningirsu the world chalice warrior - none targeting, non destruction removal for dragoon.  Saryuja Skull dread - Extender and can unbrick hands, honestly could be cut for another copy of selene His issue is if it gets handtrapped you burnt a lot of resources into him.  2x Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians. - Honestly one of the best xtras for pendulum.  Its an extender with great arrows.  It can summon souls to field or restrict, or any combo piece in your gy.  The spell counters can enable synergy with the rest of the Endymion cards.  Side board  This is the area with the least amount of testing so far. for decks to break large boards you can side out the spellbook engine for the Sphere mods and the nibiru or dark ruler no more.  And honestly dark ruler no more is just b/c forbidden droplets is expensive. Duster and reboot for backrow decks.  Mystic Mine :)  prankratops is  good value and versatile.  Tornado is good if you are siding out the spell book engine you can side out the link monster.

As we know this deck's gameplay is unique since instead of relying on their monster, it uses spell cards as their main plays.  Since <em>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</em> has been banned, this deck will now have less trouble controlling the flow of the game. The reason why this deck is difficult to deal with is because it has many handtraps, as we all know handtraps is a must in today's gameplay and this deck just not play a few of it. <em>Maxx C</em> is the game changer for this deck, resolving maxx c means your opponent will pass their combo or they're brave enough to let you draw handtraps and board destruction cards.  This deck's combo may vary depending on the circumstances you're in, so I'll just explain the use of each spell cards.  <strong>Engage</strong> - As we all know this card is your ticket to victory, activating this card with 3 spell cards in your GY will let have a huge advantage.  <strong>Jamming Waves</strong> - Pretty great backrow removal card, this card can also be used if you opponent has a monster that cannot be targeted (just make sure you have 3 spell cards in your GY)  <strong>Afterburners</strong> - Good card to bait your opponent's negate  <strong>Eagle Booster</strong> - You pretty much won't use this card most of the time, but when you do it'll win you the game  <strong>Hornet Drones</strong> -  Life saver if you didn't see Raye, also it's good if you're planning to swarm the field with monster  <strong>Shark Cannon</strong> - Multipurpose card right here, it can disrupt your opponent's combo and at the same time it can SS you're opponent's tuner monster then you'll go to <em>Halqifibrax</em> combo  <strong>Widow Anchor</strong> - Your most searched card using <em>Engage</em>  <strong>Multirole</strong> - Great for the grind game and can combo it up with <em>Area Zero</em> if you don't have <em>Raye</em>. Don't forget this dude's effect that will prevent your opponent to respond to your spell cards activation.  <strong>Area Zero</strong> - Can summon <em>Raye</em> if it's sent to the GY. If you're lucky this dude can excavate the card you need  <strong>Things to Remember</strong> <ul>  	<li>Always check your GY if it has 3 or more spell cards on it, this will enable you to maximize your resources.</li>  	<li>No <em>Raye</em> = No Game, always find a way to have<em> Raye</em> in your Hand, Field, or GY.</li> </ul>"

You typically make cherubini before ever normal summoning, which puts your opponent at odds with a nibiru, meaning you can be much more likely to play through it."

Formatted for September 2020.,"Graydle Kaiju is a surprisingly flexible control deck with the aim of Tributing your opponent's monsters with Kaijus and then taking control of them with the Graydle monster's effects. Having Kaiju's in the main deck provides one with a much-needed answer to monsters that you simply cannot run over.  3 copies of Interrupted Kaiju Slumber allow for us to get the ball rolling early when going second, generally you'll want to have Jizukiru on your side and give your opponent Gameciel when resolving Slumber. The other Kaiju's are there as a backup. The deck would like to go second, as going first is far to slow and this deck does not make an impactful board unless it has it's Graveyard loaded up since you can Synchro Summon using Slime Jr.  Rebellion is as an extra layer of defense that can mean the difference between life and death in some situations, it's a very helpful Battle Phase trick. For consistency, we have Graydle Impact, Pot of Avarice, and Salvage. The latter two cards reload our deck and hand respectively while Graydle Impact provides consistent searching during the End Phase as well as the ability to tutor for another Graydle as well as clearing cards off your opponent's board.  The Extra Deck contains some normal Link goodstuff as well as some Water synchros that we have to make due to the restriction that comes with Slime Jr's effect.

Maybe you want to make this deck and only have one magicians' souls lying around. Maybe you have none. Well, I am here to tell you that there is a way. It may not be the best way, but it will give you decent boards most of the time. So the big questions here are: ""Why two Dark Magician Girls?"" and ""What do I use instead of Magicians' Souls?""  Well, I was having trouble balancing the benefit and deficit of three Allure of Darkness in the deck. You could replace the second DMG with Jester Confit, but I found that with two Secrets of Dark Magic, two Dark Magic Veil, three Keeper of Dragon Magic, three Apprentice Illusion Magician and of course three Allure of Darkness, that DMG is rarely a complete dead draw. She is still material for one of the two fusion monsters you will summon the most with this deck.  Magicians' Souls is an amazing card, but affording a playset of it is asking a lot. The main way I make up for for only running one are the pair of Fusion Deployment and Dark Magic Veil. Fusion Deployment is searchable with only Keeper of Dragon Magic. It will special summon Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl from deck or hand. This makes Dark Magician that much easier to summon to the field turn one. Yes, it also works with Predaplant Verte Anaconda. While Magicians' Souls is searchable, there is still the single copy of it in this build. However, if you cannot afford any copies of the card, there are two things you should do. 1.) Absolutely still run a playset of Soul Servant. The deck will not work with it. 2.) You can replace Magicians' Souls with Upstart Goblin, Jester Confit, a second Magician of Dark Illusion, or any dark spellcaster you can think of that might synergize. Cosmo Brain is the one that worked for me the best.  Ultimately, the deck is not at its full potential without a playset of Magicians' Souls. But did that ever stop Yugi? Nope! So if you want to play Dark Magician, go out there and do what you can!"

I'm not going to get into all of the combos, some very key cards in this deck (other than standard train deck profiles) are XYZ Import and Negalogia AA-Zeus (pending release: Phantom Rage).  After summoning Superdreadnaught Rail Cannon Juggernaught Liebe, if he battles but does not OTK that turn, he has nothing to counter effects.  Often times, when pushing a heavy OTK with limited cards, Liebe is the only monster on your field, so if the turn passes they can easily clear your side of the field.  AA-Zeus can be summoned by an attacking XYZ monster and (quick effect): detach 2 material and destroy every other card on the field, except itself.  Heavy combo decks can easily be stopped with this card alone, passing the turn off to you to finish with a 3000 attack.  &nbsp;  XYZ import is a very, very important card that MUST be run in train decks now.  It not only clears a monster from your opponents side of the field, but it allows you to attach said monster to an XYZ monster you control.  The only condition is that the opponents monster must have attack less than or equal to the XYZ monster.  Being a high attack, heavy-hitting train deck, that condition is easy to meet.  This can provide huge benefits for all the Superdreadnought XYZ's, AA-Zeus, even Skypalace... overall an amazing card that must be played.  I've tested this deck for 15+ hours and it is the most consistent deck profile i've used to date.  Better than infinitrack/train decks by far, way more consistent and less combos which can stop Niburu.  (side note: 2 shaddoll dragons instead of 1x beast because beast has bricked my entire hand before... dragon is can pop off on flip and graveyard effect so its better to run 2 in this deck)  Hope you enjoy!"

Decode Talker Heatsoul can help you replenish your hand, but use careful since force you to pay 1000 for card draw. 3 Recorded Alive and Limit Code can help you create a solid defense. Pot of Avarice and Jar of Avarice are important to retrieve non-properly summoned Code Talkers and replenish your hand.  Advice: Keep Talkback Lancer in emergency in case you're need Transcode to revive a Code comrades.

Formatted for Sept. 2020,"THIS DECK USES OCG CARDS!  What's better than armored Dragons? MORE ARMORED DRAGONS! This deck combines Dragunity with new Armed Dragon support! The deck behaves like how a typical variation of Dragunity should; combing off and building massive boards! The new Armed Dragon monsters are retrained versions of the originals with a new method of leveling up as well as some new effects when you send copies of them, such as drawing a card and search a Level 5 or higher WIND Dragon monster, out with the clunky old and in with the much more consistent new! Armed Dragon Flash allows us to get our plays started by being able to tutor out Armed Dragon Lv3 - Thunder from the deck and then leveling it up while also discarding Dragunity Tuners which we can later revive and use to Synchro Summon.  This is a rough draft of a Dragon deck that one could fall back on when Rokkets inevitably get the axe.

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. ""Orcust"", known as ""Orphegel"" (オルフェゴール Orufegōru) in Japan, is an archetype of DARK Machine Monsters that debuted in Soul Fusion. They are related to the ""World Legacy"" archetype. The name Orcust may be a portmanteau of ""orchestra"" and ""locust"", referring to their endless numbers in the archetype's lore; it may also be a reference to Orcus. This archetype's Japanese name is a reference to Orpheus and Orgel (the Dutch/German/Japanese for music boxes/Organs). The Main Deck members are named after musical elements and have aspects of musical instruments as part of their bodies.

I think this is the 2nd strongest Fossil hybrid, following Invoked Fossil which you can also find on my profile. However, this version is significantly cheaper due to it not relying as heavily on owning Impertinence. It also has the benefits of the anti-meta Shaddoll package.  Our hand trap here is Psy-Framegear Gamma, which is unsurprising due to the deck needing access to Light monsters for it's strongest plays, as well for its inherent synergy with El Shaddoll Fusion. If your opponent is kind enough to attack into your Driver it also makes for a nice Fossil Fusion target.  Only 1 copy of Time Stream this time around. It's a lot less necessary in this build due to it's easier access to Fossil Warrior Skullknight courtesy of Shaddoll Beast.  Revival Golem is a nice bit of tech to combo with Shaddoll Fusion, Mathematician, Foolish Burial, or Miracle Rupture to help facilitate your Cross-Sheep and Utopia combos.  All in all, the Fossil engine has quite reasonable synergy with Shaddolls. I wouldn't kick this deck out of bed for eating crackers."

Formatted for Sept. 2020,"<strong><span>Looking for a way to REALLY annoy your opponent? This twist of Mystic Mine should do it! </span>  </strong>Since it's release in Dark Neostorm last year, players all around the world can agree on one thing; Mystic Mine is TOXIC! This back-breaking Field Spell needs no introduction, with many players at all levels crying out for its ban. Well, it's not gone yet, so we can still have some fun with it. This deck is a fairly standard Mystic Mine build, largely inspired by Jeff Leonard's current take on the deck so big shout outs to him! This build, however, focuses on another card that is guaranteed to turn the salt factor up to 11: Convulsion of Nature!  Convulsion of Nature is a very weird card. This Continuous Spell asks that both players flip their Deck's upside down and proceed with the Duel as normal. Essentially, this means flipping both the Decks up, revealing the top card of each Deck for both players. Since this is revealed, we can manipulate our opponent's hand with cards like Mind Crush and Drastic Drop-Off? Don't have those cards set and don't like what the opponent has on the top of their deck? No problem! Just use Goddess Skuld's Oracle and re-arrange the top of the Deck to (hopefully) make them brick next turn! All the while, we can get the top card of our Deck during the Main Phase using Archfiend's Oath, allowing us to keep a consistent hand size.  Mystic Mine is enabled in this deck through two cards; Demise of the Land and Silent Wobby. The former allows us to stop our opponent's plays dead in their tracks upon activation whilst the latter gives us access to Mine on turn 1. Dimension Shifter is another great card to have when going second, banishing things in this Graveyard-reliant meta is always helpful.  The deck's main win condition is Final Countdown. Pay 2000 LP and you'll win the Duel...20 turns later that is. With a deck as slow-burning as this, you may as well have a way to win without going into time.  The Extra Deck is just Extravagance fuel.  The side deck contains a turkey. I do recommend having some Wave-Motion Cannons with you though, it's always good to have another win condition.

But if you want to play Synchro Eldlich again, this is an option. The biggest downside is you give up the Trains, since the combo eats up almost the whole extra deck. But you end on Calamities + Savage. Also, it runs a pile of bricks. Oh well. A larger deck size might be warranted for Eldlich players trying this combo tbh.  You use Opening of the Spirit Gates and Link Summoning to get 3 dark monsters with different types, then make Curious, send Plaguespreader. You link Curious into Linkross, and revive Plaguespreader and link with Linkross into Needlefibre, summoning Deskbot 001. You make Metalmarcher, revive the deskbot, then make Formula Synchron to draw a card and fix levels. Link Metalmarcher + Halq into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens, summon Deskbot. Synchro 1 token + Synchron into Garden Rose Maiden, then Synchro it + Deskbot into Coral Dragon. Auroradon's effect, tribute 2 tokens, summon Coltwing, summon 2 tokens, summon Deskbot. Synchro Coral Dragon + 1 token into Ravenous Crocodragon, draw 2 cards of the effects. Since you have 1 token remaining the Coltwing is a level 7, so make Borreload Savage with Deskbot, and equip Curious to him. Then use Garden Rose Maiden's effect to banish itself from the GY, summon Coral Dragon, and Synchro it with your token into another level 9. Boom, Calamities + Savage."

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. Dinosaur (Japanese: 恐きょう竜りゅうKyōryū) is a type of monster that primarily relies on beatdown tactics and sometimes Monsters effect, to help a Duelist prevail in a Duel. There are many high-level Dinosaur-Type monsters, so the general strategy for them is to Summon their high-Level monsters as quickly as possible using cards like ""Hunting Instinct"" or ""Big Evolution Pill"", overpowering the opponent's weaker monsters before they have a chance to defend themselves.

Mara + Joy will get you anything, from the new Faeking to Oneiromancy. Diviner helps to fetch Mara or can send N'tss","Dream Mirror has unique concept of playing with tagging out to their counterpart using ""mirror"" field spell. It also has great artwork like Trickstar but combined with Darklord.  The play is very simple, we need <strong>Dream Mirror of Joy + Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Mara</strong>. To accomplish that we use 3 Mara, 3 Joy, 3 Phantasms (allows more interruption by searching Morpheus), 3 Diviner (send and use Trias to ss Mara), One for One, Terraforming, and Set Rotation (makes us unable to switch the field spell tho). Use Mara ss Sprite, use Sprite add Dream Mirror of Chaos/Morpheus/Oneiromancy (if we use Set Rotation, we will stuck on Joy field, means only Oneiromancy can provide interruption). At the end phase, switch the field to Terror so Chaos/Morpheus is online (Sprite can ss Mara to summon Morpheus from hand).  While we have 3 interruptions to choose, they all have their own downside. Morpheus: Best one imo, destroy card, big body, but difficult to work if you activate Set Rotation. Oneiromancy: Versatile, still online even with Set Rotation, but doesnt have body. Fusion: Biggest body, negation can be used again next turn, but doesn't destroy and doesn't work with Set Rotation.  The ratio is explainable, starters are 3 ofs, irreplaceable combo pieces as 2 ofs, and the searchables as 1 ofs. The rest of the deck is just good staples while being monster so One for One has higher chance to work.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/zPD6687.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Fun and unique gameplay, big staple slot.  Cons: Weak and struggle in grind game."

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. ""Thunder Dragon"" is an archetype of LIGHT and DARK Thunder monsters, used by Psychic Tendo in Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures. Their first member was introduced in the Vol.7 Booster Pack, while their first support was introduced in Soul Fusion. The general design and effect of each ""Thunder Dragon"" monster is based on and inspired by the original ""Thunder Dragon"", all of them being electrified dragons with a green, yellow, black or gray color scheme. ""Thunder Dragon Titan"" is especially influenced by the original ""Thunder Dragon"", which looks like a three-headed version of that monster, similar to the design of ""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"". ""Thunder Dragondark"" is a directly retrained version of the original ""Thunder Dragon"" as it has the same Type, Level, ATK, DEF, opposite Attribute, and similar effect of searching another copy of itself.

I reccomend keeping around your normal summon, in case you want to tribute summon a Kaiju; but you can also tribute an opponent's monster to give them a Kaiju, to then special summon a Kaiju to your side of the field. But you can also use Interrupted Kaiju Slumber; there's many ways to get out Thunder King. There's also alternatives with the other Kaijus, in case you're having trouble with running into Thunder King. The deck is very aggresive and focused on OTKing the opponent, by immediately lowering them to 0 as soon as possible.  I reccomend going for second, but going first isn't super bad; just be wary of removal, as the deck can be fragile. Note: The side deck is just for match-ups against certain types of decks, like a deck that runs all spellcasters or insects, and the extra deck is just a mix of good targets for Maximus. With Maxiumus, you'll want to toss out N'tss to remove the opponent's monsters, (Skull Knight serves the same purpose), and Psy-Framelord Omega for a purpose I may or may not have forgotten. The other monsters in the extra deck are just monsters that I personally like; change them out as you like. This is my first time posting here, so i'd love any feedback! Cheers."

I think this is about as good as the deck is going to get this format, some people are trying Phantom Knights support in Infernoble, but nothing besides Shade Brigandine appeals to me. This combo toolbox is way too good, both in terms of potential boards, and in terms of playing through interruption.  Infernoble Knights is a Warrior based Isolde Turbo combo deck, that uses cards like Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin, Omega (sometimes in tandem with D.D.R), Triple Tactics Talent, and most importantly Smoke Grenade of the Thief alongside Infernoble Emperor Charles, to snipe your opponent's hands. It does still put up 2-4 interruptions on your turn, but our actual goal is to have an opponent with 2 cards, and use with a negate, a pop, and perfect information. Still, the deck can really put the whole extra deck onto the board once you play around with it. Check out Pak TCG's channel for combo routes, or see my list for last month if you prefer to read. But the real trick to the deck is learning how to use your extenders to make insane boards, loop people multiple times, and play through negations.  The only real spiciness to this deck is the second Aqua Dolphin, which I think makes sense, as it is actually better as a normal summon than a Space Connector target, for the purposes of starting your combo. I will literally summon this over Space Connector if I have both and an extender, and I like seeing it slightly more often. You could run 1 Astolfo for fringe situations where you're searching off of Heritage of the Chalice after already using Durendal and other extenders, but it was so fringe the card eventually didn't make the cut, even though's it is aggressively fine.  For Hand Traps we're running Gamma and Nibiru in the main. Droll and Lock Bird is fine in the side, imo, especially for a deck like Infernoble, where the question vs Rokkets is who is going first, and how many hand traps did the person going second see. Yes, there are other targets for Droll in the format, but I'm not over-impressed by Dogmatika Invoked, and in every other matchup, including non-invoked Dogmatika decks, I'd rather an Ash. Don't get me wrong, both are great viable archetypes, and they aren't without synergy, but you're basically taking 2 supplemental archetypes and jamming them together - IMO they're both stronger when paired with other control decks, which can put up their engines alongside the 1 or 2 interruptions each side of Dogmatika Invoked adds to whatever it's paired with. A couple interruptions and a Winda is not a dead strategy, by any means, it's just not particularly hard to out the board, nor is it a particularly hard board to outgrind.  Changed the hand trap game slightly. I like the main a lot.  Upped the hand trap count. Gotta beat Rokkets some games going second. Changed the hand trap line-up. Tactics, Imperm, and Veiler are for Dragoon, D. Shifter and Lancea are for Dinosaur, Token Collector is for Infernoble (alongside generic negation). I think Ghost Ogre is really good against Rokkets (target the Romulus) as well as Dinosaur (gotta stop Lost World), with lots of useful applications in pretty much every meta matchup (Invoked target the field spell, same for Guru, Eldlich you can get the continuous Traps, Dogma should be one of those most of the time (maybe Altergeist, which case hit the Spoofing), and it has applications against the Tier 2 old meta decks as well, particularly against field spells.) Gamma is our ""generic"" hand trap, pretty much always good, and at least as likely to stop a combo deck's turn as one of the ""blowout"" traps. Numbers are pretty high, a quarter of the deck is hand traps, more if you count Tactics (which also adds to hand pressure going first or helps the deck combo off through negations) which means you should see one hand trap most games, and reasonably often you'll see the 2-3 (or 1 killer) you need to stop a turn."

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. ""A-to-Z"" (ＡｔｏＺエートゥズィĒtuZi) is a series of LIGHT Machine monsters that are designed to fuse without any Fusion cards via Contact Fusion by banishing the Fusion Materials from the field or, in the case of the Union Monsters in the Structure Deck: Seto Kaiba, from the Graveyard as well. They can also be powered up without fusing due to the fact that that most of them are Union monsters. These cards have been used by Seto Kaiba and Chazz Princeton. They are said to be rare cards in the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX anime, as they are among the cards stolen by Vellian Crowler.

Onto the explanation, my friends. </span>Playing guide <span>You'll want to, well, go through normal Salamangreat strategies. Mainly summoning them out, but here's where this deck differs; it has three boss monsters to choose from, based on your opening hand. If you start off with a good amount of the usual Salamangreats, you can link climb into either one of the Topologics or Pyro Pheonix, based off the situation. You'll want to climb through Baleynx, Sunlight Wolf, then Heatleo, in that order; I reccomend trying to get off all their effects as much as you can. </span><span>The second strategy is Mathmechs. If you start with lots of Tuners, you can use their special summoning requirements on a normal summoned monster to easily get them all out. Then you can tune a Mathmech with a dif monster (most likely a salamangreat) to make a Magma, then tune the Magma with the remaining monster to make a Sigma. Make sure to put Sigma in the place of the extra monster zone, as that makes him invincible to card effect destruction. </span><span>The third, and final strategy, is to go into Violet Chimera. This is more so a last resort if you get a bricky hand, as Violet Chimera isn't super good, but not terrible either. Summon out two monsters of your choice, then link them into Proxy. Hopefully, you can either ressurect one or summon another in order to fusion summon Chimera. Proxy works as a Poly while on the field, and Violet's materials are a link and a Salamangreat. </span><span>Once again, this is one of my first decks to be posted here, so i'd love any feedback or suggestions. Have a good day!</span>"

 What I want to see is representative of what is commonly seen on Halloween in terms of costumes.  Primarily what kids wear.  We talking PRINCESSES!  We talking SUPERHEROES.  So let’s make a deck based around these things.  &nbsp;  So first, I wanted to select the classic Princess from the Fairy Tail cards – Prinzessin.  This is the centerpiece of the deck, so I’ve got to include all that support.  I’ve got 3 Prinzessin of course, along with 3 Golden Castle of Stromberg, 3 Pumpkin Carriage, 2 Glass Slippers, 2 Iron Knight, 2 Iron Hans, 2 Iron Cage.  The full package.  And hey, the Pumpkin thing was a total coincidence, so that’s pretty nice.  This takes up a good portion of the deck.  &nbsp;  Let’s find another princess, perhaps.  I wanted Blizzard Princess but they didn’t really fit at all so no to that.  So okay, I’ll give you your obligatory zombie, you cowards.  I’ve put in Pumprincess, the Princess of Ghosts because hey it may be a zombie and another pumpkin, but at least it’s a princess.  And that’s what it’s all about.  Goshdarn princesses.  I don’t want to see another zombie fruit unless it’s got a tiara on its head.  &nbsp;  Okay, let’s move onto the next phase.  Kids love to dress up as superheroes on Halloween.  It’s a bajillion dollar industry.  Who better than the classics, the Elemental HERO archetype.  Let’s get some good stuff in there.  We got 3 Stratos, 2 Shadow Mist, a Solid Soldier, a Liquid Soldier.  3 Mask Change too.  We’re running a bit tight on deck space, gonna have to go over 40 soon if I want in that Miracle Fusion and Polymerization in there, so 1 of each of those.  We got a bunch of non-heroes in too, so let’s stick in a Mask Change II so it can maybe fix a mismatched hand.  &nbsp;  I’ve also stuck in a copy of Elemental HERO Burstinatrix because we needed a boss-ass lady.  This doesn’t really add anything to deck, but I wanted one of the classics and she’s cool.  &nbsp;  The HERO Extra Deck has some regular Mask Change targets.  I’ve put in Dark Law, of course, as well as Blast, Acid and Dian.  Earth is fairly common here what with those Iron guys supporting the Princess, so Dian works out nice.  Elemental HERO Gaia also fits in that regard, along with the princess going towards Elemental HERO The Shining.  For good measure, we got Escuridao, Absolute Zero and Sunrise.  &nbsp;  But we aren’t done yet.  I wanted another breed of hero.  A hero that were famous for those lovely budget Halloween costumes back in the day.  The mighty morphin’ Power Rangers.  Why, as a young boy, I was also a Power Ranger.  Let’s stick in Super Quants to round this thing off.  Blue Layer is a pretty nice deck thinning engine, so I put him at 3.  Especially since we’re at 42 cards here in the Main.  Then let’s squeeze in 2 Green Layers, 1 Red Layer and 1 White Layer.  2 copies of Super Quantal Fairy Alphan too; I bet there are some Fairy outfits out there as well.  For the Extra Deck, we just enough room for 1 of each for Lusterrex, Magnaliger, Aeroboros and Grampulse, which appear to all be generic summons, so that’s nice.  Alphan should deal with any level disparity.  Then of course, the Link being Blaster Magna and their Xyz Boss Great Magnus.  Some of that Megazord action.  &nbsp;  To round the deck off at a somewhat clean 42, we need a costume for the adults.  All those certain nurse outfits, you know the one.  Injection Fairy Lily.  Hopefully you will enjoy seeing this build.  I know barely anything about how Super Quants work.  But I hope I’ve painted a more accurate view of the Halloween climate without any of those lame skeletons and sheet ghosts walking around."

But most Fiend archetypes are pretty weak in the current meta. Still, repeatedly looking at the best Fiends and Fiend related cards got me interested in Evil Eye. This is a going first stun deck, where the goal is to set up Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye and equip him with Evil Eye of Selene, but it does go a bit deeper than that. But if you aren't okay with just dropping Serziel and floodgates, this is not the deck for you.  1 Terraforming, 3 of the Field spell and 3 Serziel are must ofs, in every list for a reason. This is your main engine, your starter and boss monster all off of 1 card. I'm on 1 of each of the monsters - it basically doesn't come up where you want 2 of them, and the deck searches them out for the combos you use them in. Gorgon is necessary to the deck's grind game, since you can loop either the field spell or Evil Eye Defeat over and over to keep your game going, but she's useless turn 1 and easily searched out, so I'm fine with 1 of. Basilius enables a bunch of combos, but this deck isn't built to extend to the ""full"" board as often as possible, so because of the way the deck is built it is fine at 1, and I wouldn't go higher than 2. Catoblepas is also involved in some of the decks combos, basically these two cards are very useful for setting up Zerrziel plays, and are very useful combo pieces, but you aren't a combo deck, so 1 each is fine. 2 each of the equip spells is fine - I wouldn't run more or less. They're strictly combo pieces, and searchable ones, but they're also a core part of the deck's engine. You could run 3 Selene, but Goroneio's effect is one you often want to use twice in a game. 2 Retribution and 2 Defeat might seem odd if you're just looking at their value as interruption, but Retribution is really important game 2 and 3 for protecting your backrow, and Defeat loops are the best grindy thing the deck can do. 1 each of Reemergence and Awakening is lower than most builds, but the deck has a lot of reasons to prefer Serziel stun over Zerrziel turbo. However, having an option in the deck to play a slightly more ""combo"" game is really useful, and both cards have good utility, besides which I want half the deck to be Evil Eye cards that I can discard for Gorgoneio.  I felt like card advantage/hand sculpting was important to the deck, partially to ensure you see your Serziel, and partially to ensure you hit your floodgates. Since we aren't really using the extra deck, I'm running 3 Pot of Extravagence and 3 Pot of Duality. Extravagance has a chance of hitting an extra deck card you might want, but there's more than enough space to run 3 of each, and you barely need your extra deck, so it makes a lot of sense. Pot of Duality is one of those big factors away from the more comboish elements of the deck, but the card selection it grants is amazing, and it works incredibly well alongside Extravagance, and most of the time you don't even want to special summon anything anyways.  For floodgates I have 6 cards - 2 each of Rivalry of Warlords, There Can Be Only One, and Summon Limit. Rivalry of Warlords is the easiest of the floodgates for this deck to play under, but it also is the weakest in the meta at the moment. Nonetheless, it will cut off most decks from Halqifibrax/Auroradon/Linkross, and more importantly, it ""combos"" with There Can Be Only One to lock opponents into a single monster on the field at a time. There Can Be Only One is the best of these, and basically screws over all the best meta decks by itself.  Artifact Sanctum and a single Artifact Scythe are in the deck. Thanks to Serziel, the deck actually can pop it's own cards for value, albeit slowly, and they can also lock opponents out of the extra deck for a turn - basically, useful in both control match-ups and combo match-ups. In game 2 these should be Solemns. Gamma is the only hand trap in the main deck - you can add Imperm and Droll in game 2/3 going second, but we're really not built to go second, and if you need a hand-trap for going second right now, Gamma is probably your best option.  Go first in some game 1s, run into some combo match-ups, and you could theoretically do well with Evil Eye."

Nice Control,"After testing this deck (with a few adaptions and this final build - any advices on better cards are very welcome) for a few hours, I think this deck might be doing well against combo decks. (when going first obviously)  This deck has a few options to start with:  Invoked-Engine: Therefore you have a few starters, in total it is 7 (3 Meltdown, 1 Terraformin, 3 Aleister). Which lead you to a 4th summon Mechaba (wow, so creative lul). The good thing here is, if you have Parallel Exceed in your starting hand, you can easily get him after summoning Almiraj and going into a Rafflesia/Dweller and further go with building your board, where Mechaba is either your 6th or 7th (after the xyz summon) summon, which makes you get hit by Nibiru, except you go for Rafflesia 5th summon and are safe from Nibiru.  Salamangreat-Engine: The Salamangreat-Engine is rather secondary here, as it performs well with Almiraj if you have Gazelle in hand. With Gazelle you put Roar most of the times to the grave, unless you have extenders like Spinny or Fowl in order to get a relinked Sunlight Wolf to get Rage back to hand. Both works pretty fine. In order to have access to Gazelle you run 3 Minings as well as the 1 Salamangreat Circle, which means you basically have 5 Gazelles in hand.  Combined: In this deck you more or less run 7 Aleisters as well as 5 Gazelles. 1 Aleister and 1 Gazelle will lead you to an endboard of at least: Mechaba, Salamangreat Roar, Relinked Balelynx. Every futher extender can bring more cards to the board. 1 Parallel eXceed is Dweller/Rafflesia. Other Salamangreat extenders will help you building your board stronger like reincarnated Sunlight Wolf with Rage/Roar.  I think this deck makes a good impression."

I've come up with a combo no one else has seen (like I have in the past with my other decks). This combo uses the card <a data-name=""Torque Tune Gear"">Torque Tune Gear</a>. You guys are probably wondering what the heck is this card? Well its a light union tuner monster that is a <a data-name=""Union Driver"">Union Driver</a> target. Yes, thats right, it can be used for full Halifibrax combo. I've made <a data-name=""Union Hanger"">Union Hanger</a> and <a data-name=""Unauthorized Reactivation"">Unauthorized Reactivation</a> a one card full synchro combo. This deck always wants to go first, it can setup many negates with the full synchro combo everyone knows and probably hates at this point haha. It can also end in ABC Buster Dragon too. It just depends on your hand. The Mekk-Knights allow you to go second too but its an extending engine for the combos. Lastly, <a data-name=""Buster Blaster"">Buster Blaster</a> in the side deck is a spicy tech I have come up with that is pretty good in my opinion for going second with <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> as its also a Union Driver target. I have uploaded the combos to mediafire in two .yrpX files as you guys in the past have asked me to showcase the combos. This is how you can! Just go ahead and download the replays, drag them into your ProjectIgnis replays folder and run edopro and click replays and you should be able to watch the replays! Rest assured, mediafire is safe. It scans the files you are going to upload for viruses before it uploads them. I hope you guys enjoy and stick around because I have another awesome deck profile soon!  <a>http://www.mediafire.com/file/3ua37b7078hbkmz/ABC_Synchro_Turbo_1.yrpX/file</a>  <a>http://www.mediafire.com/file/5tucg9lgtmn1spc/ABC_Synchro_Turbo.yrpX/file</a>  ^^^  EDOpro combo replays"

Fellow Friends of the Forest.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">First off I'd like to thank everyone for checking out my deck, this is my first here so I’m sorry if the formatting is a little off. Before I talk about the list I'd just like to point everyone to some top-notch Melffy resources, Renren's article <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/melffy-combo-fibrax-and-the-friends-of-the-forest/""><span class=""s3"">(here)</span></a> and Lilith Saintclaire's Deck-list and Guide <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/melffys-to-the-future-deck-recipe-and-guide/""><span class=""s3"">(here).</span></a> These are the resources that got me into the archetype and honestly they form the backbone of this list, if you want to get into Melffy I can't recommend them enough. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>2. Deck-List and Tech Choices.</b></span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s4""><b>The Main-deck Melffy and their Forest Friends. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Melffy Puppy x 3.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This ratio is almost mandatory in any non-combo Melffy variant in my opinion. Its the Melffy you want see as a part of every end board with Forest, it summons your other Melffys or Kalantosa for pops, what more could you ask for? It's even searchable off Emerging Emergency Rescute Rescue due to its convenient stat line.  </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Melffy Catty x 3.</b> </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Catty is an interesting card and obviously you run at least 1. It's an omni-searcher for your entire deck and sets you up to make Herald on your opponent’s turn by searching Hop Ear Squadron, but it can feel bricky. I chose 3 for this deck due to expecting grind heavy meta match-ups; it's paid off for me but feel free to experiment with your own ratios. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Melffy Pony and Fenny x 1. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Pony and Fenny are the least useful main deck Melffys (next to Rabby, see below) but they can be surprisingly effective in niche hands. The main use for them is unclogging Kalantosas from the hand, and recycling Hop Ear Squadron and your other Melffy's from the grave. I play both at one to search with Catty or summon with Puppy but you can try more in your list.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Melffy Rabby x 0. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So originally I played a couple Rabby and its lagomorph comrade Rescue Rabbit. However, throughout my testing it kept bricking my hands even with Unexpected Dai at 3. I think there are better options for starters in the deck, especially the Fabled monsters (see next section) so I elected to remove Rabby. It's a shame, it's by far the cutest Melffy maindeck monster. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Rescue Cat x 3.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Rescue Cat pulls a lot of weight in this list, single-handedly summoning 2/3rd's of your extra deck without locking you into beast types. I always want to see it in my opener (ideally alongside other starters/extenders) but even on its own a Naturia Beast is nothing to sneeze at. I wouldn't recommend running less than 3 if you're opting for a tempo build, but combo varies so feel free to see what works for you. A final note on the Rescue archetype here, if you choose to run the Rabby+Rabbit package you will obviously get more out of the archetypal support Emerging Emergency Rescute Rescue (more on that below.) Although even without it, the ability to search Puppy and Cat was good enough in my testing.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Valerifawn, Peropero Cerperus, and Mine Mole x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">These are your turn 1 Naturia Beast setups with Rescue Cat; pick Mine Mole if you haven't drawn a Mellfy or Peropero for the surprise pop. Vallerifawn can be used to get to Halq for finishing games or sometimes Forest if you're desperate. I wouldn't mess with these ratios, although with an increased Fabled package you could try an extra Mine Mole for plusing off of Unicore on your turn with Chawa. (See the Fabled section for more on this.)</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Amazoness Pet Baby Tiger x 2.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Our first pure extender, Amazoness Baby Tiger is a fantastic discard off of your Fabled cards or Egotistical Ape, or a good follow-up add of of Catty. The most consistent way to get it in the grave is as a summon off of Rescue Cat or Obedience Schooled and then using it as XYZs or Link material. You can even run Amazoness Call to get it in your hand or grave over Rescute Rescue if you prefer something that’s always live. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Egotistical Ape x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Our second extender and an excellent un-bricker of hands, Egotistical Ape allows you to make Naturia Beast or Halq from nearly any hand that includes him. My normal discards are the aforementioned Baby Tiger or a lone Fabled Cerburrel depending on where you want to end, even Peropero Cerperus can be choice as it can make him level 2 for XYZs plays. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Danger! Bigfoot x 2. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Finally a monster with a respectable attack stat! Danger! Bigfoot allows the deck to swing above its normal weight class, either with his attack stat, effect, or his convenient level in conjunction with a Synchro enabler we'll talk about soon. Bigfoot raises the deck’s ceiling considerably and since he's searchable by Catty you'll rarely have a match without him. Your ratios may vary but I’ve found 2 works well. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Yokotuner x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">I'll be honest, Yokotuner is mostly here to clean up niche hands. I'm not going to expect to draw both my level 3s  and Obedience Schooled but if it happens then I have Yokotuner to still make Naturia Beast. Its also a target for Halq's effect in a pinch. It could easily be replaced with more Fabled support but this was the variant I went with.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Hop Ear Squadron x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Almost at the end of our Forest Friends we come to Hop Ear Squadron, the best target for Catty's search. It gets you a negate on your opponent’s turn in the form of Hop Ear plus any level 2 left on your board, ideally Kalantosa into Herald. If you're left with a Bigfoot on the field you can use Hop Ear to go into Leo Keeper of The Sacred Tree, who when combined with Borrelsword forms the most consistent OTK line my list has. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>The Fabled Nozoochee and Cerburrel x 2,1. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So finally we come to the Fabled package. Beyond just getting you into Forest in a pinch or going into Unicore off of Catty, I also like them as extenders to beef up your end boards. Sometimes that extra Hastorr or Sandayu proves too much for my opponent to out. If you would like to expand this package I recommend dropping the Rescute Rescue in favour of 3 Nozoochee and 3 Cerburrel alongside maybe a couple Chawa and a Ganashia, although those last 2 work better as starters for combo builds. I really enjoy playing the Fabled package so I recommend experimenting with this. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s4""><b>The Spells and...no just Spells. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Obedience Schooled x 3.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This is a tough one. On the one hand you want to include this for the tempo swing it provides as it starts almost any play you might be making going first or second. On the other hand, it locks you into beasts, which lowers the ceiling on your plays. Practise with the deck’s plays can help you get more out of this card. I play 3 in this build because I'm aiming to resolve it with Rescue Cat for an explosive end-board (more on this in the Combo Guide) but in more combo or control-oriented builds it didn't preform nearly as well in my testing. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Emerging Emergency Rescute Rescue x 3. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So I really like this one, it boosts the consistency of both your starter and of seeing Melffy Puppy due to a surprising (and I’m sure intentional) stat distribution. Since you want to see both of those cards all the time I consider this worth the 3 slots, that said its not always live. Due to the cost of your LP being lower there can be some awkward hands where it isn't quite usable, at least on turn 1. I run Upstart at 1 as an admittedly jank way to make it usable more often. That said, my latest testing has involved Verte Anaconda (more on this at the end) as a consistent way to lower life points so run whatever you prefer.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Melffy Tag x 2.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So Melffy Tag is pretty amazing, how many archetypes can boast a quick play Monster Reborn after all? It's searchable off of Forest for either extension or keeping key Melffys on the field. I find 3 to be unnecessary because of how searchable it is, 1 is doable but I miss the second copy in tempo builds specifically. Go with what works best for your needs.   </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Upstart Goblin x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So this was a rushed add the night before my last event. I only included it to make Rescute Rescue live more often going first. In all honesty this was a bad call, you very rarely draw it and Rescute Rescue in a hand where you actually need it to make a play. I've gone on to remove this in favour of more handtraps but feel free to experiment with this slot, its not essential to the deck. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Harpies Feather Duster x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Another rushed meta call days before the event, I was expecting more backrow-reliant decks but I didn't see that many. For a more synergistic option I'd recommend Twin Twisters for the discard, although in my current build I've opted for more copies of Forbidden Drop. This is a good slot for experimentation and meta-adjustment so experiment as you like.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Forbidden Droplet x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">I think Droplet fits well in this deck for a multitude of reasons: it provides more discard options for your Fabled Cerburrel and Amazoness Baby Tiger for follow up plays, it insulates your board against powerful effect monsters going second, and really helps against other tempo decks. In my last tournament this came in the form of several 2-0's against Plunder Patroll but in testing it holds up against other forms of ramp/tempo as well. Against more general decks I'd probably switch this for Triple Tactics Talent as it can win some match-ups on its own (more on this below).</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b>Handtraps and The Side. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So a short primer before I get into this section, I have included handtraps with the side due to my personal philosophy on siding and deck building in general. I prefer to use my side deck for anti-meta picks (often handtraps or equalizers) that I can cycle through for specific match-ups. That’s why I’ve lumped these together and because of this I’m not going to explain my picks for the side. You can use this space for whatever you like if you disagree, or you can try out my approach if you’d like. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Ghost Ogre and Snow Rabbit x 3. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This is my standard pick for main-deck hand traps in the current meta. I find its live more often than Gamma in game 1, and game 2 the loss of power compared to Gamma matters less. Often I will switch this for a more matchup-dependant option like Ash, Veiler, or Gamma, but that’s down to personal taste. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b>The Extra Deck.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Leo, Keeper of The Sacred Tree x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So our first extra deck monster is Leo, Keeper of the Sacred Tree, the second best Naturia synchro in the deck. He’s your largest body, the only Beast in the deck with over 3000 atk points he’s your answer to large threats that are vulnerable to battle. In-conjunction with Borrelsword Dragon he makes up the deck’s otk line, as a bonus he’s almost as hard to get rid of as Borrelsword in some circumstances. The most consistent line to make him involves Danger! Bigfoot with either Valerifawn on your turn or Hop Ear Squadron on your opponents turn.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Naturia Beast x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So here is the single most impactful card in the extra deck, next to Forest at least. Sometimes enough to win a game by itself, Naturia Beast is well suited to this archetype — perhaps more so than some of the Melffy extra deck monsters (Mommy is such a disappointment tbh).</span><span class=""s5""> </span><span class=""s1"">Aside from the obvious potential synergy of milling Tiger or the other discards, there’s also the fact that this build of Melffy really can’t otherwise contend with back-row decks or decks heavy on spell-based combo extension. Turning all of that off at almost no downside is very appealing.</span><span class=""s5"">  </span><span class=""s1"">s mentioned above in the section on Rescue Cat, your best way to get to Naturia Beast is Valerifawn plus Peropero/Mine Mole off of the aforementioned Rescue Cat. I like to use Peropero going first as often opponents will walk over Naturia Beast instead of wasting valuable removal.</span><span class=""s5"">  </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>The Fabled Unicore x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This one’s pretty funny, I can’t say I’d ever heard of it before I got into Melffy but it can be surprisingly powerful in some match-ups. It’s somewhat conditional due to your hand-size needing to match your opponents, but I’ve found its not that hard to maintain with the average hand (More on that in the combo guide). Sometimes it can even be made on top of a full board due to Nozoochee and Cerburrel not taking your normal summon, although don’t expect to draw both of them every hand. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Old Entity Hastorr x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">I wasn’t expecting to make Hastorr as often as I did, but it really came through against the influx of Towers in the meta. Obviously it’s better with a couple negates supporting it but I managed to stall out some games with just Hastorr and some well-timed draws. I find it’s best made with the Fabled package instead of Unicore, but you can also make it with a normal-summoned Valerifawn in a pinch. I mentioned adding Twin Twisters instead of Harpies earlier and if you were to do that you’d probably pull off Hastorr’s second effect with more consistency. Another option is using Hastorr to punish board wipes when summoned off of Hop Ear Squadron during your opponents turn.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Herald of the Arc light x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last few metas you’ll be incredibly familiar with this one. It’s a negate and a sort-of Macro Cosmos, and it’s the perfect level to be made off of Hop Ear plus a spent Kalantosa on your opponents turn. There isn’t really a reason not to play this and there aren’t any worthwhile alternatives that I’ve found, so get used to seeing this one. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Crumble Logos The Prophet of Demolition x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This was a pretty unspecific pick, the Rank 2 XYZs pool is interesting but somewhat light on Interaction so Crumble Logos was my pick among them. Forest is better in most cases, always going first and sometimes going second depending on your grave set-up and hand. You can’t summon him under Obedience Schooled but I mostly find myself summoning him on the crack-back so that really doesn’t matter as much (see Combo Guide for details). You could play most any other Rank 2 here if you wanted, for example Sky Cavalry Centaurea or Excited Melffys for Negalogia set-ups once it’s released. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Ronin Raccoon Sandayu x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">The Raccoon archetype is a good fit for Melffy Tempo, especially the boss monster. It can provide an out to anything without battle protection or another protected monster to draw out removal. It can easily be summoned off of Bujinki Ahashima to trigger its effect on your turn, and it’s a good out to a weak board post-handtrap. I play this one in all my Melffy decks because it’s just so versatile, I would really recommend the same unless you desperately need the slot. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Melffy of the Forest x 2.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Finally we arrive at Forest, the only Melffy XYZs currently worth playing, at least till Excited Mellfys comes to the TCG. (No one can make me play Mommy.) It searches any Melffy card on your turn, normally Puppy if you didn’t draw it or Tag if you want to extend a little more. On your opponent’s turn Forest is an incredibly disruptive card in this build as your opponent likely has no way of knowing what sort of interaction Forest will put up beyond the obvious effect negate. In my opinion Forest is the archetype’s best card and the center of my build, remove at your own risk. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Topologic Zeroboros x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So the Link monsters in this deck are mostly for toolboxing on your opponents turn using I:P Masquerana with any spent Melffys or Kalantosas. Zeroboros’s role in all this is to clear boards that none of our aforementioned interaction could stop. Zeroboros for it’s part is excellent removal, especially considering you can trigger it with a sacrificial Melffy during the end phase of your turn in a pinch. There are other options for this slot, and all the other Masq targets, but that’s format-dependant so I’ll leave that to your judgment. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Borrelsword Dragon x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Borrelsword is a large, indestructible threat that you ideally drop on your opponent’s turn to finish them on the crack-back. Alternatively, you can make it on your turn through use of Halq and Valerifawn or Yokotuner on your turn for a swift OTK. If you feel more inclined to push for swift lethal on your turn you could swap this out for Accesscode Talker or even Decode Talker if you’re on a tight budget. I’ve experimented with running Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax as an option for protecting boards and it works well but limits your OTK options. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Knightmare Unicorn x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">If you are seeing a pattern then yes, Unicorn is the last Masquerana target. It is good direct non-destructive removal, as ideally you’re going to be plusing off of its effect (See Combo Guide). The other Knightmares can be valuable if you can find the space for them. I have a dedicated build for that and some neat tech in the works, so we’ll see how the larger Knightmare suite works out. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Bujinki Ahashima x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This is my favourite tech in the extra, it’s such a powerful addition to certain boards and such a good fit for the archetype aside from its inconvenient typing. I’ll go over more of the combos below but you’re looking to use Ahashima at the start of the game to put up itself, Forest, and a Melffy, ideally Puppy for the disruption. This leaves you with a pop (assuming Puppy), an effect negate, and a spell or trap pop; decent for a board that most hands can make. This slot could always be used for Fire Fighting Daruma Doll or Missus Radiant if you’re so inclined but I prefer this. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Crystron Halqifibrax x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Welcome to the 2020 meta: Halqifibrax is absolutely everywhere, even the forest. We play him here as an OTK enabler with either Valifawn or Yokotuner on your turn into the link 4 of your choice. There are as many options here as there are Synchro builds so go wild or check out Renren’s article I linked at the top.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>I:P Masquerana x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">I’ve already mentioned at length the use of Masquerana but I’ll go over it in full here. If you have 2 monsters spare after any of your primary lines, Masquerana is an excellent way to generate more interaction and make your Link 4 of choice nigh unstoppable. In the tighter extra decks of combo Melffy I’ve experimented with using Artifact Dagda instead for the Scythe lock, and you could definitely try that in this build once the extra deck gets tighter (see Future Thoughts). </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>3. ""Combo"" Guide and Tips</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So now we arrive at the strategy section of this decklist. If the quotation marks didn’t give it away there’s not exactly a lot of combos here, so instead I’m going to go over 5 opening hands and what you can make with them by the end of turn 1. I will also include some stats for the 5 openings to hopefully give you some idea as to what the deck can do on average, as well as suggestions for follow up plays. I will try to add replays in future but I hope this suffices for now. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Disclaimer: My math may not be accurate to the exact percentile, I’d allow for a couple percent either side to be safe if that degree of accuracy matters to you. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b>1. Rescue Cat + Obedience Schooled + Normal Summon Lv 2. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">I decided to start with the optimal opening hand, or at least some version of it. You have a <b>15% </b>of opening this hand, assuming Rescute Rescue is live (It’s <b>9%</b> if not). From this position my normal end board looks like Forest plus Puppy, Naturia Beast with Peropero in the grave, and Ronin Raccoon with a 2300 attack token. The way you get to this is up to you; I prefer to resolve Obedience Schooled first to bait any Ash Blossom or other hand traps. The result of this is 3 level 2 Monsters, your pick but I normally go to: Baby Tiger, Nozoochee, and a Melffy. You go into Forest and Sandayu with these plus your normal summon; I would advize getting the Melffy and Baby Tiger in the grave for a clean follow-up play. Next play Rescue Cat into Naturia Beast, using your choice of Peropero or Mine Mole depending on what you need. From there a lot of it depends on how your opponents turn plays out; if you can end on Naturia Beast the game is likely over. If not, your best bet is either Halq or Masq into Borrelsword depending on their end board. Sandayu is capable of taking care of a lot of non-Towers threats once it’s on the board so I tend to lean on that to clean up.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b>2. Obedience Schooled + Amazoness Baby Tiger. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So this hand isn’t super likely in this build coming in at <b>7% </b>but I wanted to mention it as it leaves you with more cards in hand than most of the hands I’m going over. The end board for this is very similar to the one above except without Naturia Beast: a Forest plus Puppy and Sandayu with protection. The route to this board starts with Schooled for the second Baby Tiger (Remember to special the first from your hand with its effect) and two level 2 monsters. I like Melffy Pony and a Nozoochee here normally. From there we XYZs summon Forest with the Melffy plus any of the other level 2s, activating it’s effect for Puppy if you didn’t draw it, and finally summoning Sandayu with the remaining monsters. This leaves you with a pop and effect negate plus an indestructible Sandayu providing you have a beast. Some decks can be stopped by just the pop and negate but I wouldn’t expect it to stop meta. This normally leaves you with Sandayu to clean up the board and a spent Kalantosa. As mentioned above I like using Sandayu to resolve non-Towers boards and then link it plus either the Kalantosa or your normal summon (if you have one) into Masquerana for a follow up play plus your returning Puppy. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b>3. The Fabled Cerburrel and Nozoochee + a Melffy. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This hand is a pretty rare draw at <b>10% </b>but I wanted to go over it to give you an idea of how these cards can be used alongside other boards as you draw into them. The end board this hand produces leaves you with The Fabled Unicore and a Melffy, ideally Puppy or Catty for the pop or negate they provide. The reason this board composition work is because due to Melffys’ special summoning/returning to the hand gimmick you can manipulate your hand size with minimal difficulty. This can be good to bait your opponent into inoptimal lines, and as long as you can get to Catty and Rescue Cat you can follow up with nearly any monster in the extra. As above Masq is an excellent follow up with spare Kalantosas or any Melffys, although for board breaking I like Ahashima into Sandayu for a backrow pop into a token to run over anything your opponent managed to summon.</span><span class=""s5"">  </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b>4. Catty + Bigfoot. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Another two-card combo but this one shows up a bit more often at <b>10%</b>, especially as the game progresses due to the pieces being highly searchable off of Forest and Catty itself. The play requires you to resolve Bigfoot first so there is always the risk that you discard Catty, but fortunately you’re much more likely to hit one of the deck’s many discards. Once you have Bigfoot on the field and providing you summon Catty at the end of the turn, you can search Hop Ear and use its effect with Bigfoot to summon Leo Keeper of the Sacred Tree. This can be a rough one to out due to its odd protection effect and high attack value so I recommend combining it with other interaction to seal out the game. My normal follow up is using Halq to climb into Borrelsword with a bounce on the way to clear up any threats. Normally this closes out the game but I’d recommend managing your resources for follow-up plays. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b> 5. Any Melffy + Any Lv 2 Normal Summon. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Finally I thought I’d go over a less-than-ideal opening hand, and at <b>48% </b> chance<b> </b>to show up you’re likely to see this one a lot. It’s important to mention that this will most likely show up with some of the other hands mentioned above: it has a <b>25%</b> to show up with 1 of your 2 main starters. This will obviously change how you resolve the hand but I figured I’d mention how best to resolve these pieces alone, as a lot of it carries over to maintaining tempo in-conjunction</span><span class=""s5"">  </span><span class=""s1"">ith other hands mentioned above. There’s no ideal 2 cards to see here, obviously it’s better to see Puppy or Catty with Tiger but I’ve made this hand work with Pony and Kalantosa. To start you’ll want to set whatever your normal is, unless your Melffy is Catty in which case you may want to normal it for a Hop Ear play on your opponents turn. Once you’ve summoned or set and resolved any useble spells, you want to end turn and special your Melffy. Depending on what Melffy you have you hopefully have 1 pop/negate on your opponent’s turn, likely leaving you with a spent Kalantosa plus whatever you set or potentially a Herald or Hastorr. If you’re left with even one level 2 on the board you’re probably still in it; my advice for a follow up would be to get into Forest or Naturia Beast as fast as possible. Both of these options will put up more disruption and hopefully let you stall out your opponent’s win condition long enough for you to out-tempo them.</span><span class=""s5"">  </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>4. Future Options and Last Thoughts. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">At last we come to the end of this guide! I’d like to thank anyone who read the whole thing. I hope its been helpful and if you weren’t already into Melffy as a tempo deck I hope you’ll give it a try. I built this deck to enter into YCS 9 (See MBT’s channel for more on that <a><span class=""s6"">here</span></a>) and although I didn’t make anything close to top cut, I was still impressed with its performance. I’d like to take a minute to go over some of my thoughts as to the future of the deck, along with some of the cards I’m excited to test when they release later this year.</span><span class=""s5"">  </span><span class=""s1"">irst among those cards is obviously Excited Melffys: from setting up Negalogia AA-Zeus on your turn with its direct-attacking effect to recycling any Kalantosa from the grave for more pops on your opponent’s turn, it’s an amazing addition to the archetype. Since I mentioned it already Negalogia is also a very welcome addition with its Rainbow Neos-esque board wipe, and there are even some interesting synergies with its ability to add material from almost anywhere. I will definitely be adding this one come November. I’d also like to go over Number F0: Utopic Future Dragon and its currently released summoning aide Number F0: Utopic Future. I did consider putting Future in this build but without Future Dragon it lacks a lot of the utility for such high investment. Once Dragon comes out it will likely become my go-to follow-up play as it packs protection, a beefy attack stat and a negate that steals your opponent’s monsters. Common outs like Knightmare Unicorn will fizzle to the negate before being stolen for a swift OTK with Borrelsword, I’d keep an eye on this one especially. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Thanks again for reading, I intend to continue to play Melffy and will put out more guides as I test and refine my list so watch this space.

Here's the guide below, and a TL;DR at the bottom; Credit goes to Lifedeather for his great article and deck build, both of which were a good help in making this. Please read his article after this deck. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/forgotten-archetypes-armed-dragon/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/forgotten-archetypes-armed-dragon/</a> </span><span>Now, onto the deck guide! </span><span>I included many general use cards to help support the Armed Thunder Dragons, as to be honest, they're a frail bit frail. We have Raigeki, Monster Reborn, Pankratops, Instant Fusion, Evenly Matched, Ghost Ogre, Ash Blossom, and four Solemns. Raigeki can be a good board clearing tool for an OTK, Monster Reborn can bring back your monsters, Instant Fusion brings out Relinquished to steal an opponent's monster, Evenly Matched can clear a ton of the board, and the rest are negates. </span><span>I also included, when it comes to more useful dragons, the Keeper of the Shrine, and Koa'ki Meiru Drago. Since Level monsters leave the field when they Level up, Keeper is a free special summon when they Level up. Drago fully locks down Dark and Light decks, the two most common attributes right now. </span><span>Now, onto the main attraction, the Armed Thunder Dragons. The Armed Thunder Dragons Level themselves up, leaving the field and summoning their higher counterpart from the deck. All levels before 10 aren't very notable, just serving to get to 10. Meanwhile, 10 has an odd effect, referencing one of Chazz's lines i'm pretty sure. Anyway, it gains effects as it gains attack. The first few don't really matter, but the last two are quite important. His first important one allows you to send a card from your hand to the GY to destroy a card on the field, then Level 10 gains 1000 attack. Quite nice. His final one is unlocked when he's at 10,000 attack, and it's a dark hole and harpie's feather duster combined. 10,000 is very hard to get to, though, so I don't reccomend trying it. Meanwhile, there's also Armed Dragon Level 10 White. White doesn't actually have any monsters that level into him, instead just special summoning himself by banishing armed dragons from your graveyard who's level equal 10. While he's on the field, you take no effect damage, and when he attacks, you can pop another card your opponent controls. He's also quite nice. We also have the backrow support. Armed Dragon Blitz special summons a copy of one of your Level monsters from the deck, which is quite nice when used on level 10, as it can get you into an OTK range. Flash just special summons a Level 3, which is nice for starting off the Level climbing if there's none in your hand at the current moment, and freeing up your normal summon. Note: You'll want to go second for this, but going first isn't super bad. This is also an OTK based deck.</span>"

I have some new projects in mind, but until I can make them, I present to you my second build of Convulsion Mine for October of 2020!  <span>The Strategy:  </span></strong>I've gone over the main method by which this build of Mystic Mine works so I'll keep it brief here. In essence, you want to use Convulsion of Nature so you can roleplay as Edward Snowden and know what your opponent has on the top deck at all times and using cards like Mind Crush to make them discard any cards that might give them an advantage, all while using cards like Archfiend's Oath to keep a consistent hand by declaring the top card's name and adding to your hand for 500 LP per activation. You can only use Oath once unless you have activate another copy of it. On a good day, this means that you can get anywhere from 3 to 5 cards in your hand per turn, 3 if you use Duality and two Oath's and 5 if you use Extravagance and two Oath's (Oath does not conflict with Extravagance as it does not draw.) To ensure our opponent bricks when we start to run out of ways to make them discard, we run 3 Goddess Skuld's Oracle; a card which may as well have Jeff Leonard's face on it at this point. It is a continuous Spell with an effect for Valkyries that we don't care about. What's more important is the activated ability of it which allows for us to re-arrange the top 3 cards of our opponents deck. With Convulsion, we can activate Skuld when we see our opponent is about to draw their get-out-jail-free card and put it on the bottom giving us 2 more turns of breathing room and our opponent 2 more turns of seething rage.  <span><strong>The Win Condition:   </strong></span>The win condition of this deck, believe it or not, is only partially fulfilled by Convulsion. Instead, we're doing it the old fashioned way by using Wave-Motion Cannon, Cauldron of the Old Man, and Final Countdown to win the game. Wave-Motion Cannon is even more potent game 1 due to a decrease in removal as is Cauldron of the Old Man. Final Countdown is a card that you can remove if you want to, I like to have it as an insurance policy of sorts (though many players online don't have the patience for 20 turns.) While the Wave-Motion Cannon has our opponents in it's sights, our Cauldron is putting in some work by refilling our LP so we can keep using Oath as well as burning the opponent, giving them less time for answers by allowing us to resolve Wave-Motion early.  <span><strong>Card Choices:  </strong></span>The new additions for this deck are of course Wave-Motion Cannon and Cauldron of the Old man as suggested by users combofan and LordObamaHimself. As well as Elder Entity N'tss to surprise any Dogmatika platers. Other than that, it's a pretty standard affair apart from the cards that make Convulsion work (Mind Crush, Drastic Drop Off, Prohibition, etc.) Change the build as you see fit.  As always, suggestions and feedback are always welcome in the comments below"

Some of you might be thinking ""Why did you pick these two archetypes because that isn't even what Halloween is about."" Allow me to explain my reasoning. Halloween used to be called ""All Hallows' Eve"" and Christians used this to mourn about people in the afterlife, Ringing bells for the people in Purgatory, and wearing something like a mask so if someone in the afterlife wanted to kill your they couldn't figure out who you were. When we go trick or treating now it was actually because most Christians refused to eat meat until November 3 so they would bake Soul Cakes to hand out to other people and poor children would go from house to house and get a Soul Cake in exchange for praying for someone in the afterlife. The Jack O'Lantern was originally a turnip, they symbolized the souls of the dead, were originally called Soul Lights and people use it to guide lost souls back to their family while also using them to keep Demons away from their houses and family. Some people left bowls of milk and a large meal on their loved one's grave or their stairs while other baked pastries were known as ""Bones of the holy"" to give to the lost ones. People light tindle fires and all-night vigil bonfires as a way to pray for the dead."

I really love how well these two engines go together. I saw other people's builds, but felt that it was lacking some things. Obviously, going first you want to make Zexal, using Numeron Network to special the number boys, then overlay. If you have hidden city, or terraforming to search it, and you don't get ash'd or negated, then even better. Set your guru, use hidden city to flip, then search. After this there's a couple options. I main deck 3 solemn strikes, because on the next turn, when I activate Zexal's effect, they have the chance to respond with gamma, ghost ogre, etc. So paying 1500 to negate that is easy. Also ash can stop gamma. If I don't have one of those, then I will search for fiendess in the first turn, because she's an omni negate if I control another subterror. I also side solemn judgment, because sometimes infinite impermanence will stop Zexal.  From there you just begin setting up your board. This deck is filled with hand traps of course. And each subterror monster has different effects. I run a playset of Pot of Extrav, either to use as ash bait, or if I didn't have the best drawing hand. You also need numeron wall, he's another good way to search the numeron network, or also serves as ash bait. I run 2 numeron calling's, because sometimes the 2nd one is necessary, in those pinches. As for subterror cave clash, not everyone runs it, but I think its a great card, because it lets you use subterror guru's quick effect, since you control another subterror card. Also when you do battle damage, you can grab your fiendess from the grave, and just keep recycling it. And of course subterror final battle is a super broken card, doesn't get sent to grave after being used, and 4 different effects, depending on the scenario. Lastly, this deck can easily go turn 2. You use numeron network to bring out all 4 numeron boys, and each time you attack, their attack doubles (they aren't required to detach to activate effect because of numeron network's effect). So you just climb your way up, and either beat over their big monster, or attack for game. And then if your opponent is still alive then you overlay for Zexal and back to square one."

Formatted for October 2020,"<strong>Hello, you poults! Since their announcement and subsequent release on simulators, Tribrigade have managed to capture the imagination of many players as they offer a great deal of support to decks that match their three types (Beast, Beast-Warrior and Winged-Beast.) While many players are finding new way to play Zoodiacs (sigh) I decided to take it upon myself to try and bring back an archetype that has been gathering dust for years; everyone's favorite helmet deck Bujins!  </strong><span><strong>The Strategy</strong></span> This particular build of Bujin is not exactly Yamato sitting on Kaiser Colloseum, but rather uses Tribrigades to banish Bujingi monsters as well as others to make Link plays and create big boards. With the exception of Ash Blossom and Honest, everything in this deck is a Beast, Beast-Warrior or Winged-Beast which gives the Tribrigades plenty of fuel to make plays. If it does go wrong, the Bujingi monsters can stay in the Graveyard and buy you a few turns. The key Rank 4s in this deck include Bujintei Amaterasu and Bujintei Kagutsuchi, the former brings back your banished Level 4s to make more plays whereas the latter mills 5 off the top of your deck allowing you to get started with your Link plays. The deck also runs Droplet to buy us time as well as fueling the Graveyard further as well as Pot of Acquisitiveness for some recursion.  This list is very experimental and I'm not used to playing combo decks so unfortunately I can't make a sample combo list for you. As always, feedback and suggestions are wholly welcome in the comments below!  Stay fresh, YGOPRODECK! :) <span><strong>  </strong></span>"

Naturia has always been one of my favorite archetypes, however Konami doesn't seem to share my love of them. The last time they received any direct support was in The New Challengers all the way back in 2014. However, with the release of the new Rose cards, the archetype not only receives a consistency boost but is also able to more consistently perform it's most powerful play: Shoot Lock  </strong><span><strong>What Do The Archetypes Do?  </strong></span>Naturia is a stun deck, for the most part. It's a strange diversion from the usual combo-based strategies that their types (Plant and Insect) would normally imply. They are designed to control the match by having trigger-lick effects that activate whenever the opponent does something. Cosmobeet for example can Special Summon itself whenever the opponent Normal Summons a Monster. However, this strategy is only concerned with two Naturia monsters: Naturia Bamboo Shoot and Naturia Beast. With this build, it's entirely possible to Tribute Summon for Bamboo Shoot, if that fails we can Link or Synchro away the Naturia Monsters using the Rose Monsters we have in this build.  Rose is an archetype used by Akiza Izinski in the Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds manga and anime. Her Signer Dragon, Black Rose Dragon has been a staple of competitive play up until very recently as it is one of the few legal cards that can reset the board state. The Rose archetype consists of a variety of Plant monsters to aid in Synchro Summoning the dragon. The most consistent way to do this is to use Red Rose Dragon and White Rose Dragon. White Rose can Special Summon Red Rose and both give us effects when they are used as Synchro Material. With the new Field Spell White Rose Cloister, we can consistently pump out Synchro's and Links each and every turn!  <strong><span>Shoot Lock</span>  </strong>There is a reason why I chose to include Naturia monsters in this particular deck, and that is because of the strength of Shoot Lock, which can be set up as early as turn 1 with the right hand in this Deck. When Bamboo Shoot is Tribute Summoned using a Naturia monster, your opponent cannot activate Spells and Traps. Period. It's a one-sided Cold Wave that can severely disrupt or outright eliminate the opponent from the game. To protect Naturia Bamboo Shoot, I have included Safe Zone, a Continous Trap Card that makes it so Bamboo Shoot cannot be targeted or destroyed by card effects nor can it be destroyed by battle. This strategy also cannot be stopped by Spell/Trap removal since Bamboo Shoot prevents the activation of such cards. It can be Kaiju'd over, so a Side Deck is advised in order to remove the Shoot Lock components to better counter your opponent.  <span><strong>The Strategy  </strong></span>You'll want to open up preferable with White Rose Cloister and the means to set up the Shoot Lock going first in game 1, this will shut down many strategies that require Spell Cards (Invoked, Shaddoll, etc.) While your opponent is sat twiddling their own thumbs, use the Rose monsters and begin building a Synchro and Link board to OTK your opponent. You'll want to make Black Rose Dragon or Black Rose Moonlight Dragon as early as possible. <strong>DO NOT ACTIVATE THE EFFECT OF BLACK ROSE DRAGON IF YOU HAVE SHOOT LOCK SET UP! </strong> Instead, just make as many big Synchro's as you can! We also run Red Eyes Dark Dragoon because of course we do.  As always, feedback and suggestions are welcome in the comments below!  Stay fresh! :)"

Using Avramax and Quantum will make the opponent unable to select a target to attack. Add the summon of Avramax using I:P, and now it cannot be destroyed by card effects. With the Addition of Gatchiri on board (Protects EACH cyberse monster from 1 card destruction per turn), or in sent from field to grave (Target 1 monster you control and it is unaffected by opponents card effects until the end of opponents turn), it gives the board extra resistance. Optimally the end board would be: A) Avramax + Quantum + Gatchiri + I:P + Light Dragon/ I:P +Gatchiri Make Fire Phoenix to protect another piece using Gatchiri. B) Avramax/ Summoned using I:P + Quantum + Light Dragon +Gatchiri. In this option you can also use Gatchiri in the summon of Avramax to protect your Quantum or Light Dragon for the turn.  Going Second; my goal with this deck now changes to board wiping. It has multiple tools to remove cards like Wind Pegasus, Light Dragon, Accesscode Talker and Earth Golem. There are also means of causing effect damage using Fire Phoenix and Gussari. Beatsticks can be Gussari, Avramax, Quantum, Arrival and Accesscode Talker. The end boards can go many different ways because of the various abilities you have at your disposal to remove various cards. The main thing to know going second are your methods to building up. Once you get to Dark Templar whatever you have created just fuels the board. Its getting to Dark Templar that is the most effort. Fighting through negations is tough now with Called By The Grave @1. To compensate, recognize the interactions between Balancer Lord and Cynet Mining. Balancer Lord gets you a special summon from hand upon banishment whilst Backdoor will banish and add to your hand a card with lower attack than the card you banished. If BL is your target, you can add anything in your deck to your hand except for Gussari and Parallel Exceed. This interaction is easy to get any starter/extender to your hand/field whilst also dodging a baited Infinite Impermanence/Effect Veiler. As for the lack of hand traps, this deck does need its extenders to play comfortably. However, I have been considering to drop Gussari and make it a 43 card deck with 3x Sauravis/Effect Veilers (Or rather space for hand traps in general). Something will need to change once Called By The Grave is banned however because Forbidden Droplet and Crossout Designator do not fit too well in this profile.  If there are any @Ignister Duelists out there that have tips for their hand trap choices please lmk! Recommendations are also appreciated!  Also, I didn't speak much on the Side Deck because it really does depend on whatever the venue is and what the most popular decks are at the time :)"

Your primary goal is to get 2 monsters on turn 1 and then link into Isolde grabbing Honest Neos, then binning Phoenix Blade to bring out Disk Commander and linking again into Anaconda for Fusion Destiny. You can also mix it up with Cross-Sheep, Mask Change, etc.  <strong>D-Hero package</strong>:  Plasma - Mainly a target for D-Draw, but his ability comes in handy and he's quite easy to summon in this deck.  Malicious - Your staple D-Hero. Enables all your strongest plays.  Celestial - Mainly fodder for D-Draw and Fusion Destiny, but you will be very thankful when you need either of his effects.  Drilldark - A great enabler for link summons.  Drawhand - A reasonable combo with Mask Change. You can chain Mask Change to his summon ability to swap into Dark Law and make your opponent banish a random card. You can also summon him off of Dominance getting merc'd at EOT from Fusion Destiny to get the card draw before your opponent. Lots of tricks with this fella, don't underestimate him.  Disk Commander - A level 1 to retrieve with Isolde and a great target for Cross-Sheep and Dominance.  Dark Angel - A backup level 1 for Isolde with a reasonable ability out of the grave. Pair him with Allure, D-Draw, or Drawhand to retrieve your card immediately.  <strong>The rest</strong>:  Honest Neos - Your best Isolde target since you don't need to play him to use him and he helps protect Dark Law.  Stratos - We use his S/T clear effect almost as much as his recruit effect in here, surprisingly. Often our best Cross-Sheep target if Disco isn't available.  Shadow Mist - Turns Foolish into a recruit and turns A Hero Lives into a copy of Mask Change. Also pitches to Allure. A fine role-players. It's just too bad it's not a D-Hero.  Spell Striker - An oft-forgotten tech from days passed, this little guy is great as a ROTA target to help build your link summons.  Ash Blossom - Best hand trap.  PSZ - We don't play synchros, but he still fills an important role by putting things back into the deck (*cough* Malicious *cough*) and by enabling an easy link or Plasma.  <strong>Spells</strong>:  Allure &amp; D-Draw - Our filter. Staple cards and one of the best reasons to run the D-Hero package. Just try not to get your D-Draw Ash'd!  A Hero Lives - Excellent enabler for the deck, grabbing either Stratos for a recruit or Shadow Mist for Mask Change, and then allowing a normal summon follow up into a link.  Fusion Destiny - Our primary Predeplant target.  Pot of Avarice - The deck fills it's GY so fast that I'd be hard-pressed not to include this. One of the more frequent Dark Angel targets.  Mask Change - Insane synergy with the deck. Dark Law is an absurd card and having access to it is one of this decks biggest strengths. Also combos with Cross-Sheep.  Mask Change II - I wanted more Mask Change!  Super Poly - Great Predeplant target and also enables more fusion for us.  Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade - The best Isolde target since you can rebuy it to get a free card! Also our primary enabler for Dystopia. Linking Isolde into Anaconda for Dystopia is a great way to swing board advantage in your favor.  ROTA, Foolish, Reborn, Impert - Staples.  <strong>Extra deck</strong>:  Dominance - Our primary target for Fusion Destiny. Lets us set up our GY heavily and mess with what our opponent draws, as well as giving us an insane board presence to OTK with after he dies.  Dystopia - A backup Fusion Destiny target and a frequent Super Poly target.  Dangerous - Tertiary fusion target. More of an enabler than a closer.  Dark Law - The GOAT  Divine Wind - Gives us a Mask target for Stratos, and a pretty good card in it's own right.  Anki - Masked Change II target for Malicious and Dark Law, plus a good closer (especially with Honest Neos!)  Fusion Dragon &amp; Mud Dragon - Super Poly enablers.  Borrelsword - OTK machine.  Cerberus - Utility slot, can be whatever you like.  Cross Crusader - Rarely needed, but extremely useful for getting your weaker hands off the ground.

So what if we'll build a deck that focuses on kaiju's strong point and enforcing it's weak point with control cards. At first glance this deck does not look like it will be able to compete with today's meta, but trust me it'll surely make your opponent be scared of setting up his board since it will just get destroyed. Most of the cards in this deck are power cards, as it can change the pace of the game with just one card, what more if you'll play multiple copies of it?  This deck doesn't really have a combo and from the look of the card you'll know what it can do. So in order to utilize it more you need to study your opponent's deck in advance, that way. As you can see this can go either first or second turn depending on your opponent, but most of the time you'll want to go 1st to maximize i<em>nspector boarder</em>.  Side Deck Cards Purposes: <ul>  	<li><em>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</em> - Pretty good to side against combo decks like HERO, Infernoble, etc.</li>  	<li><em>Harpie's Feather Duster</em> - use this against backrow decks then they'll concede.</li>  	<li><em>Twin Twister</em> - same with the <em>harpie's feather duster</em> but they'll still continue the game.</li>  	<li><em>Mystic Mine</em> - Good for stopping your opponent while you gather resources.</li>  	<li><em>Super Polymerization</em> - OP board breaker!!!!</li>  	<li><em>Dimensional Barrier</em> - Probably the most OP side as of now, can literally make your opponent not play in their turn.</li>  	<li><em>Imperial Order</em> - Good against spell reliant decks like sky striker, HERO, etc.</li>  	<li><em>Soul Drain</em> - Since GY reliant deck is still a thing, use this so they can't play.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Things to remember: <ul>  	<li>I know <em>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</em> is a thing but with this deck, it's just an another monster to be tributed.</li>  	<li>Don't force to end the game quickly if you don't have enough resources, remember this a control deck.</li>  	<li>Use <em>fairy tail luna</em>'s effect on your opponent's one of monsters (monsters that only have one copy in their deck/extra deck)</li>  	<li>ALWAYS CHECK YOUR RESOURCES</li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

""Gogogos"" as a deck strategy are somewhat rare nowadays, since they are simply included into ""Onomato"" decks in small numbers most of the time. To make the deck running more efficiently, I added quite a few other archetypes to the mix, making this more of a ""Gogogo and Friends"" list. The ""Gogogos"" aim, just like the rest of the ""Onomato""-related archetypes, to bring out Xyz monsters and work with their effects and often use the ""Utopia"" cards as their boss monster or game ending options.</p> <p>In terms of classic ""Gogogo"" cards, I run one ""<a data-name=""Gogogo Goram"">Gogogo Goram</a>"" (solid beater and a slow ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" in monster form), one ""<a data-name=""Gogogo Giant"">Gogogo Giant</a>"" (revives ""Gogogo"" monsters upon being Normal Summoned), one ""<a data-name=""Gogogo Gigas"">Gogogo Gigas</a>"" (self-reviving monster options which does cost your Battle Phase and is therefore most useful going first), two ""<a data-name=""Gogogo Aristera &amp; Dexia"">Gogogo Aristera &amp; Dexia</a>"" (defensive option with an effect that can potentially take care of big beaters on the opposing board) and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gogogo Golem - Golden Form"">Gogogo Golem - Golden Form</a>"" (potentially sizeable stat block with in-built monster effect negation). There are also quite a few ""Onomato"" cards in the deck which are very helpful in terms of consistency and monster swarming. Those options are two ""<a data-name=""Dodododwarf Gogogoglove"">Dodododwarf Gogogoglove</a>"", two ""<a data-name=""Utopic Onomatopoeia"">Utopic Onomatopoeia</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Zubababancho Gagagacoat"">Zubababancho Gagagacoat</a>"", which all have various effects allowing Special summoning from the hand or reviving either themselves or other monsters from the graveyard and therefore fetch a lot of usable monsters for Xyz summons. The three copies of ""<a data-name=""Onomatopaira"">Onomatopaira</a>"" not only help setting up the graveyard but also fetch the right combination of cards, while I also added one copy of ""<a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>"" for the sole reason of searching for either ""<a data-name=""Utopic Onomatopoeia"">Utopic Onomatopoeia</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Zubababancho Gagagacoat"">Zubababancho Gagagacoat</a>"".</p> <p>Other archetype that are part of the deck include a small ""Koa'ki Meiru"" engine, with mainly ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Supplier"">Koa'ki Meiru Supplier</a>"" as a solid Special summon since it triggers upon losing any Rock monster, while one copy of ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Overload"">Koa'ki Meiru Overload</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Guardian"">Koa'ki Meiru Guardian</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Wall"">Koa'ki Meiru Wall</a>"" serve as disruption and can be easily summoned with ""<a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a>"". The added ""<a data-name=""Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"" can give destruction protection to your ""Koa'ki Meiru"" monsters, but they are mostly there to fetch copies of ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Supplier"">Koa'ki Meiru Supplier</a>"" for the summon effect (which in turn also searches ""Koa'ki Meiru"" monsters). Aside from that I decided to run a small and inexpensive ""Adamancipator"" engine, with two copies each of ""<a data-name=""Adamancipator Analyzer"">Adamancipator Analyzer</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Adamancipator Seeker"">Adamancipator Seeker</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a>"", which further help accrue Xyz-able monsters onto the field.</p> <p>The rest of the Main Deck really only features more support cards to make the deck run a little smoother. One copy of both ""<a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Drought"">Barrier Statue of the Drought</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"">Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</a>"" are good targets to summon via ""<a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a>"" when going first and are also solid options to search and go into via your Normal Summon, since there are situation in which the Special summon block will hurt the opponent more than you. ""<a data-name=""Doki Doki"">Doki Doki</a>"" is there as setup and as a play-enabler, ""<a data-name=""Block Golem"">Block Golem</a>"" is more of a niche option, but will transfer itself into exactly enough materials to start a Xyz summon and ""<a data-name=""Sentry Soldier of Stone"">Sentry Soldier of Stone</a>"" can revive itself with relative ease, but can only be used for Link summons due to its level. One copy of both ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>"" seemed pretty much mandatory to me in the deck and are options you can play if the removal cards in the Extra Deck cannot be used. ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" is more graveyard setup while ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" is the obvious choice in terms of monster revival.</p> <p>The Extra Deck features a number of options to work with and is the main focus of the deck. ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" is solid backrow removal, ""<a data-name=""Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" is non-destruction removal, ""<a data-name=""Diagusto Emeral"">Diagusto Emeral</a>"" is a card draw option and ""<a data-name=""Gagaga Cowboy"">Gagaga Cowboy</a>"" can be used to inflict the last tick of damage. The aforementioned ""Utopia"" engine comes in form of two copies of ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a>"", which can be used to summon either ""<a data-name=""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"">Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</a>"" (for a 5000 ATK beater against monsters) or ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a>"" (for a 10000 ATK beater with the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a>"" in the main deck, but which I only included once due to consistency reasons for the rest of the deck). So far, there is nothing out of the ordinary and most players probably already knew of those cards prior to reading this section. ""<a data-name=""Number 55: Gogogo Goliath"">Number 55: Gogogo Goliath</a>"" might be less familiar and can serve as a DEF booster and recurrence tool, but mostly finds a way onto the board because it is a ""Gogogo"" monster and therefore triggers certain cards; ""<a data-name=""Gagagaga Magician"">Gagagaga Magician</a>"" serves a similar purpose, but can revive previously used ""Utopia"" monsters for overlays and as 2500 ATK beaters. ""<a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a>"" is the Rock type searcher and therefore a very important tool of the deck. Lastly, the Link monsters in form of ""<a data-name=""Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable"">Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Missus Radiant"">Missus Radiant</a>"" both help getting cards upon being destroyed and both have solid effects that might come in handy during your turn (""<a data-name=""Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable"">Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable</a>"" being less useful with her revive effect, but ""<a data-name=""Missus Radiant"">Missus Radiant</a>"" is a very solid tool since it provides solid stat boosts to pretty much everything on your side of the field).</p> <p>The ""Gogogos"" as a deck on their own really aged rather poorly, which is why I had to include so many other options. Nonetheless, if you want to play a deck that is capable of spamming Xyz monsters in a more Casual environment, I urge you to give the rocky monsters a go. Furthermore, if you want more information about the ""Gogogos"" and cards I did not feature in this deck list (or other archetypes for that matter), feel free to visit my blog under this link: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/02/16/archetype-analysis-gogogo/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/02/16/archetype-analysis-gogogo/</a></p>"

I've made another weird deck. Today, we have Marincess' with a Traptrix engine. I know, that sounds wild; i'll elaborate as we go on. </span><span>First of all, for the deck, we have the basic Marincess combo pieces. Nothing out of the ordinary, you just normal one and then activate some effects to special out the others. Although, here's where this deck differs; we have a small Traptrix engine. With Bottomless Trap Hole and Trap Hole Nightmare both at 3 in the deck, you have a strong backrow to stop the opponent's plays. You also have Myrmeleo to search out traps and pop backrow, Genlisea to help build backrow (note you'll most likely be using her in turn 3, after using a trap hole and sending it to the graveyard), and Mantis to search out the rest. </span><span>We also have Marincess Battle Ocean, for the Marincess'. We now go into the extra deck. We have Sera, in case you want to do a bit more with the traps, but that's not the focus. You'll want to start using the Traptrix and Marincess' to link climb, and go into Great Bubble Reef. once you have Great Bubble Reef, you'll want to banish cards for the draw and attack gain, and go in for an OTK. </span><span>Note: You'll want to go first, to set up your traps and such. As always, this is one of my first decks here, so any feedback is appreciated. Have a good day!</span>"

After this you will end up with 2 lv 5 water monsters (1 being a tuner) that can go into Needlefiber (or ultimaya if on a budget).  You really want to normal summon Deep sea diva or go into Neptabyss some how  There is also the synchron engine which works great with the low lv water monsters as well as the frog engine for back up plays (easy lv 4 and 5 synchro plays)  Quite customizable (don't want to draw lappis, Neptabyss, or Gagigobyte so I recomend playing around 45 cards)  The main win conditions are Herald of the Arc Light (easy 2 make with all the lv 2s) and whatever you can make off of Needlefiber or Ultimaya  Junk Synchron works great in the deck and can easily go into lv 5 synchros  I play the nemeses engine to return all the banished monsters from Ronin, Aria, or Aqua Spirit"

Not much has changed, still running the Garden Rose Maiden through Apollousa route. It's nice, since it makes Apollo early in the turn, and you can play to your whole board with just one tuner extender. I'm back on a second Striker Dragon, since it helps when playing through interruptions. The nice thing about Dragon link is you can abuse all the broken stuff in the format, Linkross, Halq, Dragoon even, maybe even Rusty, but you can also just play through the old combo routes effectively and make similar powerful boards, even if those get stopped. I still think Dragoon puts it up to another level - you're in a 3 hand trap situation a lot of the time, and even if you have them, and the right ones, and time them right, you still have to play on with way fewer cards in the hand, and often through a Dragoon. It's the best link 2, and since the deck is inclined to play more than 40 cards the risk of bricking isn't so bad - besides, if you see the fusion, you don't make Dragoon, or you just play the fusion.  The hawtnezz in this deck is the Artifact engine. Lancea is okay right now, good enough to main with the engine, but the real goal here is to set up Tracer alongside Unchained Abomination in your normal combos to pop Scythe on their turn (Rokket Tracer pops somethings, triggers A-Bomb, A-Bomb pops Scythe).  You can only run 1 of the bricks if you want to, but they're way less bricky at 2 since you can just use them in normal combos. I wouldn't run a 40 card deck for Rokkets anymore, personally. I understand why people want the best possible odds of seeing their important cards, but you can often actually improve your odds of seeing a TYPE of card but running multiples of the TYPE of card in a larger deck. In Rokkets in particular, you have so many amazing extenders you want to be able to abuse, and you want the highest possibility of seeing those extenders as possible - yes, you see your one card combo less often, but you combo off just as often, and through interruptions more often. It puts a strain on the hand trap line, only the best of the best here.  In terms of the side deck, I decided to run obligatory back-row removal and hand traps, to help more effectively tailor against the combo decks at the front of the meta. Token Collector is here mostly for Infernoble, but is good against virtually any dedicated Linkross/Auroradon combo deck, and so it has fringe applications. Effect Veiler is here for Verte Anaconda, vs Dragoon decks, and also to cut Triple Tactics going second or Lancea against bad matchups. Ghost Ogre is here because it is really effective against Lost World in particular. It has niche uses, and is great against Field Spells in general, and you can bump up your hand traps in the mirror with it, because it is really good against Romulus most of the time.  Added Tempest into the deck. You need a good target to send with Dragon Ravine and still extend into Verte Anaconda in certain multiple hand trap situations, especially with Droll and Nibiru heavy in the meta right now.  Cut Tempest. It doesn't do it's job well enough. I also cut Dragoon, although that's more to test the deck without it, and improve the hand trap game. This means 1 fewer interruption you can play through, but the combo is essentially the same, and now there's room for Borrelsword, who is situationally useful in combos and under Guarddragons, and gives the deck an alternative for going second to Dragoon. I do like having more space for hand traps, I feel pretty solid on this line-up, for the meta."

The Wincon comes from Sovereignty's effect to snowball advantage with high attack boss monsters and potentially OTK the following turn. 3 Trade-in can be swapped for Pot of Extravagance (The Extra Deck would need to be adjusted however)."

Also, I use Lib to set World legacy's heart as to get more resources in the hand for either to be put back using skulldread(so I can keep more of the cards I drew off of skull dread) or targets to be special summoned off of the links. Thus I can spam more skull dreads and get appolusa on the field. Overall this is a really fun deck, it is just kind of inconsistent, hence why  I put in as much searching and drawing cards as I could. This is also why I put in so many special summoning cards as this deck is essentially skull dread spam, otherwise, it has no chance. Feel free to send me any comments on the deck!

The ultimate Histlander pendulum deck!","<a>Learn about Histlander</a>  The idea behind the deck is to run basically every good Pendulum engine that's legal in these years. The deck can flexibly create/break boards and put out huge amounts of damage. We do run 40 cards due to not wanting to draw the Metalfoes Spells/Traps and so we can fit all the best engines.  Pros: - Able to put up multiple negates with ease - Can OTK very easily, even if your board gets broken - Wide variety of different boards to address different matchups (Dweller, Rafflesia, or Vortex to name a few)  Cons: - If your scales get destroyed, many hands can't properly recover - The lack of Links means you can't make explosive pend summon comebacks - You do run a fair amount of bricks and sometimes you just open unplayable hands."

The deck can flex between board-building and grinding with Snow.  Pros: - Has a very high turn 1 ceiling for board-building - Fairy Tail Snow can shut down many decks - Very flexible Extra Deck toolbox gives a good matchup spread  Cons: - The ceiling of the deck is facilitated by a large number of cards you don't ever really want to draw - A lot of the deck's power can often be reliant on random mills, dropping consistency - Since the boards don't really put up negations, aggro decks can often break your board going 2nd with the right hand"

Attempt to OTK the following turn by utilizing the Noble Knight boss monsters and out-resource your opponent through Isolde and Noble Knight Brother's effects. 60 cards allows for multiple uses of Isolde and prevents the deck from struggling in the late game. Ratios can be adjusted in order to incorporate other extenders (such as Fire Flint Lady)."

Going 1st your set up board can vary from an Abyss Dweller + True King of all Calamities + El Shaddoll Winda to fewer combinations of them. The profile is also very budget focussed. (if playing on a budget isn't a thing for you, pure Dinosaur would be the going 2nd Deck to look after)  <strong>Card ratios</strong>  <em>Monsters:</em> 3 Fluffal Bear because it starts your draw engine (mostly based on Toy Vendor) and can get you a Poly back (which doesn't come up that seldom because I only play 2 copies);  1 Fluffal Penguin because you can't always use it as Fusion Material (often you use Fluffal Cat in order to get your Poly back); 1 Fluffal Cat because it more ore less duplicates your Poly in a way; 3 Fluffal Dog and 1 Fluffal Dolphin (or 2 Fluffal Dog 2 Fluffal Dolphin) this ratio is debateable because Dolphin+ Foolish Burial Goods + any Fluffal starts your Draw engine (and might get you a Poly back to the deck) but Fluffal Dog + Fluffal Bear also starts your draw engine; 1 Fluffal Wings because you only use the draw effect and want to send it to your graveyard in any way rather than having it in your starting hand; 1 Fluffal Owl because space is limited and King of the Swamp searches Poly without being summoned; 2 Edge Imp Chain because the effect is very good but only in combination with other cards ( f.e. when you search it with Frightfur Patchwork and got a Fluffal you insantly have access to the Frightfur part of your Extra Deck, you might also play 3 though); 1 Edge Imp Sabres because it is easily searchable and the effect comes up very seldom; 1 of Shaddoll Beast/ Dragon/ Hedgehog and Naelshaddoll Ariel for drawing/ hitting backrow/ searching a Shaddoll to discard or fuison with/ clearing your opponents graveyard (can't be triggered by Toy Vendor/ Super Poly or other cards that discard for cost!); 2 King of the Swamp for searching your Poly (or to replace Edge Imp Sabres) you might also replace it with 1 additional Poly and 1 additional Edge Imp Chain ( drawing the stated card is better than searching it if you are likely to face negation); 1 Dinowrestler Pankratops as it can easily force out negations going 2nd  <em>Spells: </em>3 Frightfur Patchwork because it's an insane searcher; 3 Foolish Burial Goods because it can send Toy Vendor (and therefore search) and also Frightfur Repair (if you absolutely need a Edge Imp/ Fluffal specialed from your hand); 2 Polymerization becaused it can be searched and recycled ( 3 also would be an option if you are facing a lot of negation against your search); 1 Frightfur Fusion because it is a searchable extender but you don't want it in your opening hand; 2 Toy Vendor because you want to send it to the GY or set it with Fluffal Bear but not draw it (1 would be too less copies, 3 use too much Main Deck space in my opinion); 1 Frightfur Repair as you want to send it with Frightfur Cruel Whale but not draw it ( it's a good extender but not more as that); 3 Shaddoll Fusion because it generates a lot of advantage going 2nd  if you are facing an opponent using the Extra Deck (if not you rather side out all copies of this card); 3 Super Polymerization because it's a cheap and reliable going 2nd card ( can only be stopped by an Extra Deck or Spell Card lock, you might also keep it in the Side Deck and replace it with 2 Dark Hole 1 Raigeki as these have broader ways of usage but are easily negated) and also triggers a discarded Toy Vendor etc. ; 1 Mind Control because it's often a must negate going 2nd  <em>Extra Deck:</em> 1 True King of all Calamities as going 1st option (Fluffal Dog + Frightfur Patchwork get you there in 4 summons if uninterrupted); Abyss Dweller as going 1st option; 1 Predaplant Dragostapelia/ Starving Venom Fusion Dragon/ Mudragon of the Swamp for your Super Poly targets; 1 El Shaddoll Shekhinaga/ Construct/ Winda for: negation/untargeted destruction an Fluffal Wings in the graveyard/ floodgate and also filling your graveyard; 1 Cross-Sheep ( this spot is debateable but I like it for linking off a Mind Control target/ getting into Abyss Dweller); 1 Frightfur Kraken/ Sabre-Tooth/ Tiger/ Wolf for breaking boards and OTKing  &nbsp;  <strong>Side Deck and noteable mentions</strong>  The side deck is more an idea of cards that can be good siding in or even in the Main Deck e.g. El Shaddoll Apkallone + Extra-Foolish Burial can search El Shaddoll Fusion ( here I also included expensive cards but side decks quickly change from format to format). Your real Side Deck should definitely contain: cards against backrow oriented Decks (Twin Twister, Anti-Spell-Fragrance); cards against heavy combo Decks (Dark Ruler no more, Nibiru); cards to side in if you are likely to be forced to go 1st ( Floodgates, Extenders);(I put Apollousa in here because it can replace Calamities if it gets banned in the future); replacing Mudragon of the Swamp with Borreload Dragon might make sense for facing sticky monsters with high protection capabilities; If you have the PSY-Frame package in your Main or Side Deck you should probably play PSY-Framelord Lamda  <strong>General discussion and  strategies</strong>  <em>Pros:</em> The deck can play through 1 hand Trap mostly and has a lot of easy accessable removal options; The Fluffal draw engine can often ''unbrick'' your hand and draw into your Side Deck cards in game 2 and 3; The deck leaves a lot of Main deck space to be sided out because the Shaddoll half of the deck is not mandatory (e.g. if you are facing an opponent who doesn't use the Exra Deck at all you are better off taking out your 7 card Shaddoll engine and replacing it with Side Deck equalizers); the deck can also bait negations without committing to a normal or special summon (f.e. Toy Vendor or Frightfur Patchwork search effect, going 2nd blow out cards); Chain Blocking is often an option in order to assure your important effects to go through; going 1st you can set up boards in under 5 summons (which means you don't have to fear Nibiru, the Primal Being)  <em>Cons: </em>The deck is very susceptible to Hand Traps ( searches a lot and uses on-field monster effects); The deck highly Extra Deck and Graveyard reliant; the Shaddoll half of the deck only works against Extra Deck strategies; the deck's intrinsic removal options are mostly targeting and destructing ( Frightfur Cruel Whale is only destructing); The deck relies on its Spell Cards to go through; as many cards can be sided out (and have to in certain match-ups) a 15 card Side Deck is not capable of fitting all kind of cards you might need; the deck can brick going 1st (this rarely happens going 2nd though, apart of not drawing blow-out cards)  <strong>Deck building</strong>  As we now have stated strenghts and weaknesses of the deck, we have to find a way to minimize the weaknesses while not cutting too much of its strenghts.  Going 1st Hand Traps put a lot of pressure on this deck (especially Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring, Droll &amp; Lock Bird), which can be decreased by playing Called by the Grave + 3 PSY-Framegear Gamma + the 1 PSY-Frame Driver (as you can generate a lot of advantage before committing to a summon Gamma will be live). Also activating Gamma and then linking off the Driver with another monster into Lamda lets you search another copy of Gamma in the End Phase (which you are now free to activate even with monsters on board); Infinite Impermanence stays a card you have to play around --&gt;this package is a Side Deck option for both going 1st and 2nd  As non-target removal I would recommend to play Borreload Dragon (you have to play Cross-Sheep for Link-Climbing reasons, if you decide to go this route), either Mudragon of the Swamp or Predaplant Dragostapelia should be exchanged.  As the deck is Spell Card reliant, big threats are cards like: Secret Village of the Spellcasters, Imperial Order or mono Spell negates. Against the Floodgates side in 3 Evenly Matched (very versatile card in general) and maybe 1 Red Reboot (also a killer against trap-based backrow decks). Mono negates can be overrolled by simply playing more board wipers ( 2 Dark Hole 1 Raigeki instead of 3 Super Polymerization).  One might also play Super Polymerization in he Side Deck with Starving Venom Fusion Dragon as it's only target in order to fit in Cross-Sheep + Borreload Dragon + PSY-Framelord Lamda (or maybe even replace Super Poly with Dark Ruler no More and gain another free Extra Deck spot); playing Frightfur Wolf is also debateable, but it's synergy with Frightfur Cruel Whale to bump it up to 3000 ATK speaks for holding an Extra Deck slot for it  &nbsp;"

With 1 other plant in hand, we can easily put 2 interruptions and able to run big staple slot, sounds familiar? Ye","What a year. TCG with combo and OCG with control. Only a deck with big staple slot can survive the format. So we cut all the Rikka extender for more staple slot and starter, except Loptr. With Mardel, Loptr acts the same as Petal making us have 12 starters (3 Loptr, 3 Petal, 3 Glamour, 2/3 Lonefire, and One for One). Combo needs 1 other plant in hand, so it's a 2 cards combo (similar to Zoodiac that needs Ramram in GY). Normal summon the starter, add Snowdrop (can add others like Mudan if you already have Snowdrop), Snowdrop will ss the other plant we have on hand by tributing the starter, and since we only run plant monsters that searches (Mardel, Mudan, Lonefire, Petal), we can easily ss Mudan for Rikka spell/trap like Sheet. Last play is using Snowdrop eff to make all plant lv8 for Teardrop, making us have 2 interruptions with Sheet. In the end you'll realise we only use exactly 2 cards to do the stuff, the negs are covered by the amount of plus from the plants we run.  If going second, any plant extender (One for One, Rose Girl, or the new Ingunar) can result you Fairy Knight Ingunar (board bounce, spell speed 4) since Snowdrop can target Mudan making all plant becomes lv6. Plenty of room for side deck cards too.  Main deck: 12 Starters, 2 Mardel (ensures Loptr resolving, not really a brick since Snowdrop can summon it, and most importantly, plus), 1-2 Snowdrop (the heart and soul, but you don't wanna draw double of this, 2 cus we play Desires), 1-2 Mudan (Sheet grind game, arguably worse than Snowdrop cus Snowdrop makes Teardrop), Rose Girl (or any plant extender, I choose it cus it has recovery, super clutch with Rikka Petal playstyle). The rest is just staples and draw cards for more consistency (Desires similar to Salamangreat, but we run 2 Mudan/Snowdrop while Gazelle is at 1).  Extra Deck: 2 Teardrop (can play 3 if you want since there aint many plant extra deck around, needs 3 Snowdrop tho), Peryton (Snowdrop targets Mardel), Ingunar (3 lv6 mats, explained above), Princessprite (just another plant extra deck we can make, plus if it mills s/t), Jasmine (for link climbing if aint locked to plant), Verte (generic plant link, helps handtrap like Nibiru and Psy-Frame to become plant, can run Super Poly too but too many Dragon Buster lock around), Negalogia (super situational if not plant locked), Halq (we run tuner handtrap, can put Selene too if with Effect Veiler), Link Spider (helps Psy-Frame Driver and Nibiru token for Verte).  Pros: Super consistent, have follow-up, big staple slot.  Cons: Weaker payoff than Zoodiac, prone to handtrap."

Basically, going first you will usually open with a handtrap and some form of other negate. You'll want to get to gazelle as soon as possible and bury the roar or rage from deck to grave, and then recycle it with sunlight wolf.  Going second, ACCESSCODE TALKER is the way to go. Easy OTK and you can do the Update-Transcode combo to get out a 5300 ATK beatstick that can attack twice and can destroy 3 cards on the field."

Floodgates and Blaze accelerator Reload supplement your defensive monsters in order to reduce the size of your opponent's field. The main wincon of the deck is to rack up as much burn damage as possible while board wiping your opponent's monsters through Scattershot's effect. The extra deck primarily focuses on toolbox options and is mostly up to personal preference. 3 Magic Planter can be replaced for other draw cards such as Pot of Extravagance (The extra deck is certainly flexible enough for this inclusion)."

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. Infernoble Knight, known in Japanese as Flame Holy Knight (焔えん聖せい騎き士しEnseikishi) is a series of FIRE Warrior monsters which debuted in Structure Deck R: Warrior's Strike, but became a full-fledged series of monsters with ""Rise of the Duelist"". They are a sub-series of the ""Noble Knight"" archetypes, and as such are closely related to ""Noble Arms"", in addition to the ""Roland"" archetype.

Laugh about this deck all you want, this deck is coming in with a 80% win rate (approx.). So make sure you all just tell me some feedback as this deck is really something different comapred to some of the other stuff I have been doing.  Here are some sidenotes: I decided to play the eldich mainly because of synergy with eldich and the blaze accelerator reload. It also has got synergy as the fact is doesn't special summon as much since its a control deck which is why it slowly kills my opponent.  Here is the next deck: Updated Normal Monsters"

Vanity's Ruler acts as the deck's primary normal summon to lock down your opponent. On the following turn, attempt to OTK with Draco Berserker and your other high attack Wyrm monsters. The 4 True Kings allow the deck to go into Calamities if need be, however this engine can by cut for other cards such as 3 Mystery Shell Dragon and Nidhogg Generader Boss of Ice."

The only things you have to watch out for when playing with this deck is your Tuners.

The Level 10 materials for XYZ are: Obelisk from a True Name, Exodius via its own condition, Metal Reflect Slime with a possible stop at Egyptian god slime now that that's a thing, and Accel (sending Quickdraw to up its level) made out of Deep Sea Diva and Gishki Diviner. From there you have a simple choice of Number XX, Gustav into Liebe, Galaxy Destroyer. Accel and Quickdraw can also make a Cyber Dragon Infinity.  Plays with Reckless Summon are for Diva into triple Diviner for draw 3 and Trish Zero, or for triple quickdraw into CDI and maybe a Chevalier De Fleur for the extra negate.  The card calling is mostly True Name for the quick Obelisk, or Sphere Mode if your opponent has troublesome cards that need to be cleared. Diviner and Archfiend's Oath can generate extra cards in hand, especially with Oath being a soft once per turn. Convulsion, Card Advance, Spellbook Organization, and Diviner can be used for either a peek at the card before it's called or even a top of deck fix before calling."

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. Infernoble Knight, known in Japanese as Flame Holy Knight (焔えん聖せい騎き士しEnseikishi) is a series of FIRE Warrior monsters which debuted in Structure Deck R: Warrior's Strike, but became a full-fledged series of monsters with ""Rise of the Duelist"". They are a sub-series of the ""Noble Knight"" archetypes, and as such are closely related to ""Noble Arms"", in addition to the ""Roland"" archetype.

Couple that with a handful of handtraps and that alone can be enough to slow down current meta decks on a good day.</span>  <span>Similar can be said about Zexal Turbo Numeron. Number S0: Utopic Zexal can lock you opponent down for a turn but he's weak during your turn and falls to Gamma and Infinite Impermanence. Still, with the right amount of handtraps you just might be lucky enough to win.</span>  <span>Ideally you make your Numeron plays and then switch Numeron Gate for Generaider Boss Stage. During your opponents Draw Phase you summon Harr from your deck or, if Harr is in hand, summon Dovelgus and then chain his effect on his summon, tributing himself to summon Harr from hand. DON'T activate Zexal in the same chain. Once Harr is on the board you then proceed to activate Zexal's effect. Now if your opponent tries to activate Psy-Framegear Gamma or Infinite Impermanence you can negate that with Harr.</span>  <span>Also don't forget to make use of Harr's second effect (which they wrote down first because who reads cards all the way to the end, yet I still keep forgetting about this effect) to force your opponent to send a monster from their hand or field to the GY if they add a card to their hand from their deck except for their normal draw.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Quickly some card choices explained:</span>  <span>1# Effect Veiler can be swapped for Infinite Impermanence (Less of a card choice and more of a budget thingy)</span>  <span>2# No Memories of Hope. Albeit drawing 4 cards sounds incredible (realistically speaking 3 cards as you're trying to play around Nibiru. Numeron Gate 4 exists only to OTK) both archetypes don't require you to throw your entire hand to establish a board and therefore don't rely on draw power as much as other decks do. These slots find better use in handtraps.</span>  <span>3# No World Legacy Monstrosity/Trias Hierachia/Girsu Mekk-Knight. These cards are incredible in pure Generaider to summon V.F.D. turn 1 while also giving you an extra interruption/draw power with Trias but they don't add much practicality in a hybrid deck with less slots to spare.</span>  <span>4# Cyber Dragon Nova &amp; Invoked Mechaba. You can fill these 2 ED slots as you like but I've been running into so many Dogmatika engines lately (and the only out to Winda would be Loptr's effect allowing to resolve) so I decided to skip the Side Deck and move them to the Extra Deck right away.</span>  <span>5# Generaider Boss Room. I added one copy of this card to search off of Mardel if you already have access to Generaider Boss Stage. This card is an omni negate if your opponents effect is chained to the activation of your Generaider card or effect. (Boss Room doesn't <em>really</em> negate the effect but rather changes the effect to both players drawing a card which can be advantageous to you but also to your opponent, so keep that in mind) </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Now go forth and get your game on.</span>"

Combos included! ,"<span>This is my latest Infernoble knight build and I think it is very consistent. Infernoble Knight is a tier 1 deck, being able to adapt to the current metagame and play through the ‘powerhouse handtraps’ such as gamma, imperm, nibiru and even droll and lock bird (this one requires a good hand). Playing 60 cards in Infernoble knight is absolutely necessary to avoid drawing bricks such as too many equip spells, combo tuners etc. For this build I am mainly focusing on playing NIBIRU PROOF, that would either be playing around nibiru or playing through it. I have included combos for both in my NIBIRU PROOF Infernoble knight combos, I recommend that you check it out - you can watch some combos and learn how to play the deck better and improve as a player. If you do, please like the video and subscribe to the channel - it is a great way to support me and the channel. I will now go over what cards we need in hand and what the end boards are going to be in all the combos I show in my video. Also if you are interested in doing so - you may check out my other uploads on YGOPROdeck, I have uploaded a dragon link and 2 Eldlich decks and I have youtube videos explaining those as well, link to those can be found in the YGOPROdeck of those. If you have any questions regarding the deck, let me know in the comments below or the comments you youtube.

Super Poly and it's respective Extra Deck targets are used as additional pieces of disruption when going first, or board removal tools if forced to go second. The wincon of the deck tends to come from the Rivalry/Zombie World lock backed up by Balerdroch and an Extra Deck boss monster of your choice. Additional copies of Vampire Domination and Domain can be cut in order to fit in any combination of the various zombie support cards available (Allure of Darkness is a possible option but beware, as a handful of your monsters are not the Dark attribute)."

Fortunately <em>Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor </em>and <em>Sky Striker Ace - Kagari </em>came off the banlist, with these two back to 3, the deck will now be able to compete again with most of the meta decks.  Handtraps Explanation: <ul>  	<li><em>Nibiru, The Primal Being</em> - I've observed that most decks right now are abusing <em>Halqifibrax</em>, this card can easily change the flow of the game to your favor against those type of decks.</li>  	<li><em>Ghost Ogre &amp;  Snow Rabbit</em> - Since Numeron is still a thing here in TCG, it will be wise to put this in the main deck just to be sure. Although you can still use this against some of your opponent's key card in order to interrupt their combo.</li>  	<li><em>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</em> - I've noticed that most of the combo decks will not be bothered when you use <em>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</em> to them, so instead I've come to a decision that this handtrap will have a much more impact to your opponent's combo.</li>  	<li><em>Effect Veiler</em> - Self Explanatory handtrap. Most of you will say that <em>Infinite Impermanence</em> will be a better choice but since we have a <em>Selene</em> in the Extra Deck, this monster will be more useful overall.</li> </ul> Most of the Spell Cards are pretty much standard except <em>Sky Striker Maneuver - Scissors Cross</em>, I put this card in the Main Deck since <em>Dragoon</em> is a thing. This card can out your opponent's <em>Dragoon</em>, though that's not the effect that I use it most for. The thing that I like about this card is it helps me fill up my GY with Spell Cards faster.  Extra Deck is pretty much standard except the <em>Link Spider</em>. You can use this card against Dino especially if they use <em>Lost World</em>, that card can lowkey shut down Sky Striker. Good thing we have this card to remove the token from our main monster zone.  Side Deck Explanation: <ul>  	<li><em>Nibiru, The Primal Being</em> - Good against combo deck. Side it in if your opponent greatly relies on combo and if they don't have that much extender or bait cards.</li>  	<li><em>Dinowrestler Pankratops</em> - Can pop your opponent's card and it's a free summon monster.</li>  	<li><em>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</em> - If you think <em>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</em> is not a good choice against your opponent, side this in instead.</li>  	<li><em>Dark Ruler No More</em> - Good card to break your opponent's board. If you think that your <em>Nibiru</em> will just get negated or baited, side this in instead.</li>  	<li><em>Cosmic Cyclone</em> - Good against Altergeist and other backrow decks. This card will prevent the Altergeist's grind ability.</li>  	<li><em>Mystic Mine</em> - If you think your match will come to a grind one, side this in so that your opponent's pace will slow down.</li>  	<li><em>Evenly Matched</em> - Self Explanatory card. Use this with Dark Ruler No More and your opponent's face will be shocked.</li> </ul> &nbsp;"

(Watch the video for news on my 2021 video series),"  I found out from YouTube that <em>Godzilla VS King Kong</em> is going to air in 2021, assuming nothing goes wrong. And for the past few weeks, if not months, I have been getting back into Godzilla; I used to be a big fan back in middle school. So I made this Dinosaur Kaiju deck, named ""Godzilla March"", after Godzilla's iconic theme song.  &nbsp;  Because of the Kaiju engine here, going second is more important than ever for Dinos. Interrupted Kaiju Slumber is one of the best cards in the deck, not just because it turns the tables if your opponent has multiple strong monsters on board, but because it works surprisingly well with Lost World. With Kaiju Slumber, you can give yourself a Dogoran and your opponent any other Kaiju, and Dogoran will be stronger, since the opponent's Kaiju is not a Dinosaur. Plus, you can do this before your Normal Summon so that your opponent will get a Juraegg Token and they can't target any non-tokens with card effects.  &nbsp;  Slumber also has synergy with Lost World because you can use it while the opponent has a Juraegg Token to pop a Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon, and then search an Oviraptor. And one last thing about this deck? Because Animadorned Archosaur is Level 1, the Extra Deck has 2 Relinquished Anima in there. If you are able to summon it, then summon a Kaiju to your opponent's field in the zone Anima points to, so that Anima can equip it.  &nbsp;  As for the Side Deck, it contains 3 copies of cards that are all useful in the current meta. So if you're playing against a high-tier deck and it's time to get serious, just switch out the Kaiju cards for those.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

With the Deck you have plenty of search for <strong>DM</strong> I think more than enough to get any combo off.</div></blockquote> <p>If there are any road blocks on the field, its pretty easy to get rid of them when you have <strong>DM</strong> on the field with cards such as the Dark Burning Magic <strong>(DBM)</strong>, and with the <strong>Soul</strong>, <strong>Circle</strong> combo on the field.</p>  <ul>  	<li> <span>Plan 2</span>: <h2><span><em><strong>(WindWitches)</strong></em> </span></h2> </li> </ul> <blockquote><div>This plan is to try and get out <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong> out on the field with the Windwitch engine.

With that set you can then Tune <strong>Glass Bell</strong> &amp; <strong>Ice Bell</strong> into either the Clear Wing Synchro Dragon <strong>(Clear Wing)</strong> or the  Windwitch - Winter Bell <strong>(Winter Bell)</strong> .</p> <p>Personally 90% of the time I will go into <strong>Winter Bell</strong>, because most of the time you are not keeping this part of the component long. With <strong>Winter Bell</strong> on the field activating its effect (Target 1 Windwitch monster in your GraveYard <strong>(GY)</strong> and inflict damage to your oppoent equal to that target's Level x200 during the battle phase).</p> <p><span>Most</span> the time I only use this effect.

Once you have <strong>Crystal Wing</strong> out on the field, its usually a good enough wall of defence, attack and negates that it can help you in all stages of the match. I feel this combo is fairly effective when its pulled off.</p> <p>When its not pulled off its a shame but I feel when you have cards such as<strong> Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong> and <strong>Infinite Impermance</strong> in deck it helps negate most things that will stop you from pulling the combo off. But if there is too much struggle I have throw into the Side Deck the <strong>Effect Veiler</strong>, <strong>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</strong>, and <strong>Twin Twisters</strong> to help with flexability.</p>  <ul>  	<li> <span>Plan 3</span>: <h3><span><em><strong>(Dragun of Red-Eyes)</strong></em></span></h3> </li> </ul> <blockquote><div> Now this is the cheese king overlord so all you need for this plan is to as the tital say's. Get <strong>Dragun of Red-Eyes</strong> out onto the field. I have made it so there are a few ways of achiving this goal. First is the 2<strong> Keeper of Dragon Magic's</strong>, If the card is normal or <span>Special Summoned</span>: You can discard 1 card; and add 1 Polymerization or Fusion Spell from deck to hand and reveal 1 fusion Monster (Being the <strong>Dragun of Red-Eyes</strong> in this case) in the extra deck; <span>Ss</span> 1 of the fusion materials listed from that monster from the <strong>GY</strong> in face-down defence postion.</div></blockquote> <p>But once you have done that, the Spell card you are after is 90% of the time <strong>Red-Eyes Fusion</strong>. You want to instantly pop this when there are no negates on the field and just summon<strong> Dragun of Red-Eyes</strong> right out.</p> <p>Other ways of Summoning <strong>Dragun of Red-Eyes</strong> is to Link Summon PredaPlant Verte Anaconda (<strong>Verte</strong>) by having to effect monsters on the field and tributing them for <strong>Verte</strong>. Then popping <strong>Verte's</strong> Effect, to target 1 face-up monster on the field; it becoming Dark until the end of the current turn this effect is activated, then Paying 2000 Lp and sending a Fusion or Poly from the deck to the <strong>GY</strong> then the effect of the spell activates.</p> <p>So you will usually use it to search for <strong>Red-Eyes Fusion</strong> to Summon <strong>Dragun of Red-Eyes</strong>.</p>  <blockquote> <p><span><em>""So there are 3 Simple combo's I use in this deck, there are a few more, but im sure most people could figure it out"". </em></span></p> <p><span><em>""Have fun ggwp"" ~Buzm</em></span></p> </blockquote> <p></p>"

This deck combines the offensive/recursive power of ""Shiranui"" with the oppressive con","This is my own personal decklist that combines the offensive/recursive power of ""Shiranui"" with the oppressive control that ""Zombie World Lock"" offers. I thought I'd release this list for Halloween for the festivities. :)  The <strong>main strategy</strong> of this deck is to establish the ""Zombie World Lock"" board.  While Zombie World + Rivalry of Warlords ensures that your opponent only controls only one monster on their field, Doomking Balerdroch allows a negate + banish once per turn. To achieve this board, Zombie World + Doomking have to be present on the field. This ideal board primarily falls to the crux combo piece Uni-Zombie. Uni-Zombie almost single-handedly achieves this end board by milling zombies from the hand or deck (Necroworld Banshee for Zombie World) (Glow-Up Bloom for Doomking), in addition to providing synchro access. The primary ways to search out Uni-Zombie is through Shiranui Solitaire, and Shiranui Solitaire can also be accessed by Ghost Meets Girl - A Shiranui's Story.  The <span><strong>Non-Archetypal Zombies</strong></span> add some muscle into this deck through their various interactions with big Daddy Doomking:  <strong>Jack-O-Bolan</strong> is a free summon which helps mill your hand to your graveyard for plays. It provides a quick effect monster reborn once per turn, which also trigger Doomking's banishment effect - resulting in an interruption and a extra zombie on board.  <strong>Vampire Fraulein</strong> is a zombie battlephase handtrap that summons itself when an attack is declared, allowing Doomking to banish during the battlephase. It also adds up to +3000 ATK/DEF to any zombie monster on the field, once per battle (for the cost of lifepoints), turning any zombie into a massive beatstick.  (Link 2)<strong> Vampire Sucker</strong> provides more resources to a zombie player by giving the player a free draw anytime a zombie is resurrected from either graveyard. During the standby phase, if Doomking is in the graveyard and there is a Field Spell on the board, it will resurrect itself, which prompts Vampire Sucker's +1 draw effect (chain link 1) and Doomking's banishment effect (chain link 2). Drawing one card and banishing another on the field/graveyard in the standby phase is often devastating. Often in the first turn, Doomking + another zombie is linked away for Vampire Sucker to allow for this chain to occur during your opponent's standby phase.  <strong>Non-archtypal synchros</strong> are also useful in this deck. For unprepared decks, , (LVL12 Synchro)<strong>Geomathmech Final Sigma</strong> is invincible since it is unaffected by card effects while in the EMZ (this card is easy to bring out by synchroing a level 4 uni-zombie with a (level 8) Doomking, and Doomking returns in opponent's standby phase.) , (LVL7 Synchro)<strong>F.A Dawn Dragster</strong> is a OPT S/T negate. , (LVL8 Synchro)<strong>Draco Berserker</strong> punishes every effect used by the opponent by with banishement and (LVL8 Synchro)<strong>Psy-Framelord Omega</strong> is banished pile recursion and interruption.  <strong><span>Non-Archetypal Spell/Traps:</span></strong>  <strong>Gold Sarcophagus</strong> - Triggers every maindeck Shiranui banishment effect. (Solitaire = Resurrection from banished pile) ( Samurai = Recovery from graveyard) (Spiritmaster = 1 pop).  <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> - Pretty straightforward. Also trigger's Vampire Sucker's effect.  <strong>Pot of Desires</strong> - +2 draw for 10 cards banished face-down. Remember Shiranui monsters banished facedown don't trigger their effects! Careful about using this card too much, it may banish too many combo pieces.  <strong>Terraforming/Metavers</strong>e - Access to Zombie World. <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM""><strong>Rivalry of Warlords</strong> - Forces both players to only control 1 type of monster.When they Summon any monster, Zombie World changes that monsters type to Zombie. Rivalry of Warlord's will prevent that player from attempting to summon any other monster that is not a Zombie Type monster. Therefore, unless the opponent is playing a zombie deck, they cannot summon from their hand, deck, or extra deck if they have zombies on their field. Zombie World + Rivalry of Warlords + Doomking Balerdroch makes a very difficult to break board. This card cannot be searched in this deck, only drawn.</p> <strong>Super Polymerization</strong> becomes a very powerful board breaker/interruption with zombie world, as almost any monster on the field can be fused away for <strong>Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</strong>. <strong>Mudragon</strong> and <strong>Starving Venom Dragon</strong> are also Super Poly targets.  <strong><span>The Shiranui portion of the deck provides various helpful effects for the deck:</span></strong>  <strong> Shiranui Solitaire</strong> allows more ready access to the ""ZWorld Lock"" board, by searching Uni-Zombie from deck. Solitaire also allows for recursion from the banished pile by reborning any banished Shiranui (except itself) when the card is banished.  <strong>Shiranui Samurai</strong> is a one of, since it's searchable and isn't a combo piece. It's main strength is it's quick effect, allowing Doomking to trigger it's effect anytime during the opponent's turn. It can also out monsters that are hard to get rid of through it's banishment effect. It's also recursion as it allows graveyard recovery when it's banished.  <strong> Shiranui Spiritmaster</strong> allows for a target destruction of a card on the field anytime it's banished face-up with cards such as Shiranui Samurai, Shiranui Style Swallow's Slash, Gold Sarcophagus, etc.  <strong>Shiranui Spectralsword</strong> can tune in the field and graveyard. Through graveyard synchro, it can cheat out Archfiend Zombie-Skull even without the use of proper materials.  <strong>Shiranui Style Swallow's Slash</strong> is targeted destruction for two monsters in exchange for a zombie tribute, and it also banishes a Shiranui from deck, triggering their effects. If Shiranui Spiritmaster is banished, 3 cards on the field are destroyed. (+ it sounds like a special move from Demon Slayer lol, extra cool points)  <strong>Ghost Meets Girl, a Shiranui's Story</strong> provides extra access to combo pieces since it searches out Shiranui Solitaire which in turns accesses Uni-Zombie.  <strong>Shiranui Extra Deck</strong> monsters are this deck's main offensive juggernauts - (LVL5 Synchro) <strong>Swordsaga</strong> changes battle position, (LVL7 Synchro) <strong>Squiresaga</strong> provides non-targeting destruction, (LVL8 Synchro) <strong>Shogunsaga</strong> boosts it own attack on summon for OTKs, and <strong>Sunsaga/Skillsaga</strong> provide blanket protection, destruction and recovery.  While this deck is strong and semi-consistent going first, it doesn't do well to interruptions, negates and handtraps. If Uni-Zombie is somehow negated, the turn usually ends there. This deck also has difficulty breaking boards, as it doesn't have much tools to do so.  All in all, this deck is a fun rogue strategy to play, semi-budget, and easy to learn. Have fun and Happy Halloween duelists!"

Whatever you open with, try to forge a clear path to a field of big monsters.  A good opening card is Starliege Seyfert since you can use it thin your deck by one card and still get Striker Dragon out, which then leads to more shenanigans with Rokkets in general."

Basically, Superheavy Samurais can attack while in defense mode and their defense points act as their attack points. Providing good defense for a good offense. But if you need something that'll help your duel by attacking in attack mode, Samurai Destroyer will help you out without fail.  Note: Superheavy Samurais effects work best when you don't have spells and/or traps in your graveyard. In this deck, I added Sekka's Light. Knowing it works like Pot Of Greed, its additional effect will be able to banish itself so your graveyard is clear and you can be able to use Superheavy Samurai monsters effects without worry. However, using Sekka's Light means you cannot activate spell or trap cards yourself. Here's why, Warlord Susanowo's effect allows you to take spells or traps from your opponents graveyard and place them on your field so you can use them yourself, but if you used Sekka's Light at the start, Warlord Susanowo's effect would be useless and it'll cramp your Spell/Trap Card Zone which are needed for the Superheavy Samurai Soul cards. So use Sekka's Light if you need to gain an advantage and you're good."

Also the backup plan is Amina beatdown.","For my submission to the Yu-Gi-Oh spooky deck competition, I thought of the scariest thing I could, the inevitability of death. I decided against that idea at first because stall decks are lame as hell. Looking at my deck now you may be thinking that I am a horrible hypocrite, playing mine when I said stall was lame, however, there is one card that instills fear into the hearts of every man. Mystic Mine. But I thought that that may discredit the deck so I strayed away from using it too often. I found out later, that it facilitated my plays extremely well. I don't feel like I must explain the horror of getting hit by a meteor and of the other obvious cards, so now we will go into the ""strategy"" involved.  &nbsp;  <span>Inferno Tempest</span>  Mill. Mill. Mill. That is the name of the game when you play this deck, at least most of the time. The best play to make when you have this titular card is to tribute an opponent's monster into a 3000+ attack Kaiju then destroy your own 0 attack monster with it to activate the spell's effect. After all of the banishing, the Necrofaces activate, milling your opponent some more. If you have a Left Arm, you want to go for this card. To help you get to this card, we have a few stall items such as the Mystic Mine, and if you are in the<strong> DIREST OF STRAITS</strong>, you use a Kaiju and then go into Relinquished Anima to snatch up the Kaiju and gain the attack to just punch their face. The side deck is something you can choose on your own, find what you would enjoy for the deck. This is by no means to be taken as anything remotely viable and is just a fun casual deck."

It uses the Artifact engine and the Psy-frame engine with an emphasis on going first, but can easily switch to a going second variant using the side deck.  - Monsters (25)  Fluffal Dog x3: It searches any fluffal monster you need to continue your combos  Fluffal Penguin x3: Mostly used either as a special summon from toy vendor or as a fusion material to draw more, it allows you to make Bahamut Shark going first along with Dolphin, gets recycled by Toadally Awesome, and make link plays with bahamut or the special summon it gives you with it's first effect.  Fluffal Dolphin x1: It makes Bahamut Shark with Penguin, and allows Foolish Burial Goods to become a one card combo starter. Sending Toy Vendor to the GY from Deck, then normal summoning Dolphin to set Toy Vendor from the GY and send wing to the GY. His second effect rarely is used.  Fluffal Bear x2: Search Toy Vendor, our main advantage generating engine. Run at 3 because we want to have Toy Vendor as often as possible, I have cut it to 2 to reduce the card count to 40.  Fluffal Wing x1: Allows you to pop Toy Vendor by banishing itself and another fluffal from the GY, allowing you to draw 2 cards and search one from the destroyed vendor, it's only run at 1 because you rarely use it's effect more than once per duel, altho you can send Suture Rebirth to the GY and return it from the banished zone if needs be against grindy decks, that is why Suture Rebirth is in the side deck.  Fluffal Owl x1: Searches Polymerization (which is already easily searchable), it's second effect becomes live against Prohibition or any spell locking card allowing you to fusion without a spell.  Fluffal Sheep x1: Combo Extender, Special summons itself for link plays, if you search it from Dog and have Edge Imp Chain in hand, you can use it to send Dog back to hand, special Chain, make a link 2 and get chain's search effect.  Fluffal Cat x1: the other combo extender, has more uses going 2nd than first, but when going first can still allow you to put 2 fusions on board, either to make VFD or Dingirsu.  Edge Imp Sabres x1: Only at 1 because it is easily recycled by it's effect, it's used to make Tiger against backrow heavy decks, to link climb, overall a great card.  Edge Imp Chains x3: When sent to the GY from the hand or field, allows you to search a frightfur card. Most of the time used to search Frightfur Fusion for our XYZ plays, or Frightfur Patchwork to setup next turn.  Edge Imp Scythe x3: Our archetypal handtrap, can end the opponent's turn with a well placed destruction by summoning Frightfur Cruel Whale, allows us to use our artifact during the opponent's turn, and also protects our fusion monsters from destruction by banishing itself from the GY (most of the time used when Cruel Whale is the only monster on your field when you summon it)  Artifact Scythe x1: One copy, searchable by Dagda, Destroyable by Frightfur Cruel Whale with Edge Imp Scythe. Locking our opponent from the Extra Deck sometimes ends their turn here and there.  Psy-frame Gear Gamma x3: Our other handtrap, here to protect us from handtraps.  Psy-frame Driver x1: Just one copy to make Gamma live, can be summoned from the GY even when sent there by Toy Vendor.  - Spells (15)  Polymerization x3: Our fusion spell, nothing more to say.  Frightfur Fusion x1: Just one copy, easily searchable, using it to fusion summon a fusion monster by banishing from GY allows us to easily make rank 8 or 9 plays.  Frightfur Patchwork x3: Searches both Poly and an Edge Imp monster, fantastical to make even bad hand live.  Foolish Burial Goods x3: One card combo started, used to send Toy Vendor to the GY and making us search a fluffal monster or sabres, often than not you search Dolphin out of it, or Dog.  Toy Vendor x3: Most important card in the deck ? It's drawing effect can either make or break your turns, but it's search effect upon being sent to the GY is just too good.  Frightfur Repair x1: Sent to the GY with Frightfur Cruel Whale second effect. You never use the spell's first effect, but the second one allows you to extend your combos.  Instant Fusion x1: Used to bring out Winda while protecting her with Dingirsu in turn 1, often via Anaconda.  &nbsp;  Extra deck (15)  Frightfur Cruel Whale x2: amazing card, on summon it destroys a card on both fields, non targetted, has a quick effect to send a frightfur card to the GY from either the main deck (Frightfur Repair) or the extra deck to boost the attack of a frightfur monster, you often use it's first effect to pop either scythe or toy vendor.  True King of All Calamities x1: Made from 2 Cruel Whales on first turn to stop the opponent from playing on his turn.  Frightfur Sabre-Tooth x1: Boosts all frightfur monsters' attack and on fusion, revives a frightfur fusion monster, giving us options for XYZ plays or just pushing for OTK. If fusion summoned with 3 materials, can't be destroyed by battle or effect.  Frightfur Kraken x1: Once upon a time it was our best fusion, now slightly outclassed by Cruel Whale, his non destruction effect is still tremenduous, and going second can easily lead to OTKs with his double attack. Using him to summon Sabre-Tooth allows us to reuse his card removal effect a second time, followed up by either an OTK or an XYZ 8 play. Him plus Sabretooth gives you just 8000 attack.  Frightfur Daredevil x1: Newly addded Beatstick, I've found myself using him more and more for the burn damage to push for the win. Can still be replaced with a third Cruel Whale or any other frightfur fusion if you don't like him, i've grown quite fond of him however.  Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star x1: Made from Kraken and Sabre-tooth, gives us a 3rd non destruction removal (but untargeted unlike kraken's) when going second, and when going first, protects Winda from Instant Fusion's destruction effect.  Frightfur Wolf x1: Often used via Frightfur Fusion by banishing our whole GY to have a 2k beater attacking a crazy lots of times.  Frightfur Tiger x1: On summon, destroys cards up to the number of materials used in it's summon, used to clear backrows.  Bahamut Shark x1: Made from Penguin and Dolphin, allows us to summon Toadally Awesome as a way to stop Nibiru during our turn, or just annoy the opponent on his.  Toadally Awesome x1: See above.  Cross-Sheep x1: Most often used for the fusion effect to extend our plays, he is the primary card enabling us to summon Bahamut Shark and Toadally.  Predaplant Verte Anaconda x1: Used when going first tu pitch Instant Fusion to make El Shaddoll Winda as a floodgate.  El Shaddoll Winda x1: Still a good floodgate nowadays when backed up by Dingirsu.  Artifact Dagda x1: Part of the Artifact engine to put out Scythe ready to be popped out by Cruel Whale on the opponent's turn.  &nbsp;  On turn 1, your goal usually is to put out a mix of whichever you can put between VFD, Toadally Awesome, and Dingirsu/Winda.  In order to get VFD, you usually need 1 Fluffal monster, 1 Edge imp monster (most often chain), and a Polymerization with a Frightfur Fusion (which can be searched if using Chain as material). Use Polymerization with the monsters to summon the first whale, then search/use Frightfur Fusion and summon a second Whale by banishing the mats for the first fusion from the GY and overlay both whales to make VFD after using their effect to send Frightfur Patchwork to the GY from the deck to extend your potential plays.  If you summon Dagda and have Edge Imp Scythe in hand with another fluffal (penguin if possible), you can still lock the opponent from using the Extra deck by summoning Cruel Whale during the enemy turn. His destruction effect becomes CL 1, on that, use it's second effect as CL 2 to send Frightfur Repair to the GY, and use Dagda as CL 3 to set Artifact Scythe from the deck, so the opponent can't Cosmic Cyclone it as it will be set and destroyed in the same chain.  To summon Dingirsu, you'd need either 2 Polymerization or 1 Polymerization and Fluffal Cat,  an Edge Imp Monster (and 2 fluffals if not using cat) in order polymerize a Kraken, then use Kraken to polymerize Sabretooth with another monster which will then revive Kraken, and overlay both for Dingirsu (which nets you 3 non destruction removal if you do it going second by using kraken's effect after each time you summon him and with Dingirsu). If you have the required extender, you can then summon Predaplant Verte Anaconda and use it to copy Instant Fusion for a Winda as a floodgate, which will NOT be destroyed at the end phase thanks to Dingirsu, then during the opponent's turn, Winda can also survive an attack thanks again to Dingirsu (let it die at the end of the opponent's end phase to not gimp yourself tho)  Going second, you probably can scoop, but Kraken and Sabre-tooth will be the backbone of your plays. Most of the side deck is geared towards going second in a bo3.  Droll and Lock Bird is probably the best Handtrap in the meta against the top tier decks, able to single handedly force them to end their turns.  Lancea can be searched with the Dagda/Cruel Whale Combo if needed be to also stop them from playing their full combo.  Nibiru the Rock Jhonson is Nibiru, always useful.  Forbidden Droplet is the board breaking spell by excellence, i'd also run Lightning Storm but I don't have them (yet).  Harpie's Feather Duster for backrow heavy decks alongside Tiger.  Frightfur Reborn is against those stall decks, in order to get a second use of Fluffal Wing by banishing the spell from the GY to return Wings to the GY.  The last 3 fusions are here because I had nothing to replace them with yet.  The deck can definitely steal some wins here and there, and if you enjoy combo decks i'm sure you'll enjoy this deck too, you can most of the time play through one handtrap (depends which one of course), the Toy Vendor engine makes the deck quite good at cycling through the deck and the games usually are quick. Also Fluffals are cute."

Juggernaut Liebe and Gustav Max are your main ways of dealing high amounts of damage along with attack boosting cards like Limiter Removal. The infinitrack Xyzs are to be used as toolbox options and also to rank-up into your OTK enablers through Outrigger Extension. When forced to go first, the deck can still hold it's ground by setting up some combination of Super Dora, Megaclops, Outrigger Extension, and Infinitrack Goliath being used as Xyz material. 3 copies of limiter removal can be swapped out for other cards if desired (handtraps are recommended). The Xyz ratios of the Extra Deck can also be tailored to personal preference."

Grind out advantage and wipe your opponents board on their main phase as needed.  Pot of Duality as our card draw of choice. It doesn't provide actual card advantage like Extravagance or Desires, but our deck needs specific cards more than it needs a lot of cards. Extravagance is a nonbo with a lot of our other card draw effects, and Desires wiping random cards from our deck is much too steep a cost to pay here. Thankfully we don't special summon much, so Pot of Duality slots in quite well.  This deck plays a lot like an old school control deck and is very budget friendly to boot. We don't really use our extra deck much beyond the occasional Linkuriboh or Link-2 off of Crackdown. Fossil Warrior Skull Knight and Elder Entity N'tss are really just tech cards for Dogmatika.  Note Phantom Knights' Fog Sword + There Can Be Only One creates a soft lock against any deck relying on one creature type!"

Summon Ancient Gear Ballista with ease and use the Rail Cannons, Reactor Dragon and Howitzer to th","<span>Ancient Gears and... Trains?? Okay, hear me out...</span>  <b>[Updated list/Strategy Guide V.1.4]</b>  <b>The guide will have discrepancies between it and the deck but that's just because I'm lazy and can't be bothered updating the deck's guide past the 1.2 revision - but I continuously update the deck so I thought it was worth updating the list at least.</b>  No seriously, Ancient Gears have some rather good synergy with Trains since both decks are entirely EARTH Machines and both archetypes have a lot of generic support for EARTH Machines, not just Railway or Ancient Gears specifically. Ancient Gear Ballista is the core combo card of this Deck, pretty much the entire Main Deck is built to swarm Ballista out as much as possible since he can be summoned with any 2 EARTH Machines, not just Ancient Gears. Trains also open the deck to the Rank 10 XYZs. Gustav Max + Howitzer burn on top of all that battle damage? Yes please!  <strong>MAIN DECK</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Super Express Bullet Train</a></strong> Three copies. You always want to be seeing this guy. If you control all EARTH Machines it can Special Summon itself for free, and during the end-phase it returns a Machine in your GY to your hand if it was sent there that turn, which is more useful than it seems, and it triggers during your opponent’s end phase if sent to the GY during their turn as well. Use <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a>’s effect to Special Summon it during their turn, detach it from your R10 XYZs or tribute it for <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a>'s nuke effect and return whatever you think you'll need for your turn. <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Ancient Gear Box</a>'s search effect will activate if added back from the GY by <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> too, giving you access to double the resources for next turn. Trigger this effect as often as you can, obviously.  <strong><a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Heavy Freight Train Derricrane</a></strong> Two copies. Free Special Summon if you summon another EARTH Machine. If detached from a R10 XYZ it can pop a card. Mostly used as the free summon to get <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> out. However, it makes <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a>’s phat burn or <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a>'s quick effect to protect itself a little bit more powerful.  <strong><a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a></strong> Now at two copies since the original post. I've added a lot more ways to get rid of it from the hand and Deck. Since it’s not as likely to sit in your hand forever I think two copies can work now as the Deck is a lot better once <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> is in the mix, and I do want to see it more often than I did. You don't really want to draw it, but if you do, <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a>, <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Frame</a>, <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> and <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Droplet</a> help to get it out of there and on to the field or GY where it's useful. Prioritise getting him to the GY as fast as possible. Get him out of the Deck with <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a>, <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish</a> or <a data-name=""Scrap Recycler"">Scrap Recycler</a>. It's also worth noting <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> is level 10 which makes him a prime candidate to go into the R10 XYZs but make sure to detach him first so you're still covered by his Special Summon effect in the GY. You can also use that effect to chain block <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a>'s effect when that's triggered at the same time. ALSO, you can combo his monster nuke effect with <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> since that can Special Summon <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> during the opponent's turn and <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> can tribute it off making use of its’ high ATK, and you can return an EARTH Machine during the end-phase off <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a>'s effect as well. Keep the pressure up!!  You can use this to dodge effects and other disruption too.  <strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon</a></strong> One copy, down from 2. The loss of VFD means there's no real use in running two anymore, too many big machines means too many bricky machines. You won’t be able to use the first Reactor to pop another <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> and go for a second Reactor, but that trade in power is worth the increase in consistency. Not having one at all limits <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a>’s effectiveness and your power ceiling too heavily. He'll still does most of the heavy hitting and can be brought out ""easily"" with <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>'s effect to pop <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> or after <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> is destroyed. If you still control <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Reactor Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> (or any other Machine), I usually go into <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> during MP2. 3000 ATK beatsticks with no protection don't do much for you nowadays during the opponent's turn, at least <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> can recycle <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> for advantage off his effect during their turn and set you up again for your next turn.  <strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Ancient Gear Box</a></strong> Two copies. I tried three, but that was too many. If added to your hand outside of being drawn, you can search for <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Frame</a> or my personal favourite new target: Infinitrack Anchor Drill (500 DEF Wooo!). This Deck can trigger <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> off <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> and <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a>'s effects. Use <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> to gather more resources to fuse with, set up for the next turn with <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a> or search <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Frame</a> out to discard a <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> stuck in your hand being useless and trade it for an <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fusion"">Ancient Gear Fusion</a>. *whispers* It's free card advantage.  <strong>*Deep Breath** <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede</a></strong> Three copies. If summoned, this card summons another EARTH Machine from your GY, which is pretty much any monster in the Deck. Ideally, target <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> if you have it to trigger its’ recycle effect during the end-phase, otherwise any monster will do. <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> can then recycle <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a> and you can do it all over again. This is essentially a card to make <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> with, or if you use its’ second effect you can go into the R10 XYZs by copying the level of another monster you control, either <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a>, <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a> or <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a>. This guy infinitely comboing with <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> is the reason I play 2 <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> over 2 <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a>.  <strong><a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a></strong> Brand new addition to the deck! Three copies! This card is so good, I totally missed it when building the original Deck (thanks PurpleJesus7). If summoned, this card Special Summons another EARTH Machine from your hand, and DOES NOT negate its' effects. It's a one card <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>, it yeets <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> right out of your hand and gives you access to spicy <a data-name=""Dingirsu, The Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu</a> plays thanks to its’ second effect of level manipulation shenanigans, similar to <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a>.  <strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Ancient Gear Wyvern</a> </strong>Three copies. The ye olde searcher for any Ancient Gear card you want, except itself. It does have an annoying drawback which prevents you from Setting any cards for the rest of the turn after you use <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a>'s effect, apparently searching <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reborn"">Ancient Gear Reborn</a> and setting it that turn was too OP. Remember to Set all the backrow you want to use during your opponent's turn <strong>before</strong> searching with this card. I tend to Set all my cards before I start my combos, just in case. It’s a bad habit in any other situation other than this one. Search <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> for another search (<a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern </a>searches <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a>!?), <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a> for protection, or search whatever you want- I'm not your dad.  <strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Ancient Gear Frame</a></strong> One copy, down from two. It was already mostly there for the name, I cut it back due to the lack of room in the Deck but kept one for the discard (for <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a>) that comes in handy once in a blue moon, and it is a target for <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> when you need the materials for <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a>. <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Frame</a> can discard a card and search <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fusion"">Ancient Gear Fusion</a> (since it lists Ancient Gear Golem in its' card text). It does have other effects but we don't run either Golem or Ultimate Pound because bricks (:pepehands:), so those effects, whilst good- are irrelevant. It's an okay card, but if you want room for more trains or something else you want to splash, this card is probably the one to cut.  <strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Hunting Hound"">Ancient Gear Hunting Hound</a></strong> Two copies. Three is too many. Burns for 600 on Normal Summon and has a “Poly” effect that can Fusion Summon either <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> or <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a>. I don't need to explain why he's in here or what I do with him.  <strong><a data-name=""Scrap Recycler"">Scrap Recycler</a> </strong>Another new addition. Two copies. This card is just another <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish</a> for <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a>, and it's an EARTH Machine so you can still Special Summon your Trains off Scrap’s summon, and go into <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> after you've dumped <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> to the GY. It can also dump <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> to the GY if you already have <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a>. I've not once used its' recycle effect but it's there if you want to recycle a <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> and <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a> for a DRAWW MONSTA CARDO!!  <strong><a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Urgent Schedule</a></strong> Three copies (now affordable for all you budget players!!). This is your power card, this is, and I repeat, this is NOT <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a> bait. <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a> Special Summons 2 monsters of choice from the Deck, one high-level and one low-level monster, if your opponent controls more monsters than you do. Always pick <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> as the high-level monster if he isn't already in the GY, otherwise pick <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> or <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a>, situation depending. Usually, I pick <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> as the low-level monster if I intend to recycle it off <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> that turn or if <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> is not already in circulation. Otherwise, <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a> or <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> are both good targets to get in circulation. If you already have everything you want in circulation summon either <a data-name=""Scrap Recycler"">Scrap Recycler</a> if <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> is already in the GY (or is also being summoned off <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a>) since he’s pretty useless otherwise, or <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Hunting Hound"">Hunting Hound</a> as a last choice.  <strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fusion"">Ancient Gear Fusion</a></strong> Down to two copies from three. The Deck's core strategy is moving away from Fusion Summoning due to better access to <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> and <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> plays, so this card isn't as important to see in your first hand. If you need it, just search it off <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> or <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Frame</a>. It's a poly, that's it really. It's got redundant/irrelevant Golem effects which we don't use. It can't be responded to if <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a> is face-up, which is pretty cool. This card makes <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> 99% of the time. 1 in 100 games you might go into <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a> if you've got the materials to spare or your opponent has no outs to it. However, the threat of being able to go into <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant at any time will keep your opponent on edge. </a>  <strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Ancient Gear Fortress</a></strong> Two copies. Your opponent cannot respond to your Ancient Gear effects and Ancient Gear monsters you control cannot be targeted or destroyed the turn they’re summoned. Amazing. ""Response? Yes? TOO BAD BITCH FORTRESS SAY NO"" - actually me one time. The single best support card for Ancient Gears since <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>. Although in this Deck it manly protects your <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> plays rather than blanket protect your entire fucking Deck since we play a mix of other archetypes' cards. Purer builds should always run three. It's still incredibly good at protecting your main combo piece, and it's also got the signature Ancient Gear pop-float (only in the S/T zone, so no Magical Hats shenanigans this time), but it locks you to Ancient Gears for the turn (No <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Anger Knuckle or </a><a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max in the MP2, remember that)</a>. I don’t recommend destroying it with <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>, but if you have nothing else it’ll do. <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a> is also an amazing card to bait the opponent’s negates with, they'll know that if they don't negate or destroy this card, they won't be able to stop anything else you do for the rest of the turn (not necessarily true, but I imagine that's what they're thinking since it gets negated A LOT). It doesn't stop your opponent to responding to the resolution of an Ancient Gear effects though, keep that in mind. It also doesn't stop the opponent from negating <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> or its' effect since it isn't an ""Ancient Gear"" card, for some reason. Always Set your <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>s folks.  <strong><a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> </strong>Otherwise known as ""Kaboom Town*"" since it literally never survives on the field for more than a turn. Two copies, down from three. Searched off <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> and then almost always immediately blown up by it too. I wouldn't want to live there. You don't<em> always </em>have to summon <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Reactor Dragon</a> off <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>, sometimes Special Summoning <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> for the search can help more in the long run (or to push for a <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant)</a>, or summoning <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> from the GY (or Megaton Golem if you play him), even better if <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> is in your GY for suicide shenanigans.  <strong><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a></strong> Three copies. Yes, I know it's a $100+ card but I already own three copies so I put <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Droplet</a>s in here because this is my Deck after all and they’re really good disruption, keeping your monsters alive and good at getting <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> out of your hand if he's chilling in there etc. etc. It's a great card, you don't need me to tell you that or how to use it. For budget players: try out <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Chalice</a>, <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash,</a> or more <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called Bys</a> if it wasn't always taking a tour bus through the forbidden and limited realms. If you're feeling more ""A good defence is a good offence"", try out some generic 'going second' cards like <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler </a>(which is better? No damage or no board?), <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, </a>or an assortment of Kaijus and the like.  <strong><a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a></strong> Because fuck you <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a>.  <strong><a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong> Limited to one. Used to dump <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> to the GY where he belongs. If starting out with only <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a>, you can dump a target to the GY to use it as a target for <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a>' effect. It can bait a negate if you're trying to get <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a> off and it also dumps targets (<a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a>) for <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> to recycle, <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> to Special Summon (if you're desperate), or <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reborn"">Ancient Gear Reborn</a> for next turn plays (if you're even more desperate).  <strong><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong> Limited to one. It does what it does. This Deck needs all the combo extenders it can get. Besides, your GY is usually full of massive beatsticks or annoying <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a>s, <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Reborn</a> comes in handy.  <strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reborn"">Ancient Gear Reborn</a></strong> One copy, although I played around with two. Our one and only Trap Card. It's okay, but it's a little slow. I run just the one because <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> can search it when summoned during the opponent's turn and you'll be able to Set it during your turn. It is kinda nifty though; you can chain the effect to <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> (if it tributes itself and you control no monsters thereafter) and/or <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a> to get double the monsters. Just listen to the satisfying sound of your opponent's life points dropping constantly as you reborn <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> over and over again.  <strong>EXTRA DECK</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Ancient Gear Howitzer</a></strong> Two copies, down from three. The bread-and-butter Ancient Gear fusion monster. Probably one of the most annoying cards for your opponent to deal with. It burns, floats, AND is immune to all other card effects. Its' Floaty Mc. Float Face effect isn't once per turn (Its' burn effect is though). You can suicide this into bigger monsters and Special Summon <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon</a> (or any Ancient Gear) from the Deck to do the hittin' <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> couldn't. If <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> in your GY you'll also get to summon him off <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a>'s suicide, which also chain blocks <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a>'s float (or vise-versa).  <strong><a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Ancient Gear Giant</a></strong> One copy. This is your Hulk Smash, a fucking MASSIVE beatstick that will almost always end the game if your opponent can't deal with it. He’ll do what Hulk did to Loki to your unfortunate opponent at the other end of the stick. <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a> is totally immune to Spells and Traps, but vulnerable to monster effects (God, I wish it were the other way around). Although he’s much better protected with <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a> up, if you need a big beatstick, you don't get bigger than this. Well, no, that's not quite true, you do, but it can't attack multiple times like <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a> can... oh wait, it does that too!?? It's okay though, this deck runs both.  <strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ancient Gear Ballista</a></strong> The Deck Master. Three copies. This card searches <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> or any Ancient Gear monster, then, in the case of <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>, immediately blows it up and makes one of your opponent's monsters ATK/DEF 0, making hitting them over the head with a 3000 ATK beatstick that much more satisfying. He's also an Ancient Gear (I forget that sometimes) so once you've done your things you can use him as material for a <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> or LINK <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> off into <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> for railway shenanigans, it's a waste to just leave him out there, he doesn't really do anything for you during your opponent's turn.  Consider running <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa</a> to make use of <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>’s LINK 2 rating and whatever’s left on your field. Apollo with two or three negates is still fairly good.  <strong><a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Double Headed Anger Knuckle</a></strong> One copy, two if you're feeling it. He can summon your level 10s from the GY, or himself, which comes in handy a lot, and comes in CLUTCH when you're top decking because literally any card you draw can do the '<a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> into <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> into a <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> field nuke' wombo-combo. You can use this effect to dodge other targeting or disruptive effects too. High priority to get into circulation if <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> is in the GY, if not, constantly making use of <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a>’s recycle is still really, really good.  <strong><a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a> </strong>I added one copy to the Deck just for some turn 1 plays since the Deck doesn't really have any. You can't use <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a>, <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista, </a>and ending on just <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> or <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> isn't exactly a fantastic unbreakable board. Its effect isn’t as useful with LINKS since they can't be turned to Defence and negated, but it still stops a lot of plays dead in their tracks, which is good enough really.  <strong><a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> </strong>Added one copy to the Deck for generic backrow removal since the Deck doesn't have much besides whatever is in the Side Deck at the time and <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Reactor Dragon</a>. Consider running a <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">AA-ZEUS instead as it'll probably be more useful (I'd run it if I owned it).</a>  <strong><a data-name=""Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid"">Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid</a></strong> One copy. Generic Rank 4 with some good protection and supports trains (despite it being a ship). If it ends up destroying something, you can overlay into <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> for a phat 2k burn, or into <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a> for a big beatstick/wall that can be rather annoying for the opponent to remove, and if you're really feeling it: overlay, overlay, overlay into a 4 or 5 material <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">AA-ZEUS</a>.  <strong><a data-name=""Dingirsu, The Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, The Orcust of the Evening Star</a></strong> One copy, two if you're feeling it/find the room. <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a> gave us access to Rank 7s and 8s and this is probably the best Rank 8 around. If you don't like it (and why wouldn't you) feel free to use something else like Number 11: Big Eye (target a Level 3 with <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a>’s effect) or whatever.  <strong>**Deep Breath** <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora</a></strong> What's with this ridiculously long name?? One copy. Personally, I prefer 2 <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> and 1 <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a> but you can swap the ratios if you want to, both works. This is for those times when <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> is too vulnerable or you want to keep some of your monsters alive and effects their working. While good at both being a giant beatstick and gargantuan wall, he can also protect the vulnerable <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a> if you plan on summoning it this turn. Detaching for the effect also triggers <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a> or <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> (the latter in the end-phase) making <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a> a lot more appealing over <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav </a> sometimes.  <strong>**Deeeeeep Breath** <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</a></strong> One copy, and another stupidly long name, but he makes up for that ridiculous name with its sheer FUCKING POWER, <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a>’s cannon isn't just for show. If you thought <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a> was a beast, imagine <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a> as his more successful, cooler, sexier, and stronger cousin. Overlay this over <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> or <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a> after you've used either of their effects (or you if you haven't and want to attack more times). You can detach a material to have <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a> gain a permanent 2k ATK, bringing it up to 6000, then 8k the next turn (if it's still alive or you haven't already won). It can always attack a number of times on monster equal to its’ materials +1. That's 3 attacks, four if you didn't use Gustav's/<a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a>'s effect. Use him to clear the board and if you haven't used <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a>'s effect, let the rest of your monsters attack directly for fucking insane damage. This card is a powerhouse even by Machine standards, and does most of the work for the deck. Must include. Get one. They're cheap now too.  <strong><a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max</a></strong> Two copies. Some good, sweet burn damage that puts Dragoon to shame (Okay, that's a lie but Gustav at least looks 50x cooler- only if it's the LART we're talking about). I find myself going into this card a lot, burning my opponent, then either overlaying to <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a> or LINKing it off for <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> or <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a>. Gustav’s 2k burn on top of a <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> burn, and the awesome battle damage these machines can dish makes for """"EZ"""" OTKs. Your opponent won't survive more than a few turns if they aren't careful. A <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav burn and a direct attack from </a><a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe is exactly 8k damage.</a>  --  <strong>The 1 2 3s and ABCs (A.ncient B.eatsticks C.an S.mash) </strong>[Below was written with the original Deck in mind, it's still relevant and informative but it could be a bit better, but I'm not gonna rewrite all this. Use that big brain of yours to figure out where the new cards fit in]  The main focus of the deck is to bring out <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ancient Gear </a><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> as fast as possible. The R10 XYZs are a nice addition and work well together with AG but they shouldn't be your main focus or win-con.  Say your starting hand is AG Fusion, <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Urgent </a><a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a>, AG <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a>, AG <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Droplet</a>. You go second (this is a board-breaker deck after all) and draw <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a>. A typical combo (for now I'm not going to factor in negates/disruption etc.) might look like this...  Activate <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a>, Special Summon <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina </a><a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> and <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a>. You already have <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> and <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a>; you don't need more AGs. Get whatever you want/lack into circulation. You Special Summoned an EARTH Machine. Special Summon from your hand <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a>. Set <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Droplet</a>, THEN Normal Summon <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a>. Search <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a> and then activate it right away. XYZ <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> using <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> and <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a>, detach <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a> and burn your opponent for 2k. <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a>'s effect activates and pops a card. If you're going first, summon <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a> instead, assuming you can Normal Summon and you have either <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a> or <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> in your hand. Or <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish</a> and <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a> etc.  Link Summon AG <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> using <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> and <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a>. If you don't have another monster to normal summon, use Gustav. Search <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>, then activate <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> and use <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>'s effect to pop it and make a monster your opponent controls ATK/DEF 0. If you didn't have <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> at this point, summon it off <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>, otherwise summon <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Reactor Dragon</a>. If you were going first ignore most of the above and just summon <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Bagooska</a>. First turn you should prioritize getting as many fusion materials as you can and thinning out the deck as fast as possible, going second you can afford to be more aggressive and go for the beatsticks more.  Use AG Fusion and summon AG <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> using <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> and either the monster he searched for or one you had in your hand already/the <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> (don't use <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Reactor</a>) you summoned off <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>. Burn your opponent for 1k. You can then choose to Overlay Gustav into <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a>. If all you need is one solid hit, detach <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> from <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a> and smack the 0/0'd monster that <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> targeted for game, since <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a> is on 6k and you've burned for 3k so far. Otherwise if you don't detach it's just a solid 1k ATK upgrade over Gustav that can attack monsters three times! Plus all your other monsters can attack too if you didn't use <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a>'s effect.  So it's time for the fun part. The Battle Phase. Always attack with the Ancient Gears first since your opponent can't activate Spell and Traps (monster effects only if attacking with <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a>, both if attacking with Reactor) until the end of the damage step. Use Reactor to pop either one of their backrow or another <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> if you have one, don't always pop <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a>, it has good protection effects that are best left active, unless you need just one more hit. If you're lucky enough for there to be a monster greater than 1000ATK feel free to suicide <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> straight into that. That will summon another AG from the Deck, and the effect can't be negated if <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a> is up. If you have <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> in the GY, he will special summon itself too since <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> is an EARTH Machine and it was just destroyed.  If somehow your opponent survived your onslaught either through major disruption or magic bullshittery, go into MP2, you're not done. If you went into Leibe for the battle phase, detach <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> now for Leibe's effect. Other monsters can't attack for the rest of the turn, but they weren't going to anyway. This puts <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> in the GY giving you some protection. LINK Summon <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> using whatever's at hand, if you haven't used <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> this turn, summon it now off <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a>.  For the most part, that's it you're done. If you went first you have a 4k defence wall that can make itself immune to card effects and if it has <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a> as a material, it can also pop a card. Maybe a <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> or <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Bagooska</a> too. If you went second you smashed your opponent so hard he didn't know what hit him. If you didn't already win you should soon. Assuming you weren't negated and disrupted at every corner, then your board will be much less impressive and your opponent won't be bleeding from every morsel. This summary assumes a lot, a real game is very different. If someone slaps down <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a> or <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a>, you're fucked. Make sure to prepare an appropriate Side-Deck suited to your locals. I recommended at least 2 <a data-name=""Twin-Twisters"">Twin-Twisters</a>.  &nbsp;  <strong>Tips and Little Tricks</strong> If you activated <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a> and have <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a> in hand. Link away into <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> before you summon <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a>. That way <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a> can target <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>'s materials in grave and Link into <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> or use it's other effect to XYZ into one of the Railway Cannons or the <a data-name=""Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid"">Dreadnought Dreadnoid</a>.  If you summoned <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> off a <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> pop or a <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> float during your opponent's turn, search <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reborn"">Ancient Gear Reborn</a> (if you want to) since you can set it during your turn unlike normally when <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> locks you out from Setting cards for the rest of the turn, which doesn't matter during your opponent's turn.  After <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> has attacked you can nuke your opponent's monsters by tributing itself and attack directly with the rest of your monsters. <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> can revive itself again next turn if your opponent destroys one of your monsters.  If <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> is destroyed on summon but his effect will still resolve, search out <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> instead of <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>, since <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> is useless without <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>. <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> should search <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a> and set you up for the next turn.  Just because you know you're out of <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Reactor Dragon</a>s in the Deck, or any decent targets for a <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> float, doesn't mean your opponent knows that. Sitting on a bluffing <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> has worked for me sometimes.  <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">If Bullet Train</a> summoned off <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> during your opponent's turn wasn't destroyed that turn, it still has its' effects negated during your turn. It can attack and you won't have to send 2 cards you control to the GY to do so.  Anyway that's about it I guess. If I think of more things I'll add them later (and I never did lol).  &nbsp;  *If you got the Anna ""Kaboom"" reference, I like you. We do use her trains after all."

Sadly my wish did not come true. The deck is too slow and obviously, a deck centralized around flip monsters is usually going to be way too slow. But, if you use one of the only playable flip centralized deck in the entire game, Shaddoll, you can make a pretty formidable strategy. Basically what you want to do is open something that is to the degree of ""Shaddoll Fusion"" + ""Pre-Preparation of Rites"". First, you will want to activate (this an assuming that you are going second and your opponent controls an extra deck monster) ""Shaddoll Fusion"" sending ""Shaddoll Beast"" and ""Performage Trick Clown"" summoning ""<a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a>"". Then as Chain Link 1 send ""Reeshaddoll Wendi"" with ""<a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a>"". Then as Cain Link 2 draw a card with the effect of ""Shaddoll Beast"", lastly use the effect of ""Performage Trick Clown"" to Special Summon itself (if you didn't know, doing it in this exact order chain blocks your ""El Shaddoll <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">Construct's""</a> effect). Finally, your ""Reeshaaoll Wendi"" effect will activate Special Summoning a ""Shaddoll Beast"" from your deck in Facedown Defence Position. Next, you will activate ""Pre-Preparation of Rites"" adding a ""Prediction Princess Tarotrei"" and a ""Prediction Ritual"" from your Deck to your hand. Then activating ""Prediction Ritual"" you can tribute your Facedown ""Shaddoll Beast and your ""Performage Trick Clown"" to summon your ""Prediction Princess Tarotrei"". During your end phase ""Prediction Princess Tarotrei"" Special Summoning your ""Shaddoll Beast"" back to your side of the field facedown, then during your opponent""s turn ""Prediction Princess Tarotrei"" can flip it back face up to draw two cards!"

Fortunately I've found a build where it completely suits my playstyle which is an OTK with board wiping ability that has handtraps. It's consistency is a 10/10 to me when it comes to board wiping your opponent's field and it can dodge most of your opponent's targeting negeation since you have Vision HERO Increase, Mask Change, and Forbidden Droplet. Though in this build it's not a good idea to go 1st except when it's absolutely needed, the one condition of this HERO build when it goes 1st is that you need to have access to Mask Change or any handtraps in order to disrupt your opponent. The reason why i did not put Destiny HERO - Celestial and only put 2 Fusion Destiny is to decrease the chances of having a brick hand. Overall this deck is awesome to play especially when you know it's in and outs and how you expect what cards your opponent will negate.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>HANDTRAPS EXPLANATION</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - A standard handtrap since it's usable against any deck.</li>  	<li>Droll &amp; Lock Bird - Since Maxx C is banned here in  TCG, I've noticed that most combo decks are not afraid to continue their combo and most of them will not be stopped by 1 or 2 handtraps. So I've decided to use a handtrap that impacts them in a whole turn.</li>  	<li>Infinite Impermanence - A pretty handy handtrap since it you can use this on either player's turn considering you control no cards on the field.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><strong>SIDE DECK EXPLANATION</strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Dinowrestler Pankratops - A free body card and can pop  your opponent's card. Good card to use if you want to bait your opponent's negate.</li>  	<li>Artifact Lancea - A handy card to use against banish type deck.</li>  	<li>Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit - Since Numeron is still a thing in TCG, this card is a must.</li>  	<li>Mask Change - The single mask change that's in the side deck because this build is blind going 2nd. Side this in if you are planning to go 1st.</li>  	<li>Twin Twisters - A must have card against backrow decks. I was not planning to put this card if Pankratops is not limited.</li>  	<li>Prohibition - Since Crossout Designator is not available in TCG, this card is a must have if you don't want to get Nibiru'd</li>  	<li>Summon Limit - A substitute for Vanity's Emptiness since it's banned in TCG.</li>  	<li>Anti-Spell Fragrance - Kinda like Imperial Order so i put 2 of  it.</li>  	<li>Imperial Order - Self explanatory card.</li>  	<li>Red Reboot - Another self explanatory card</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong><span>REMINDERS</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>Always keep in mind to bait your opponent's negation/disruption.</li>  	<li>As much as possible you want to activate another card before chaining Forbidden Droplet, so you can send that card on the field to the GY. That way you can save some resources.</li>  	<li>As much as possible avoid using a monster handtrap if you're oppoent doesn't have a monster on the field, you might get baited so that they can use PSY-Framegear Gamma.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The most famous deck of this archetype is the Invoked Dogmatika, just by reading you know what the deck would look like so I've made a little bit of tweaking. I did not put a shaddoll engine here since it's gonna be inconsistent, so I've added cards that will cover up the deck's weak point. By adding more draw power, disruption , and board break cards I've been able to add more consistency to it and increase it's board breaking ability. The major problem of this deck is that if you do not have access to aleister or nadir/ecclesia, it'll be a hard game for you, luckily with the help of the handtraps, trap cards, and draw cards the probability of it happening will be lower, even if it happens you will have time to gather resources since your traps will buy you time.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>UNIQUE CARDS EXPLANATION</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>Dinowrestler Pankratops - Since you will not always be the one winning the decision on who will go 1st, I've put this in the main deck just in case.

The reason for that is because of thunder dragon, just by putting thunder dragon colossus in the field will be a nightmare for HERO users. I removed Destiny HERO - Celestial and Triple Tactics Talent, the reason for that it's because most of the time i can't use their effect. I've also cut Fusion Destiny to 2 since I removed Celestial, I can now only use 1 Fusion Destiny once per game due to the lack of material. With those adjustments, my HERO deck will now be more consistent and will have an additional negation. I've also made some changes in the side deck since some of the previous cards in it are not as effective as I have imagined.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>SIDE DECK EXPLANATION</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>Nibiru, The Primal Being - I only run 1 copy of it since it's just a target for Crossout Designator.</li>  	<li>Dinowrestler Pankratops - A handy card to pop one of my opponent's card .</li>  	<li>Artifact Lancea - Good against deck that needs to banish cards. Decks like Thunder Dragon, Phantom Knights, etc.</li>  	<li>Droll &amp; Lock Bird - If you think ash blossom is not enough to stop your opponent's combo, use this card instead.</li>  	<li>Mask Change - The last mask change is in the side deck because this build is for blind going 2nd. I know mask change is a good card but it can be a brick if I run 3 copies of it in the main deck while my goal is to break my opponent's board.</li>  	<li>Crossout Designator - I was wrong about this card, this card is my savior against Nibiru, Maxx C, etc.</li>  	<li>Vanity's Emptiness - A self explanatory card.</li>  	<li>Anti-Spell Fragrance - It's like a nerfed Imperial Order.</li>  	<li>Imperial Order - Another self explanatory card.</li>  	<li>Red Reboot - Once again a self explanatory card.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong><span>REMINDERS</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>Even if your opponent's end board going 1st will have multiple negates/disruption, don't be afraid to still go 2nd because this deck has more cards of break boarding compared and handtraps compared to it's control cards.</li>  	<li>Always use a card effect first before chaining Forbidden Droplet, it will help you save resources since you can send the activated card on the field to the GY and it will still resolve normally.</li>  	<li>Always think of the possible situation if your opponent negates a certain card that you'll use, think of a fallback option so that you will still put on a board.</li>  	<li>If you think your opponent runs PSY-Framegear Gamma in their main deck, as much as possible don't use a monster handtrap when they don't control a monster since you'll just get baited.</li> </ul>"

The Mayakashi engine is pretty straightforward, you want to use Hajun to summon Dakki and begin Synchro climbing to Gashadokuro, with Yuki Musume as an extender that can either start another ladder, or preferably help make the powerful Link 4 Yuki-Onna the Absolute Zero Mayakashi. She can make the ATK of a monster 0 and negate it's effects when a monster is summoned from, or an effect is activated in the GY up to twice per turn.  As for Eldlich, he provides a notorious advantage engine over the course of interrupting your opponent with soldiers of the Golden Land and summoning himself or other Zombies with the Eldlixirs, all of which float in the GY.  Cards such as Yuki-Musume can help get Golden Lord to the GY so you can SS him by his own effect. And the Scarlet and White Eldlixirs can revive any Zombie from the GY while Golden Lord is on the field, allowing you to summon your Mayakashi Synchros from the GY proactively to pop stuff, instead of waiting for your opponent to destroy the current one on the board.  The two archetypes are pretty easy to grasp on their own, and do not get in each others way. So I thought I would make a quick profile on it. I'm not a master of either of these two themes, so feel free to correct any misunderstanding I might have in the comments, or ask any other questions."

Welcome to my take on Unchained. Below I've laid out my deck list choices, I hope they inspire you in your take on the deck. Please leave a comment if you like my choices or have any suggestions for improvements :). Cheers from the Netherlands  I will discuss the following 3 bullet points: <ul>  	<li>Why blind 2nd?</li>  	<li>Card choices</li>  	<li>Main combo/opening hands</li>  	<li>Final comment on outing Dragoon</li> </ul> <strong>Why blind 2nd</strong>?  I dont think there is much debate here. I have played going 1st and 2nd versions a lot. What ends up happening is that your line of play is pretty much the same either way, but in a going 2nd strategy you can use your opponents monsters as link material instead of ending on a mediocre board with 1 - 3 interruptions.  <strong>Card choices</strong> <ul>  	<li>3x all of the Unchained monsters. Pretty standard. Optionally you can play 2x Sarama, this decreases consistency and grind game but increases the ceiling of the deck.</li>  	<li>2x Abominable and 1x Soul of disaster. Pretty standard too. I would love to play 2x Soul of disaster but its too much of a brick imo.</li>  	<li>3x Ash blossom. Most generic hand trap in game.</li>  	<li>3x gamma + driver. This hand trap is NUTS. Not just in general, but specifically in this deck. You play 3x Extrav, 3x Aruha and 3x Rota which all activate in your hand with no monsters on the field (get the hint already???). Also, you often end up with no monsters on the field due to ramming your monsters into your opponents with the goal of triggering their effects in battle phase (giving you an empty board).</li>  	<li>2x DD Crow. This is really up to you and nr 1 card choice you can/should change. Its just that DD Crow is a personal favourite of mine, with banishing not just monsters and being a quick effect it really provides a unique game mechanic (e.g. hit Miscellaneousaurus from Dinos).</li>  	<li>1x Pankratops. Hands down this card gets banned next banlist (works really well with evenly matched I must point out).</li>  	<li>3x rota.</li>  	<li>3x Extravagance.</li>  	<li>1x Harpie feather duster.</li>  	<li>2x Dark ruler no more. Amazing in this deck under the right circumstances. You could play 3 but I think its too much with 3x Extravagance.</li>  	<li>3x of both Unchained traps.</li>  	<li>3x Evenly matched. I can not express how much I love this card. Especially in Unchained too, since skipping battle phase does pretty much nothing (you will OTK in only 1/10 games, mostly you will do 3x 1500 + 300 damage anyway).</li> </ul> <strong>Card choices (extra deck)</strong> <ul>  	<li>3x Unchained link 2, 3</li>  	<li>2x Unchained Abomination</li>  	<li>2x Knightmare unicorn (going into unicorn on opponents turn is gold!)</li>  	<li>Topologic zeroboros and Bomber dragon are both nice options to keep the interruptions interactive on opps turn (bomber dragon for Salamangreat/Crusadia e.g.,  Zeroboros for any deck that can Soul charge/spam tokens)</li>  	<li>Framelord omega</li>  	<li>Pegasus @Ignister is INSANE against Dogmatika. The synergy with this deck is unreal</li>  	<li>Dingirsu for non targeting and non destructive removal. Be careful with the fiend lock in this deck ofc.</li> </ul> <strong>Card choices (side)</strong> <ul>  	<li>DD Crow, as I said personal favourite.</li>  	<li>Artifact package. You can pop your own Scythe if you have too</li>  	<li>Cosmic cyclone and Heavy storm duster for instant win against backrow.</li>  	<li>Imperial order and Skill drain are free Ws. Especially skill drain is must for this deck, having all your Unchained monsters activate in GY.</li>  	<li>3x Lancea because Dino matchup is really bad. Like really hah.</li> </ul> <strong>Main combo/opening hands</strong> <ul>  	<li>As I said earlier, Gamma + 1 of (rota, Extrav, Aruha) is on itself full combo. Make sure to use the Gamma to go into Omega for the +1 ;).</li>  	<li>Dark ruler + any Unchained monster is full break a board. Activate Dark ruler, ram monster and bring either Abominable or Soul of disaster to the field and go on from there.</li>  	<li>Evenly matched. Activate evenly matched, if it resolves you win, if it doesnt, do the standard Aruha/Rakea + trap combo.</li> </ul> <strong>Final comment on outing dragoon</strong> <ul>  	<li>Under the right circumstances, facing a Dragoon can be an instant scoop. Know how to deal with this card. Best is to go straight to battle phase, ram Unchained monster, and bring out Abominable to ram into the dragoon. If your monster eff in GY gets negated by dragoon that is actually pretty good, because it does not gain the +1k Atk stat. Also, activating Rakea on field instead of Aruha in hand is also encouraged if you must because Aruha does not trigger when destroyed from hand.</li> </ul> &nbsp;"

Combo tutorial: <a>https://bit.ly/3lWdZ8n</a>  Endboard is VFD with Chaos Ruler (can Borreload Savage too, but it lacks follow-up) and since our goal is to send <strong>Baking</strong> and <strong>Plaguespreader</strong> to GY, <strong>Uni-Zombie/Shiranui Solitaire</strong> are the best starter. To complement that we use Foolish Burial, One for One, and Tuner's High. We don't use Allure of Darkness as we need our Skull Servants in GY, Tuner's High kinda replace its role tho. King of the Skull Servants act as follow-up, 3 copies for easier search via Chaos Ruler or 2 draws from our combo, Monster Reborn works good too since we will have 1 King in GY (and 4 Skull Servants, means 4k via Monster Reborn, 5k if it's not) while being great extender. Chaos Ruler also can re-summon itself while dumping more Skull Servant and/or Plaguspreader, making our follow-up play legit. The rest are just staples, better with dark/light attribute (Nibiru and Veiler) as Chaos Ruler target for extra interruption.  Pros: Legit board with follow-up and staples.  Cons: Skull Servant theme is brick city."

Plus sides to getting  high as all hell? Fuel to making bad yu-gi-oh decks. My personal drug addiction aside, we have a new deck here; Dragonmaids with a Invoked engine. I adore Dragonmaids, but personally, I found that they're not super powerful on their own. To supplement this, I included a Invoked engine, which is great for spamming out multiple fusions to help the Dragonmaids. It also mashes quite well with the Dragonmaids, as the Dragonmaids have an array of attributes. Now, onto the guide. You'll want to get a low level Dragonmaid out to activate their effect, whether it be searching or sending a card to the GY. Your goal should be to turbo out House as fast as possible, then use the engine pieces for Invoked to get out whatever you can, based off of what's on hand. Then go into the battle phase, and bounce the low level Dragonmaids back to the hand for stronger ones from the hand or GY. Deck list explanation. We have the core dragonmaid cards, with the usual shit. For the humanoid forms, 3 kitchen, 3 chamber, 3 parlor, and 1 nurse. Kitchen is great for searching cards, Chamber is great for searching the fusion spell, Chamber is great for GY set up, and Nurse is good for late game revival to go into combos. We also have all of their dragon forms, which can be used to go into during the battle phase.  We have their fusion spell, to get out House as fast as possible, Send-off to special out monsters, Tidying for removal, and the other trap I forget the name of for searching. We also have House in the extra deck, and then Sheou, House's dragon form. You'll want to get out House, use her for a little bit to get off her effects for removal, and then fuse into Sheou. Invoked Engine The invoked engine carries 3 Aleister as a main core of it, for fusion material, Invokation is their fusion spell, and Magical Meltdown for searching Aleister. In the extra deck, we have lots of their fusion monsters, all of which are choices you can make based off of the attributes you have on hand and the attributes you have. As always, any suggestion or advice is appreciated. Have a good day. (Also, i know y'all prob don't care, but I got a GF! It's housewife time)"

This deck always wants to go first so you can full combo and prevent them from playing. I didn't feel like doing a combo tutorial on this deck because I didn't think it was necessary. You should by now know the synchro, orcust, and phantom knights combo as its nothing new. The deck is just full of extenders and really pushes the Orcust, Phantom Knights and Dark Warrior engines to their fullest potential. In my experience, the deck doesn't brick very much and is pretty consistent. I will explain the small combos here you may not already know exist within the deck. The basic Orcust and Synchro combo are in here for more draw power and getting out Apollousa. There are extenders like Chaos Space for the baby dragons and discarding the Orcust pieces. The Meklord combo is easy. Use <a data-name=""Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core"">Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core</a>'s effect to search out <a data-name=""Meklord Assembly"">Meklord Assembly</a> and then use Meklord Assembly to search out <a data-name=""Meklord Emperor Wisel - Synchro Absorption"">Meklord Emperor Wisel - Synchro Absorption</a> and use Meklord Assembly's second effect to discard an Orcust monster or whatever you to want to discard that will benefit you and destroy Nucleus to bring out <a data-name=""Meklord Emperor Wisel"">Meklord Emperor Wisel</a> then you can go full synchro combo if you had an extender like Adhara or the baby dragons. Then after all that, going into Apollousa, you should do full Orcust combo and then Phantom Knight combo to get one Fog Blade and the Phantom Knight rank up magic spell. You must have Dingrisu in grave to do the rank up magic combo. During their main phase use Cymbal Skeleton in grave to summon Ding but dont use dings effect unless its to send a card from field to grave. Then use rank up magic to go into <a data-name=""True King of all Calamities"">True King of all Calamities</a>. I suppose if someone comments down below for a combo tutorial I will do it and upload the replay to mediafire for you guys. But most combos here aren't anything new except the Meklord one I came up with that is an extended play. Using <a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a> to discard an Orcust monster for full Orcust combo is also another great play we all love lol. Another small tip you may not realize is using Adhara plus another monster you can go into Haqlifibrax and summon Brass Bombard which is full Orcust combo, especially if you have another Orcust monster to special summon off Bombard's graveyard effect. As always, I hope you guys enjoy the deck profile and stay tuned for more awesome custom deck profiles made by me!"

Too many combo variations and end boards to list, but that is the basic concept.

Hope you enjoy!,"Invoked and Magistus are two decks I think that they synergize quite well together making for some interesting plays. The deck focuses more on hitting your opponent when time arises, or by making some power plays. Magistus is a interesting archetype that equips Magistus monsters from the extra deck to themselves for effects, which I found to be a pretty neat idea!  Here is a quick explanation of each of the Magistus bosses: Vafram can destroy your all of your opponent's face up cards when he is destroyed, if he is equipped to a monster the equipped monster cannot be destroyed by spells and traps. <a data-name=""Ninaruru"">Ninaruru can destroy a s/t your opponent controls as long as you destroy a Magistus card in your own s/t zone, and when she is equipped to a monster, it can attack twice. </a>  <a data-name=""Ninaruru"">Finally, we have Saint Aiwass who can (target) a monster on the field during either players main phase and equip himself to the selected monster. If you equipped him to an opponents monster, you take control of it.

Kryptonite against decks that relies heavily on extra deck.,"<strong><span>OVERVIEW</span></strong>  I've been brainstorming on how to improve Nekroz's consistency and efficiency since unicore has been of the banlist. Sadly since we're in an era where handtrap is most likely in a deck, adjusting the deck became much more challenging to the point where it's consistency decreases and it's endboard is not that worth due to it's consistency. But the Dogmatika Archetype made Nekroz's life much easier: increasing their consistency, disruption, board breaking, and it's sustainability against extra deck reliant decks. These two archetypes are like kryptonite against decks that relies on their extra deck a lot: with nekroz having unicore who is a skill drain against monsters that are summoned from the extra deck and of course there is brionac who is a multipurpose card, it can be used to search a Nekroz monster or  you can ritual summon it to bounce 2 extra deck monsters, and lastly the Dogmatika monsters, ecclesia provides a sustain since she can't be destroyed by battle against extra deck monsters, and the best monster in the Dogmatika when using it with nekroz is Maximus, he can dump Herald of the Arc Light and Titaniklad/Wind Pegasus/N'tss/Skull Knight which will result in a huge advantage for the user since you can search for a ritual monster/spell and still have a negation/destroy. Overall I'm quite satisfied with this build since it can compete with meta decks, though do note that in order to utilize this deck's full potential you need to analyze your opponent's deck and in and outs of this deck, since this deck is only as good as it's user.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>2 CARD COMBO (BRIONAC + ANY IMPCANTATION MONSTER BESIDES TALISMANDRA AND CHALISLIME)</span></strong>  Take note that you don't need to specifically draw these two cards in your opening hand in order to perform this combo. The main goal of this is to have access to Cyber Angel Benten be used in a Ritual Summon in order to search for Vanity's Ruler, while having two monsters on the field without having use your normal summon, so that you can tribute Summon Vanity's Ruler <ul>  	<li>Use the Impcantation monster's effect two special summon Impcantation Talismandra, use Talismandra's effect in order to search for Cyber Angel Benten.</li>  	<li>Use Brionac's effect to search for Clausolas, then use it's effect to search for Nekroz Cycle.</li>  	<li>Use Nekroz Cycle to special summon Brionac from the GY, tributing Cyber Angel Benten. Use Benten's effect to search for Vanity's Ruler.</li>  	<li>Tribute summon Vanity's Ruler using the two Impcantation monsters.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong><span>EXTRA DECKS MONSTERS EXPLANATION</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>Elder Entity N'tss - It's a standard card to run for Nekroz and Dogmatika since these two archetypes sends a lot of extra deck monsters to GY to function.</li>  	<li>PSY-Framelord Omega - Good for recycling your extra deck monster in the GY. This can also be used to remove a card from your opponent's GY.</li>  	<li>Wind Pegasus @Ignister - A good card to be in the GY since it will make your opponent think twice to destroy your monsters because this can send their monster back to the deck/extra deck if they do so.</li>  	<li>Daigusto Emeral - Good in the grind game, though you will not use this most of your games.</li>  	<li>Nephthys, The Sacred Flame - If your opponent's deck have trouble against a monster that has a high attack, cannot be destroyed by battle and card effect, and cannot be targeted by card effects, the this dude is your saviour.</li>  	<li>Eria the Water Charmer, Gentle - Same reason as Daigusto Emeral.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong><span>SIDE DECK CARDS EXPLANATION</span></strong>  So most cards in this are for going 2nd since the main deck is not that great for breaking boards. <ul>  	<li>Artifact Lancea - Good to side against decks that needs to banish cards. You can also use this to avoid macro cosmos, D.D. Crow, Dimension Shifter, etc.</li>  	<li>Droll &amp; Lock Bird - Since this deck cannot run handtraps like Ash Blossom and Infinite Impermanence, using a handtrap that has a lingering effect will be wiser since it will greatly limit your opponent's options. Droll is really good at today's meta in TCG since Called By The Grave is limited and there is not Crossout Designator. Also most combo decks now doesn't care if they got handtraps like 1-2 times since they can still put a decent board.</li>  	<li>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon - Super Poly target 1.</li>  	<li>Mudragon of the Swamp - Super Poly target 2.</li>  	<li>Dark Ruler No More - Good to side against a going 1st combo deck, this card paired with evenly matched is a nightmare for them.</li>  	<li>Cosmic Cyclone - Good against backrow decks. I use 2 of this instead 2 of twin twisters since this deck needs many resources as much as possible.</li>  	<li>Twin Twisters - I only use this if my opponent's backrow is so annoying.</li>  	<li>Super Polymerization - Self explanatory card.</li>  	<li>Evenly Matched - Board breaker. Pair this with Dark Ruler No More and your opponent will be cryin'.</li> </ul> <strong><span>REMINDERS</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>Don't forget about the Nekroz's ritual spells effect in the GY.</li>  	<li>Trishula's effect needs to banish exactly 3 cards from hand, field, and GY.</li>  	<li>Be wise what to dump from the extra deck.</li>  	<li>This deck is only as good as it's user.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

In this way the opponent, no matter how powerful monsters he has, It will not be able to attack you as long as the two-card combo is active.  &nbsp;  You will then need to use the rest of the cards and especially the combo Gold Sarcophagus + Necroface to remove as many cards from the game as possible, in this way, once a Helios/Golden Homunculus card is evoked, their attack will be so high that they can wipe out any monster of the opponent.  Useful combos: <ul>  	<li>D.D Survivor can be used to evoke Helios/Homunculus, once removed from the field it can return at the end of the turn and can be useful in case you have no more monsters in the field.</li>  	<li>Chaos Zone + Necroface + (Soul Release) is very convenient in case many monsters have been removed from the game, in this case it is ensured that once per turn any monster can be resummoned.</li>  	<li>The Cheerful Coffin, Monster Gate and Dimensional Alchemist are very useful in combination with Soul Release to increase the attack of Helios or to have monsters removed from the deck, so they can be re-enacted via Chaos Zone or d.d.r Different Dimension Reincarnation</li>  	<li>Soul Absorption and Graverobber's Retribution are used to heal the LP and respectively to inflict constant damage to the opponent's LP.</li> </ul>"

I myself have suffered horrifying defeats at the hands of this list, and as such decided that I’d put out a guide for the Halloween season. This list brings you all the terror </span></span><span><span>of the monstrous Mayakashi archetype, a collection of spirits based on Japanese yōkai. These spirits are in perpetual conflict with the demon-hunting Shiranui archetype, however they have agreed to put aside their conflict for th</span></span><span><span>e sake of this list. Aside from them we also have a variety of zombie favourites and tech choices to bring you all the terror of Halloween right from the comfort of your own haunt. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>2. Deck-list and Tech Choices</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><u><b>Main-deck Mayakashi and Miscellaneous Zombies</b></u></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi x 3</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>We begin with the deck’s hyper-extender and the primary set-up tool of the Mayakashi archetype. Dakki is a real force to be reckoned with; </span></span><span><span>a</span></span><span><span>s long as your starting hand has Dakki or one of the many ways to find her you are pretty much guaranteed to climb through all of the Mayakashi synchros and some of the links as well. This is due to Dakki’s effect laughing in the face of popular interruptions such as Nibiru or Infinite Impermanence, thanks to it being a Trigger Effect that activate</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span> in the graveyard. The one downside to Dakki is her permanent xeno-lock effect: as long as her effect activates you will be locked into Mayakshi extra deck monsters for the rest of the turn, </span></span><span><span><i>even if she leaves the field.</i></span></span><span><span> We run this at </span></span><span><span>three</span></span><span><span> to boost the consistency of the deck’s most resilient hand (</span></span><span><span>m</span></span><span><span>entioned at length in the Combo Guide) but </span></span><span><span>running two</span></span><span><span> is acceptable if you’re tight on main-deck space.    </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Hajun, the Winged Mayakashi x 3</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Hajun functions as the deck’s primary starter next to Glow-Up Bloom, searching either Dakki or Yuki-Musume on summon. It should be noted that the effect triggers on any sort of summon, so One for One is a direct 4th copy of Hajun. Along with Mayakashi Return this boosts the consistency of opening Hajun or a way to search it to </span></span><span><span><b>58%</b></span></span><span><span>, a respectable average for any starter. It should again be mentioned that Hajun xeno-locks you into Mayakashi extra deck monsters, although unlike Dakki as long as you can link-off Hajun the effect is not continuous. We play </span></span><span><span>three</span></span><span><span> copies of Hajun here for consistency of our main combo, but you can experiment with less if you’d like to try other starters. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Yuki-Musume, the Ice Mayakashi x 3</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>As the last of the main deck Mayakashi </span></span><span><span>m</span></span><span><span>onsters, Yuki-Musume fills the final role as an advantage generator. It functions as a once-per-turn </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>oolish </span></span><span><span>B</span></span><span><span>urial for any zombie monster as long as it’s in your hand or graveyard and you control a Mayakashi monster. Since this lets you foolish any zombie we can preform lines with Glow-Up Bloom if we drew Zombie World or lines with Necroworld Banshee if we did not. Both of those option leave us with full Mayakashi combo plus at least Zombie World and potentially Balerdroch for the negate and banish. For these reasons we play </span></span><span><span>three; </span></span><span><span>you can experiment with less but it will directly effect you</span></span><span><span>r</span></span><span><span> resource loop’s consistency. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Doomking Balerdroch x 2</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>At last out of the main-deck Mayakashis we come to the Zombie World portion of the deck, starting with it</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span> boss Doomking Balerdroch. You have several ways of getting to Balerdroch </span></span><span>—</span><span><span> chiefly Glow-Up Bloom — but honestly anything that gets it in the grave works fine as long as you or your opponent controls a field spell. Once on field Balerdroch represents a banish or negate that is triggered by any zombie effect anywhere, including the hand. This allows clever plays with our hand-traps of choice or </span></span><span><span>our</span></span><span><span> opponents’ depending on the meta. Balerdroch represents an additional recursive body for link climbs on your turn, and often this looping of monsters is enough to overwhelm your opponent in </span></span><span><span>conjunction</span></span><span><span> with the aforementioned banish-and-negate plus your innate Mayakashi effects from the grave. We play </span></span><span><span>two</span></span><span><span> because its very searchable and easy to </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>oolish, plus it tends to brick at </span></span><span><span>three</span></span><span><span>. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Jack O’Bolan x 2</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Another stop on the standard Zombie-deck express, Jack O’Bolan is a fantastic way to unclog bricky hands. You can discard a variety of things to summon him </span></span><span>—</span><span><span> ideally Balerdroch or Glow-Up Bloom — but there are as many options as there are </span></span><span><span>z</span></span><span><span>ombies that plus in the grave. It can be funny and devastating to use his effect in conjunction with Zombie World to steal your opponents’ destroyed monsters, only to link them off and have it banished when it leaves the field. Due to his convenient level he can also help jump-start your Mayakashi lines with Dakki into Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi (more on this in the Combo Guide). Overall he’s worth running at </span></span><span><span>two</span></span><span><span> but considering he can searched off Glow-Up Bloom, any more would bloat the deck. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom x 1</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>So here’s a fun one, Hela is not the best in her own archetype but here she synergizes amazingly. We summon her off of the same fundamental Glow-Up Bloom line we summon Balerdroch with, so she’s not exactly a rare sight. Her effect lets us not only get rid off Yuki-Mususme or Balerdroch for advantage, but also summon any </span></span><span><span>z</span></span><span><span>ombie we want in our grave. This can be used on your opponent’s turn in order to generate interruptions in the form of the Mayakashi synchro monsters’ on-summon effects, such as Yoko’s pop or Tengu’s </span></span><span><span>backrow disruption</span></span><span><span>. Of course, doing this is also an excellent way to trigger Balerdroch’s banish proactively to shut down your opponent’s plays. We only play one copy of Hela due to Glow-Up Bloom ratios but more could be an option. </span></span><span><span>P</span></span><span><span>erhaps </span></span><span><span>you could experiment</span></span><span><span> with a greater Generaider package as non</span></span><span><span>e</span></span><span><span> of our xeno-locks stop us summoning from deck. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Glow-Up Bloom x 3</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>We’ve already talked at length about the uses of Glow-Up Bloom so I won’t belabour the point too much. Glow-Up Bloom is an auto-include in anything playing Balerdroch in my opinion. It can be bricky, but we have an out to that (see Combo Guide). It’s obviously most powerful when Zombie World is on the field, but even adding a zombie to hand can secure a follow-up play </span></span><span><span>for </span></span><span><span>next turn. We would honestly run </span></span><span><span>four </span></span><span><span>if we could! </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>eel free to experiment with you own ratios, but be prepared for the cohesiveness of your build </span></span><span><span>to</span></span><span><span> suffer.      </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Necroworld Banshee x 2</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>So in a deck that depends on its field spell for interruption and recursion, are you really going to turn down extra copies of Terraforming? We don’t play three due to it being highly searchable with most of your standard lines, and it clogging up the deck’s valuable normal summon in the hand. Feel free to experiment with this slot; the ratios are up to preference and how much you value Zombie World in the current meta.    </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Mezuki x 1</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>We end the monsters on a truly classic zombie: Mezuki has been a staple in Zombie World lists since its release. In this deck it’s there to help extend and insulate your lines against hand-traps due to the myriad of ways to </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>oolish zombies in the deck. You don’t really want to see Mezuki in the opene</span></span><span><span>r </span></span><span><span>without Jack O’Bolan or another way to discard for cost, so we choose to run one. You could experiment with more and maybe even a copy or two of Gozuki and Shiranui Solitaire if you value extension. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><u><b>Spells and Traps</b></u></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Mayakashi Return x 3</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>W</span></span><span><span>e start the spell and trap section with a huge consistency booster in Mayakashi Return. It searches or </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>oolishes all of the Mayakashis, most importantly Hajun in the event you don’t have Yuki-Musume in your opener. It can also be used to extend with Yuki-Mususme if you drew Dakki and Hajun. </span></span><span><span>Additionally, Return can be</span></span><span><span> used to search all the Mayakashi Spells and Traps. Overall I think this card is an auto-include at </span></span><span><span>three </span></span><span><span>in any Mayakashi build for how much it boosts the consistency of your </span></span><span><span>lines</span></span><span><span>. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Mayakashi Winter x 1</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>I’ll be honest, Winter is pretty bad. </span></span><span><span>It</span></span><span><span>s first and second effect are largely irrelevant in this build</span></span><span><span>, but w</span></span><span><span>e play it </span></span><span><span>for</span></span><span><span> its graveyard effect. </span></span><span><span>I</span></span><span><span>t allows us to convert an extra Mayakashi Return into a potential pop for monsters, spells, or traps depending on the contents of your graveyard. This can also be used to further your </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span> lines on the crack-back. You could cut this in favour of another Monster Reborn-style effect if you think it would synergize better with your build. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Mayakashi Metamorphosis x 2</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Metamorphosis is our best </span></span><span><span>R</span></span><span><span>eborn option. </span></span><span><span>I</span></span><span><span>t not only summons but also provides protection from targeting and a discard, which can unbrick cards like Yuki-Musume or Mezuki from your hand. Obviously you can search it with Return as with all Mayakashi cards, boosting the consistency of seeing it. The key use of this card is summoning your synchros on your opponent’s turn to interrupt their combos with a well-placed pop or mill. You can absolutely fiddle with the ratios of this one, although we like it at two as it complements the above-mentioned Winter and </span></span><span><span>R</span></span><span><span>eturn nicely. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Zombie World x 3</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Zombie World has a storied history of meta and off-meta play over the years; it remains a rogue-</span></span><span><span>t</span></span><span><span>ier strategy in many tournaments to this day. This list’</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span> use of the card focuses on its type-changing effect to lock your opponent out of summoning with Rivalry of Warlords. There are several ways to search this card including Terraforming and the a</span></span><span><span>fore</span></span><span><span>mentioned Necroworld Banshee, which can be </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>oolished as a part of your opening combo using Yuki-Musume if you don’t have need of her other targets. We have experimented with running Set Rotation and Magical Mid-Breaker Field to boost the consistency of Zombie World and shut down </span></span><span><span>your</span></span><span><span> opponent’s use of field spells and ability to target. It might be worth experimenting with if you’re so inclined, otherwise just play three. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Terraforming x 1</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>There’s not much need to explain this one. Terraforming is a </span></span><span><span>four</span></span><span><span>th copy of Zombie World and potentially more if you run the Set Rotation combo mentioned above. We’ve discussed using Metaverse as well, but ultimately we felt it wasn’t worth the extra card. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Rivalry of Warlords x 3</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Here we come to the most crucial half of the eponymous Rivalry lock. In conjunction with Zombie World, you can lock your opponent out of summoning anything other than zombie monsters. This disrupts the majority of current strategies aside from Eldlich (as of Oct. 2020) and makes up a large part of how this list deals with higher-tier opponents on the play. Balerdroch can be helpful for keeping the lock on field for longer with his recursive negate, along with any of your Mayakashi</span></span><span><span>s</span></span> <span><span>graveyard</span></span><span><span> effects. I would say that any </span></span><span><span>r</span></span><span><span>ogue-tier or below zombie deck should be playing Rivalry, but if you dislike locks feel free to switch these for more handtraps. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>One for One x 1</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Another format staple, One for One is an additional copy of Hajun that can plus you depending on what you discard. Obviously we want to play as many consistency boosters for our starter as possible, so I wouldn’t consider this slot mutable if you want to run the lines we do (</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>ee Combo Guide). It being a special summon from deck also opens up explosive lines with certain main-deck Mayakashi monsters. If for some reason this ever gets off the limited list, run as many as you can.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Foolish Burial x 1</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>I’ve referenced this card several times as a catch-all for any effect that sends cards from the deck to the graveyard. Obviously in a zombie deck this card is near-mandatory in my opinion as it sets up Yuki-Mususme or Mezuki for set-up or extension respectively. Most of the time you’ll be sending Yuki-Musume to either set up Necroworld Banshee or Glow-Up Bloom for Balerdroch. Overall an amazing card; as with One for One, if it ever gets unlimited we’ll be playing more.    </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Pot of Avarice x 2</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Pot of Avarice is pretty broken in Midrange. It’s especially relevant here since we are trying to dump a minimum of six optimal targets on the first turn </span></span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>based on any hand with Hajun or access to him). From there Avarice is basically a Pot of Greed that refreshes your deck and allows you to synchro climb again. We only play two due to space constraints in this build, but three is a valid option </span></span><span>—</span><span><span> feel free to experiment. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Forbidden Droplet x 3</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>We finish</span></span></span><span><span><span> off the Spells and Traps </span></span></span><span><span><span>section </span></span></span><span><span><span>with the forma</span></span></span><span><span><span>t-</span></span></span><span><span><span>staple board-breaker Forbidden Droplet. We play it here as an out to the various </span></span></span><span><span><span>T</span></span></span><span><span><span>owers most decks are playing, and as </span></span></span><span><span><span>a</span></span></span><span><span><span> tool for simplifying boards going second. The discard for cost is obviously helpful here as we have monsters and spells that plus in the graveyard: Winter or Yuki-Musume for example. The slot could also be used for Super Poly — you’ll see below that we side it, but if you prefer it </span></span></span><span><span><span>then</span></span></span><span><span><span> feel free to take this out. I would caution that extra deck space is tight, so this will be a little more consisten</span></span></span><span><span><span>t</span></span></span><span><span><span>.    </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><u><b>Handtraps and The Side Deck</b></u></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Notes on The Side and format techs</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Before I start on the hand-traps we play in this list </span></span></span><span><span><span>I’</span></span></span><span><span><span>d like to go over Jazzy_Sue’s position on the </span></span></span><span><span><span>side deck’s use</span></span></span><span><span><span>. The</span></span></span><span><span><span>y believe the side deck</span></span></span> <span><span><span>should </span></span></span><span><span><span>be used to patch up holes in the deck’s capabilities: as an example we play Lightning Storm in the side to help with the Mayakashis’ lack of bulk removal for spells or traps. You are welcome to play whatever you personally think is relevant, or just stick with our list. It wasn’t made with any particular tournament in mind so some fine-</span></span></span><span><span><span>t</span></span></span><span><span><span>uning would be wise if you intend to play this list in one.    </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring x 3</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Ash is not a particularly strong hand-trap in a vacuum in my opinion due to its lack of destruction, but as a compliment to other disruption it can shut down a wide array of plays. In this list, that other disruption is normally some combination of: Rivalry, Zombie World or Balerdroch. The last is especially relevant as </span></span></span><span><span><span>A</span></span></span><span><span><span>sh is a zombie and can therefore trigger </span></span></span><span><span><span>B</span></span></span><span><span><span>alerdroch’s effect to banish natively whenever your opponent searches. If you’re particularly attached to another option for this slot, feel free to switch it out at the cost of some synergy. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion x 3</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>This pick is slightly more useful in this particular build, as it allows us to protect the one resource that really matters: the graveyard. Due to the toolbox style of the Mayakashis’ on-</span></span></span><span><span><span>s</span></span></span><span><span><span>ummon effects, banishing from the grave is devastating for our lines and interruption. Since the effect can be used </span></span></span><span><span><span>on</span></span></span><span><span><span> both graveyards there are a fa</span></span></span><span><span><span>ir</span></span></span><span><span><span> number of decks that don’t like to see this card. Ghost Belle’s effect will also trigger Balerdroch due to Ghost Belle being a </span></span></span><span><span><span>zombie</span></span></span><span><span><span> like Ash. Feel free to try other options in this slot, we mostly run it due to it being Jazzy_Sue’s favourite hand-trap.    </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><u><b>The Extra Deck</b></u></span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Oboro-Guruma, the Wheeled Mayakashi x 1</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>We begin our look at the extra deck with the worst Mayakashi synchro. Oboro-Guruma is almost entirely here to help with dumping our synchros in the grave on turn one. Once he’s in the grave, Oboro-Guruma is most useful as a banish target to trigger your other Mayakashi synchro’s summon-from-the-grave effects. The battle protection can be useful as a last-ditch stall in a pinch, I guess. You really can’t play less of this if you want the first-turn combo to work properly but play more if you value battle protection. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Tsuchigumo, the Poisonous Mayakashi x 1</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Tsuchigumo is another not-great extra deck pick we play to assist with our initial climb. The mill effect on summon can potentially be useful for setup if you hit the right cards or in very grindy match-ups. This one is also a good banish for other stronger Mayakashi summons on your opponent’s turn. I would recommend running one of these for the sake of your first-turn play. but running any more is probably unnecessary as there are better uses for extra deck space. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Tengu, the Winged Mayakashi x 2</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Finally we come to a good Mayakshi synchro, Tengu being the first that we want to special summon on our opponent’s turn. When summoned this way Tengu pops an opponent’s spell or trap, allowing you to take out problem cards like like Dragunity Divine Lance or Dragon Buster Destruction Sword and allowing you to shut off your opponent’s combos or locks. Since the effect activates on the field it’s still vulnerable to Mystic Mine, but there are side deck options to compensate for this. We run two Tengu in this build in response to the current popularity of decks like Sky Striker, Salamangreat, and Monarchs. As mentioned above this is to out various back-row locks and combo pieces; if back-row becomes less prevalent then I’d recommend playing one of these. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi x 2</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Yoko is by far the best Mayakashi extra deck monster, just like its main-deck counterpart Dakki. Its on-summon effect is a non-targeted pop of any monster, which is certainly worth the two extra slots it takes up. This will form the backbone of your active disruptions, as aside from the pop Yoko is also blessed with a reasonable attack stat of 2900. This often allows it to clean up your opponent’s simplified boards the turn after it was special summoned. As an aside you don’t even have to climb into Yoko through the normal line as it can be summoned with just a Jack O’Bolan and Dakki; this is often how you start lines in situation where you don’t draw Hajun (see Combo Guide 3). Overall Yoko is a very worthwhile card to run in any Mayakashi build, although due to how tight the extra is we wouldn’t recommend running it at three.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi x 2</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>We end our look at the Mayakashi synchros with Gashadokuro, who notably has the second highest attack of any </span></span></span><span><span><span>z</span></span></span><span><span><span>ombie-type synchro monster. Aside from being a formidable beatstick he is also unaffected by card effects the turn he is summoned from the grave by any effect. This can assist with clearing lower-attack threats and finishing your opponent on the follow-up. This all said Gashadokuro’s primary use in this build is in the grave as protection of sorts for your link monsters, as your opponent may not want to waste valuable removal on a problem card like Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi or I:P Masquerena when a </span></span></span><span><span><span>T</span></span></span><span><span><span>owers with high at</span></span></span><span><span><span>tac</span></span></span><span><span><span>k is lurking in your grave. All this said I think you could probably get away with playing one of these in favour of the above-mentioned third Yoko, if you want more focus on disruption.    </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi x 2</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>As with the above synchros our first link is more of a name than anything else. We play two Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi to aid in clearing our main-deck Mayakashi xeno-lock on the follow up play, mainly Yuki-Musume and Hajun. Her effect can be handy in a pinch but mostly we use her to climb into Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy and the other Yuki-Onna for more effective disruption. You could play less of this but it would hamper your follow-up plays and restrict your ability to play non-zombie links. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi x 2</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The second Yuki-Onna is much more impactful than its link two counterpart. Its a twice-per-</span></span></span><span><span><span>t</span></span></span><span><span><span>urn permanent effect negate any time a monster activates its effect in the grave, like all of our aforementioned Mayakashi synchro monsters. If you’re starting to notice powerful synergy then welcome to the disruptive centre of the deck. Our first turn aims to end on this plus the Zombie World/Rivalry </span></span></span><span><span><span>l</span></span></span><span><span><span>ock and Balerdroch at minimum, which leaves us with two permanent effect negates, a monster effect negate, and the Rivalry lock. This is more than enough to stop most tier two and below decks in their tracks, although it can struggle with more meta relevant decks’ almost-</span></span></span><span><span><span>i</span></span></span><span><span><span>nfinite extension. </span></span></span><span><span><span>A</span></span></span><span><span><span> last funny note on Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi is that its first effect hard-counters banish-heavy decks like Thunder Dragon so long as it’s on field. We play two as to allow us to repeat our climb if we need to as link fours tend to attract negates, but you could cut this to one in favour of more non-zombie links or Cherries targets. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy x 1</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>At last we com</span></span></span><span><span><span>e</span></span></span><span><span><span> to the last Zombie link and the first non-Mayakashi extra deck monster. Anyone who’s played Zombie World decks before is likely familiar with the Shiranui archetype, or at the very least Shiranui Solitaire. Luckily for any of you new to this deck, Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy doesn’t have much to do with his archetype’s gimmick beyond summoning any of your banished zombie monsters. The primary use of this is to recycle high-impact synchros like Tengu and Yoko to allow you to out tempo your opponent over longer match-ups. As a fun secondary bonus if you summon Yoko, Skillsaga’s first effect wi</span></span></span><span><span><span>ll</span></span></span><span><span><span> protect it from destruction </span></span></span><span><span><span>and</span></span></span><span><span><span> allow for a follow-up into Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi on your turn. We only play one of these as the long games where this card shines are increasingly rare in the Oct 2020 format. </span></span></span><span><span><span>Th</span></span></span><span><span><span>at said, if the meta slows down in future more of these could be worth experimenting with.      </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>I:P Masquerena x 1</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Now on to the non-zombie link monsters, and I know that might sound odd in a lock-based zombie deck but </span></span></span><span><span><span>I</span></span></span><span><span><span>’ll explain. There are a couple scenarios we run into commonly that necessitate that we link off our monsters to further our plays, without being under </span></span></span><span><span><span>R</span></span></span><span><span><span>ivalry or the i</span></span></span><span><span><span>nn</span></span></span><span><span><span>ate xeno-lock of the main-deck Mayakashis. Masquerena is mostly for getting synchros in the graveyard and has the added benefit of allowing us to go into a link three or four with extra protection using our spent Mayakashis on our opponent’s turn. You could easily cut this in favour of another link two like Vampire Sucker or such but we think Masq has the most impact. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>Linkuriboh x 1</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>As mentioned above our non-zombie links are for resolving niche board states, this time with our main-deck Mayakashi. Linkuriboh is for linking off a negated Hajun in the event we don’t have Yuki-Musume. As a bonus this one can also be used to get your follow-up Yuki-Musume </span></span></span><span><span><span>(</span></span></span><span><span><span>or Glow-Up Bloom in a pinch</span></span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span><span> into the grave for recursion and link materi</span></span></span><span><span><span>a</span></span></span><span><span><span>l. This was an addition based on how many decks are playing Infinite Impermanence and Effect Veiler; it comes up relatively often and at least gets us something interactive on board. If you’d like to cut this you can, I don’t think there are many other link ones that would work but go ahead if you disagree. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>3. Combo Guide and Follow-Up Plays</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Before I go over the combos for the deck </span></span></span><span><span><span>I’</span></span></span><span><span><span>d just like to go over how best to use these lines, and why we mention the specific lines we do. To start it is best to think of this deck’s line</span></span></span><span><span><span>s</span></span></span><span><span><span> in two distinct categories: Mayakashi, and Zombie World. These two categories are often resolved concurrently with the same resources and produce different kinds of interaction. I’ve already gone over the synergy between the different kinds of interaction in the deck-list so I won’t belabour that here, but needless to say any combination of these is normally enough to end the game within 4 turns. One thing to note is that the deck’s follow-ups are highly variable depending on both match-up and preference, so we recommend testing the deck extensively to see what you want it to do prior to taking it into the meta. We will recommend the follow-ups we favour, but take that with a grain of salt </span></span></span><span><span><span>as none of this is tournament-</span></span></span><span><span><span>t</span></span></span><span><span><span>ested</span></span></span><span><span><span>. Finally the math below may not be accurate to the exact percentile but should be good enough for you to get an idea of the likelihood of seeing these opens and where similar lines may go. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>1. Dakki + Yuki-Musume</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>So we’re going to start with one of the </span></span></span><span><span><span>two</span></span></span><span><span><span> optimal openings for the deck, coming in at </span></span></span><span><span><span><b>40%</b></span></span></span><span><span><span> to open these </span></span></span><span><span><span>two</span></span></span><span><span><span> cards or access to them. We resolve this by normal summoning Dakki then special summoning Yuki-Musume, using its effect to foolish either Necroworld Banshee or Glow-Up Bloom depending on if you have access to Zombie World or not. If you don’t you’ll want to use Necroworld Banshee’s effect to get Zombie World on the field before starting your synchro climb. Starting from Oboro-Guruma you’ll want to climb through all the Mayakashi synchro monsters up to Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi, summoning Dakki back every time you send it to the grave. If you have access to a </span></span></span><span><span><span>R</span></span></span><span><span><span>eborn effect such as Mayakashi Metamorphosis you’ll want to summon Dakki one last time and link both of them off for Yuki-Onna, the Ice </span></span></span><span><span><span>M</span></span></span><span><span><span>ayakashi. This is to give the synchro you summon on your opponent’s turn protection as it tears up their plays. From this point your best follow-up is to summon Yuki-Musume again to </span></span></span><span><span><span>F</span></span></span><span><span><span>oolish Glow-Up Bloom for Balerdroch, all so that you can link the Yukis (Onna and Musume) plus the synchro you summoned earlier into Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi. This leaves you with a board of the link four plus Balerdroch going into your opponent’s turn, plus whatever other disruption you drew aside f</span></span></span><span><span><span>ro</span></span></span><span><span><span>m the two cards listed.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>2. Hajun + Yuki-Musume</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The next hand we’ll be going over is Hajun plus </span></span></span><span><span><span>Yuki-Musume</span></span></span><span><span><span>, at </span></span></span><span><span><span><b>30% </b></span></span></span><span><span><span>to open going first. This hand resolves not unli</span></span></span><span><span><span>ke</span></span></span><span><span><span> our first open w</span></span></span><span><span><span>ith us normal summoning Hajun to special summon Dakki from deck, before special summoning Yuki-Musume. We again use Yuki-Musume’s effect to </span></span></span><span><span><span>F</span></span></span><span><span><span>oolish either Necroworld Banshee or Glow-Up Bloom depending on our access to Zombie World as mentioned above. </span></span></span><span><span><span>From this point we will activate Zombie World using Necroworld Banshee’s effect before starting our synchro climb using Dakki and Hajun. We’ll climb all the way to </span></span></span><span><span><span>Gashadokuro</span></span></span> <span><span><span>before </span></span></span><span><span><span>summoning Dakki, and linking Dakki and Hajun for Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi </span></span></span><span><span><span>before summoning Dakki one last time. From here we link everything off for the link four Yuki-Onna, leaving us with a fully set-up graveyard and a twice-per-turn permanent effect negate anytime we summon from grave, plus whatever we summon from the grave. Your opponent’s turn should play out with you restricting their plays and summoning any Mayakashis you can either with cards like Metamorphosis that you opened or the innate Mayakashi graveyard effects. You should be left with a Mayakashi synchro or link on the field and at least Yuki-Musume still in grave. This allows you to </span></span></span><span><span><span>F</span></span></span><span><span><span>oolish again on your </span></span></span><span><span><span>next</span></span></span><span><span><span> tun by summoning Yuki-Musume, ideally for Glow-Up Bloom to get you Balerdroch for finishing out the game or insulating your other disruption. Your lines will diverge here depending on your opponent’s deck and hand, but in our testing the game rarely goes much more than a couple turns after you execute this line. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>3. Dakki and Jack O’Bolan plus discard</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>To begin this one I’ll state that this is not the most likely of openings at about</span></span></span><span><span><span><b> 15%</b></span></span></span><span><span><span> but we wanted to mention it to illustrate how one should best use Jack O’Bolan </span></span></span><span><span><span>in-conjunction with other openings. One should begin by special summoning Jack O’Bolan with whatever discard you have access to, ideally Necroworld Banshee or Glow-Up Bloom for more disruption but Mezuki will do </span></span></span><span><span><span>for set</span></span></span><span><span><span>u</span></span></span><span><span><span>p later. From here we’ll normal summon Dakki and start our synchro climb from Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi through to Gashadokuro and finally Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi. You might be noticing this is similar to </span></span></span><span><span><span>both of the openings we mentioned above and you’d be right </span></span></span><span><span><span>—</span></span></span><span><span><span> our opening is pretty standard, it’s the follow-ups that vary. </span></span></span><span><span><span>From here we have a couple options based on what you discarded and what else you drew in your open</span></span></span><span><span><span>ing hand</span></span></span><span><span><span>. If you discarded Necroworld Banshee and drew Metamorphosis for example, your board will look much like </span></span></span><span><span><span>the </span></span></span><span><span><span>first two </span></span></span><span><span><span>mentioned boards, only with restricted access to your Mayakashi graveyard effects. As a different example if we discarded Mezuki and didn’t draw Metamorphosis </span></span></span><span><span><span>once we’ve done our climb, we’ll want to activate Mezuki for Jack O’Bolan so that we have an option to bring back our Yoko or Gashadokuro depending on our opponent’s board. This play overall is not as strong as those mentioned above but it’s also less common. </span></span></span><span><span><span>F</span></span></span><span><span><span>rom this you should know how to resolve it </span></span></span><span><span><span>or other hands like it</span></span></span><span><span><span> optimally when it comes up. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>4. Glow-Up Bloom and </b></span></span></span><span><span><span><b>N</b></span></span></span><span><span><span><b>o Normal Summon</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>I’ll be honest this hand is unlikely at </span></span></span><span><span><span><b>10% </b></span></span></span><span><span><span>and it’s honestly pretty bad in comparison to the other hands we’ve gone over. The reason </span></span></span><span><span><span>we decided to mention this is </span></span></span><span><span><span>it’s similar to how openings with just Hajun play out when the opponent negates H</span></span></span><span><span><span>aj</span></span></span><span><span><span>un’s effect. Regardless of which level one you’ve ended up with on field, from here you’ll want to activate Zombie World if you have any access to it, then link </span></span></span><span><span><span>off Glow-Up Bloom (or Hajun if applicable) for Linkuriboh. This will let you activate Glow-Up Bloom’s effect, either searching </span></span></span><span><span><span>Jack O’Bolan if we don’t have Zombie World up or </span></span></span><span><span><span>s</span></span></span><span><span><span>ummoning Balerdroch if we do. </span></span></span><span><span><span>If you used Hajun for all of this you might be wondering what the point of dumping Hajun is: </span></span></span><span><span><span>s</span></span></span><span><span><span>imply put we play 8 different reborn effects in the main deck so the chances of us opening one of them is </span></span></span><span><span><span><b>65%</b></span></span></span><span><span><span>. While not guaranteed this happens often enough that we consider it a valid follow-up option, as Hajun’s effect triggers </span></span></span><span><span><span>on special summon </span></span></span><span><span><span>which</span></span></span><span><span><span> allow</span></span></span><span><span><span>s</span></span></span><span><span><span> us to basically redo our opening play. All told, versions of this opener will leave you with Zombie World as well as Balerdroch and Linkuriboh so that you have some interaction on your opponents turn or a repeatable Hajun line on your next turn. </span></span></span>  <span><span><span><b>5. One for One and Dakki or Yuki-Musume plus discard</b></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>At last we come to the final opening we’ll be discussing today, at </span></span></span><span><span><span><b>7% </b></span></span></span><span><span><span>this is respectable for one of the best hands in the deck.</span></span></span><span><span><span> We value this hand because it puts up the same disruptions as </span></span></span><span><span><span>hands one or two potentially without our normal summon. </span></span></span><span><span><span>We start with One for One to summon Hajun in order to special either Dakki or Yuki-Musume, depending on what you have in hand. From here we ideally want to normal summon Dakki if we drew it, before </span></span></span><span><span><span>synchro summoning with Dakki and Hajun into Oboro-Guruma. From here it’s business as usual to climb through our synchros using Dakki’s effect every time until we get to a board of Dakki, Yuki-Musume, and Gashadokuro. </span></span></span><span><span><span>From here we’ll link Dakki and Yuki-Musume off for the link two Yuki-Onna to get Yuki-Musume </span></span></span><span><span><span>in grave. </span></span></span><span><span><span>Next we use</span></span></span><span><span><span> Yuki-Musume’s effect to special </span></span></span><span><span><span>summon </span></span></span><span><span><span>it from the graveyard, </span></span></span><span><span><span>F</span></span></span><span><span><span>oolishing either Necroworld Banshee or Glow-Up Bloom if you drew Zombie World. This will leave us ideally with materi</span></span></span><span><span><span>a</span></span></span><span><span><span>l to make the link four Yuki-Onna with Zombie </span></span></span><span><span><span>W</span></span></span><span><span><span>orld up and our full grave set-up for </span></span></span><span><span><span>Re</span></span></span><span><span><span>born effects on the opponent’s turn. If you drew Zombie World you will also have Balerdroch for the extra negate and banish.

As far as my final thoughts on the list I’d say this deck has lot of potential in slower or restricted metas, but in the current climate mid-range is less viable due to threats like Dragon Link and Infernoble Knight. This list is pretty resilient to most handtraps except Called By The Grave, but due to the density played by even tier </span></span></span><span><span><span>two</span></span></span><span><span><span> and below decks our plays are stopped more often than not in event play. Casually this list is amazing </span></span></span><span><span><span>due to the frequent and recursive threats our boards generate being beyond the </span></span></span><span><span><span>capabilities</span></span></span><span><span><span> of many rogue and off-meta decks. What’s more, Jazzy_Sues irl build came in at under </span></span></span><span><span><span>$</span></span></span><span><span><span>150 US</span></span></span><span><span><span>D</span></span></span><span><span><span> (</span></span></span><span><span><span>w</span></span></span><span><span><span>ith some substitutions) so you can get into this build for relativ</span></span></span><span><span><span>el</span></span></span><span><span><span>y little compared to other decks of this calibre. As far as the deck’s future </span></span></span><span><span><span>goes,</span></span></span><span><span><span> I think there is some promise </span></span></span><span><span><span>competitively</span></span></span><span><span><span> in the Eldlich Mayakashi variant with the announcement of the new Eldlich </span></span></span><span><span><span>fusion monster and continuous spell. I’m given to understand that Jazzy_Sue is already working on it. </span></span></span><span><span><span>In the meantime we hope you enjoyed our first Halloween effort, </span></span></span><span><span><span>and </span></span></span><span><span><span>we hope to bring you more in the future. </span></span></span><span><span><span>U</span></span></span><span><span><span>ntil next </span></span></span><span><span><span>time,</span></span></span><span><span><span> stay safe and spooky fellow YuGiOh fans!</span></span></span>"

This deck is more consistent since the only bricks is the barrier statue. The thing about this deck is that there are no garnets except if you are super unlucky and draw two double evolution pill. The typical two card combo if Baby and Miscellaneousaurus ends on Evolzar Dolkka, Simorgh,bird of sovereignty with barrier statue, and a Ultimate Conductor Tyranno.

Do not take this to a competitive event since you will lose unless your luck is unbeatable. Use cards like  Time Wizard to wipe all of your opponents monster off the field at once, or one at a time with Snipe Hunter. For the Battle Phase there are cards like Sasuke Samurai #4 to destroy cards before the Damage step or Fairy Box to reduce your opponent monster's attack to zero. These cards and more with a little of luck will lead your way to victory. Again don forget this is just a fun causal deck that 99% of the time will not will at locals."

The new support cards is the main reason on why this deck is back: with Tear Scale having multiple effect that gives the user a huge advantage, it's also one of the key cards to complete the combo, also let's not forget about Raiders' Knight and Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon, this 2 cards is the card you need in order to OTK your opponent. This deck can run a ton of extenders while still having space for handtraps and anti-handtraps card, that's why i can safely say that this deck is BROKEN. When building this deck, I really want to add the level 3 Danger! monsters here since it's always plus card even if it's discarded, I know that it's not common to run Dangers! when you have handtraps and anti-handtraps card, but I want this build to be unique and fit my playstyle so I've added it.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>1 CARD COMBO (TOUR GUIDE FROM THE UNDERWORLD)</span></strong> <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Tour Guide then activate it's effect to special summon Burning Abyss Graff.

Activate Leviair's effect detaching Ancient Cloak to special summon the banished Ragged Gloves to the field.</li>  	<li>Activate Ancient Cloak's effect from the GY to search for Silent Boots.</li>  	<li>Special summon Silent Boots using it's own effect (you don't need to activate it since it's consider an inherent summon). XYZ summon Phantom Knights of Break Sword using Silent Boots and Ragged Gloves to one of Bardiche's link marker.</li>  	<li>Activate Bardiche's effect to destroy 1 card on the field when a Dark XYZ Monster is special summoned to it's marker, destroy Break Sword in order to use it's effect when it's destroyed, it can special summon 2 Phantom Knights monster with the same level in your GY and increase their level by 1, special summon Ragged Gloves and Silent Boots from the GY.</li>  	<li>XYZ Summon Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon using the two level 4 monster.</li>  	<li>On your opponent's main phase, activate the Rank-Up-Magic from your field to special summon Dark Requiem XYZ Dragon.</li>  	<li>End Board - Bardiche, Cherubini, Leviair, and Dark Requiem XYZ Dragon.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  <strong><span>2 CARD COMBO (TOUR GUIDE + ANY LVL 3 EXTENDER)</span></strong>  So for this combo the level 3 extenders are: <ul>  	<li>Psychic Tracker</li>  	<li>Psychic Wheeleder</li>  	<li>Danger!?

This is the most up to date version of the Melffy Tri-Brigade deck that I have been toying with over the past couple of months.  <strong>General Deck Theory:</strong>  The Melffy engine generates plenty of advantage and interaction off of their one card starters, but lacks ways to push damage and affect the board on their own turn. This is where the aggressive Tri-Brigade sub-engine, <em>Alpha, the Master of Beasts</em>, and <em>Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</em> come into play, as they all provide big bodies and effects that chew through the opponent's field. Also, given that Melffy play off of 1 card starters, we are free to include a generous helping of handtraps (13!). Combined with the instant board breaker <em>Alpha, the Master of Beasts</em>, it reasons that going second is not necessarily a death warrant for this deck, even against combo. However, this is still a blind first deck, as we would prefer to set up our wall of Melffy advantage before the opponent gets on board.  <strong>Common Opening Lines:</strong>  Note: When I refer to a ""pop,"" I am referring to an effect that destroys an opponent's card, in this case at quick effect timing.  Obedience Schooled = 2 pops + 1 search for follow up or negation  Activate <em>Obedience Schooled</em> to summon <em>Kalantosa Mystical Beast of the Forest, Melffy Puppy</em>, and  <em>Melffy Catty</em>. Overlay the 3 Level 2 Beasts into <em>Excited Melffys.</em> On the opponent's turn, use <em>Excited Melffys </em>to resummon the 3 Level 2 beasts, which will no longer have their effects negated. <em>Kalontosa</em> will pop a card when it is resummoned, <em>Puppy</em> can summon another <em>Kalantosa</em> from deck, and <em>Catty</em> can search for a follow up play, like <em>Alpha, the Master of Beasts</em>, or it can search <em>Hop Ear Squadron</em> to immediately summon a <em>Herald of the Arclight</em> on the opponent's turn. Be very careful to not search <em>Hop Ear</em> when the opponent can already run over <em>Herald</em> in battle, as wasting the search can be costly, especially if you have no follow up.  Rescue Cat = 2 pops  Activate <em>Rescue Cat</em> to summon <em>Kalantosa </em>and <em>Melffy Puppy. </em>Similar to the last opening, we overlay these 2 Beasts into <em>Excited Melffys</em>, which can bring back the 2 Beasts without their effects negated.  Nimble Beaver = 1 pop and 1 conditional negation  Activate <em>Nimble Beaver</em>'s effect on summon to summon another copy from the deck. Overlay the <em>Nimble Beavers </em>into <em>Melffy of the Forest</em>. Activate <em>Melffy of the Forest</em> to search <em>Melffy Puppy</em>, or, if you have a copy in hand already, search <em>Melffy Cat. </em>Assuming we only end with <em>Puppy </em>in hand, summon it in the End Phase using its own effect. During the opponent's turn, when <em>Puppy</em> returns to the hand to summon <em>Kalantosa</em> from deck, you can activate <em>Melffy of the Forest</em> to negate one monster permanently and prevent it from attacking. This negation is rather situational, since it only triggers  exactly right after a Melffy returns to hand and thus cannot stop on summon effects, but it is important to know that it is there.  Rescue Cat/Nimble Beaver + Tri-Brigade Airborne = 1 Banish + 1 Pop + 1 or 2 Floating Effects (effects that search when the monster is sent to GY)  Activate Rescue Cat to summon two <em>Melffy Puppy</em>s from deck or <em>Nimble Beaver</em> to summon a copy of itself from deck. Overlay the two Level 2 monsters for <em>Melffy of the Forest.</em> Activate <em>Melffy of the Forest</em>  to search <em>Melffy Puppy</em>, or, if you have a copy in hand already, search <em>Melffy Catty</em>. Now, activate <em>Tri-Brigade Airborne</em> <em>Assault</em> by targeting <em>Melffy of the Forest</em> to summon <em>Tri-Brigade Nervall </em>from deck. Link Summon <em>Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</em> using <em>Forest</em> and <i>Nervall </i>as material. Since it was sent to the GY, activate <i>Nervall</i>'s effect to search <i>Kerass </i>from deck. Next, activate <em>Ferrijit</em>'s effect to summon <i>Kerass </i>from hand. There will now be 4 or 5 monsters in the GY at this point, depending on which starter you opened with. Either way, activate <i>Kerass </i>and banish 4 cards from the GY to summon <em>Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen.</em> If there are 5 cards in GY, avoid banishing <em>Nervall</em>. Lastly, Link Summon <em>Tri-Brigade Rugal the Silver Sheller</em> using <em>Ferrijit </em>and <i>Kerass </i>as Material. When <em>Ferrijit </em>is sent to GY, you get a small redraw to fix the hand. During the End Phase, summon from hand the <em>Melffy Puppy</em> that we searched earlier. During the opponents turn, we can resummon <i>Kerass </i>or <i>Nervall </i>(better because it floats) using <em>Rugal </em>to trigger the banish effect of <em>Shuraig </em>at any time during the Main Phase and we can pop a card with <em>Kalantosa</em> off <em>Puppy</em>. <em>Shuraig </em>also floats into almost any card in our deck, because why not.  &nbsp;  <strong>Card Choice Discussion</strong>  I don't claim to be an expert deck builder or believe that I have completely broken the meta with this semi-casual Melffy deck. I do, however, believe that I have put enough thought and experimentation into this deck to justify every inclusion and exclusion, with room for disagreement. Below, I talk about some deck build choices that may be surprising or flat out incorrect to many people.  Why no <em>Simorgh </em>with <em>Barrier Statue</em> or Mist Valley Infinite Negates? <ul>  	<li>They aren't fun. The great thing about Melffy is that you are slowly building up advantage while interacting with your opponent in a very careful and meaningful way. Building the deck around setting up one of these locks removes all of that complexity and strips Melffy of its unique identity and strengths.</li> </ul> The Tri-Brigade ratio seems weird. You should be playing <em>Fraktall</em>, he's the best one to open with. <ul>  	<li><em>Fraktall</em> sends <em>Nervall</em>, who searches <em>Kerass</em>. With the discard from <em>Kerass</em>, you have 3 cards in GY. Now you banish them all to summon the Link 3 <em>Rugal</em>. You can even link off what you have into <em>Shuraig</em>. Now what? You used 2 cards in hand to end on a big guy that sits there and floats. In short, <em>Fraktall</em> is not a starter.</li>  	<li><em>Airborne Assault</em> is clearly not a starter either, so why play it over <em>Fraktall</em>? Well, as an extender, it's just pound for pound better card advantage than <em>Fraktall</em>. It summons <em>Nervall</em> from deck, who then gives you a +1 when used as material. Meanwhile, when you send <em>Nervall</em> to GY with <em>Fraktall</em> and search a Tri-Brigade monster, you only go neutral in terms of card economy</li> </ul> 1 <em>D.D. Crow</em>? <ul>  	<li>The <em>D.D. Crow</em> is included strictly in lieu of playing a second <em>Nervall</em>, which is not great to draw. <em>Crow</em> is more of an engine piece that doubles as a handtrap. In the combo I mentioned earlier with <em>Rescue Cat</em>/<em>Nimble Beaver</em> + <em>Airborne Assault</em>, if you draw both your 1 <em>Nervall</em> and an <em>Airborne Assault</em>, then you use <em>Airborne</em> to summon <em>D.D. Crow</em> from the deck, Link Summon into <em>Ferrijit</em>, and summon from hand the <em>Nervall</em> that you opened with. You still have 4 or 5 cards in GY to banish for <em>Nerval's</em> effect, so the rest is the same.</li> </ul> <em>Hop Ear Squadron</em> kind of sucks... <ul>  	<li>I agree. 80% of the games I would rather search a more impactful and less risky card with <em>Catty</em>. However, those 20% of games where we pop their normal summon and can successfully <em>Herald</em> negate their next play make the 1 of <em>Hop Ear</em> better than playing a single extra handtrap. Also, a funny play going second is to <em>Gamma</em> the opponent on their turn and immediately use the <em>Driver</em> on field and <em>Hop Ear</em> to summon <em>Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</em> (or <em>Psyframelord Omega</em>, both have merit).</li> </ul> Why so little Melffy cards? They're all searchable, you know. <ul>  	<li>The other Melffy cards are mediocre to bad. <em>Melffy Pony</em> is reasonable, but it relies on you already being extremely set up and your GY is often taxed by the Tri-Brigade already. If Pony could recycle <em>Rescue Cat</em>, my opinion of it might be higher, but often the only Level 2 beast in GY is <em>Kalantosa</em>.  Now that <em>Excited Melffy</em>, which wants all of it's materials intact, is our go to Melffy XYZ, <em>Melffy Playhouse</em> doesn't play well with our opening board. Bringing back one Melffy with <em>Melffy Tag</em> does not push any significant plays through, and if we really want to get a Melffy back in rotation, we can just use <em>Excited Melffy</em>. <em>Melffy Hide-and-Seek</em> is a slow <em>Upstart Goblin</em> that conflicts with the Tri-Brigades' GY resource usage. <em>Melffy Mommy</em> and <em>Melffy Fenny</em> I won't go over because just glancing the card text, it's evident they do nothing. Overall, I would nearly always rather search either <em>Melffy Puppy</em> or <em>Melffy Catty</em> over any of the cards I mentioned.</li> </ul> If this is a go first deck, why play 3 <em>Alpha, the Master of Beasts? </em>You could just play 1 and search it with <em>Catty</em>. <ul>  	<li>The card is just that powerful. Going second, it is the best card in the deck. Going first, it ensures that you have a follow up to control the board. All of your duels are going to be grindy because of the Melffy playstyle, so having access to beater that can preserve itself by returning to hand will always impact the duel. Given the low attack of Melffy, you can freely summon this card, even on the third turn with monsters on your field. It doesn't hurt that it has synergy with <em>Rescue Cat</em> and <em>Obedience Schooled</em> in bouncing back the negated cards they summon. For example, you can access the Tribrigade engine by summoning <em>Kerass</em> off of <em>Rescue Cat</em>, bouncing it to hand, and then Special Summoning the <em>Kerass</em> from hand. Additionally, you can bounce back some Melffy summoned off <em>Obedience Schooled</em>, who will then summon themselves back from the hand.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Shien's Spy can also be used to hand off one of your ritual monsters for Chaos Max to swing into, since they also have 0 DEF. On top of this, you can just hand off the only Impcantation on your field (besides Chalislime) so you can unlock your Extra Deck until the end of the turn.  If you draw a BEWD, it helps to discard it with Trade-in or Chalislime so you can just banish it with Chaos Form, or use 2 Impcantations to tribute summon it then XYZ with another level 8 into Draglubion. I recommend summoning Neo-Galaxy Eyes with its effect.  Normally the best/easiest card to ritual summon with it Advanced Ritual art, especially for the non-MAX Dragon.  Make sure to ALWAYS ritual non-MAX with a BEWD, so you can use its effect which helps you beat over big monsters.  Happy Summoning!"

Ideally, Megalith Bethor has already cleared most of your opponent's field at this point so that your OTK enablers can attack directly. 1 Megalith Portal and 3 Doki Doki can be replaced for other cards depending on personal preference (consistency boosters are highly recommended). The Impcantation engine can be used to boost consistency but be careful as the engine is counter-intuitive to the Fossil strategy by locking you out of your extra deck."

In case you do not know how infinite negates work, Simorgh summons Mist Valley Apex Avian from the deck with it's effect during the end phase, and Carrier equips Mist Valley Thunderbird to your Simorgh. Apex Avian can negate an opponent's card effect by bouncing a 'Mist Valley' card you control back to the hand and Thunderbird can summon itself when it returns to the hand, neither effect being once per turn. So you can infinitely negate your opponent's card effects by using Avian to bounce back Thunderbird and Thunderbird summoning itself. If your opponent attempts to attack over Thunderbird you can just 'chain titan eff' to pop the monster you are attacking with, further boosted by the fact that Thunderbird is a thunder-type monster, so it also triggers titan's effect.This is of course susceptible to Dark Ruler No More, Forbidden Droplets, Kaiju's, any quick effect card that can negate as chain link 3 (Imperm, chalice, gamma, etc) and super poly (after baiting a negate). There are probably others I missed, but apart from that you can't really bait these negates nor realistically play through them.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>CHAOS THUNDER DRAGON GUIDE </span><span>For unfamiliar people, Chaos Thunder Dragon is a strategy where the 'Chaos' part refers to monsters that can special summon themselves by banishing monsters of a specific attribute (usually LIGHT and/or DARK). Next comes the 'Thunder Dragon' part. These are cards that gain effects either by discarding them or them being sent from the field to the GY or getting banished (The effect gained by being banished is the same as the one gained by being sent to the field to the GY) and since they are all LIGHT or DARK, they synergise pretty well with the Chaos engine. Some notable cards include Thunder Dragonroar, who can summon another 'Thunder Dragon' monster from the deck if banished, Thunder Dragondark, who can search any 'Thunder Dragon' card when banished, Black Dragon Collapserpent and White Dragon Wyverbuster who can summon themselves by banishing a LIGHT and DARK (respectively) from the graveyard and can search the other monster if sent to the GY and The Chaos Creator, who banishes a LIGHT and DARK to summon itself and can summon back a banished monster, along with recurring other banished monsters.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>OTHER NOTABLE CARDS Dark Beckoning Beast/Opening of the Spirit Gates: Opening either one of them can lead to a 1 card 'Curios, The Lightsworn Dominion' who can set up your graveyard. I won't tell the combo here, so I recommend searching up '1-card curious' on Google or Youtube.    Apart from a few cards, which are mainly techs or staples that aren't necessarily required for the deck to function, i would say the deck is relatively semi-budget, clocking in at the 100-150 euro range, so it's definitely a fun deck to try out. It doesn't necessarily have any 'combos' per say, as it really does come down to the hand you draw and it is very open-ended.</span>"

Don't ask. Anyway, here we have a slow Phantom Knights deck, focused on slowing the opponent with us with the use of our traps. And yes, we're running Mystic Mine. Yes, I betrayed all of my morals. Anyway, onto the deck guide. We have the core Phantom Knights cards, with the main monsters. We have: 3 Ragged Gloves, for a extra 1000 buff (which is permanent) and, you can banish it from your GY to send a ragged cloak to search out a Boots 3 Anchient Cloak, which can buff another monster but that's never used, unless you're in a tight position. It's best to send it to the graveyard and then banish it to search a Boots or Gloves to your hand, or if you don't need to summon any more monsters, a fog blade to fuck around and find out. 3 Silent Boots, which easily special summons itself out for a rank 3. Staple card, and it can also banish itself to search out a Fog Blade or whatever else you need Now, we have the Phantom Knights spells/traps 1 Phantom Knight's Spear, for protection in the GY and extra burn damage 2 Phantom Knight's Rank Up Magic Launch, for when you have a XYZ monsters with no materials left 2 Raider's Unbreakable Mind, to get a free destruction if you rank up. 3 Fog Blade because... It's Fog Blade. I don't need to explain this. 1 Phantom Knight's Sword, for an extra 800 buff for an OTK finish. 1 The Phantom Knights's of Dark Gauntlets, for sending Spear and other good spells/traps to the GY that you want in the GY 2 Vambrace, which is great for slowing down the opponent and protecting your monsters. 3 Raidraptor- Phantom Knight's Claw, which is a great negation for when you have XYZ monsters on the field 2 Mist Claws, which can recycle more recources for extra plays. 1 Shade Briganade, to stall out an attack Misc. main deck cards 1 Tschukinoko, which special summons itself easily, gets a draw, and can discard a card you'd want in the GY (although it's random, so it might discard something you want to save) 1 Jackalope, same with the above 3 Ash Blossoms, ez negate, gg bro 2 Ghost Ogre, understandable have a nice format 3 Allure of Darkness, strong draw power 3 Mystic Mine, to slow down the opponent, especially if it's a swarm deck like most decks in the meta rn.  I hate myself for this 1 Lost Wind, cripples the opponent's boss monster Hee hee, extra deck go brrrr 1 Rusty Bardiche, Rusty Bardiche is really good if you have a hand for spamming  out enough monsters for a link-3 and getting out another XYZ. Can also search out a Fog Blade and shit easily 1 Megaclops, good for late game, in case I grind out 3 XYZ monsters (have done that before when testing this) 1 Raider's Knight, can be summoned if you special summon monsters off of Break Sword's destruction effect 2 Break Sword, the monster you wanna summon first with Ragged Gloves, to get a 3k beater with a destruction effect 1 Dante, an alternative rank 3 in case you run out of or lose your Break Swords, with a great mill for extra resources 1 Utopia, for a Rank 4 in case Break Sword is destroyed 1 Utopia the Lightning, to rank up Utopia from It do be a side deck doe 3 Nibiru, to completely counter decks that summon 5 or more monsters. 1 Pankratops, for going second and to get an easy pop 3 Gamaciel, in case your opponent runs strong monsters you can't beat over normally 1 Mind Control, for easy stealing when going 2nd 1 Raigeki, to break your opponent's board when going 2nd 1 weird book thing, to slow down the opponent's plays I hate myself for making this, have a good day. Any suggestions are appreciated"

The ""U.A."" archetype is based on various pop culture references regarding ""Future Sports"", mixing a solid amount of already existing sports in one giant mash-up (even including race cars since some of the newer ""U.A."" support also counts as ""F.A.""). During the game, they are played as a Hybrid deck, being a mix of both beatdown and aggro strategies while also allowing field control via negates when it counts. To allow such a smooth transition, all ""U.A."" monsters (except one) can Special summon themselves by returning an ""U.A."" monster to the hand, giving you the option of attacking normally during your Battle Phase only to switch your monster line-up during Main Phase 2 to have disruption ready during the opposing turn.</p> <p>The monsters are almost entirely from the ""U.A."" archetype, except for the three copies of ""<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"", who I run for the obvious negation via handtrap; ""U.A.s"" have a good amount of consistency boosters and do not really lose any tempo by putting a few handtraps in, so run whatever option you either deem is the best or, alternatively, the most budget-friendly. The ""U.A."" core consists of three copies of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Midfielder"">U.A. Midfielder</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""U.A. Libero Spiker"">U.A. Libero Spiker</a>"", who both have solid switch effects to be able to even switch out monsters during the opposing turn, but I cannot stress enough that they are also there to provide non-tribute Normal Summons, something which the archetype was and to a certain extend still has problems with. Without a monster on board, you cannot start the switching schenanigans, which will leave you with quite a few bricks in form of monster cards. Talking about switching, the options you can go into are two ""<a data-name=""U.A. Perfect Ace"">U.A. Perfect Ace</a>"" who negates a card for discarding one from your hand, a copy of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Blockbacker"">U.A. Blockbacker</a>"" who can switch the position and then negate the effect of a Special summoned monster, a copy of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Mighty Slugger"">U.A. Mighty Slugger</a>"" who works like a ""U.A."" version of an ""Ancient Gear"" monster and therefore prohibits the opponent from activating stuff during his attack and two copies of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Dreadnought Dunker"">U.A. Dreadnought Dunker</a>"" sporting both piercing damage and destroying a card whenever he is able to inflict damage to the opponent.</p> <p>The last monster in the deck is ""<a data-name=""U.A. Playing Manager"">U.A. Playing Manager</a>"", played at three copies (although you could lower the ratio to two if necessary). This card is a beast, because he can Special summon himself when a switch is happening, giving you some swarming and an additional beater. But whenever he is Special summoned, he can decide whether he wants to destroy a card on the field or negate the effects of all non-""U.A."" monsters, which is even better. He is easy to recycle, since you can simply bounce him to your hand as cost, Special summon another ""U.A."" monster, then bring him back in because his summon effect triggers, giving you another activation of his effects if he has no use them during that turn. And with the help of the Level 4 monsters, you can even switch him out and bring him back in during the opposing turn, even giving you another disruptive option.</p> <p>The Spell/Trap line-up has various staples that you will find in other ""U.A."" decklists aswell; simply because those cards are that useful. Both ""<a data-name=""U.A. Hyper Stadium"">U.A. Hyper Stadium</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""U.A. Stadium"">U.A. Stadium</a>"" are played at three copies, giving you a solid amount of helpful effects which could look something like this: Play ""<a data-name=""U.A. Hyper Stadium"">U.A. Hyper Stadium</a>"", search a Level 4 monster via its effect, use the second effect to reveal a ""<a data-name=""U.A. Stadium"">U.A. Stadium</a>"" in your hand to gain an additional Normal Summon for the turn, play ""<a data-name=""U.A. Stadium"">U.A. Stadium</a>"" from your hand, Normal summon the searched Level 4 monster giving you another search via the first effect of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Stadium"">U.A. Stadium</a>"", play another Level 4 monster via Normal summon (either because it was already in your hand or because you searched it with ""<a data-name=""U.A. Stadium"">U.A. Stadium</a>'s"" effect) to gain another search into a high-level monster and continue from there. The Field Spells are crazy useful and the ratio works fine in my mind. I even run one copy of ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" to get the missing piece more often. The three copies of ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>"" are mostly for ditching ""<a data-name=""U.A. Penalty Box"">U.A. Penalty Box</a>"", which can search a ""U.A."" Spell card when banished from the graveyard, giving you yet another searcher for the Field Spells or for the single copy of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Powered Jersey"">U.A. Powered Jersey</a>"", which in combination with ""<a data-name=""U.A. Dreadnought Dunker"">U.A. Dreadnought Dunker</a>"" can end games rather consistently. ""<a data-name=""U.A. Signing Deal"">U.A. Signing Deal</a>"" is both a playstarter, since it puts a monster on the field, as well as a search option because you can easily bounce the card and then resummon it with its effects activatable; the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a>"" serves a similar purpose. The deck works very well without touching the Extra Deck, therefore the maximum amount of ""<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>"" serve as very solid draw options. The generic rest is one ""<a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>"" to search for the Level 4 guys and therefore get them into my hand more consistently, which allows different searches via the Field Spell line-up and one ""<a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>"" against opposing backrow. One argument that I have encountered against ""<a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>"" is that you always have to discard a card, which can be pretty damaging to ""U.A."" but I do like to have the option of getting rid of a potential copy of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Penalty Box"">U.A. Penalty Box</a>"" in my hand; but feel free to run a different backrow removal.</p> <p>The Extra Deck, as is often the case, mostly features options for various situations in the game. ""<a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>"" makes Field Spells reuseable, ""<a data-name=""Missus Radiant"">Missus Radiant</a>"" can be used to push a little harder since the entire ""U.A."" line-up is Earth Attribute, the ""Knightmares"" are well-known and provide various removal effects, ""<a data-name=""Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights"">Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</a>"" can be used to search but will often not be necessary, ""<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>"" is a counter option against graveyard-heavy decks, ""<a data-name=""Evilswarm Exciton Knight"">Evilswarm Exciton Knight</a>"" can serve as a field reset, ""<a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" brings non-destruction removal, ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" is another anti-backrow option, ""<a data-name=""Number 61: Volcasaurus"">Number 61: Volcasaurus</a>"" can sometimes be used to burn for game, ""<a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>"" can steal monsters from the opponent which clears the field of one monster to get over while also providing you with another attacker, ""<a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack"">Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack</a>"" provides tokens and further removal and ""<a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>"" will bring Spell negation. Similar to the ""B.E.S."" deck I posted a while ago, ""U.A.s"" are not really in need of summoning any of those cards, but it is nice to have the option instead of leaving the Extra Deck empty (which would be a bad choice anyway due to ""Pot of Extravagance"").</p> <p>There are two deckbuilding details I want to mention still: Some decks run as little of the ""U.A."" monsters as possible, potentially running only one copy of every high-level monster because they are easily searchable and accessable. That is a valid strategy and can be played as such, I simply wanted to have the option to still have some of my playmakers after losing one to destruction effects or being forced to discard them. Pick whatever approach seems best in your mind. Number two is about the Extra Deck: Since ""<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>"" banishes six cards, there are decks that run about five Extra Deck monsters at maximum copy count to increase the chance of still having copies of everything after banishing. This is also a solid approach to take, the only thing you need to ask yourself in order to find out what is best in your deck is whether you like a plethora of options pre-""<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>"" or if you want access to all of the card post-""<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>"". Those are only some pointers I found noteworthy when building the deck.</p> <p>""U.A."" is certainly a quite unique and powerful deck to play. The option of turning an Aggro-board into a disruptive wall is both strong in-game and fun to pull off. If you are interested in the rest of the ""U.A."" archetype and want to read my opinion on all things ""U.A."", you can visit my blog, where I recently posted a ""U.A."" archetype analysis, here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/10/20/archetype-analysis-u-a/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/10/20/archetype-analysis-u-a/</a></p>"

","The Dogmatika archetype is an archetype that is against the extra deck, since they send cards from the extra deck to have effects, and they lock the player out of the extra deck. This archtype can be meshed into most decks usually invoked, or even buster blader more recently. Today I am testing it with Dinosaurs, and I find that it works pretty well. The strategy is to do all of your dinosaur combos, then do the dogmatika stuff to get a even more powerful board. Typically if you open Miscellaneousaurus, Babycerasaurus, and Nadir Servant, you end on Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, Evolzar Dolkka,  Dogmatika Ecclesia The Virtuous, Dogmatika Fleur De Lis, and a set Dogmatika Punishment.

I guess so,"&nbsp;  Been playing around and made a few changes to my previous iterations of this deck to what is the most competitive version yet.  Dragoon is the goal of the deck, sometimes it can feel like Dragoon or bust, but most of the time it’s VERY possible to get into Dragoon and even with a Flare Metal and/or disruption. Dragoon is almost always live but you don’t need him to stick. With Soul Servant, you can play a very consistent Dark Magician grind game until you can push for game.  Added dragon’s mirror because it’s cute with dragon knight and borreload furious. I might cut it, but I’ve been liking it so far, at the very least it’s way better than poly."

What a better way to bring out the excitement by expressing the horrifying fear that comes along before getting all the candy? Be prepared to join on this thrill ride of virtual trick-or-treating YuGiOh style!  First off, you can't go trick-or-treating without the perfect costume! Well, I've got you covered with options for everyone! There's the traditional superhero so Hero Kid is the perfect emphasis that shows every kid's dream to be their favorite superhero. Perhaps,  Disney princesses are more your thing so Cinderella has got you covered as well! But maybe superheroes and princesses are not your thing, perhaps you want to spice it up by throwing in your Sci-Fi favorites! The Kozmo series gives many options if you're a Star Wars fan and Mandalorian season 2 is right around the corner so #hyped. Jedi? Sith? Stormtrooper? Whatever you want! Lastly, this is a YuGiOh Halloween contest after all so the classics are here too, Dark Magician... Dark Magician Girl... even the robe and rod is offered for a build your own Dark magician costume! Kaibaman is there too for all our Seto Kaiba fans because let's be honest, Kaiba &gt; Yugi. Remember to bring your pumpkin!  You've picked your Halloween costume and you're prepared to go trick-or-treating. Well, it's not going to be your usual travelling door-to-door as the Ghostrick are here to give you that frightful fear as you progress through the night. Will you be brave enough to get through Stein? Ghoul? But don't worry because not everything Ghostrick is there to spook you as the Ghostrick Fairy is there to keep you on your feet!  If you've managed to get past the trials of the Ghostricks, you're one step closer to getting the candy! But first, you've reached the haunted mansion of Toon World. Do you dare to go inside? Of course! As the creeped door opens, you find yourself uneased but you have to keep pushing forward for that candy! Welcomed by the ghost of Shadow Toon as it follows you wherever you go, the creeping skull heads jump you for that sudden surprised! Of course, in the world of Toon World, Toon Summoned Skull will be the master of disguise behind these trickery. You don't know where it is but it could out any moment so be prepared! However, we're brave and nothing will stop us from getting our candy. We continue onwards and we see the Lady in Wight, Jack-o-bolan, Saggy the clown but it hasn't been too bad. Hey, this haunted house isn't as bad as the author puts it as! You prepare to exit through the door to the outside when you least realize it, the Toon Summoned Skull pops out from its shadows and drags you into the depths of the graveyard...  Into the graveyard, we see the lost souls of the victims to the Toon Summoned Skull. The grim reaper guards the lost souls from ever escaping.. is your life doomed? Are you stuck here without ever getting that candy? I guess that's it then.  ...  ...  ...  But wait there is one way out! The Ghostrick fairy who's stuck alongside with you this whole time to keep you from giving up has come to bless you with the chance at revival. With such bravery shown so far and never giving up, the fairy is impressed at your strong will and grants you the ""Call of the Haunted' allowing your escape. Unfortunately, as you leave though, the Ghostrick fairy has to bid you goodbye, having to stay behind in the graveyard as the call can only grant the escape of one being and the fairy has been searching for the ""one"" which is you.  Thankfully, with the Ghostrick fairy at your side, you managed to survive this Halloween adventure. Sadly, at the cost of the fairy though, but her sacrifice was necessary to save you. The Pot of Avarice congratulates you on your survival and grants you all the candy for you to enjoy even a Chocolate-a-la-mode! Though, the powers of the Pot gives you the chance to call back another from the graveyard but at the cost of no candy. Do you give up your candy treat to revive the Ghostrick fairy?

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. ""Thunder Dragon"" is an archetype of LIGHT and DARK Thunder monsters, used by Psychic Tendo in Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures. Their first member was introduced in the Vol.7 Booster Pack, while their first support was introduced in Soul Fusion. The general design and effect of each ""Thunder Dragon"" monster is based on and inspired by the original ""Thunder Dragon"", all of them being electrified dragons with a green, yellow, black or gray color scheme. ""Thunder Dragon Titan"" is especially influenced by the original ""Thunder Dragon"", which looks like a three-headed version of that monster, similar to the design of ""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"". ""Thunder Dragondark"" is a directly retrained version of the original ""Thunder Dragon"" as it has the same Type, Level, ATK, DEF, opposite Attribute, and similar effect of searching another copy of itself.

Mystic Mine OTK,"Going second OTK deck built around going second, and then either OTKing or breaking boards with Machina Citadel or Accesscode talker, while setting up Super Dora or  Apollo. The idea is to use Machina Citadel as a powerful recursive boss monster by stacking the GY with them, and then kill in one shot with Liebe. You also have the insane power of using Urgent Schedule to summon Scrap Recycler and Machina Citadel, which going second is an excellent way to break boards with DRNM, particularly with the Knightmares in the extra deck. Crystron Rosenix and Machina Fortress are included as Scrap Recycler targets, and Golem as the Scrap Wyvern Brick (though placing it in attack position on your opponent's field will open up OTKs.) Irradiator and Megaform can help make trains and stack multiple Citadels, and are mostly here because  Machina Redeployment is such a nuts card, and you need more targets. Still, the cards are good and help make trains where you'd have Citadels. Derricrane and Bullet Train are both Obligatory, because trains. Derricrane attached to Super Dora + Apollo is pretty good going first. both have useful side effects, and make rank 10s easily. You only need 1 Knight Express to search out with Switchyard (itself a busted card), at least in the Machina builds. Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede is just here as a Switchyard target, but in a pinch it is a dope normal summon. Rather than run 3 Switchyard, we're running 1 Switchyard, and 2 Mine, with Set Rotation, and Terraforming. You don't need as many copies of Switchyard as Mine, and Mine is basically here to be spell negate bait, though it also opens up easy Train OTKs. Gadarla is run over Jizikiru, who has synergy with the deck, simply because some Dino players are using Simorgh to Barrier Statue lock people. I think Kaijus are really good in trains, and are good right now - Dragoon is outed with 1 Kaiju, and Kaijus help out all kinds of cards you can't destroy (which is one of the things this deck excels at going second. Dark Ruler No More is basically obligatory in a deck that is dedicated going second. Infernoble makes this card a lot worse, but Infernoble's board is relatively easy to break after hand loops, and we can bring in hand traps for that matchup. Lightning Storm is likewise a going second staple, should be pretty obvious what the card is for. Urgent Schedule has fringe benefits going first if you see it alongside Scrap Recycler, adding a Level 10 Machine to your hand when you pop it with Wyvern. Unchained Abomination destroys spells and traps in control matchups, and is good for breaking boards in some instances over Accesscode. I love the card. Genius is some good going second negation, which can help turn off protection, force out negations, and enable board breaking. Pentestage and Underclock Taker are here for enabling OTK's.
