It's sooooo budget, but you can extend it by adding <a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World.</a>

Here I will show you the 2 main combos for the strategy.
The first combo is only by having <a data-name=""Unchained Twins - Aruha"">Unchained Twins - Aruha</a> and any Unchained spell/trap

- the set card is destroyed and you special summon <a data-name=""Aruha"">Aruha</a>
- you trigger the set card's floating effect to special summon <a data-name=""Unchained Twins - Sarama"">Unchained Twins - Sarama</a> from your deck
- use <a data-name=""Sarama"">Sarama</a>'s effect, targeting the spell/trap in your GY
- that card is set to your field then you destroy <a data-name=""Sarama"">Sarama</a>
- Sarama's floating effect special summons <a data-name=""Abominable Unchained Soul"">Abominable Unchained Soul </a>(you can trigger it's effect if you want)
- link the 2 monsters you have on the field into <a data-name=""Unchained Soul of Rage"">Unchained Soul of Rage</a>

Now you have a Link-2 monster on your field, who can link itself with an opponents monster during their Main Phase.

The second combo, which is an OTK if your opponent has no monsters on their field adn nothing in response to attacks, requires <a data-name=""Unchained Twins - Aruha"">Unchained Twins - Aruha</a>, <a data-name=""Unchained Twins - Rakea"">Unchained Twins - Rakea</a> and any Unchained spell/trap.
- you set the spell/trap
- pop it with <a data-name=""Aruha"">Aruha</a> which is then special summoned
- the set card's floating effect triggers to special summon <a data-name=""Sarama"">Sarama</a>
- normal summon <a data-name=""Rakea"">Rakea</a> and proceed to Battle Phase
- attack with them for 4500 damage
- activate the quick effect of <a data-name=""Rakea"">Rakea</a> to pop your <a data-name=""Aruha"">Aruha</a>
- aruha's floating effect triggers, special summoning <a data-name=""Abominable Unchained Soul"">Abominable Unchained Soul</a><a data-name=""Abominable Unchained Soul"">
- it's effect triggers, discarding the card that you have in your hand to pop your </a><a data-name=""Sarama"">Sarama</a><a data-name=""Abominable Unchained Soul""> (or </a><a data-name=""Rakea"">Rakea</a><a data-name=""Abominable Unchained Soul"">, it doesn't        matter)
</a>  - it's floating effect triggers to special summon one of your Unchained monsters (doesn't matter which) and swing for game

So that's all for the combo tutorial, good luck!"

Is luck on your side?,"Hey guys, Mi-ka-yo here, using another account to upload an entire GAMBLING DECK!  This is not like the Swordsman of Landstar deck, that deck had a lot more cards that didn't revolve around gambling.  With this one, I found the best and worst gambling cards that I could, put them together, and shared them for others to enjoy.

&nbsp;

I started with a deck called ""Gamble Mania"" that I downloaded a long time ago by somebody that I wouldn't be able to tell you the name of right now.  I completely gutted most of it, gave it much more cards, and an extra deck that really is nothing to write home about.........

&nbsp;

I believe that the point of this deck is to keep your opponents guessing so that you can have the upper hand (if the cards you have don't screw you over).  The gamble is the name of the game and I hope that you like it!

&nbsp;

Enjoy,

Mi-ka-yo"

&nbsp;

Edit : https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=447320-26191328 A replay to show the combo and where we can go with it.

&nbsp;

Well I assume you are here to look at one of the endless versions of Dragonmaid decks. Its the reason why this archtype became a fan favorite since its launch. You can play controll, stun, combo, 40 cards, 60 cards. Throw pots in, or throw them out ones you see that there is no money left after buying 3 Hospitality. Orrrr you are here for the waifus. Hey I dont judge, aslong as we agree that Drident is best maid.

Lets go over it card by card and talk about the goal we have with this deck.

The dragonmaid core :

3 Chamber : Searches you the fusion spell, hospi to extend, tidying to extend if you have ravine or to set for controll. She is one of the 1 card sphere maker and what is really important, she is the only one able to summon the fusion maids from grave at the start of the bp.

3 Parlor : Basically works the same as chamber and does almost all the same. Only difference she can send tidying directly for combo, but cant gets its controll eff. However if you already have extender in hand she is a good way to get nurse or any other maid you may need later to grave. Also a 1 card sphere

1 Kitchen : Just a free monster send or if you are lucky and have a big maid in hand which bricks you, also another way to get a new starter like chamber or parlor to hand. Sometimes you may hear a bell ring that you should play none. But look at her and tell me you dont want to have atleast one around.

1 Nurse : She is one of the cards holding the deck together. Overworked nurses are sadly also part in a fantasy card game, thats why you want to use her every turn to extend and summon more maids. She is basically a flat +1 or +2 everytime you summon her ones the grave is set.

2 Changeover : Your fusion spell to go into the gem of the deck Dragonmaid Sheou/Strahl, or House when you are lead down the dark path of VFD. Important to remember for the gy effect, even if the target leaves the board, you still add changeover to hand.

3 Hospitality : Probably one of the most broken extender to ever be printed. Set up your grave, non target summon from hand and gy. Searchable and one activation a turn no use. Sadly the price tag is justified, but dont buy it if you can avoid. Dont let people sky rock the price and gate people out. the reprint is coming !

3 Tidiyng : Looping cards back to hand and in best case triggering your House is always good, but non target summon from hand or gy in etiher players turn while being searchable by two cards ? This card should be the 40$ one~

&nbsp;

Rokket :

2 Tracer : Its tracer, it summons another rokket for a free Chaos ruler or Savage Dragon, and can be summoned by quick launch. Yeah, I dont know how quick launch and this can exist at the same time.

2 Absoruter : As we play Ravine we love discarding things that also give us free cards back so this card is already good for us, but it can also work as a mini noctovision dragon if we have a rokket on board. Dragon, free summon and search? Sign me up

1 Silver : Wont come up often but the banish eff can be nice

1 Recharger : target for quicklaunch and tracer, but also can work with striker dragon eff to recycle a tracer back to hand and summon 2 of boot sector
<ol>
 	<li>Boot Sector : Summon striker, search this spam rokkets. Simple</li>
</ol>
Dragons :

Noctovision : Make striker = free summon. Simple. gives you a extra draw and protects your set tidying when in grave, this card is basically a dragonmaid. Since its release its been probably the most played card which isnt part of the archtype.

Odd-eyes : High level dragon for fusion, which can search Emperor who we talk about in a bit. Can also summon fusion Monster from grave, and in 1 of a Million, can set up a pendulum scale. Its fun to use but can be cut.

Emperor : Recycles your banished dragons , is a high level dragon for fusion and can nuke the board in emergencys when you need non target removal. If you cut odd-eyes also cut this one

3 Nibiru : Big rock vs combo deck go token

3Gamma and 1 Driver : One of the strongest hand traps in the game with only little downside. You can use it to stop the opponent of going full combo or you can use it in your turn to protect a search spell / stop vfd / Zexel. And if you can do it in your turn you also get a free Chaos ruler. I see that as a absolute win.

1 Miradora : Situational and not to good currently. But we can search it of Tempest + its a high level dragon for fusion.

1 Dragons Ravine : Search of Romulus and dumb extender and send extender.

1 Tempest 1 Gold Sako : Simple combo to search Miradora or Parlor

All in all this deck is just learning which card leads to which combo, but the end board you should aim for is usually Sphere + Sheou or ones you know the cards a little better you can end on

Borrel Savage + Sphere + Sheou + Rampage/ Vfd

If wanted I can later add a few replays to show combos and how the deck performs against meta / ranked on DB"

Nothing to special, but a deck I personally have lots of fun with.

Disclaimer: This Deck ","Its a fun little Plant based deck.

Main goal of this deck is to manipulate your LP to gain as much value from your aromages as possible.

I believe I wont have to explain why I use three copies of <em>""Lonefire Blossom""</em>.

<em>""Rikka Petal""</em> is used as a recurring fodder for your <em>""Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy""</em> or <em>""Aromaseraphy Jasmin""</em>.

Other Tech Cards for this Deck are one copie of <em>""Rose Girl""</em> (free summon you can use for Link/XYZ/Synchro summons or as a fodder for <em>""Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy""</em> or <em>""Aromaseraphy Jasmin""</em>), two <em>""Rose Lover""</em> (mainly for Link/XYZ/Synchro summon and will help you special summon from hand) and three <em>""Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood""</em> (a handtrap many players dont even realize exists which helps you gain an LP advantage for your own effects).

<em>""Aromage Bergamot""</em> + <em>""Teardrop the Rikka Queen""</em> + <em>""Aromaseraphy Rosemary""</em> for the offensive.

Other Tech Cards I am still experimenting with are: <em>""Copy Plant""</em>, <em>""One for One""</em>,<em> ""Gigaplant""</em>, <em>""Fairy Archer Ingunar""</em>, <em>""Solemn Warning/Judgement""</em>.

&nbsp;

Edit: I am aware that ""Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light"" is a must have for any plant based strategie but since I try to develop this deck on a budget I havent included her. Since it is work in progress I am gonna add her if she drops in value."

DESTROY THE CITY TO SAVE THE CITY!!!

There is not much to say, it is a strange and perhaps unnecessary combination but hey I thought about it because of the concept of Kaijus vs Heros and in the end hey it works it is not spectacular but it works, you have fun and you confuse people.

<strong>KAIJUS</strong>

<strong>Big boys: </strong>Thunder King and Dogoran are normally used to summon them and kick butts or to save the little ones and their negations

<strong>Little boys: </strong>Gameciel and Kumongous easily tribute enemys or you can keep them and have a negation (HERO has no negations :1)

<strong>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber: </strong>You all know the power of this card, you take away the easy field, you settle in with the Kaijus you want and also look for the next turn

<strong>Kyoutou Waterfront:</strong> Needed on anything Kaiju based

<strong>HERO!!!</strong>

<strong>Well I promise to do this, I think that an explanation of everything HERO is unnecessary since I think it is common knowledge to know how they work and if not, they are tremendously intuitive</strong>

<strong>Honest Neos: </strong>Extra ATK

<strong>Malicious:</strong> Go easy to GY and look for another

<strong>Faris-Vyon-Increase: </strong>Easy Combo just with Faris in hand

<strong>Adusted: </strong>Searchable search engine

<strong>Stratos: </strong>Incredibly good card from HERO

<strong>Liquid Soldier: </strong>Good draw ability, in addition to being part of Absolute Zero

<strong>Solid Soldier: </strong>Extra Body

<strong>Shadow Mist: </strong>Great card, can search in any sense

<strong>Emergency Call: </strong>Search for any Elemental (Usually Stratos)

<strong>Dark Calling: </strong>Summon Malicious Bane

<strong>Miracle Fusion: </strong>Sunrise card, in addition to summoning Zero normally

<strong>Mask Change: </strong>Access to all Masked HERO

<strong>Malicious Bane:</strong> Adusted makes him so easy to summon and he's also a monster of destruction.

<strong>Escuridao:</strong> Take off dark stuff

<strong>Absolute Zero:</strong> He is a great hero, easy to summon, destroys field

<strong>Trinity:</strong> He win games

<strong>Sunrise:</strong> Help your heroes, look for Miracle Fusion and it is also easy to summon

<strong>Masked Acid:</strong> Combo with Absolute Zero to clean field

<strong>Masked Dark Law</strong>: One of the best Heroes

<strong>Masked Blast:</strong> Something niche but it works many times

<strong>Xtra Dread Decimator:</strong> Although it may not seem like it, it is easy to summon, in addition to helping the OTK

<strong>Xtra Wonder Driver:</strong> Extend combos

<strong>Xtra Cross Crusader</strong>: With malicious it is easy to invoke in addition to looking for any necessary HERO

<strong>Other Things</strong>

<strong>Triple Tactics: </strong>Very good versatility

<strong>Polymerization: </strong>Vyon card

<strong>Reinforcement: </strong>ROTA

<strong>Terraforming: </strong>Search the kaiju field

<strong>Reborn: </strong>Super Staple

<strong>Exciton Knight: </strong>It's not necessary at all, I just like it :)

<strong>Unicorn and Phoenix: </strong>Best Generic Links

<strong>Other Options</strong>

<strong>Kaiju:</strong> Jizukiru is a good Big Boy and Anti-Kaiju makes the deck even more Kaiju

<strong>Destiny:</strong> Destiny Fusion + Drawhand + Malicious = Dystopia, is a good combo unfortunately you can only play dark, which breaks all this but hey, if you like it you can add Radian to help... oh and Dynatag helps... sometimes

<strong>HERO:</strong> Dian helps Solid Soldier to stand out, in addition to perhaps increasing the copies of him, Favorite Hero synergizes well with the deck through the kaiju field, but in the end I did not like it, although it is a very good option, Form Change to greedy plays

<strong>Super Poly:</strong> The Superpoly Engine is quite good although I am still not convinced

<strong>Staples:</strong> Called is hell of a card and Droplet helps OTK or negations normally

<strong>Thing you should Know</strong>

Think well which Kaiju you want to use to tribute and which one to keep, this could decide the.

Normally Wonder Driver is in most HERO recipes, because it is quite good but if you are not a great HERO player or a great combo planner you will hardly ever use it so in that case it would be fine to change it

Speaking more of the other options, the Superpoly Engine is seriously good, it fits good with the deck and it can also make the Kaijus take advantage even when you gave them to the rival, on the other hand Favorite HERO is great on the deck I mean it with the field, with the other attack that is very good,only that something in me does not finish seeing it, even so I think that the indicated thing would be to be able to the card in the deck to 2 copies.

<strong>Upcoming decks?</strong>

<strong>Abhyss:</strong> Well maybe I lied about the sphinx, in the end I did not like it but haha memories instead this new archetype of Reptiles... well I will only say that in this one if I have a couple of ideas.

<strong>Galaxy Control:</strong> It sounds crazy but when I saw some cards of the archetype I liked the idea, even so I continue in that because of my low knowledge of the archetype (By the way I think that more than Galaxy is Photon, what should i call the deck?)

<strong>True Draco Crystal:</strong> I continue with the idea of the Deck, it is already done but its a little lazy even so, the most probably thing is that I will upload it soon.

<strong>Remake of the Best Fusion Deck:</strong> Well, the Remake goes there, the bad thing is that it doesn't really add anything good, but that's fine, it's not like I have to change the deck completely. The important thing is to bring it back and explain why is a good deck.

So how does this deck achieve it's goal? devote the entire thing to specialing zombie monsters. What archetype can shit out zombie monsters like it's nobody's business? Mayakashi, specifically the synchro cards + Dakki. Dakki is a tuner that special summons itself from the graveyard when used for a synchro summon. but with practically no protection that either of these cards have, this is where Zombie World comes in. You see, Bone Tower doesn't specify YOU summoning a zombie monster, but EITHER PLAYER. Zombie World, the field spell that turns every monster on both fields and graveyards zombie type essentially limits how many summons your opponent can do before milling their entire deck themselves."

If I were to rank dragon link in the current metagame, I would give it a solid tier 1.5 (Tier 1 would be Drytron, VW and Eldlich). Another thing to consider is that Dragon link Took 1st in the 3v3 LCS 10!! There were more than 300 players participating in this tournament and dragon link still found it’s way to the top (Insert Sam saying “I TOLD YOU!!!” Here). 1st place was taken by Gabriel Netz and his team and this build I have today is inspired off of his build but has differences. </span>

&nbsp;

<span>Before Doing the deck explanation, I just wanted to thank everyone here at YGOPROdeck for all the support. This is deck #30 for me and I have already hit over 115,000 total views for my decks here on YGOPROdeck!! To me this means a lot and I feel like it is amazing being able to communicate with so many people. Thanks for the support!</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Just a quick reminder that the deck explanation, All the combos and explanations on ways to best use your resources are ALL on my Youtube video. Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me and the channel!</span>

<b>Changes I am making to my build (compared to my older versions)</b><span> - </span>
<ol>
 	<li>
<ol>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>I am not playing VFD</b><span> - this is not a deck revolving around using VFD as the main negate/win condition. It uses several different kinds of interruptions to disrupt the opponent. It uses specific interruptions designed to counter the top tier decks of the current metagame. For example, Heradic seal and Dragonmaid Tidying are used to bounce back cards to the opponent’s hand - this is an amazing way to counter Zoodiac (very reliant on normal summon) and Virtual world (gets rid of the card targets for the VW monsters) and is also a high impact interruption which can be used to get rid of walls like Dragoon and Final Sigma as well (bounce does not target or destroy) and Number 68 completely exodia obliterates Drytron and is also effective against eldlich and other graveyard reliant decks. </span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>I am playing a 40 card deck </b><span>- To increase consistency this was needed. This deck is also not playing bricks (except PSY-Driver which does not count) so it is completely ok to play 40 cards because the main reason Dragon link played bricks in the first place was to reduce the risk of drawing bricks, but since this deck plays only 1 brick, it is fine to play 40. The 1st place deck also played 40 cards.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>I am not running black metal <span>- Again, I needed to make the deck 40 cards and there wasn’t space for this. Also, since decks like Drytron are in the metagame, the popularity of skull mister is gone up and Black metal is a skull mister target. I just felt like Seyfert and Chaos space were more than enough. Seyfert and space also have the protection of GAMMA.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1"">I am running Chamber Dragonmaid and Dragonmaid Tidying <span>- This was because Tidying is such a strong trap and is very high impact. Chamber can serve as the normal summon and since the deck just plays so many extenders, the deck can afford to play Chamber as a normal summon instead of something like seyfert. Normal summoning Chamber is better than normal summoning something like rokket tracer. Chamber can also be summoned off of elpy if not drawn. Tidying also serves as a monster reborn for the following turn and that will allow chamber to search another tidying if you need to play the grind game.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<b>Composition of the deck</b><span> -</span>

&nbsp;
<table>

<tr>
<td><b>Starters </b><span>(cards you usually normal summon to get the combo going - there are ones that do not require the normal summon but almost all the starters get you into a romulus)</span></td>
<td><span>For starters (get it? Starters? Nvm) I am playing 3 Chamber Dragonmaid, 3 Seyfert, 3 Chaos Space, 1 Black Dragon and 1 White Dragon. Chamber does not get you into a romulus and requires an extra extender to work with but is a great card since it increases the disruptions on the endboard by 1 in the form of a very high impact trap card - Dragonmaid tidying. This is well worth the extender and chamber is also something’s summoned off of elpy. Seyfert and chaos space (the best starter) are to search the chaos dragons and can be protected from ash blossom with gamma. If one of the chaos dragons are drawn, with any normal summon of the other attribute (light or dark) it is basically a starter on its own. Chaos space can also search lavineer and if you manage to not banish seyfert, you can even mill lavineer with ravine, use seyfert to add back lavineer and search anything else with Brotaur!!</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Extenders</b><span> (cards that extend your plays and help if you get hit with handtraps)</span></td>
<td><span>The extenders are - 3 Quick launch, 3 World Legacy, 3 Noctovision, 1 brotar and 1 Lavineer. No explanation needed for those, all of those will help you extend plays.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Combo extenders </b><span>(cards that extend your combo, put up additional disruptions and are good to see in hand but cannot help you if you get handtrapped in most cases)</span></td>
<td><span>They are - 3 Tracer, 2 synchron, 1 recharger, 1 absorouter and 2 Tidying. All of these cards help your plays and combos in setting additional interruptions - watch my video for knowing how these help the combo, you need to actually know the combo to understand why these cards help.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Handtraps</b></td>
<td><span>I am running 3 ash and 3 gamma, very self explanatory.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Soft Bricks</b></td>
<td><span>They are (one each) PSY-Driver, Boot Sector and Dragon Ravine. Soft bricks simply mean a -1, nothing too dangerous.</span></td>
</tr>

</table>
&nbsp;

<b>Cards in this deck that counter the current meta </b><span>-</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Notice that cards from the side deck are also included. The stuff in parenthesis is what the card counters in that deck, if there is no parenthesis, it means it counters the deck in general. Ash is not in this list since it counters literally everything. Basic interruptions such as seal, savage, and tidying are not mentioned unless they specifically counter a certain deck - they also counter literally anything but I choose not to add them in. And yes Tri-brigade and rocks are meta now. </span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Drytron</b><span> - number 68 (hardcounter), droll (hardcounter), nibiru, droplet (ruler and ultimateness)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Eldlich</b><span> - hfd and cosmic cyclone (backrow removal), lancea (side deck), lavineer (can pop backrow), unchained (pops) and basic removal cards, number 68</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Zoodiac</b><span> (all to counter zeus) - dinowrestler, kaijus, nibiru, droplet, tidying and seal (zoo is very relient on normal summon)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Virtual World</b><span> - droplet (VFD and shenshen), gamma(VFD), cosmic cyclone (banishes chuche - makes them unable to combo), nibiru (not always useful since number 75 is in VW), seal and tidying (get rid of the targets for the VW monsters), kaiju (shenshen), dinowrestler (shenshen), droll, lancea </span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Bird up! Tri-Brigade</b><span> - droplet (apex avian and zeus), lancea (hardcounter), kaijus and dinowrestler (zeus and apex avian), nibiru, seal and tidying (relient on certain combo pieces to resolve)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Adamancipators</b><span> - nibiru, droplet (for the multiple negate endboard), kaijus and dinowrestler (break endboard), tidying and seal (fairly relient on normal summon)</span></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<b>Conclusion</b><span> - Dragon link is a solid meta contender and I would rank it (in the current metagame) a tier 1.5 deck. It is definitely not the best deck or anything, in my opinion Drytron, Virtual World and Eldlich outrank it (tier 1 decks) but Dragon link is still a great meta choice. If you want to win more, I would recommend playing one of the other 3 decks but Dragon link can also win duels - just that the other 3 decks are a little better. If you are like me you would play dragon link anyway!! The deck can easily go anti meta and fares fairly well against the top 3 meta contenders but loses easily to NIBIRU. I think in the end it all comes down to how familiar you are with the deck, if you are confident and familiar with this deck - I saw go for it beat all the other meta contenders and show them who’s on top!!! Dragon link best deck lets goooo!</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Also make sure to answer the poll question in the comments! Today’s poll question is: If you had to rank all the yugioh anime, what order would you rank them and what score would you give each of them out of 10?</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Mine would be -</span>
<ol>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>5ds (9.5/10)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>ZEXAL (9/10)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Duel monsters season 1 (8/10)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Vrains (7/10)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Duel academy (7/10)</span></li>

my personal favorite strat:

1: activate black whirlwind

2: summon Blackwing - Auster the South Wind and activate the spell

3: add Blackwing - Harmattan the Dust to your hand and special summon him.

4: activate the effect of Blackwing - Harmattan the Dust and target Blackwing - Auster the South Wind

5: synchro summon Blackwing Full Armor Master

if your opponent has a monster you want then activate the effect of Blackwing - Auster the South Wind in the graveyard in order to put a wedge counter on your opponents monsters. then activate Blackwing Full Armor Master and then pick the monster you want to take control of."

Rainbow Life to resist against burn. Metaverse/Terraforming to fetch Dark Sanctuary. Final Countdown as an alternative wincon. Extra Deck is fairly useless, it exists ""just in case"". N&deg;41 to negate effects, N&deg;39 to negate attacks. Sideboard is to sustain against weaknesses. The Dark Door to stall attacks. Mask of Dispel/Anti-Spell Fragrance to burn against traps/Spell heavy decks. Magic Cylinder against aggressive decks. Judgment of Anubis against heavy boardwipes. Strong against Burn or decks relying on a lot of spells/traps, weaker against fast decks. Fastest assemble is done in 8 turns. Just made this deck for fun in my LGS.

Heavily depends on field spell otherwise you have to send cards from your hand.

Use Demise/Metaverse to put out Mystic mine, to buy time until you can build a decent hand.

It can put out a lord turn 1 with the right cards to have them start with -1

feel free to replace torrential tribute with whatever you want, I find torrential tribute and royal decree the most useful sides, Dark law also pretty good to disrupt...

Performs pretty solidly but you have to protect the field spell hard until the opponent has no outs."

I honestly just change it every time I hit a losing streak and then post it on here if it successfully breaks my los,"This is my third Endymion deck. I honestly just like posting it on here every time I update my deck.

I started using Chronograph Sorcerer and Timegazer Magician. I can not believe I did not use them before. Chronograph is a free spell for counters, and makes Timegazer a free special summon (I think this might have been common knowledge but keep in mind I started playing Yugioh like late-December of 2020). Not only that, but if you have a second Chronograph in hand, and you pop Chronograph to bring out Timegazer, then that activates Chronograph's effect to special summon itself from your hand, as well as any other monster from your hand that you want to special summon. That's an instant Crowley for the spellbook engine and you haven't even normal summoned yet (also if you want to keep 'em there, Timegazer has low atk/def values but acts as additional protection for your scales). If you can activate instant fusion to get out Millennium-Eyes Restrict, or activate Servant of Endymion to bring out Jackal King before you link into Crowley then you are basically free to run to grab more counters and also thin out your deck a bit more.

There is also one copy of Super Polymerization. From what I understand, most people say to run 3 or none at all, but honestly with this you are drawing into your deck so much that you either get your ideal board of negates or you draw into Super Poly anyways. This is here because I am tired of going against a first turn Dragoon with a mediocre hand. This way, I usually either have a solid hand that can play around Dragoon's negate and then finish my combo to get accesscode or something and just walk over Dragoon anyways, OR I'll have Super Poly and just take him out for Starving Venom.

Speaking of the extra deck, I took out Day-breaker and Bagooska for Starving Venom and Mudragon. I usually will always try to go for Starving Venom, especially against monsters like Dragoon and Borrelend, but if can't, Mudragon is a good way to interrupt plays as well, especially because if I activate its effect to prevent the targeting of a specific attribute, I can actually stop a surprising amount of combos (though usually if they are able to, they will just go into battle phase and walk over your Mudragon-- it still makes them waste a battle phase and saves you from a potential OTK that turn). I also added in Underworld Goddess of the Closed World from Blazing Vortex. This is also just an amazing card to out boss monsters that ""can't be destroyed by card effects/battle and can't be targeted"" (Dragoon/Borrelend/etc.), and she has a pretty nice effect too.

Also just wanted to put it out there because I sometimes forget: but if the opp. has monsters like Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds or Vanity's Ruler, you can use Archfiend Eccentrick to destroy them."

Claw of Hermos side deck for fun/casual play. Sort of meta since the main card is Dragoon.","This is a pure red-eyes deck with a hermos side deck for fun. If you are playing casually I recommend siding in Hermos (or side him in whenever you want).

if you don't draw Red-Eyes fusion there is still a way to get Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon on the field; Predaplant verte anaconda. Just pay 2000LP, send Red-Eyes fusion, DM and REBD to the grave. It's not easy to get Anaconda on the field as you need 2 monsters to link summon it, but its still a decent back-up plan if you don't draw Red-Eyes Fusion.

<strong>Main Deck</strong> and <strong>Side Deck </strong>(40 cards) (15 cards)

I put more monsters than spells/traps mainly because the Red-Eyes archetype has many monsters but not too many good spells/traps. This deck is also gemini, so say hello to Phoenix Gearfried! Gemini ablation is for getting Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon and Phoenix Gearfried on the field (as well as the other gemini's). Gemini summoner is for when you can't fusion summon but you have a powerful gemini card in your hand.

8x Fusion cards: Claw of Hermos x3 (In the side deck), 3x Red-Eyes Fusion and 2x Polymerization for fusion summoning the fusion dragon cards.

I added 3x Ash Blossom (side deck) and 2x Ghost Ogre because I couldn't find enough spells/traps, so instead I chose handtraps. Luckily Ghost Ogre is quite reliable.

<strong>Extra deck </strong>(9 cards but 4 cards in the side-deck)

The extra deck contains powerful cards which are part of the Red-Eyes archetype. Clearwing is just for taking full advantage of the handtraps (the handtraps are tuners)."

First to go special summon photon lord and harbinger and second turn go for Otk. Deck ratio can be change but try to make it as consistent as possible as Galaxy deck oftenly get an auto lose due to bricky hands. U may bait your opponent negation by putting in cards like mind control or infinite impermanence or even photon hand. Beware of nibiru! summon photon lord first if  you dont want your board get wiped by it.

Pure Ancient Warriors are nice and all but Tri-brigade gives the deck the extender it really needs. The synergy between the two is also great.

One good interaction is that you can activate 3 visits, then summon Double Dragon with the eff of a tribrigade and still proc the eff of 3 visits to search any ancient warriors.

The deck is good going first or second. I play a single revolt that can be search off the new tribrigade link which gives me more possibility going first or in the grind but you can remove it and try a full going second build."

I'm not saying it's good, it is Crystal Beasts after all, but I think it can be competitive with some newer non-meta decks. There are a number of strategies. You can try to get Hamon out and then Rainbow Dragon or Rainbow Overdragon. The Links and XYZ monsters allow you to use your crystal beasts for something useful and then to send them to the graveyard where you can access them with support spells. You have access to Zeus through Utopia, and Rainbow Neos is great spot removal.

Let's go through the cards one by one and explain what they're run for.

<strong><span>Monsters:</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>1x Elemental Hero Neos - Bricky, but needed for Rainbow Neos</li>
 	<li>1x Rainbow Dragon - an okay boss monster, but very hard to get out, mostly used for Rainbow Neos</li>
 	<li>3x Sapphire Pegasus - this card is your bread and butter. Use it to search itself and fill your back row with Crystal Beasts.</li>
 	<li>2x Ruby Carbuncle - I probably think this card  is better than it is, but its effect of being able to special summon the beasts in your back row can be really useful for flooding your board with monsters you can use to link off or XYZ.</li>
 	<li>1x Emerald Tortoise, 1x Amber Mammoth, 1x Topaz Tiger, 1x Amethyst Cat, 1x Cobalt Eagle - None of these cards are especially useful, mostly used for Ultimate Crystal Magic and for filling your back row.</li>
 	<li>3x Ash Blossom - I mean come on. You can use this to negate so much. Very useful for shutting down your opponent and keeping yourself alive.</li>
</ul>
<strong><span>Spells and Traps:</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>3x Crystal Bond - This card is so good. You can use it to search out a Sapphire Pegasus and put a Ruby Carbuncle in your back row. A lot of plays begin with this card.</li>
 	<li>3x Rainbow Bridge - This card lets you search out bond, beacon, or any other spell that you might need at a given time. Very useful card.</li>
 	<li>2x Rainbow Ruins - Could maybe be bumped down to one or even zero. Just useful for staying alive longer and giving you an out when you inevitably fill your entire back row with beasts.</li>
 	<li>2x Crystal Abundance - This card is really good but the condition is pretty prohibitive. You can use it to flood your board and OTK or just link off the monsters. Could honestly be bumped to three, but only if you think it's actually good.</li>
 	<li>3x Crystal Promise - Great with sapphire pegasus as a way to get out Rainbow Neos instantly. Normal summon a pegasus, search out a pegasus, use promise to special summon the second pegasus, then you can link them off into verte anaconda and summon Rainbow Neos.</li>
 	<li>3x Crystal Beacon - Good for an OTK that the deck is kind of built around. More on that later.</li>
 	<li>1x Crystal Blessing - I think this is the worst crystal spell I included. It's good to fill your backrow after linking, but useless otherwise and bricky if you don't have any beasts in your graveyard.</li>
 	<li>1x Neos Fusion - You only really need one for verte anaconda, but you could maybe run two if you also bumped up your Rainbow Neos materials.</li>
 	<li>1x Raigeki - Pretty self explanatory, destroy your opponent's monsters.</li>
 	<li>1x Harpie's Feather Duster - Pretty self explanatory, destroy your opponent's back row.</li>
 	<li>2x Ultimate Crystal Magic - Lets you get out Rainbow Overdragon. Pretty good, easy to activate, could probably be bumped to three.</li>
 	<li>1x Crystal Conclave - I do not think this card is as good as other people make it out to be. Special summoning is nice, but it takes up a zone in your back row that could otherwise be a beast.</li>
 	<li>1x Infinite Impermanence - Deal with your opponents effect monsters and negate them.</li>
 	<li>1x Witch's Strike - Great for getting back at your opponent when they negate a summon.</li>
</ul>
<strong><span>Side Deck:</span></strong>

I think this deck actually has a lot of potential for the side deck. I listed a lot of cards that could be bumped down. You could definitely drop the  5 crystal beasts, a Neos Fusion, and so on and then fill up on hand traps or whatever else you need.
<ul>
 	<li>2x Nibiru - This card is great against certain decks. This card is a one card OTK enabler.</li>
 	<li>2x Hamon - This card can act as a replacement boss monster if you want another win condition, but getting out Rainbow Neos is probably easier.</li>
 	<li>1x Topaz Tiger, 1x Emerald Tortoise, 1x Cobalt Eagle, 1x Amethyst Cat, 1x Amber Mammoth - Hey these cards aren't very good. You could probably drop them from the side deck for more tech cards. I just included them in case you want to add them for your second Ultimate Crystal Magic.</li>
 	<li>1x Neos Fusion - Could probably be dropped for more tech cards, just include if you want a back up for the first one getting Ashed.</li>
 	<li>2x Infinite Impermanence - Great card, great negation, really good if you go second.</li>
 	<li>1x Twin Twisters - More back row removal</li>
 	<li>1x Solemn Warning - You wanted to summon that monster? Damn bro, that sucks.</li>
 	<li>1x Dark Ruler No More - this lets you deal with pesky effects and annoying monsters like Dragoon.</li>
</ul>
<strong><span>Extra Deck:</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>1x Rainbow Overdragon - Good boss monster, not as good as Rainbow Neos</li>
 	<li>1x Rainbow Neos - Really good card. Great removal that doesn't destroy or target. Very easy to get out with Verte Anaconda. This card is so good and could probably be bumped up to two.</li>
 	<li>1x Daigusto Emeral, 1x Tornado Dragon, 1x Abyss Dweller - Generic rank 4 XYZ monsters that let you have various utility like back row removal or drawing cards.</li>
 	<li>1x Gossip Shadow - Rank 3 for the few times you want to and can go into those. Great monster negate that lets you draw.</li>
 	<li>1x Utopia, 1x Utopia the Lightning, 1x Zeus - You can evolve Utopia into Lightning, attack, then summon out Zeus with 4 materials. Zeus is great, you can shuffle out whatever your opponent puts out.</li>
 	<li>1x Knightmare Cerberus, 1x Knightmare Phoenix, 1x Knightmare Unicorn - You basically have to run these cards in any deck. They're easy spot removal that you can get out for basically nothing.</li>
 	<li>I:P Masquerena - Good interruption. Great card, easy to get out.</li>
 	<li>Verte Anaconda - Kinda the backbone of this deck. Get it out as fast as possible and get out Rainbow Neos.</li>
</ul>
<strong><span>Example 2 Card Combo </span></strong>

Imagine you draw Crystal Bond and Crystal Beacon. This has the possibility to be an OTK. Either of these cards could also be a Rainbow Bridge. Anyway, start with Crystal Bond and search out a pegasus and put whatever in your back row. Normal summon Pegasus, put another pegasus in your back row. Use beacon to special summon Carbuncle from your deck. Use carbuncle's effect to summon up the pegasus and the other crystal beast. You now have two pegasus, a carbuncle, and another crystal beast. on your field. Link off the carbuncle and other crystal beast into Verte Anaconda, use it to summon Rainbow Neos, then tribute your Verte Anaconda to wipe your opponent's monsters. Now you have 8100 Attack points, just barely enough to OTK. This combo gets even better if you can add a promise into the mix."

The deck runs 60 cards to help reduce brick hands.

The Eldlich engine is the backbone of this deck. Golden Lord can be used as a beat-stick or for back-row removal, and he enables the secondary effects of the Eldlich trap monsters. Cursed Eldland allows you to search you other Eldlich cards. Sanguine summons Golden Lord from your deck or GY and it floats into your trap monsters. The trap monsters can each float into Sanguine. Gustav Max can be made if you get both Golden Lords to help close out games.

The Red-Eyes engine is designed to turbo Dragoon. The vanillas and Fusion card are needed for the summon, and Insight and Wyvern help you get to Fusion. Link Spider allows you to make Anaconda using trap monsters, and Anaconda gives you another way to access Fusion. Dragoon is way too powerful, so you have to play him while you can. Wyvern can bring him back after he is destroyed if the conditions are met.

The Dogmatika engine gives you access to a lot of removal and extra deck hate. Ecclesia allows you to search the other parts of this engine on summon, and can be special summoned if your opponent controls an extra deck monster. Fleurdelis is a beat-stick and negate. Maximus removes cards from your opponent's extra deck and can trigger N'tss. Nadir Servant can trigger N'tss and search Ecclesia. Punishment is removal that can also trigger N'tss for an extra removal.  Ash Dragon can be sent instead of N'tss if you want a search instead of removal.

The Shaddoll engine gives you access to control and removal tools through its extra deck monsters. Construct can run over extra deck monsters. Apkallone has battle protection and negation. Winda is a special summon floodgate. The main deck monsters provide a diverse tool-box through their flip and sent to the GY effects.

The Invoked engine has the rest of your extra deck monsters. Mechaba has negates. Augoeides can destroy a monster. Purgatrio is a beat-stick with piercing. Caliga is a battle and effect floodgate. Their main deck cards search each other, and provide recursion allowing you to recycle Invocation and Aleister.

Terraforming provides an extra copy of Meltdown which is the start of your Invoked search chain. Prison is powerful removal that can be used against most decks. Torrential is a great tool for punishing over extension, and, if Golden Lord was summoned by his own effect, he is immune to the destruction.

The side deck has back-row hate and hand-traps that can be sided in as needed."

Predaplant Engine,"I've been working on this particular Shaddoll build for a bit now and I'm pretty excited with the results so far.

Squamatta &amp; Wendi are your primary engine cards so you have to run 3 each. Ariel is your combo enabler with some incidental GY hate stapled to it. Keios is really just a Light tutor target to enable your plays with Construct. The rest are utility effects that you can access at almost any time you want.

Performage engine enables your combos via Trick Clown. Damage Juggler can have some nice synergy with the Predeplant engine as well as granting you more utility. Hat Tricker is just a tutor target and extender, he also grants access to the Earth type in the main deck.

The Predeplant engine is nice here because Shaddoll doesn't need a normal summon in-archetype but can have issues finding its Fusion spells at times. Scorpion for Cobra fixes this issue quite nicely while offering Dark type monsters to fuse with and putting bodies on the table for link summons. The fact that Scorpion can tutor any of your fusion effects is also quite nice as it offers a lot of utility.

The hand trap line-up is pretty standard. Ash is the best HT in the format. Gamma protects your Shaddoll Fusion from Ash while also providing Light monsters for Construct. Veiler isn't the best HT option in the format, but we really want access to Light monsters as often as possible and Veiler is likely the next best card for the slot.

Rainbow Neos is probably the portion of the deck that looks the strangest, but hear me out. There are a couple of reasons to play it over Dragoon in this deck. For one, we like the Light type monsters a lot more than the Darks, so opening with the fusion material hurts a lot less. But there is also the fact that Neos Fusion is a much better target for your Predeplant engine since you can summon the same turn you activate it.

There is also a metagame aspect to this pick. Currently the deck does fine vs Drytron and Virtual World, as we play good ways to interact with them in the main deck. However, Eldlich can be an issue for the deck. Rainbow Neos is actually an incredibly strong card in this match up. All 3 effects can be absolutely backbreaking against Lich when used at the right time, and he can't be outed by a single Conquistador thanks to the GY effect of Neos Fusion.

Also, and arguably most importantly, Rainbow Neos is just way cooler than Dragoon.

Not a lot to talk about as far as spells go, but I will say that your 3 limited spells all offer an absolute bevy of utility for you and I would not leave home without any of them.

As for traps, Incarnation is a combo enabler and utility piece in one. 2 feels like the right number. Only 1 Schism might look wrong for how powerful the card is, but it's extremely easy to access from the deck whenever you want it.

Extra deck:

-Shekhinaga is important as a Super Poly target vs Zoo

-Construct is your best card, never leave without 3

-Apkallone offers incredible utility between both of its effects

-Winda is stupid good. 1 is usually enough, but I like running 2 in case I burn one early on an Instant Fusion play or just on an early combo start.

-Venom &amp; Mudragon are easy little Super Poly targets. Venom is extra important since you can make it off of Verte Anaconda and any opponents monster you can target with Anaconda's effect. Mudragon is nice because it can also be summoned off of Instant Fusion and become any type you might be missing in a pinch.

-Accesscode Talker is your combo end boss. When made with Unicorn, Talker+ Construct offers an easy 8100 damage while clearing the opponents board on the way.

-Unicorn is great utility and the link-3 enabler to make big Accesscode.

-Cross-Sheep is your link-climbing expert and another important piece of your main combo.

-Anaconda is Anaconda.

-Gravity Controller enables any opening that can make Construct or Apkallone to tutor Schism to your hand.

1-card Shaddoll Fusion combo:
<ol>
 	<li>Activate Fusion, sending Trick Clown and Squamatta to make Construct</li>
 	<li>Trigger Clown, Squamatta, and Construct. SS Clown, send Wendi and Incarnation to the GY.</li>
 	<li>Trigger Wendi, set Ariel from deck.</li>
 	<li>Link Construct and Clown to make Cross-Sheep, picking back up Fusion with Construct's effect.</li>

<span>Monsters (29)</span>

<span>1 Mist Vally Apex Avian (mist valley loop)</span>

<span>3 blackwing bora the spear (easy body)</span>

<span>3 blackwing kris the crack of dawn (easy body)</span>

<span>3 blackwing auster the south wind (combos with allure)</span>

<span>1 blackwng zephrios the elite (extender and vital to have)</span>

<span>3 blackwing gale the whirlwind (haha, repeatable attack cut go brrr)</span>

<span>2 blackwing pinaki the waxing moon (comeback move if necessary)</span>

<span>1 mist valley thunderbird (mist valley loop)</span>

<span>2 blackwing breeze the zephyr (add to hand = summon)</span>

<span>1 blackwing gust the gladius (conditonal summoning)</span>

<span>3 blackwing gust the backblast (great card to open with)</span>

<span>2 blackwing blizzard the far north (grave summoner)</span>

<span>1 blackwing hamaten the dust (you can play this at any number you want, I play one)</span>

<span>2 blackwing orochi the squall (easy monster to summon)</span>

<span>1 blackwing vayu emblem of honor (underrated extender)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Spells (11)</span>

<span>3 black whirlwind (gimmie more blackwings)</span>

<span>3 against the wind (looks bad on paper, great in practice)</span>

<span>3 allure of darkness (need I say more?)</span>

<span>1 rank up magic soul shave force (summoning infinity)</span>

<span>1 foolish burial (because why not?)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Extra (15)</span>

<span>Synchro (6)</span>

<span>2 Blackwing full armor master (busted in some ways)</span>

<span>1 assault blackwing rikiri the rain shower (big numbers be like)</span>

<span>1 blackwing nuthong the starlight (another normal summon, black whirlwind)</span>

<span>1 assault blackwing soryo the rain storm (the synchro vayu summons)</span>

<span>1 formula synchron (explained later)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Xyz (4)</span>

<span>1 cyber dragon infinity (funny black card)</span>

<span>1 ice beast zerofyne (negates entire opponent’s field making sure you can go uninterrupted)</span>

<span>2 raidraptor force striyx (searcher)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Link (5)</span>

<span>1 smigbird bird of sovereignty (mist valley loop)</span>

<span>2 raidraptor wise strix (I don’t know if you even need to ask)</span>

<span>1 crystron halquibrax (after 2 years still terrorizing the meta)</span>

<span>1 union carrier (WAY too good for it’s own good)</span>

<span>Combo guide:</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Mist valley loop (with cyber dragon infinity and sometimes blackwing rikiri the rain shower)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>A level 4 blackwing plus three other blackwings or two other blackings and black whirlwind, you can add rikiri the rain sparkling if you have three other blackwings (including a tuner) The requirements for this combo comes out quite often and is the main combo of the deck.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Let's say we have black whirlwind plus bora the spear, gale the whirlwind, and pinaki the waxing moon.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Link two of the blackwings for raidraptor wise strix, leave a level 4 blackwing there though! (if going for rikiri the rain shower then leave a tuner as well)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Use wise strix to summon blackwing zephios the elite.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Overlay zephrios and other level 4 blackwing for raidraptor force strix</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Force strix detaches zephrios to add bora the spear to your hand</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Wise strix sets shave force</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Zephrios returns black whirlwind (if you have a blackwing tuner then summon the bora you added and return that to the hand) to hand and summons self</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Summon bora the spear</span>

&nbsp;

<span>(Side step, if you have the tuner then link it with bora to make crystron halq and summon vayu, whatever you do leave halq out)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Link force strix and wise strix to make smighbird</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Link zephryos and bora (if side step was followed then vayu instead) to make union carrier</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Union carrier attaches mist valley thunderbird to smighbird</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Activate shave force to summon force strix and rank it up into cyber dragon infinity</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Infinity takes union carrier as an overlay unit</span>

&nbsp;

<span>(side step, if vayu is in graveyard by the previous side step then banish vayu and a level 4 to make shorya the rain storm)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>End turn and smighbird summons mist valley apex avian.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>(if opponent activates effect avian returns thunderbird to hand to negate and thunderbird summons itself)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>(next steps are only if you did the side steps)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Halq banishes self on opponent’s turn to make formula</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Formula quick tunes shorya to make rikiri the rain shower.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>End, apex avian, smighbird equipped with thunderbird, cyber dragon infinity (if side steps completed then also rikiri the rain shower)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Overall a decently consistent deck that’s really fun and efficient against certain decks (drytron, virtual world, cyber dragon, phantom knight, danger!, and so on). I’ve had times where I would get the loop out and my opponent wouldn’t understand why I’m stopping them constantly, then once they read my field they just left, I’ve also had people who would leave as soon as I equipped thunderbird.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>It has flaws like… um… kaijus? Yes kaijus are the main weakness of this deck, It also can die to super poly (to mudragon, not starving venom) or a player who’s smart enough to bait a negate and then attack your tunderbird. It also isn’t exactly what you would call nibruproof, just putting that out there.</span>"

Here I will explain why I added some of the cards.

<strong>Main Deck </strong>(40 cards)

The 1x cards (Rollback, shadow, mask, goblin, cyber and Comic) The purpose of these cards is really to search them when you need them. For instance shadow toon is worthless on the first turn.

3x Toon harpie lady: These cards are very important. They are free special summons as long as Toon kingdom is on the field. Also If you play them whilst another toon monster is on the field you can destroy one of your opponent's spells/traps. This is useful to get rid of potential threats.

3x The Black Sone Of Legend: This card's purpose is to special summon Red-eyes then use Red-eyes to special another toon card from your hand.

3x Toon mermaid: Free special summon.

3x Toon Dark Magcian: The best toon card (in my opinion). The card's purpose is to set/special summon the 1x cards and to special summon Toon ancient gear golem and Toon Black Luster Soldier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1x Toon Ancient Gear Golem: Great at dealing damage.

2x Toon Bookmark: I put 2 instead of 3 so there was room to add comic hand. Adds Toon Kingdom to your hand and serves as protection for Kingdom too.,

3x Toon Terror: Great at negating spells/traps and destroying monsters.

2x Toon Briefcase: Stops your opponent from getting monsters on the field.

<strong>Extra Deck</strong> (add cards so the total becomes 15)

1x Clear Wing Sychro Dragon: Powerful card that can be summoned once you side in Ash Blossom and/or Ghost ogre (use an lv3 tuner+ a lv4 toon).

<strong>Side Deck </strong>(15 cards)

3x Ghost Ogre: If your opponent is taking control of the duel(s) using card effects side her in (can be used to synchro summon clear wing). She is a great replacement for Toon Terror; she can be activated from the hand.

2x Ash Blossom: If your opponent is doing the specific things listed on the card side her in (can be used to synchro summon clear wing).

3x Toon Buster Blader: Side him in if your opponent is using dragon cards.

1x Toon Rollback: side it in to deal damage as quickly as possible.

Raigeki: Side it in if your opponent is getting large and powerful fields."
