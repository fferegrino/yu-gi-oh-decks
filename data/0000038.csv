Due to the great number of kaiju cards in the main deck, you have a very strong element surprise in the first game, i prefer to play 2 of each kaiju, because you can use the dark for allure, the light you use as a material to your xyz monsters, cause its a lvl 10 machine, and the komungus its the weakest of the kaijus usually you use him to tribute your opponent monsters or fusion summon shekinaga.  about the side deck:  The kaijus are really good in the first game, but a very good trick in the second game is to take the entire kaiju core(9 cards) and put a good side in the deck, and have a 9 card space for side deck its pretty good.  Necrovalley could look a little bit strange, due to the cards we have that use the graveyard, but its a really good tech against some decks, and you can also search it with your terraforming, and if you really need to take the necrovalley off, it's also very easy for you.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The differences in this list are that it focuses more on the Salamangreat matchup with d.d. crow at 2 (you can play it at 3) and shark cannon at 1 with one-sided (you can main deck it at 2 and then play 3 shared ride in the side deck for the mirror). The side deck is geared towards Thunder, but you can tailor it for other matchups as well. As Sky Striker stands, it really only has to worry about three matchups; Thunder Dragons, the mirror &amp; Salamangreat.

The way that this deck handles the issue of drones at 1 is that it offers the player a choice; you can either use your normal summon on raye (should you fail to get to drones) or you can use your normal summon on Candina (should you get Candina). Despite this limiting the player to 1 or the other, as far as engines go, it does allow the player manning the deck to play both engines as the duel progresses. Generally speaking, it would be smarter to set up a sky striker field of widow anchors with some disruption for the next turn - but it's up to each player to choose the engine.  Side Notes: <ul>  	<li>To improve the Trickstar engine, one could play Carobein at 1 - 2, cut Raye to 0, and move widow to 2.</li>  	<li>Afterburners and Jamming Wave are interchangeable; I've put Jamming Wave over Afterburner because it destroys without targeting.</li>  	<li>The destrudo engine could be played (destrudo + mare mare) to add removal following the transition from sky striker to Trickstar</li>  	<li>The side deck can include gameciel, and it can change the hand trap ratio</li>  	<li>This deck is pretty reliant on knowing your matchup; and with that being said, cherries can be the win condition of this deck in many matchups.</li> </ul> Plays of Note: <ul>  	<li>Candina Normal Summon:  Search Lycorris or Reincarnation, or Lilybell later in the game</li>  	<li>Add Lilybell: Special Summon Lilybell, attack --&gt; Add Lycorris, Lycorris tag out Lilybell &lt;-- this generates much needed offense</li>  	<li>Normal Candina + Reincarnation in GY: Candina searches Lilybell, Lilybell add Lycorris, make Link 2, activate Reincarnation from GY --&gt; make Link 3 [double knightmare]</li> </ul> Other cards that should be considered: <ul>  	<li>Gozen Match</li>  	<li>Rivalry of Warlords</li>  	<li>Gamma &amp; Driver</li>  	<li>Ghost Belle</li>  	<li>Ghost Ogre</li>  	<li>Kaijus</li> </ul>"

The other reason why rocket synchron is in there is because it is easy material for the Guardragon engine(WARNING: this is NOT a Red-eyes Guardragon deck). yes there are some times where you can brick with the deck, but that is what the hand traps are for. the hand traps in the deck(2 ash blossom and 2 ghost ogre) can also help keep your opponents searching and field presents under control, they can also be used as a target for needlefiber incase you run out of synchron/ glow-up bulb targets. <h2>The Side Deck</h2> The side deck can be useful in todays metagame, but I wouldn't recommend running them unless you absolutely have to, of course you can just run them by preference. just to point out the obvious, we have extra copies of ash blossom and ghost ogre and effect valor incase you need to be a little more control based with the deck. Pankratops is good in the deck as well, but the problem with it in this specific build  is because if your playing dangers, you have to play pankratops first and then go off with your Danger!/Synchron engine so you wont be able to get its effects off after. I do run an extra copy of nessie and the snek boi in case I feel a little cheeky, or in case I need the extra summoning power. however this can come back to bite you because sometimes messing the ratios of the deck can lead to bricks in the deck, but that is why the hand traps are there. and extra quick launch is always good if you need extra turbo, twin twisters is good for backrow hate, world legacy guardragons is good to get your level 1 dragons out of the GY, and infinite impermanence is good for more control of the board as well as red reboot which is for the altergiets. there was also deep consideration on wheather I should put dragon ravine in here as well, but the problem is that you need to have full access to the deck in order to make it work, which means that you can exactly send as many cards to the GY as you want...also there aren't that many dragon in the deck to send to the GY. <h2>The Extra Deck</h2> there is not really much to say about the extra deck except that is just your casual guardragon extra deck with the link monsters, summon sorc, and skull dread. the other monsters such as Beelze and black rose dragon are in there just to spice up the deck a bit. but the important monster in the deck is ""Red-eyes Flare Metal Dragon"". the reason why this card is the important one(Besides Dracossac) is because this can not only burn your opponent, but I can also special summon a red-eyes monster from the GY for another name. In fact, flare metal is SO important in the deck that he is part of the main combo for the deck. <h2>Combos</h2> Even though the deck is very flexible with out the main combo, it is best to use this combo as much as you can, which I will explain now. <ul>  	<li> the main combo should at least include one tuner, and one or more danger! card, first you summon the tuner(in this case glow-up bulb), use it to summon linkuriboh and the needle fiber, use needlefibers effect to summon rokket synchron. then use the danger! monster to special summon(if your opponent hits jackalope that is fine) itself or another monster, then use rokket synchron to summon Elpy and the danger! and needle fiber to summon triple burst. you then summon darkness metal and go into your casual guardragon plays from there, by the time you get to skull dread, you shoudl be able to at least have a red-eyes and/or Extra deck monster on board.</li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> so...what do I think of the deck? I think it's pretty good, the only issues I see is the fact that the deck is more or less combo oriented than other decks such as altergiest. as long as you can get a synchron plus another danger! in hand, then you should be completely fine. the only other issue is that the deck must go first so it can have time to set up like any other deck. if I wanted to change anything, I would swap out a tuning for 2 or more impermanence just so I can be better protected.  welp, that was my deck profile. I am still experimenting with this deck, but I do hope that this can be a good starting point for other red-eyes players like me, but if you do want to play something other than ""Red-eyes degenerate link cluster F***"" than you can look at my pure red-eyes guardragon deck profile which should be s little easier to get a grip on. hope you guys like the deck."

It's not great, there isn't any really strong <strong>win</strong> condition of the deck. It mainly revolves around the White Aura monsters and flooding the field a bit.  &nbsp;  <a data-name=""Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince"">Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince</a> can easily discard a <a data-name=""Atlantean Dragoons"">Atlantean Dragoons</a> to then do a few things. You can pull a <a data-name=""Lappis Dragon"">Lappis Dragon</a> to have it immediately summon or you can do what I prefer and pull another copy of Atlantean Dragoons and then use <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssmegalo"">Mermail Abyssmegalo</a> to discard that copy (and then pull a Lappis Dragon).  The Legendary Fisherman III is a great card if you can get it out but don't bank on it. Instead try to use it with <a data-name=""Tatsunoko"">Tatsunoko</a> to summon <a data-name=""White Aura Bihamut"">White Aura Bihamut</a>.  <a data-name=""Crystron Needlefiber"">Crystron Needlefiber</a> can use his effect to summon either <a data-name=""Coral Dragon"">Coral Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Ib the World Chalice Miko"">Ib the World Chalice Miko</a> (which can then pull <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a>).  <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a> usually goes int Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince.  I really like <a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a> since it got released but I've found myself struggling to get it out with <a data-name=""A Legendary Ocean"">A Legendary Ocean</a>.

I like to give decks time and then post a new one so everyone has a chance to check it out! Anyways I was looking at <a data-name=""Destrudo The Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo The Lost Dragon's Frisson</a> and was thinking if there's anything cool to do with him since he's a really good synchro turbo card and then I saw <a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a> which is a level 7 tuner that can synchro summon during your opponent's turn. I saw that and noticed how it's effect says it can reduce its own level by a monster you send from deck to grave and realized you can use that plus another monster to make <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> during your opponent's turn to blow up their field which is pretty crazy. Anyways, this deck can go first or second it doesn't really matter. Going first you have many tools at your disposal like the Black Rose Dragon play I just explained and triple <a data-name=""Trickstar Reincarnation"">Trickstar Reincarnation</a> as well as the three Solemns. Going second you can make <a data-name=""Yazi, Evil of The Yang Zing"">Yazi, Evil of The Yang Zing</a> with Destrudo and a Trickstar monster and summon <a data-name=""Mare Mare"">Mare Mare </a>and go into <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> to OTK. I wanted to make a Trickstar deck that can go either first or second that is pretty consistent for you guys. I know you guys like my other Trickstar decks but I'm hoping you guys will love this one. The reason for <a data-name=""Hack Worm"">Hack Worm</a> is for the Destrudo Shooting Riser Dragon play I explained in the beginning. It's a free monster to special summon going first that allows you to use for Shooting Riser Dragon after you go through your Trickstar cards in hand. Another way to bring out Black Rose Dragon without Hack Worm is by using Trickstar Reincarnation in your graveyard during your opponent's main phase 1 to special summon a Trickstar monster from grave and then Shooting Riser Dragon and that Trickstar monster to synchro into Black Rose Dragon. I really hope you guys enjoy this deck and stick around for new decks weekly."

It can perform many combos and never bricks.  <a data-name=""D/D savant Copernicus"">D/D savant Copernicus</a>  This card is the decks' main combo starter and is extremely flexible. If you draw this card on your first turn and one other D/D card you can combo into either a <a data-name=""zefra metaltron"">zefra metaltron</a> or a <a data-name=""D/D/D abyss king gilgamesh"">D/D/D abyss king gilgamesh</a>. The first combo ends with <a data-name=""D/D/D abyss king gilgamesh"">D/D/D abyss king gilgamesh</a> a full scale and the <a data-name=""D/D savant copernicus"">D/D savant copernicus</a> on the field. Start by normal summoning <a data-name=""D/D savant copernicus"">D/D savant copernicus</a> and use its effect to send <a data-name=""D/D swirl slime"">D/D swirl slime </a>to the graveyard then banish it and special summon any D/D monster from your hand. Use both D/D monsters on the field to go into <a data-name=""D/D/D abyss king gilgamesh"">D/D/D abyss king gilgamesh</a> and activate his effect to set a pendulum scale. I usually use D/D/D destiny king zero larplace and D/D savant newton. You can then pendulum summon the <a data-name=""D/D savant copernicus"">D/D savant copernicus </a>back from the extra deck as well as any other D/D monsters in your hand.  The second combo requires you to start with <a data-name=""D/D savant copernicus"">D/D savant copernicus</a> and one other D/D monster or dark contract in hand. Normal summon <a data-name=""D/D savant copernicus"">D/D savant copernicus</a> and send <a data-name=""D/D lamia"">D/D lamia</a> to the graveyard. Then use <a data-name=""D/D lamia"">D/D lamia</a>'s effect to special summon itself from the graveyard. Using both monsters go into crystron needlefiber using his effect special summon a second copy of <a data-name=""D/D lamia"">D/D lamia </a>from your deck. Using this <a data-name=""D/D lamia"">D/D lamia</a> go into <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh,</a> then using both <a data-name=""crystron needlefiber"">crystron needlefiber</a> and <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> as materials special summon <a data-name=""zefra metaltron"">zefra metaltron.</a>  <a data-name=""D/D swirl slime"">D/D swirl slime</a>  <a data-name=""D/D swirl slime"">D/D swirl slime</a> is one of the best combo starters in the deck as it gets you two monsters on the field for the cost of two monsters in hand. Usually, when you start with swirl slime you fusion summon straight into <a data-name=""D/D/D flame king genghis"">D/D/D flame king genghis</a> or <a data-name=""D/D/D flame king high genghis"">D/D/D flame king high genghis</a> and then special summon another monster straight out of your hand. This card is usually the target for cards like <a data-name=""foolish burial"">foolish burial </a>and <a data-name=""D/D savant copernicus"">D/D savant copernicus</a> because it can special summon any D/D monster from your hand.  <a data-name=""D/D/D abyss king gilgamesh"">D/D/D abyss king gilgamesh</a>  I usually try to make this card on my first turn to set my pendulum scales. After this the card kind of just sits there the best thing to do after you summon <a data-name=""D/D/D abyss king gilgamesh "">D/D/D abyss king gilgamesh</a> is let your opponent destroy it this lets you special summon a D/D monster from your extra deck or graveyard in defence position ignoring it's summoning conditions. I usually special summon <a data-name=""D/D/D super doom king bright armageddon"">D/D/D super doom king bright armageddon</a> off of this effect as it stops your opponent from being able to disassemble your board with it's protection effect also it's high stat line usually means your opponent won't be able to destroy it by battle."
