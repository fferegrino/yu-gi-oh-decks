As we know this deck's gameplay is unique since instead of relying on their monster, it uses spell cards as their main plays.  Since <em>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</em> has been banned, this deck will now have less trouble controlling the flow of the game. The reason why this deck is difficult to deal with is because it has many handtraps, as we all know handtraps is a must in today's gameplay and this deck just not play a few of it. <em>Maxx C</em> is the game changer for this deck, resolving maxx c means your opponent will pass their combo or they're brave enough to let you draw handtraps and board destruction cards.  This deck's combo may vary depending on the circumstances you're in, so I'll just explain the use of each spell cards.  <strong>Engage</strong> - As we all know this card is your ticket to victory, activating this card with 3 spell cards in your GY will let have a huge advantage.  <strong>Jamming Waves</strong> - Pretty great backrow removal card, this card can also be used if you opponent has a monster that cannot be targeted (just make sure you have 3 spell cards in your GY)  <strong>Afterburners</strong> - Good card to bait your opponent's negate  <strong>Eagle Booster</strong> - You pretty much won't use this card most of the time, but when you do it'll win you the game  <strong>Hornet Drones</strong> -  Life saver if you didn't see Raye, also it's good if you're planning to swarm the field with monster  <strong>Shark Cannon</strong> - Multipurpose card right here, it can disrupt your opponent's combo and at the same time it can SS you're opponent's tuner monster then you'll go to <em>Halqifibrax</em> combo  <strong>Widow Anchor</strong> - Your most searched card using <em>Engage</em>  <strong>Multirole</strong> - Great for the grind game and can combo it up with <em>Area Zero</em> if you don't have <em>Raye</em>. Don't forget this dude's effect that will prevent your opponent to respond to your spell cards activation.  <strong>Area Zero</strong> - Can summon <em>Raye</em> if it's sent to the GY. If you're lucky this dude can excavate the card you need  <strong>Things to Remember</strong> <ul>  	<li>Always check your GY if it has 3 or more spell cards on it, this will enable you to maximize your resources.</li>  	<li>No <em>Raye</em> = No Game, always find a way to have<em> Raye</em> in your Hand, Field, or GY.</li> </ul>"

It ended up being much more consistent than other builds that Ive seen (which only use tour guide, graff, and cir). You typically make cherubini before ever normal summoning, which puts your opponent at odds with a nibiru, meaning you can be much more likely to play through it."

Formatted for September 2020.,"Graydle Kaiju is a surprisingly flexible control deck with the aim of Tributing your opponent's monsters with Kaijus and then taking control of them with the Graydle monster's effects. Having Kaiju's in the main deck provides one with a much-needed answer to monsters that you simply cannot run over.  3 copies of Interrupted Kaiju Slumber allow for us to get the ball rolling early when going second, generally you'll want to have Jizukiru on your side and give your opponent Gameciel when resolving Slumber. The other Kaiju's are there as a backup. The deck would like to go second, as going first is far to slow and this deck does not make an impactful board unless it has it's Graveyard loaded up since you can Synchro Summon using Slime Jr.  Rebellion is as an extra layer of defense that can mean the difference between life and death in some situations, it's a very helpful Battle Phase trick. For consistency, we have Graydle Impact, Pot of Avarice, and Salvage. The latter two cards reload our deck and hand respectively while Graydle Impact provides consistent searching during the End Phase as well as the ability to tutor for another Graydle as well as clearing cards off your opponent's board.  The Extra Deck contains some normal Link goodstuff as well as some Water synchros that we have to make due to the restriction that comes with Slime Jr's effect. Edit these ratios as you see fit. :)   For the side deck, a Mild Turkey is a must! Add whatever you want to make up the other 14 cards.  As always, comments and suggestions are always welcome!"

Maybe you want to make this deck and only have one magicians' souls lying around. Maybe you have none. Well, I am here to tell you that there is a way. It may not be the best way, but it will give you decent boards most of the time. So the big questions here are: ""Why two Dark Magician Girls?"" and ""What do I use instead of Magicians' Souls?""  Well, I was having trouble balancing the benefit and deficit of three Allure of Darkness in the deck. You could replace the second DMG with Jester Confit, but I found that with two Secrets of Dark Magic, two Dark Magic Veil, three Keeper of Dragon Magic, three Apprentice Illusion Magician and of course three Allure of Darkness, that DMG is rarely a complete dead draw. She is still material for one of the two fusion monsters you will summon the most with this deck.  Magicians' Souls is an amazing card, but affording a playset of it is asking a lot. The main way I make up for for only running one are the pair of Fusion Deployment and Dark Magic Veil. Fusion Deployment is searchable with only Keeper of Dragon Magic. It will special summon Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl from deck or hand. This makes Dark Magician that much easier to summon to the field turn one. Yes, it also works with Predaplant Verte Anaconda. While Magicians' Souls is searchable, there is still the single copy of it in this build. However, if you cannot afford any copies of the card, there are two things you should do. 1.) Absolutely still run a playset of Soul Servant. The deck will not work with it. 2.) You can replace Magicians' Souls with Upstart Goblin, Jester Confit, a second Magician of Dark Illusion, or any dark spellcaster you can think of that might synergize. Cosmo Brain is the one that worked for me the best.  Ultimately, the deck is not at its full potential without a playset of Magicians' Souls. But did that ever stop Yugi? Nope! So if you want to play Dark Magician, go out there and do what you can!"

I'm not going to get into all of the combos, some very key cards in this deck (other than standard train deck profiles) are XYZ Import and Negalogia AA-Zeus (pending release: Phantom Rage).  After summoning Superdreadnaught Rail Cannon Juggernaught Liebe, if he battles but does not OTK that turn, he has nothing to counter effects.  Often times, when pushing a heavy OTK with limited cards, Liebe is the only monster on your field, so if the turn passes they can easily clear your side of the field.  AA-Zeus can be summoned by an attacking XYZ monster and (quick effect): detach 2 material and destroy every other card on the field, except itself.  Heavy combo decks can easily be stopped with this card alone, passing the turn off to you to finish with a 3000 attack.  &nbsp;  XYZ import is a very, very important card that MUST be run in train decks now.  It not only clears a monster from your opponents side of the field, but it allows you to attach said monster to an XYZ monster you control.  The only condition is that the opponents monster must have attack less than or equal to the XYZ monster.  Being a high attack, heavy-hitting train deck, that condition is easy to meet.  This can provide huge benefits for all the Superdreadnought XYZ's, AA-Zeus, even Skypalace... overall an amazing card that must be played.  I've tested this deck for 15+ hours and it is the most consistent deck profile i've used to date.  Better than infinitrack/train decks by far, way more consistent and less combos which can stop Niburu.  (side note: 2 shaddoll dragons instead of 1x beast because beast has bricked my entire hand before... dragon is can pop off on flip and graveyard effect so its better to run 2 in this deck)  Hope you enjoy!"

Decode Talker Heatsoul can help you replenish your hand, but use careful since force you to pay 1000 for card draw. 3 Recorded Alive and Limit Code can help you create a solid defense.

Formatted for Sept. 2020,"THIS DECK USES OCG CARDS!  What's better than armored Dragons? MORE ARMORED DRAGONS! This deck combines Dragunity with new Armed Dragon support! The deck behaves like how a typical variation of Dragunity should; combing off and building massive boards! The new Armed Dragon monsters are retrained versions of the originals with a new method of leveling up as well as some new effects when you send copies of them, such as drawing a card and search a Level 5 or higher WIND Dragon monster, out with the clunky old and in with the much more consistent new! Armed Dragon Flash allows us to get our plays started by being able to tutor out Armed Dragon Lv3 - Thunder from the deck and then leveling it up while also discarding Dragunity Tuners which we can later revive and use to Synchro Summon.  This is a rough draft of a Dragon deck that one could fall back on when Rokkets inevitably get the axe. Keep your eyes peeled for the release of the new Armed Dragon monsters and their support cards!  In the side deck are some ideas for future builds, as well as one of the usual suspects!  As always, feedback and suggestions are always welcome in the comments!"

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. ""Orcust"", known as ""Orphegel"" (オルフェゴール Orufegōru) in Japan, is an archetype of DARK Machine Monsters that debuted in Soul Fusion. They are related to the ""World Legacy"" archetype. The name Orcust may be a portmanteau of ""orchestra"" and ""locust"", referring to their endless numbers in the archetype's lore; it may also be a reference to Orcus. This archetype's Japanese name is a reference to Orpheus and Orgel (the Dutch/German/Japanese for music boxes/Organs). The Main Deck members are named after musical elements and have aspects of musical instruments as part of their bodies.

I think this is the 2nd strongest Fossil hybrid, following Invoked Fossil which you can also find on my profile. However, this version is significantly cheaper due to it not relying as heavily on owning Impertinence. It also has the benefits of the anti-meta Shaddoll package.  Our hand trap here is Psy-Framegear Gamma, which is unsurprising due to the deck needing access to Light monsters for it's strongest plays, as well for its inherent synergy with El Shaddoll Fusion. If your opponent is kind enough to attack into your Driver it also makes for a nice Fossil Fusion target.  Only 1 copy of Time Stream this time around. It's a lot less necessary in this build due to it's easier access to Fossil Warrior Skullknight courtesy of Shaddoll Beast.  Revival Golem is a nice bit of tech to combo with Shaddoll Fusion, Mathematician, Foolish Burial, or Miracle Rupture to help facilitate your Cross-Sheep and Utopia combos.  All in all, the Fossil engine has quite reasonable synergy with Shaddolls. I wouldn't kick this deck out of bed for eating crackers."

Formatted for Sept. 2020,"<strong><span>Looking for a way to REALLY annoy your opponent? This twist of Mystic Mine should do it! </span>  </strong>Since it's release in Dark Neostorm last year, players all around the world can agree on one thing; Mystic Mine is TOXIC! This back-breaking Field Spell needs no introduction, with many players at all levels crying out for its ban. Well, it's not gone yet, so we can still have some fun with it. This deck is a fairly standard Mystic Mine build, largely inspired by Jeff Leonard's current take on the deck so big shout outs to him! This build, however, focuses on another card that is guaranteed to turn the salt factor up to 11: Convulsion of Nature!  Convulsion of Nature is a very weird card. This Continuous Spell asks that both players flip their Deck's upside down and proceed with the Duel as normal. Essentially, this means flipping both the Decks up, revealing the top card of each Deck for both players. Since this is revealed, we can manipulate our opponent's hand with cards like Mind Crush and Drastic Drop-Off? Don't have those cards set and don't like what the opponent has on the top of their deck? No problem! Just use Goddess Skuld's Oracle and re-arrange the top of the Deck to (hopefully) make them brick next turn! All the while, we can get the top card of our Deck during the Main Phase using Archfiend's Oath, allowing us to keep a consistent hand size.  Mystic Mine is enabled in this deck through two cards; Demise of the Land and Silent Wobby. The former allows us to stop our opponent's plays dead in their tracks upon activation whilst the latter gives us access to Mine on turn 1. Dimension Shifter is another great card to have when going second, banishing things in this Graveyard-reliant meta is always helpful.  The deck's main win condition is Final Countdown. Pay 2000 LP and you'll win the Duel...20 turns later that is. With a deck as slow-burning as this, you may as well have a way to win without going into time.  The Extra Deck is just Extravagance fuel.  The side deck contains a turkey. I do recommend having some Wave-Motion Cannons with you though, it's always good to have another win condition.  As always, feedback and suggestions are always welcome in the comments!"

But if you want to play Synchro Eldlich again, this is an option. The biggest downside is you give up the Trains, since the combo eats up almost the whole extra deck. But you end on Calamities + Savage. Also, it runs a pile of bricks. Oh well. A larger deck size might be warranted for Eldlich players trying this combo tbh.  You use Opening of the Spirit Gates and Link Summoning to get 3 dark monsters with different types, then make Curious, send Plaguespreader. You link Curious into Linkross, and revive Plaguespreader and link with Linkross into Needlefibre, summoning Deskbot 001. You make Metalmarcher, revive the deskbot, then make Formula Synchron to draw a card and fix levels. Link Metalmarcher + Halq into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens, summon Deskbot. Synchro 1 token + Synchron into Garden Rose Maiden, then Synchro it + Deskbot into Coral Dragon. Auroradon's effect, tribute 2 tokens, summon Coltwing, summon 2 tokens, summon Deskbot. Synchro Coral Dragon + 1 token into Ravenous Crocodragon, draw 2 cards of the effects. Since you have 1 token remaining the Coltwing is a level 7, so make Borreload Savage with Deskbot, and equip Curious to him. Then use Garden Rose Maiden's effect to banish itself from the GY, summon Coral Dragon, and Synchro it with your token into another level 9. Boom, Calamities + Savage."

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. Dinosaur (Japanese: 恐きょう竜りゅうKyōryū) is a type of monster that primarily relies on beatdown tactics and sometimes Monsters effect, to help a Duelist prevail in a Duel. There are many high-level Dinosaur-Type monsters, so the general strategy for them is to Summon their high-Level monsters as quickly as possible using cards like ""Hunting Instinct"" or ""Big Evolution Pill"", overpowering the opponent's weaker monsters before they have a chance to defend themselves.

Mara + Joy will get you anything, from the new Faeking to Oneiromancy. Diviner helps to fetch Mara or can send N'tss","Dream Mirror has unique concept of playing with tagging out to their counterpart using ""mirror"" field spell. It also has great artwork like Trickstar but combined with Darklord.  The play is very simple, we need <strong>Dream Mirror of Joy + Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Mara</strong>. To accomplish that we use 3 Mara, 3 Joy, 3 Phantasms (allows more interruption by searching Morpheus), 3 Diviner (send and use Trias to ss Mara), One for One, Terraforming, and Set Rotation (makes us unable to switch the field spell tho). Use Mara ss Sprite, use Sprite add Dream Mirror of Chaos/Morpheus/Oneiromancy (if we use Set Rotation, we will stuck on Joy field, means only Oneiromancy can provide interruption). At the end phase, switch the field to Terror so Chaos/Morpheus is online (Sprite can ss Mara to summon Morpheus from hand).  While we have 3 interruptions to choose, they all have their own downside. Morpheus: Best one imo, destroy card, big body, but difficult to work if you activate Set Rotation. Oneiromancy: Versatile, still online even with Set Rotation, but doesnt have body. Fusion: Biggest body, negation can be used again next turn, but doesn't destroy and doesn't work with Set Rotation.  The ratio is explainable, starters are 3 ofs, irreplaceable combo pieces as 2 ofs, and the searchables as 1 ofs. The rest of the deck is just good staples while being monster so One for One has higher chance to work.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/zPD6687.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Fun and unique gameplay, big staple slot.  Cons: Weak and struggle in grind game."

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. ""Thunder Dragon"" is an archetype of LIGHT and DARK Thunder monsters, used by Psychic Tendo in Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures. Their first member was introduced in the Vol.7 Booster Pack, while their first support was introduced in Soul Fusion. The general design and effect of each ""Thunder Dragon"" monster is based on and inspired by the original ""Thunder Dragon"", all of them being electrified dragons with a green, yellow, black or gray color scheme. ""Thunder Dragon Titan"" is especially influenced by the original ""Thunder Dragon"", which looks like a three-headed version of that monster, similar to the design of ""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"". ""Thunder Dragondark"" is a directly retrained version of the original ""Thunder Dragon"" as it has the same Type, Level, ATK, DEF, opposite Attribute, and similar effect of searching another copy of itself.

I reccomend keeping around your normal summon, in case you want to tribute summon a Kaiju; but you can also tribute an opponent's monster to give them a Kaiju, to then special summon a Kaiju to your side of the field. But you can also use Interrupted Kaiju Slumber; there's many ways to get out Thunder King. There's also alternatives with the other Kaijus, in case you're having trouble with running into Thunder King. The deck is very aggresive and focused on OTKing the opponent, by immediately lowering them to 0 as soon as possible.  I reccomend going for second, but going first isn't super bad; just be wary of removal, as the deck can be fragile. Note: The side deck is just for match-ups against certain types of decks, like a deck that runs all spellcasters or insects, and the extra deck is just a mix of good targets for Maximus. With Maxiumus, you'll want to toss out N'tss to remove the opponent's monsters, (Skull Knight serves the same purpose), and Psy-Framelord Omega for a purpose I may or may not have forgotten. The other monsters in the extra deck are just monsters that I personally like; change them out as you like. This is my first time posting here, so i'd love any feedback! Cheers."

I think this is about as good as the deck is going to get this format, some people are trying Phantom Knights support in Infernoble, but nothing besides Shade Brigandine appeals to me. This combo toolbox is way too good, both in terms of potential boards, and in terms of playing through interruption.  Infernoble Knights is a Warrior based Isolde Turbo combo deck, that uses cards like Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin, Omega (sometimes in tandem with D.D.R), Triple Tactics Talent, and most importantly Smoke Grenade of the Thief alongside Infernoble Emperor Charles, to snipe your opponent's hands. It does still put up 2-4 interruptions on your turn, but our actual goal is to have an opponent with 2 cards, and use with a negate, a pop, and perfect information. Still, the deck can really put the whole extra deck onto the board once you play around with it. Check out Pak TCG's channel for combo routes, or see my list for last month if you prefer to read. But the real trick to the deck is learning how to use your extenders to make insane boards, loop people multiple times, and play through negations.  The only real spiciness to this deck is the second Aqua Dolphin, which I think makes sense, as it is actually better as a normal summon than a Space Connector target, for the purposes of starting your combo. I will literally summon this over Space Connector if I have both and an extender, and I like seeing it slightly more often. You could run 1 Astolfo for fringe situations where you're searching off of Heritage of the Chalice after already using Durendal and other extenders, but it was so fringe the card eventually didn't make the cut, even though's it is aggressively fine.  For Hand Traps we're running Gamma and Nibiru in the main. Droll and Lock Bird is fine in the side, imo, especially for a deck like Infernoble, where the question vs Rokkets is who is going first, and how many hand traps did the person going second see. Yes, there are other targets for Droll in the format, but I'm not over-impressed by Dogmatika Invoked, and in every other matchup, including non-invoked Dogmatika decks, I'd rather an Ash. Don't get me wrong, both are great viable archetypes, and they aren't without synergy, but you're basically taking 2 supplemental archetypes and jamming them together - IMO they're both stronger when paired with other control decks, which can put up their engines alongside the 1 or 2 interruptions each side of Dogmatika Invoked adds to whatever it's paired with. A couple interruptions and a Winda is not a dead strategy, by any means, it's just not particularly hard to out the board, nor is it a particularly hard board to outgrind.  Changed the hand trap game slightly. I like the main a lot.  Upped the hand trap count. Gotta beat Rokkets some games going second. Changed the hand trap line-up. Tactics, Imperm, and Veiler are for Dragoon, D. Shifter and Lancea are for Dinosaur, Token Collector is for Infernoble (alongside generic negation). I think Ghost Ogre is really good against Rokkets (target the Romulus) as well as Dinosaur (gotta stop Lost World), with lots of useful applications in pretty much every meta matchup (Invoked target the field spell, same for Guru, Eldlich you can get the continuous Traps, Dogma should be one of those most of the time (maybe Altergeist, which case hit the Spoofing), and it has applications against the Tier 2 old meta decks as well, particularly against field spells.) Gamma is our ""generic"" hand trap, pretty much always good, and at least as likely to stop a combo deck's turn as one of the ""blowout"" traps. Numbers are pretty high, a quarter of the deck is hand traps, more if you count Tactics (which also adds to hand pressure going first or helps the deck combo off through negations) which means you should see one hand trap most games, and reasonably often you'll see the 2-3 (or 1 killer) you need to stop a turn."

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. ""A-to-Z"" (ＡｔｏＺエートゥズィĒtuZi) is a series of LIGHT Machine monsters that are designed to fuse without any Fusion cards via Contact Fusion by banishing the Fusion Materials from the field or, in the case of the Union Monsters in the Structure Deck: Seto Kaiba, from the Graveyard as well. They can also be powered up without fusing due to the fact that that most of them are Union monsters. These cards have been used by Seto Kaiba and Chazz Princeton. They are said to be rare cards in the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX anime, as they are among the cards stolen by Vellian Crowler.

Onto the explanation, my friends. </span>Playing guide <span>You'll want to, well, go through normal Salamangreat strategies. Mainly summoning them out, but here's where this deck differs; it has three boss monsters to choose from, based on your opening hand. If you start off with a good amount of the usual Salamangreats, you can link climb into either one of the Topologics or Pyro Pheonix, based off the situation. You'll want to climb through Baleynx, Sunlight Wolf, then Heatleo, in that order; I reccomend trying to get off all their effects as much as you can. </span><span>The second strategy is Mathmechs. If you start with lots of Tuners, you can use their special summoning requirements on a normal summoned monster to easily get them all out. Then you can tune a Mathmech with a dif monster (most likely a salamangreat) to make a Magma, then tune the Magma with the remaining monster to make a Sigma. Make sure to put Sigma in the place of the extra monster zone, as that makes him invincible to card effect destruction. </span><span>The third, and final strategy, is to go into Violet Chimera. This is more so a last resort if you get a bricky hand, as Violet Chimera isn't super good, but not terrible either. Summon out two monsters of your choice, then link them into Proxy. Hopefully, you can either ressurect one or summon another in order to fusion summon Chimera. Proxy works as a Poly while on the field, and Violet's materials are a link and a Salamangreat. </span><span>Once again, this is one of my first decks to be posted here, so i'd love any feedback or suggestions. Have a good day!</span>"
