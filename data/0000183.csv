Enabling this was the new Support Card Traptrix Vesiculo by being a starter, extender and grinder all in 1. The disappointing part being Cularia who is just a worse Sera in every way, the only time you should ever Summon her is if you already have a Sera on field that you wouldn't need to Link off, already Summoned Dragoon and cannot go into Xyz for some reason. Long story short, Cularia's job is just being banished for Prosperity, you can switch her out for anything else.  &nbsp;  This version is pretty much unbeatable when going first, and going second you still have Dimension Shifter to force your opponent to pass.  Your priorities should be to maximize the amount of board presence by having atleast 2 Traps Set turn 1 and having either Bagooska, Dweller or Dragoon on board.  &nbsp;  I also wouldn't advise to take Dragoon out. This Deck has no real Wincon to work for and is also abyssmal at breaking already established boards so Dragoon and Zeus are filling that gap."

Well , in this list you'll find an answer to all of your questions , altough if there are any feel free to send me a massage .  There was already a list from this deck on my profile but it's kinda a bit older and doesn't compare with the newer cards and the new meta ,so I waited for the new support and finally finished my research and found a way to competitively play it in the current meta and the current time ,I reallyÂ  hope you'll like what i have come up with ,and that you will enjoy it.  one more reason why I uploaded this deck now was because all the decks which I found here on youtube etc... ,were either old , not really that competetive or pre LIOV ,where the new came out which braught a huge boost to the deck only by itself.  Here's also a link with all the combos explained really in the depth , and what do you do in a particular situation and stuff like that , this way I wont need to explain and writte down all the combos , and also becouse I think that you'll get way more faster when you watch someone actually doing and explaining the combos that just by reading them here .  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcVW1hDM9dc&amp;list=LL&amp;index=1&amp;ab_channel=TeamYuGiFailsTeamYuGiFails  That would be all from me and as said I hope you will enjoy this deck and list and have much fun with it .  Greetings from your readytogetricked i hope that this will help you even a bit to enjoy the current format"

Super poly is extremely strong with zombie world since you can use opponent's monsters to summon your fusion monsters.  The Danger ! archetype is here to make the deck faster and discard cards. And you love discard cards with this deck.  Gamma is here to prevent opponent using Ash on Solitaire. It can be a bit brickey but it remains a very strong hand trap. You can prevent opponent doing Lancea too which is pretty problematic for this deck's mechanisms.  Shiranui Solitaire should only be used to special summon Uni-zombie unless you have already Zombie World on the field.  Uni-zombie is the maestro of this deck. You want him on the field asap. He allows you to foolish from your deck and discard from your hand. Both effects once per turn!  Cards too foolish/discard:  Banshee : you can ban her from your GY to activate Zombie World from your deck.  Mezuki: You can ban him from GY and special summon a zombie monster from your GY.  Glow-up Bloom: If Zombie World is activated you can ban it and special summon a level 5 or more zombie monster from your deck. If Zombie World is not on the field you can't special summon but add the monster to your hand: Vampire Fraulein or Jack-o-Bolan are good choices.  Have fun!

To that end I decided to experiment with a Magician package that focuses on using <a data-name=""Harmonizing Magician"">Harmonizing Magician</a> as an extender to get to a Magician that can help summon Vortex Dragon. I don't consider it a budget build considering the presence of among other things, the one copy of <a data-name=""Diviner of the Heralds"">Diviner of the Heralds</a>, however I am aware that some optimizations are yet to be made. As such, this is a prototype.  <hr />  The ideal combo is an extension of a basic two card combo from <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the ""Idiot's Guide to Solfachords"" video by direYGO</a>. As such it is a 3 card combo that needs you to open with a way to summon <a data-name=""Supreme Dragon King Darkwurm"">Supreme Dragon King Darkwurm</a> and <a data-name=""DoSolfachord Cutea"">DoSolfachord Cutea</a> and have <a data-name=""Harmonizing Magician"">Harmonizing Magician</a> in hand. the respective searchers here are <a data-name=""Dragon Shrine"">Dragon Shrine</a>, <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a> (which isn't ran here due to space) and <a data-name=""Pendulum Call"">Pendulum Call</a>, having Dragon Shrine or One for One is ideal since you only have 1 normal summon.  The first step of this combo is to use Dragon Shrine to Mill Darkwurm and set up its effect. this lets you get Supreme King Gate Zero as a scale. From there you summon Cutea to add a high scale Solflachord monster (for this example 5 is the minimum, so <a data-name=""SolSolfachord Gracia"">SolSolfachord Gracia</a> will suffice) to use as the other scale. You then summon I:P Masquerena using Cutea and Darkwurm as materials. This will put them in the Extra Deck and ensure there will be room for them both for the Pendulum Summon. From there you activate Call to search Harmonizing and Dragonpulse (or any other Magician at your preference) With the scales set and Cutea and Darkwurm in the Extra deck, you can then Pendulum Summon the four monsters.  Harmonizing Magician's effect then activates, letting summon a third Magician to suit the combo's needs. In this case We'll be summoning <a data-name=""Nobledragon Magician"">Nobledragon Magician</a>. We tune Nobledragon and either Darkwurm or Dragonpulse into the Level 7 <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a>, which then enables use to summon Gate Zero both because of Meteorburst's effect and because a zone was opened up. We overlay those two Level 7 monsters into <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a>. This leaves us with Masquerena, Absolute, Cutea, Harmonizing and a Level 4 monster. the latter of which can be used to extend further into a rank 4 or Link-2.  On your opponent's turn you can then use Masquerena's effect to Link herself, Cutea and Absolute away to summon Avramax, with Absolute's effect activation to summon Vortex. Alternatively you can link Absolute away in addition to summon a Link-3.  <hr />  The other two Magicians are Dragonpit for if you have a Level 7 or <a data-name=""Puzzomnino, the Drop-n-Deleter"">Puzzomnino, the Drop-n-Deleter</a> out and Timebreaker for if you want to use Harmonizing herself as the Tuner or already drew into Nobledragon. The rest of this 60 card deck would be msotly Traps such as <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>, <a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a> and 5 cards of the Solemn series. I'm also considering using <a data-name=""Mask of Restrict"">Mask of Restrict</a> in lieu of some of the Solemn cards to further fortify Avramax in the event Kaiju and Sphere Mode return to meta prominence (though it wouldn't do much against Nibiru). Outside of the Odd-Eyes trio, Avramax and Masquerena, the rest of the Extra deck is used to provide follow-ups (<a data-name=""Borrellord Dragon"">Borrellord Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>, and <a data-name=""Ignister Prominence, the Blastinging Dracoslayer"">Ignister Prominence, the Blasting Dracoslayer</a>) or alternate ways to Vortex or Avramax, such as Puzzlomino or <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a>, or extenders (<a data-name=""Crystron Halqlifibrax"">Crystron Halqlifibrax</a>).  The side deck is a little generic, with going second cards such as <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> and <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, though I also added <a data-name=""Hypnosister"">Hypnosister</a> and <a data-name=""Wavering Eyes"">Wavering Eyes</a> for pendulum matchups as well."

With the right hand, you can end with an Absolute Zero, Escuriado, Sunrise, and Core. This deck seems to show a lot of potential even without Malicious Bane. I was trying to get this deck as budget as possible so instead of running Liquidman, I chose to run Bubbleman (If you can afford Liquidman, I'd go for it instead of Bubbleman). The hand I got the most often was Elemental HERO Stratos, Elemental HERO Solid Soldier, E - Emergency Call, Fusion Conscription, Fusion Sage, and 1 of the Normal Elemental HEROs. The combo I did is as followed: <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Elemental HERO Solid Soldier.</li>  	<li>Special Summon Stratos with Solid Soldier's effect.</li>  	<li>Search for Shadow Mist.</li>  	<li>Activate Fusion Sage to search Polymerization.</li>  	<li>Activate Polymerization to Fuse Shadow Mist and the Normal HERO in your hand to Summon Sunrise.</li>  	<li>Start a chain with Shadow Mist and Sunrise to add a Bubbleman and Miracle Fusion to your hand.</li>  	<li>Link Summon Xtra HERO Wonder Driver by using Stratos and Solid Soldier as material.</li>  	<li>Set Fusion Conscription, Miracle Fusion to Special Summon Bubbleman.</li>  	<li>Activate Miracle Fusion to Summon Escuriado to the zone Wonder Driver is pointing to, by banishing Shadow Mist and Solid Soldier.</li>  	<li>Activate Wonder Driver's effect to set Miracle Fusion.</li>  	<li>Activate Miracle Fusion again to Summon Absolute Zero by banishing the Bubbleman and Stratos.</li>  	<li>End board is Escuriado, Absolute Zero, Sunrise, and Wonder Driver</li> </ol> Now you have a Board wipe, A Beater, a Card Destroyer, and a Special Summoner as your end board."

The Agent and Despia are both banish oriented fairy decks and apparently work together super well when you tie a chaos engine into the mix, hereâs how:  Despia is easily the coolest thing thatâs coming out in DAMA, itâs a dark fairy oriented deck made for the monster fallen of albaz, itâs extremely consistent but lacks one important trait, it needs light monsters to work. Yes, it needs them to summon their fusions, otherwise they canât exactly win, so my original trick for them was diviner of the heralds. Now though new support cards came out for another banish oriented fairy deck, the agents. Exempt the agents are actually LIGT monsters! This gives them two pieces of synergy, theyâre both banish fairies, and Despia can use Agents for fusion materials. But there wasnât enough, it was consistent but underwhelming. Thatâs where our most important deck comes in, chaos, chaos actually ties these deck together very tight and completely revamps the playstyle of the synergy. I already learned to love this deck and I hope it can evolve and become a viable strategy."
