If you going first have some negs ready for summons mostly. I would recommend swapping out for <a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=98069388"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/98069388.jpg"" data-card=""98069388"" data-name=""Horn of Heaven"">Horn of Heaven</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;if you going first (to have at least one more negate).&nbsp;</p><p>Against Bystials (even bystials based) deck - x3 Skull Meister if you are scared to run into them, but just 2 is enough for me. 1 in main since I don't like surprises should be enough. Going first is kinda flip, going second should be much better even tho tear/bystials would be a problem in that case.&nbsp;</p><p>Against Tear/Ishizu (tear based) deck - Don't go second, and if you do, try to bait their negs on Shrouded Dragon eff or if you already have Branded Fusion then something like Aluber or Fallen of Albaz on summon effs. Just play mindgames. Also, in most cases when you going blind and don't know what you playing against, your Super poly will be useless against it, so if you have BEO3, just swap it out for Necrovalley and <a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=79864860"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/79864860.jpg"" data-card=""79864860"" data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</span></a> . <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=47355498"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/47355498.jpg"" data-card=""47355498"" data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;will hit you too but not as much as them. Yes Triphy is risky and kind of high ""cost"" but you can easily combo it with either mirror or albion, to clear a board + have a negate either way. Also, activating Necro in first turn after you have your stuff prepared is most-likely to be a GG if they don't have something to clear it up.&nbsp;</p><p>Against DWorld/Danger (<a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=4280258"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/4280258.jpg"" data-card=""4280258"" data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</span></a> &nbsp;based too) deck - New DWorld decks are crazy but the biggest problem for you is going second. If you can't negate the right stuff with effect veiler/meister/imperm you are gonna have a big problem or just starting with less than 3 cards in your hand. Also, hitting Dangers in opp hand is crucial so a bit of luck too. And also, pray for no <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=7623640"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/7623640.jpg"" data-card=""7623640"" data-name=""Ceruli, Guru of Dark World"">Ceruli, Guru of Dark World</span></a> . Other than that, the match-up is pretty much coinflip but you can get ahold of it really fast when playing against it. Necrovalley would be a good addition too when having second match.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I do not prefer main-decking Necro especially when I go blind. It backfired couple of times. I've experimented with 3x Branded Opening and Branded in Red as well.

I found myself bricking on 3x for some reason. Also you are discarding A LOT with this build - that's why having 3x tragedy is a good thing heh. 1 copy of it wasn't really coming in my hand at all when it was really needed. Having bigger chance to have 1 is always good. So 2x is optimal for me. Don't forget to swap it out when going against Tear decks, it will get only negated/shuffled and won't really work against them sadly.&nbsp;</p><p><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=45484331"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/45484331.jpg"" data-card=""45484331"" data-name=""Springans Kitt"">Springans Kitt</span></a>&nbsp; - 3x is overkill imo. 1x ain't enough, at least not for me. 2x is just right. I mean, you still can play 3x, cut out 1x Tragedy, and try it that way. But with this build, i'm suggesting playing only 2 copies.&nbsp;<strong>Edit:&nbsp;</strong><em>Nevermind, 3x is just fine.

Since you gonna dump scythe to the grave anyways. Either with discards like Super Poly or with Branded Fusion for Albion. You can basically bait your opponent into Scythe but still having the option of Back to the front is nice. Basically you can use it for bringing back fusions like Mirrorjade so, still win-win situation.&nbsp;</p><p><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=62022479"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/62022479.jpg"" data-card=""62022479"" data-name=""Branded Bond"">Branded Bond</span></a>&nbsp; - I was discussing this with few people if this was good or not as main deck card. You won't see this card even in side deck but hear me out. This card came so clutch in a lot of situations. Especially when it can be used for basically Shrouded Dragon from Grave or banished Fallen of Albaz.

This card is so underrated imo, even tho it's pretty lit.

Hey I said ALIENS! Not really a Word Yugioh players fear. Sadly Aliens never got the Spotlight they deserved and that's why it's time to change that with this Decklist. Let's see the Details:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Obvious go to Combo </strong></p><p>It's obvious that the new Link 3 Cosmic Slicer is the go to card to make in this Deck. He's Mystic Mine on legs (just a little different) and is a additional Normal Summon and a on summon search for A-Counter related cards. This card alone wins you a Duel if played right and it's something Aliens desperately needed to be somewhat relevant again.</p><p>Overlord, Dog and Ammonite are the Monsters which give you the summon power to make him. Crop Circles, Recombination Device with Mysterious Triangle and Code A Ancient Ruins combined are the Spells and Traps who enable a easier summon for the Cosmic Slicer too.&nbsp;</p><p>Together with Alien Kid or Planet Pollutant Virus (both searchable through slicer) every Monster of the opponent with A-Counters is changed to defense position and can't activate it's effects.</p><p>If the Cards fall right he's on Board as early as turn one and ready to be destroyed by Lightning Storm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Let's be honest that's not enough</strong></p><p>Aliens other big boy the Synchro Level 5 Fortress is the other Key Card which enables a lot of Spam and Removal if combined with Code A Ancient Ruins. Alien Ammonite is a easy one Card Combo to make him. Due to the soft once per Turn Nature of every older Alien card you can easily loop Code A with the Fortress to summon the Fortress Synchro boy 3 times in one round and some other dudes on top of that.&nbsp;</p><p>With all that you have a easy OTK line ready at any time, waiting to be deployed and waiting to be removed by Nibiru.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>And that's it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>No not at all. I didn't even mention the A-Counters in all of this. A-Counters when combined with certain Alien Monsters decrease the opponents ATK and DFF by 300 for every A-Counter and every Monster with said effect. Breaking big Tower Monsters (If not unaffected) are easy to be cleared with it since many A-Counter spreading effects are non targeting.&nbsp;</p><p>Monsters infected with A-Counters are also in danger of changing Control to your side of the field with Brainwashing Beam or Alien Hypno. Alien Hypno can steal up to 4 Monsters with no once per turn yet again and Brainwashing Beam acts as interruption.&nbsp;</p><p>The last Cosmic being the Cosmic Horror can tribute over stolen Monsters to remove them for good and Crop Circles achieves similar things. The Fail to find take 2000 damage part in Crop Circles effect is not working anymore due to current official rules preventing that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>That's all right?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Just a few extras left. The lackluster Field Spell is being played at one since it's a perfect return to hand card for the Synchro Fortress amd 1900 ATK sounds better then 1600. Alien Hunter is additional OTK power and kinda bad but always welcome as an option for me to Deal 3200 Damage. Alien Mother is the perfect target to be ditched to the Graveyard to be revived later with Code A. She Combos well with Overlord too, making her a suspicious one of.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final Words</strong></p><p>Aliens are good. They have a lot of interruption ready to be deployed and can easily overwhelm the opponent. The downsides are the absence of any Protection whatsoever. Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame is the only small lifeline they have to recover from Boardwipes. Gaining advantage again when the Field is once broken is difficult too, often leaving them open to be one turn killed after.&nbsp;</p><p>Stealthbuster and Recombination Device are your only real recovery tools and often not enough.&nbsp;</p><p>But don't let all that fool you. Aliens are a force to be reckoned with. With enough practice you can easily aim for Platin League and Higher in Master Duel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Try it yourself if you like Aliens like me.

We hopefully will be getting new support soon so a update now sounds decent + it could get more people excited for more future lists. Also I wanted to make a post so MBT finally makes a video about magistus for either one of his two deck shows (TMT or one shot show).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways, some notes. This list was specifically crafted to beat Tearelements/ the current meta. It's not a pure spellcaster list like many of you probably hope but rather a build that uses the good cards from the format to setup more interruptions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Description:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Magistus is a lore based - spellcaster archetype that focuses on attaching ED monsters to themselves (similarly to summoning them as their avatars) to do certian things.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deck List and Explanation: (I'll be copying a lot of the descirptions from my old post since I'm lazy AF)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Magistus Engine: (12)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3x Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame: Tuner of the deck. Serves as a starter as it can special summon another lv4 spellcaster from your hand/gy or attach Artemis to get to Crowley if you have spellcaster handtraps.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3x Endymion, the Magistus of Mastery:&nbsp; Starter that gets to Artemis and allows you to cycle through your deck. Also is a water for toad and allows you to toolbox equips to out cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Rilliona: S/T Searcher for the deck. I assume it's pretty clear from the ratios, but the magistus spell lineup has been really hit in this list. The issue is that all the spells involve you actually being able to start playing already and/or involve having another card to combo with it. RIlliona isn't as good as Endymion/Zoroa as a starter and rather works as a great followup play to search Vitra on the turn afterwards. It can work as a starter with the annoying play of: NS Rilliona -&gt; Grab Vitra -&gt; Link into Artemis -&gt; Vitra to revive Rilliona -&gt; Attach Artemis but this play just seems worse then it has to be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Crowley: Extender for the deck and the card you'll most likely grab off Artemis. His ability to change attributes comes up if you have two Crowleys on board for Rilliona XYZ (who needs two separate attributes) and for Toadally Awesome. He also is useful for Dharc in the ED.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Vitra: You need to open up another name for this to be good as it's not a starter like most of the format (looking at you field spells/starter smhh). Extender for the deck</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Trismagistus: Extender that serves as a soul charge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In general, these two aren't great in general and even worse in the current format as they lose hard to Rukkalos (Tearelements boss monster. You know who I mean, I ain't googling the card).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Generic Broken Cards: (17)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Unicorn -&gt; Searches follow up in the way of the Cont spell and also allows you to get a peek at your Opp deck if they hand trap you to Zoroa lock effectively. Also banishes a lot of the 1 of cards that decks are running as we move to more toolbox formats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3x Fenrir -&gt; interruption that searches followup and outs a lot of cards itself. Need I say more?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Druiswurm/3x Magnumut -&gt; Hits Tears hard and is pretty good in general. Also serves as a Dark for Dharc</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Secret Village of the Spellcasters -&gt; A lot of the format have really good spell cards. Furthermore, a lot of the outs for Zoroa come in the way of spell cards. Vahram isn't enough of a protection (not even close lmao, idk what Konami was thinking giving such a weak protection).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Kashtira Birth -&gt; Field Spell that serves as followup. In testing, I have yet to use the banish effect but it might come up?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Metaverse -&gt; 1 card kills Tearelements. Need I say more?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3x Forbidden Droplet -&gt; Little known fact, our equips are free sends with Droplets after their effects are used. Furthermore, wer run a lot of spells that combo well with droplets and/or have things we don't mind sending to GY. (the two performages come to mind)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Generic Cards:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Foolish Burial -&gt; to send a performage to have an easy extender. Also can be a play starter when combined with Vitra. Note you can send Trick Clown for a free body if you want to.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pot of Desires -&gt; Draw 2. You are running duplicates of a lot of cards you need. Typically I either use this to get extenders or hope to get into the good field spells.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Spellcaster ""Generics"":</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3x Spell Power Mastery -&gt; Our way to search for our starter Endymion&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 ea of Juggler/ Trick Clown/ Hat Tricker -&gt; More extenders to play thru boards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ED:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Aiwass -&gt; Fusion based meta so Aiwass is here. Has a neat effect to give the equipped monster 1k attack/def which comes up once an a while.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Zoroa, the Magistus of Daimon - Our main t1 board usually revolves around him. Important to realize that Zoroa says the cards don't have to be attached to him to do the floodgate effect and that Zoroa works no matter where the ED monster attempts to activate. Also has a neat reincarnation effect that becomes useful for plays later on and to reestablish the lock. Can be ran at 1 or 2 - up to your preference. (Would RECOMMEND 1 because you need the util in the ED to play through boards!)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Zeus - It's Zeus. Need I say more? A lot of decks are focused on decent rank 4's so we can rank up into Zeus quite easily to force interruption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Bahmaut Shark/Toad - One of the best interruptions that Magistus can make. Just use either Crowley type changed to water + Endymion and/or Jigabyte to make Shark and Toad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Feral Imps -&gt; Combo line to make UFD + Toad. I'll go over this line at the end but it's used to search for Jigabyte (note it's a pretty big rank 4 so in testing I've also made it specifically to search for an extender then make Zeus).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Bagooska - Best Generic rank 4 if you get stopped. Sadly, spellcasters don't have much generic extenders which are also spellcasters themselves. A lot of them involve having something else on the board (Ecclesscia needs an ED monster, Hat Tricker needs two monsters) so if you get stopped and can't make Rilliona or can't make a decent board, go with trusty plan B.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x&nbsp; Rilliona - Typically the card that allows the search for baby Zoroa. Allows us to consistently go into Zoroa. Remember that this card locks us into Magistus ED monsters. Also has a neat effect to negate a monster on your turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x UFD Package - Easy enough to make turn 1 granted you have a way to 3 level 4 bodies (which happens very often).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Combo line to make Toad + UFD: Start with starter (typically Endymion) -&gt; search Crowley. Bring out Crowley and one extender of your choice. XYZ the monsters that aren't able to turn water (if you have jigabyte then use jigabyte as a material since you can only have one on the board) and make feral imps. Feral Imps Search Jigabyte, ss jigabyte into Shark into Toad. Then use Shark + Feral to make UF into UFD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Accesscode/Selene/Dharc -&gt; Halq was banned so we gotta make due with what we have. Crowley being a dark makes Dharc possible for us and a lot of the format currently uses Darks so it works well. Line is simple: Make Dharc, ss a dark from opp gy, make selene, revive from gy or ss from hand, make Accesscode. Two pops + a 5.3k body sounds good to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Artemis - the best equip card that the deck has. It allows the search for any of our Magistus monsters that we need in hand. Honestly, currently the best card in the entire archetype.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Side deck:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Droll still works well with the deck since Crowley needs to discard a spellcaster. Droll isn't to bad into the current format.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vahram/Ninaruru -&gt; Syncro Lock + extra xyz lock or backrow pop</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>HFD -&gt; We still don't have a great way around backrow so 1 HFD in the side to finish up the set of 3 with Vahram/Ninaruru has been the best option so far.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LS/Evenly -&gt; Board breakers. Great for forcing up interruption in the form of Cryme in the Tearelements matchup.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Summon Limit -&gt; FLOODGATES GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. I choose this floodgate as after we establish a board, we don't have to SS a lot. We also can out it ourselves with Droplets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways, here's my current list that I've been trying out in the YGO Omega competitve ladder.

To achieve this board, <strong>Zombie World + Doomking </strong>have to be present on the field. <br /><br /></span><span class=""style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"">As long as you have this set-up, you're likely to win and everything else that you summon on your field is extra defends your ""ZWorld Lock.""</span><br /><span class=""style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto""><br />This ideal board primarily falls to the crux combo piece <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong>. Uni-Zombie almost single-handedly achieves this end board by milling zombies from the hand or deck (Necroworld Banshee for Zombie World) (Glow-Up Bloom for Doomking), in addition to providing synchro access. <br /><br /></span> <strong> Shiranui Solitaire</strong> allows more ready access to the ""ZWorld Lock"" board, by summoning Uni-Zombie from deck. <br /><span class=""style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto""><br />Milling as many cards as possible from your deck/hand to your GY enable this strategy. The<strong> ""Assault Mode"" engine</strong> supports milling, since a summoned Psi-Reflector easily makes a level 8 Synchro, which would be <strong>Chaos Ruler</strong>. Chaos Ruler mills 5 from your deck (hopefully zombies) while adding a combo piece to your hand. <br /><br />If you have extra monsters on field, </span><strong>Vampire Sucker</strong> is the ideal monster to summon. She provides more resources to a zombie player by giving the player a free draw anytime a zombie is resurrected from either graveyard. During the standby phase, if Doomking is in the graveyard and there is a Field Spell on the board, it will resurrect itself, which prompts Vampire Sucker's +1 draw effect (chain link 1) and Doomking's banishment effect (chain link 2). Drawing one card and banishing another on the field/graveyard in the standby phase is often devastating. Often in the first turn, Doomking + another zombie is linked away for Vampire Sucker to allow for this chain to occur during your opponent's standby phase.<br /><br />While this deck is strong and consistent going first, it doesn't do well to interruptions, negates and handtraps. ""Pure"" Zombieworld is considered ""rogue"" in the competitive environment of Masterduel that is overrun with Runick, Branded and Adamancipator. If you truly want to upgrade your ""Immortal Glory"" Structure Deck, perhaps you should pair it up with Eldlich and Branded.<br /><br />Also, if your normal summon Uni-Zombie is somehow negated pr interrupted, the turn usually ends there. This deck also has difficulty breaking established boards, as it doesn't have much tools to do so.<br /><br />All in all, this deck is a fun rogue strategy to play, semi-budget (thanks for the Structure Deck Masterduel devs!), and easy to learn.<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</p>"

I feel like many people don't understand the slower playstyle of Shiranui so I go more into Detail below:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Starters:</strong></p><p>Your obvious goal with this Deck is to get your L2 Spectralsword Tuner into the Graveyard as quickly as possible to get a follow up Synchro summon on the next turn. Note that you can also banish him and use additional effects to get him back to the GY.</p><p>Your Number one go to Card for that is the L4 Squire which sets up a first Turn L6 or L7 Synchro Summon. Spiritmaster and Solitaire to some extent can achieve the same with more setup/downsides.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>But how do I survive if Squire is missing?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>That's were Shiranui is starting to work. They can prevent all damage with the permanent Trap Samsara and have a stronger Icarus Attack with Swallow's Slash (Banish Spiritmaster to destroy up to 3 cards).&nbsp;</p><p>In addition they have Quick Effect Speed summons from Hand and Deck and the L4 Samurai can at quick effect Speed trigger his non targeting Banish if he's being attacked and thus trigger Spiritmaster to interrupt the opponent further.</p><p>With that you will be able to survive even against the most Meta oriented Decks with ease. But beware since this strategy falls appart if the opponent summons multiple negates during his turn (Prevent that with Destroy Interruption like Swallow's Slash or Spiritmaster). Having the permanent spell Solemnity active also helps (if it survives).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It's your second turn, what now?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Now it's Shiranui's time to strike back. Use the Spectralsword in the graveyard to setup a L6 or 8 Synchro play and use the L3 Spectralsword Shade tuner to recycle said Combo back to the field and go into the Synchro 10 Sunsaga and non targeting destroy what's left on the opponents side of the field.</p><p>To prevent any follow ups feel free to activate the Shiranui/Mayakashi Trap to prevent any Special summons from anywhere except the grave.&nbsp;</p><p>From this point thanks to strong Recycling and banishing power you can Combo through any of your Shiranui Boss Monsters whenever you like and devastate the opponent's strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>The one strong upside of this Archetype is you never run out of gas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Extra Spice</strong></p><p>Both Shiranui Style Samsara and Shiranui Style Solemnity are Soft Once per turns. Having more then one active equals more advantage. Imagine Recycling 6 Monsters and Drawing 3 cards in one turn. A pipedream I dream of every day.&nbsp;</p><p>The Link 3 Monster helps Shiranui getting over their once per Turn Special Summon limitation by interrupting the opponent with a summon during their turn. Thanks to the link arrows of her you always find space to summon one Shiranui back from the banished Zone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final Words</strong></p><p>Shiranui is truly fascinating and versatile in it's usage. The Fire Attribut gives them some unique Matchups and big faces if you happen to see Barrier Statue lockdown (They always summon Fire first).&nbsp;</p><p>But like every Zombie Archetype they hard loose against Necrovalley and other Graveyard interruption and sometimes the whole Strategy breaks appart if the key pieces are missing.&nbsp;</p><p>Then again it's a very fun Deck and easily one of my favourites for it's Recycling/Banishing loop. Give it a try if you like if you want to learn a more complex Deck. Understanding all the Combos and when to use them takes time but I easily go into Platin and beyond with this Strategy when it works.&nbsp;</p><p>Sidenote: In Master Duel they even give you a Shiranui Starter Deck with everything except the 2 UR's. Also the Shiranui/Mayakashi Lockdown Trap is still Missing and can be replaced with ""Fateful Hour"" or simple Boardwipes instead.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall Rating: ★★★☆☆☆</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

The most efficient way of doing so is through the Prologue trap which is run at 3 alongside Whelp and Trap Trick each at 3 which can search it out from the deck. The secondary little Destruction Sword monsters provide nice control effects e.g. locking opponent from extra deck, graveyard or face-up backrow efffects.</p><p>The achilles heel of the deck is backrow, hence the 3 dark bribes and copious backrow removal cards.</p>"

It also broke my heart to also learn that while it was a cute little deck that involves Kitt and Kerass just doing their thing, Spright Tri-Brigade fell short against Tearlaments and others. I never really got the appeal of splashing in anything that isn't gonna stick for too long, but that applies with all Yu-Gi-Oh deck these past few years. Not to mention that out of all the Spright variants (excluding pure), I did enjoy this one the most for its simplicity and access to link plays. Running a zoodiac engine however is not needed nor recommended as I tried running it with the package, but can only get through it twice (with or without ""Fire Formation - Tenki).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>"

I hope you're doing good.<br /><br />This deck is Viable as soon as Photon Hypernova is released. This build is focused on breaking the opponents board as good as possible to then control the game from there through fenrir and Arisehearth. It doesn't have the best game 1 against Tear, but in the side Shifter and Crow are ready to tear it apart xD<br /><br />Post siding you can bring out secret village with a big eye on field so cards like Book of eclipse, DRNM, change of heart etc or even entire decks like runick wont be able to be played. Shifter, Crow and Droll are fantastic against Dark world, and in the Mirror Match Droll and D-barrier will most-likely carry the duel.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, have fun with it and good luck for 2023. See ya^^</p>"

However, the Libromancer archetype seemed to be a bit better than other ritual archetypes, with how its main method of ritual summoning is a field spell with no once-per-turn limitation on its summoning effect. They don't need any extra deck monsters, which is why I'm including some Dogmatika cards. If you have Nadir Servant, add that to this deck.

Utilising the newly released ""Duality"", we are able to tribute any Level 5 Light Machine for a Chimeratech Rampage Dragon or Chimeratech Fortress Dragon for a Cyber Twin Dragon. This card allows Cyber Dragons to access their fusions much more easily and is another great tool to add into our arsenal.<br /><br />Why Forbidden Droplet over Dark Ruler No More?<br /><br />Forbidden droplet has a nice benefit to send Clockwork Night on the field to grave to allow us to use Machine Duplication again. It being a Quick-Play also allows us to play around certain interuptions like Infinite Impernance targetting a Cyber Dragon Core. It is also a decent interuption if we are ever forced to go first.<br /><br /><strong>Cyber Dragon<br /><br /></strong>1-3x Cyber Dragon<br />3x Cyber Dragon Core<br />2-3x Cyber Dragon Herz<br />1-2x Cyber Dragon Nachster<br /><br />0-1x Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju<br /><br />3x Cyber Emergency<br />0-3x Clockwork Night<br />0-1x Overload Fusion<br />0-1x Cybernetic Overflow<br />0-1x Cyberload Fusion<br />0-1x Cyber Revsystem<br /><br />1-2x Chimeratech Rampage Dragon<br />1-2x Cyber Dragon Nova<br />1-2x Cyber Dragon Infinity<br />1-3x Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon<br />1-3x Chimeratech Fortress Dragon<br />1x Cyber Dragon Sieger<br /><br />1x Salangreat Almiraj<br />0-1x Relinquished Anima<br />0-1x Linkuriboh<br /><br />1x Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder<br /><br />0-1x Cyber Twin Dragon<br />0-1x Cyber End Dragon<br />0-1x Cyber Eternity Dragon<br /><br />0-1x Spright Elf<br />0-1x Gigantic Spright<br /><br />The typical Cyber Dragon core I stick to. Ratios will largely depend on the engines you wish to use.<br /><br /><strong>Machine Duplication<br /><br /></strong>0 or 3x Machine Duplication<br /><br />Still a good option (even if it conflicts with Clockwork Night) to go into a Cyber Dragon Infinity. Although, it can be risky since it can be easily disrupted with any almost any kind of interacation.<br /><br /><strong>Galaxy Soldier<br /><br /></strong>2-3x Galaxy Soldier<br /><br />Another good option for going into Cyber Dragon Infinity. Also acts as a secondary target for ""Duality""<br /><br /><strong>Duality<br /><br /></strong>2-3x Duality<br /><br />Duality is an interesting card, it allows you to trade a Level 5 Light Machine for a Chimeratech Rampage Dragon or any of your Chimeratech Contact Fusions into big threats. This allows Cyber Dragons to access their prized fusions much more easily. Worth trying out due to low extra deck investment needed since you will be running most of the fusions in a regular Cyber Dragon deck anyways.<br /><br /><strong>Therion<br /><br /></strong>1-2x Therion ""King"" Regulus<br />0-2x Therion Discolosseum<br />0-1x Terraforming<br /><br />An omni-negate in Therion ""King"" Regulus to either break boards or stabilise on the crackback. Good for the long game<br /><br /><strong>Cyberdark<br /><br /></strong>0-2x Cyberdark Claw<br />1x Cyberdark Chimera<br /><br />1-2x Power Bond<br />1x Cyberdark Realm<br />0-1x Cybernetic Horizon<br /><br />Power bond into a 4200 ATK Chimeratech Rampage Dragon for 12600 damage? Decent option if you do not mind the bricks in the deck.<br /><br /><strong>Wishlist<br /><br /></strong>A searchable version of Overload Fusion<br />1 Card Infinity<br />Easier access to Clockwork Night<br />Link 1.

May it be wielded with wisdom. May it be put down when its job is done."" -Brok, God of War: Ragnarok","<p>While I was getting immersed in <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em>, I was not emotionally prepared for the tragedy that would cement Odin's status as the biggest @$$hole in all the Nine Realms: the murder of Brok, and how it twisted Sindri into a broken, hateful shell of his former self. Since the brothers' debut in <em>God of War 4,</em> the rugged, foul-mouthed manly man and soft-spoken, germaphobic sensitive soul have wormed their way into our hearts. So it's no surprise that Brok's funeral scene made at least 10 people on every block cry their eyes out.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is my tribute to Brok the dwarf, an Ishizu Runick deck. Both of the decks feature milling as key components of their overall strategy. While Runicks have Runick Fountain as their main recovery card, Ishizu's new Fairies have Mudora and Agido's retrains for both recursion and interruption of the opponent's plays. So combined with the Ishizu engine, Runick can deck the opponent out much sooner than expected. This deck doesn't use hand traps apart from Kelbek the Ancient Vanguard, so the ideal scenario is you going first.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now before you download this deck profile, make sure to pour one out for our blue brother in arms. After God of War: Ragnarok proved itself to be one of the hallmarks of 2022 for gamers, I refuse to end the year before giving one final requiem for Brok.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>May this deck profile win true.

In this playstyle, you will likely include a high number of traps in your deck, as well as monsters that have effects that are triggered by your opponent's actions, such as activating a monster, spell or trap card.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>To play this style effectively, it is important to pay attention to your opponent's moves and anticipate what they might do next. For example, if you see that your opponent is setting a lot of spell or trap cards, you might want to consider holding onto your traps until they are activated, so that you can use them to disrupt your opponent's plans. In a different scenario, because Master Duel is in a format where it&rsquo;s single elimination and most competitive, meta decks use a lot of special summoning, you want to save your monster effects and traps to hit opponent choke points. The great thing about labyrinth is, you can also use your monster effects to react to your opponent's actions, such as ripping a card from your opponent&rsquo;s hand through Lovely and if applicable, drawing off Arianna.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>In addition to using traps and reactive monster effects to disrupt your opponent's plans, it is also important to have a solid defense to protect yourself from your opponent's attacks. This involves using monsters with high defense points and attack through Archfiend and Sky Prison, or using traps and spells to negate or deflect your opponent's attacks and monster effects through Storming Mirror Force, Called by the Grave and Impermanence. By carefully balancing your offense and defense, you can effectively control the flow of the game and put pressure on your opponent to make mistakes. This build creates a nice oppressive presence through backrow removal and low monster removal by means of Harpie&rsquo;s Feather Duster, Heavy Storm Duster and the Virus one-ofs.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Maxx ""C"" is a monster card that has an effect that allows you to draw additional cards from your deck whenever your opponent special summons a monster. This can be a powerful tool for generating card advantage, as it allows you to gain an extra draw each time your opponent special summons a monster.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Pot of Duality is a spell card that allows you to add a card from your deck to your hand, and then shuffle the remaining cards back into your deck. This can be a useful way to search for specific cards that you need in a given situation, as well as thinning your deck to improve your chances of drawing key cards.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Pot of Extravagance is a spell card that allows you to banish a number of cards from your deck, and then draw that same number of cards. This can be a powerful way to search for specific cards and improve your chances of drawing them, as well as thinning your deck to improve the consistency of your draws.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>In general, these cards can be powerful tools for improving the consistency and efficiency of your deck, and can be especially useful in trap control decks that rely on having specific cards in hand to disrupt your opponent's plans. By carefully considering how to use these cards in your deck and strategy, you can improve your chances of success in Labyrinth.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>In conclusion, this deck is amazing and has done phenomenal for me. I am currently 9-0 with this deck; I don&rsquo;t know how impressive that may be for you, the individual reading this, but anything above gold in Master Duel is sweaty!&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Thank you for your time! :)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Send the phantasm city in your gy with electric jellyfish and revive it with sea stealth attack.<strong> !!!</strong>Experience is needed for this field spell, so you know when and where to utilize it, or it will block your plays.</p>"

The main strategy is to fusion summon a bunch of boss monsters, preferrably ending with monsters such as Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon, El Shaddoll Winda, and Invoked Mechaba. I'll go though each of the archetypes and why they're here.</p><p>Branded: Just having branded fusion in your hand allows you to get a monster from your deck to the graveyard easily, as well as calling upon Mirrorjade to strengthen your board. Many branded fusion monsters have effects when sent to the graveyard, allowing them to synergize with Dogmatika, and Branded Lost stops your opponent from negating your fusion summons and allows you to search a monster that mentions Fallen of Albaz when you fusion summon any monster, allowing you to get an extra card into your hand without much difficulty.</p><p>Invoked: Mechaba's just an annoyance to a lot of decks, so we may as well add them for the extra negate/banish. Their effect requires a card to be discarded, but that's ok, you can discard a Shaddoll or something else with a graveyard effect. Invocation allows you to recycle materials from the graveyard to fusion summon, and the field spell magical meltdown also protects your effects that fusion summon monsters.</p><p>Dogmatika: As these cards like to lock you out of the extra deck, try to use Dogmatika cards at the end of your turn whenever possible. Mostly these are just here to send Branded and Shaddoll fusion monsters from the extra deck to the graveyard that way you can use their searching effects.</p><p>Elementsaber: The Invoked and Shaddoll archetypes can use materials from the graveyard to fusion summon, and these materials are usually dependant on the attribute of one material, so if you can get elementsabers into your graveyard, you can use those as whatever attribute you need. Palace of the Elemental Lords is the card that makes this work, really. It will boost all of your monsters' attack and defence for each attribute in your graveyard, although, that doesn't mean a lot. What this deck really aims for is the ability to search any elementsaber monster from your deck, and to be able to send elementsabers from the deck to the graveyard when you would normally send them from the hand. When you activate your Palace, use it to find Elementsaber Lapaulia Mana. You'll have to skip the battle phase of your next turn, but that's a small price to pay. Then, use Lapaulia Mana's effect to special summon itself from your hand, and to send the other two elementsaber monsters from your deck to the graveyard. I'm using Makani and Lapaulia as fodder for this, but you can switch them out for other elementsabers depending on how you want to use Lapaulia Mana's effect. Anyways, congrats, you now have a decently strong, protected monster and to monsters in the graveyard that can be any element of your choice.</p><p>Shaddoll: All shaddol monsters have some sort of effect when sent to the graveyard, so with the other archetypes allowing you to send them from the deck and extra deck to the graveyard, and discarding them, then you'll get these effects often. You can also set up a Winda lock at the end of your turn just to annoy your opponent.</p><p>This deck looks a lot more complicated than it actually is, once you get into it, but do try to figure out some combos before you play it. This decklist is legal in both the TCG and in Master Duel (Maybe OCG too but I don't know what the banlist is like there). Have fun if you do try this deck!</p>"

I'd sugest filling the rest of the extra deck with generic link monsters that you think might be useful.</p><p>P.S. You might also consider removing the 2 Purple Butterflies and running 3 Tigers but honestly Tiger isn't as useful as you'd imagine so if you didn't get 3 from pulling packs there's really no reason to waste reasources building more, and if you didn't even get even 1 you can just not run it.</p>"
