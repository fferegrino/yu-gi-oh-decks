There are very strong and dangerous moves it can pull.  I feel that this deck does better going second, as it is an offensive deck. It's not like you'll lose if you go 1st, but 2nd might be better for this deck.  This deck makes use of some HERO cards that are currently exclusive to the OCG. These cards are Elemental HERO Liquidman, Elemental HERO Sunriser and Xtra HERO Hell Diviser.  Nibiru, the Primal Being can counter opposing decks that Summon a lot during a single turn, but it can also work well as the Rock Fusion Material for Evil HERO Dark Gaia.  The Side Deck is mostly compromised of other cards you can consider for the deck."

There are a few variations on this from the winning decks I've seen. No Black Dragon Collapserpent, or White Dragon Wyverburster. They're cool extra special summons, but while White Dragon is pretty consistent in this deck, its a light attribute which is no good with Allure of Darkness, and Black Dragon was pretty inconsistent. They're just awkward, and I'd rather have more copies of the good Rokkets to tutor for so I can do what I want with my Rokket pile, and take full advantage of both the searching and the card advantage inherent in Rokkets. The deck also makes a considerable number of special summons already. There's still room for a Tempest, and I'm considering going up on White Rose Dragon. But having 3 Rokket Tracer seems pretty important to the core, and 2 of each other gives me good tutoring ability. I'd also be remiss to cut an Absorouter.  In the extra deck, I've opted for Black Rose Dragon to combo with White Rose Dragon, and to give me a good repeatable destroy all. This should also be good enough to clear away backrow. There Borreload Savage Dragon, a good thing to pull out of the extra deck with Agarpain after making lots of link plays. And also there's Ib, because the 2 Draconnet combo can immediately pull her out, and she can pull out World Legacy Guardragon, which is big for making the link plays. Then I have on Borreload Furious Dragon as a Dragon's Mirror target. Its effect is really good with Booster Dragon and Rokkets, and its a freeish extra special summon in a deck that stocks its graveyard so well. Besides that, I have a pretty normal link pile for the deck, with lots of one-ofs since I can recur from the graveyard and from banishment with Guardragons. Shout outs to Link Spider and I:P Masquerana, one of which starts combos super easily, and the other of which lets you continue combos after your Rokkets have tutored on your end step  EDIT*  Running Apollousa for the IP: Masquerana combo. Also added a single Autorokket Dragon, since its a 3 star monster to tutor for, useful for making Black Rose Dragon and Ib. It also gives us an option against spell/trap heavy decks.  Added Skullmeister to the maindeck. It's a dark monster hand trap, so I figured it would be good to try it out. It should help game 1 against Orcust, really gearing decks up to take on Orcust.  Flipped around the hand traps, to move more D.D. Crow and Called to the main and Skullmeister to the side.  EDIT***  Now I'm trying more of the Rokket support, in Striker Dragon, Boot Sector Launch, and Dillingerous Dragon. This gives me a third way to tutor for support off of link monsters, and more combo extenders for Rokket plays.  I've gone down on Called for BSL, so I may still end up cutting it. Even with this many Rokket monsters, I might fall short of BSL in average hands, so as much as another linkable tutor is appealing, I'm reserving judgement.  I've also added one Destrudo; not much to say, its a more reliable special summon than White Rose Dragon, and it gives me an alternative way to combo out of the graveyard that's less backbreaking than Tempest, and you can loop it with Dragon Ravine (half your lifepoints is nothing to sneeze at, but you'll never not be able to pay it!) It also makes Black Rose Dragon better.  I've changed the trap suite in the side deck, and added Darkness Metal, the Dragon of Dark Steel as another big Link-4 boss monster, over Apollousa. Apollousa lock are great, but Darkness Metal is more of everything the deck is doing.  EDIT***  I've got Knightmare Phoenix in the extra deck for Spell/Trap removal. I've got a Link Spider in the sidedeck for when I want to co-link Knightmares instead of the usual plan.  I'm back on Saryuja Skulldread. He's not strictly necessary, or always possible, but as an MTG player I'm very tempted by a better Brainstorm (even if all I'm doing afterward is the usual loopy guardragon thing). Darkness Metal was cooler in theory than in practice. I've also switched maindeck hand traps for D.D. Crow and Skullmeister. Unlike Ash, you can pitch them to Allure, and with so much graveyard interaction in the meta it makes sense to hose graveyards maindeck.  Side Deck is now 3 each of Ash, Lancea, Evenly Matched, Nibiru, plus a single Link Spider, one Solemn Judgement as a catch-all, and one Imperial Order. The last one may seem strange in a spell-heavy deck, but the idea is to bring it out in vs dedicated spell heavy decks, set up on turn one, and then stop your opponent from taking you down.  I've moved Triple Burst Dragon back into the main deck. Between Dragon type, the negate, and the extra couple hundred attack points it seems better than Unicorn (which I never have the cards to proc).  EDIT  Dropped a hand trap for a second Silverrokket. Just more Rokket fuel to pull out of the deck. I found I was occasionally short on level 4 dragons and Rokkets that recur.  I dropped Burial for another Shrine. All I'm ditching are dragon anyways, and Shrine is usually a painless special summon, wheras Burial by itself isn't."

It is NOT intended for actual serious play, just as a quick test. You will most likely lose xD. Basically swarm with Dustons using House Duston, Diamond Duston, and The Revenge of the Normal to make Dystopia. Then, if you want, you can tribute Dystopia into Garzett for 10,000 ATK. Also, if you can't get Dystopia, you can use Starduston for loads of ATK, too. But actually, this sucks. Don't use it lol."

It is pretty simple and straight forward but I will go through the key players of the deck just because nothing is stopping me.  <strong>Magic Cylinder</strong>  My all time favourite trap card. Its pretty self-explanatory so I don't want to dwell on this card for long.  an opponent's monster attacks, you activate MC and then boom no damage taken, I can't say the same about your opponent  <strong>Raphion</strong>  Raphion is pretty much the punishment you get for playing high atk monsters and not being able to defend them properly.  Raphion attacks, it activates its effect and your opponent takes all the damage from their monster that Raphion attacked. Savagery  <strong>Amazoness Swords Woman</strong>  She might have low attack stats but never underestimate her at all. Especially when you don't know what she can be capable of.  Amazoness Swords Woman attacks and your opponent takes all the damage you would have taken if you battled against a high attack monster. Good counter for Blue Eyes Max Chaos Dragon  &nbsp;  <strong>Strengths</strong>  This deck is fully utilised in a battle against high attack level monsters with little to no defence in their names.  Blue-Eyes can barely handle a deck like this unless you play Max Chaos, then magic cylinder is useless. But now that Magic Cylinder is out of the picture, B-E Max Chaos has Raphion/Michion to deal with, and that battle will not end well for Blue-Eyes Chaos Max.  Gren Maju deck feels like it was a match made in heaven when playing against this deck, This is because a deck like Gren Maju is an OTK itself depending on one card if not more to handle that OTK task, So why don't we reverse that OTK and use it for ourselves with little to no effort coming only from a <strong>single card!!</strong>  There is this Synchro monster called Pyrocesslayer Final Sigma making the rounds in  the current meta and somehow it has not affected me at all. You know why?. Because it is just another High attack monster. Sure ""unaffected by card effects"" is good but throw in a Dimension Wall+Raphion The Timelord and watch that bad boy crumble  <strong>Weaknesses</strong>  Sure all decks have weaknesses and this deck is also all like the other decks. So don't think you will every single duel with this deck. <ul>  	<li>Well one obvious weakness to this deck is that it is weak against <strong>Stall and Burn</strong> decks because of their lack of high attack monsters</li>  	<li>Effect negating decks are also some painful decks to deal with this deck</li>  	<li>Yes also decks that lockdown spells and traps to being used. Although it is  not that of a big deal. You can still win without playing traps and spells</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>In conclusion</strong>  The deck is pretty fun to play with and teaches your opponent that the people(or duel monsters in this case) that they feed can come back to bite them.  &nbsp;  <strong>P.S</strong>  Although there is Reflect bounder on the side deck. I hardly ever use it because most of my opponent are not that stupid to fall into Reflect Bounder's trap lol.  Feel free to comment and give your input on the deck. There might be some cards that can improve the deck that I am not aware of at the moment. But hey!, everyone had different ideas so help is appreciated."

Key cards in successfully employing the Salamangreat strategy include:  • Gazelle: This is the engine of your Deck. <a data-name=""Salamangreat Gazelle"">Salamangreat Gazelle</a> dumps the card that is most ideal for perpetuating or achieving a specific game state. More often than not that will be Roar, and in some cases Rage, however, there may be instances where something like Falco (which is being cut entirely now) or Jaguar is more beneficial to send. If you open Rage or Roar, sending something like <a data-name=""Salamangreat Falco"">Salamangreat Falco</a>, <a data-name=""Salamangreat Jack Jaguar"">Salamangreat Jack Jaguar</a>, <a data-name=""Salamangreat Spinny"">Salamangreat Spinny</a>, <a data-name=""Salamangreat Foxy"">Salamangreat Foxy</a>, <a data-name=""Will of the Salamangreat"">Will of the Salamangreat</a>, or even <a data-name=""Salamangreat Circle"">Salamangreat Circle</a> can be a smart decision for enabling future play (though what you send should also be considered with your usage of Stallio as Stallio can Special Summon one of your Salamangreat monsters from Deck).  • Stallio: When you can't get to Gazelle with your opening hand your other option is to Summon Gazelle off of <a data-name=""Salamangreat Mirage Stallio"">Salamangreat Mirage Stallio</a>. This not only makes Stallio vital, for combatting inconsistency, but it makes Stallio incredibly powerful; being able to Special Summon a variety of monsters that serve different roles, at the cost of 2 Level 3s, enables Stallio to jack up the consistency and flexibility of the Deck. Now <em>I cannot stress enough</em> how free Stallio is given its generic Summoning conditions. 2 Level 3s have never been easier to put on board than in 2019, and Salamangreat is no exception to this; the archetype has several ways to spam Level 3s. Given how easy it is to make, and how powerful it can be, it should be of no wonder that Stallio is integral to many of the core combos. For those of you who are learning the archetype, the usual suspect for Stallio's effect is Jaguar as you can use it's graveyard effect to Summon itself under Sunlight Wolf which then triggers the Sunlight Wolf and allows you to recover a Fire monster (like <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, Gazelle, Foxy, or even <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a>).  • Wolf: Coupled with <a data-name=""Salamangreat Sanctuary"">Salamangreat Sanctuary</a> and your standard combo(s) involving Gazelle sending Roar/Rage, <a data-name=""Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf"">Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf</a> offers access to a recyclable omni-negate or pop 2. Its reincarnation Link ability (to recover a Salamangreat back row, once per turn) is one of the cornerstones of the Salamangreat grind game and central strategy. Adding to its relevance is the fact that Wolf can recover your combo pieces. This gives Salamangreat a very zoodiac-esque feel as by recovering Gazelle, you're essentially recovering your entire gameplan. This level of recursion is also definitive of the Salamangreat grind game and is the main reason why Salad is capable of displaying strong turn 2s+.  • Jaguar: Coupled with Sunlight wolf, Salamangreat Jack Jaguar defines the Salamangreat grind game. It can continually recycle your Extra Deck, continually trigger Sunlight Wolf to fetch whatever combo piece you need, and continually provide itself as Link Fodder. As your opponent receives diminishing returns, by way of recursive Roar negates or Rage pops, this card begins to truly shine; offering a free additional summon each turn makes OTKs easier, it makes Rank 4 plays easier, it makes building your board back up easier, and much more.  • Roar / Rage: These are your primary options to consider when using Gazelle's effect. When you're blinding first, it is typically safer to send <a data-name=""Salamangreat Roar"">Salamangreat Roar</a> as it turns into an infernity barrier-esque negate and can affect a wide range of play styles, but when you know your opponent's strategy (especially if they are playing a back row strategy) it may be smarter to send <a data-name=""Salamangreat Rage"">Salamangreat Rage</a> as it can disrupt their ability to set high levels of disruption. Adding more to their significant disruption is the fact that you can keep setting them each turn with Sunlight Wolf. With each unanswered Sunlight Wolf, these cards push a Salad player closer to winning the game.  Having discussed the core of the strategy, I feel that it is important to highlight cards that accentuate the strategy's end board and consistency. Salamangreat is not a ""break my board"" type of strategy and despite its high resource efficiency, it is not a ""control"" strategy. While it can certainly play as both of these strategies, or facilitate both of these strategies, it is typically played - and will be discussed here - as a mid-range deck.  • Backrow: Impermanence, Solemns, Artifact Engine. I would mandate that Impermanence is necessary as its viability as both a set disruption and hand trap is too strong to ignore for a Deck that lives or dies by a combo that dies to any significant amount of disruption (whether that be going 1st or 2nd). <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> helps you deal with boards going 2nd and 1st; preventing ""break my board"" type decks from outright curb-stomping, and helping disrupt a variety of decks when set going 1st. To a lesser degree, I would recommend looking at the Solemn Brigade and Artifact Engine. <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> and <a data-name=""Solemn Judgement"">Solemn Judgement</a> at 3 are incredibly strong and can prevent blow-outs from siding or simply add to the low level of turn 1 pressure that Salad naturally applies. <a data-name=""Artifact Sanctum"">Artifact Sanctum</a> can also help with regards to the latter, but it is far less consistent as you are required to play cards that perform as garnets when opened (<a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>).  • Hand Traps: <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a>, Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring, <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>, <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, <a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a>, and even <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> are all worth considering in Salamangreat. While many of these are great options for Salad, it should be noted that when playing specific hand traps - that counter specific meta-strategies as opposed to multiple - you inadvertently hurt the consistency of your gameplan. Salad thrives off being able to be consistent against a variety of Decks, and for that reason your main deck hand traps should only really be used to facilitate consistent disruption. A card like Phantazmay (Thanos Dragon) is great at facilitating this disruption as it can protect your board while drawing into <em>other useful hand traps</em>. Similarly, cards like Ash, Veiler, and Imperm will almost always be consistent disruption. On that note, I would really only advise you to consider these 3 more than any other hand traps; I do not play a high hand trap count because I find that Salamangreat can brick when playing a high number of hand traps, and it can be very hard to play through those bricks (playing something like Phantazmay can in theory work against this, but it also adds to the chance of drawing a weak or dead card - which may or may not be an issue in your eyes).  • Extra Deck: The Salad extra doesn't feature a lot of spice, given how tight it is, but there are some non-Salamangreat cards that should be mentioned. A card like <a data-name=""Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze"">Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze</a> is important for Salad matchups and can also be used in the Striker matchup, and given that these 2 decks are very popular in the current meta, this card is a must-have at competitive events. At a less competitive event, however, it is worth noting that you can replace Hiita with something more suitable. An option that can be used in place of Hiita (or simply in place of 2 Stallio) is <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a>. Given how easy it is to make a rank 4 in Salamangreat, it is worth considering the rank 4 pool - and Bagooska (turn 1) is incredibly strong when backed up by Salad's grind + disruption. On the note of rank 4s, it is also worth considering <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> (which I consider to be a staple). At this point in the format, it is almost mandatory to play Dweller as it can auto-win a key matchup like Orcust. Aside from these cards, I would also strongly encourage a player to look at <a data-name=""Update Jammer"">Update Jammer</a> into <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> (and when it's released in the TCG, <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>). Not much needs to be said about these two as they are some of the strongest board breaking tools available to Salamangreats, that are not Salamangreat."

Running Seal of Orichalchos because why not, an extra 500 points puts my monsters above the 3000 mark, the downside isn't relevant, and I just want to play with the card. Dropped the Skystrikers, because you don't really get the full value off of Engage. Might be correct to play Engage just for deck thinning, but instead I freed up space for Instant Fusion.  Actually (somewhat) using the extra deck now with Extra-Foolish Burial and Instant fusion.  I decided to add back in a single Engage into Hornet Drones. Second copy is dead, but it gives me more deck thinning, potential card draw in theory, and makes tokens for 1000 less lifepoints than the alternative.  Dropped Engage for a One Time Passcode, since 2000 Def is appealing, and this way you don't brick with an Engage and a Hornet Drones when you need both special summons.  Going Terraforming over a second Mystic Mine. Even though it makes me weaker to Ash, it also lets me find Seal in matchups where the power boost is important, and it is functionally that second Mystic Mine still. The deck also isn't very weak to Ash in general, so making my opponent make the hard call on whether to bring hr in game 2-3 is appealing. (Other than finding Mystic Mine or Seal of Orichalcos, the only thing being Ashed is a search for Sauvaris)  I've gone up Preparation of Rites and Solemn Judgement for more protection maindeck. Those last couple slots aren't super important, I think 2 Solemn in place of Extra-Foolish Burial seems reasonable, the deck seems more versatile and this way is actually paying less life points than before."

A variety of the main deck and extra deck Evil Eye monsters gain particularly powerful effects (with some drawbacks) when equipped with Selene. The deck itself plays more of a control deck, using the Evil Eye monsters equipped with Selene to interrupt opponent's plays and deal with problem cards, while the monster equipped with the spell is increasingly difficult to deal with because of Selene's attack boosting effect and granted immunity. The deck itself can main a variety of backrow and tech choices like Super Polymerization, as well as a decent slew of consistency cards (Extravagance, etc.).  Currently the deck feels like ""Guru Control with extra steps"" but I like the extra deck monsters for the deck, as well as the art. So even if it is similar to my current main deck, I'd like to try to make the deck work.  As I have just recently picked up the deck, any suggestions and constructive criticism welcome! Side deck subject to change based on local meta game for the most part."

You want to go first though. Going first you just setup <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>, <a data-name=""Cybernetic Overflow"">Cybernetic Overflow</a> (which you search off <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a>), Dingirsu, <a data-name=""Orcust Crescendo"">Orcust Crescendo</a>, and/or <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a> which is almost unbreakable. Going second you can just break their board using <a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a>, and/or <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a>. I also put in a spicy side deck for going first. Like <a data-name=""Penalty Game"">Penalty Game</a>. This card destroys Sky Striker or any other Spell or Trap focused deck because they won't be able to play. I know a lot of people are playing I:P but I personally don't think it's necessary to win and I don't have the extra deck space. I don't really have much to explain about this deck, mostly everyone should know how to do full Orcust combo at this point since the deck has been around for so long. Anyways, I hope you guys enjoy the deck and stick around for more."

Starving venom is in the extra deck because we can easily bring it out with 2 rokkets, and it can win you the game alone.  Crusadia draco helps you put that 4th body on the field. If you are only able to bring out 3 rokkets, no problem! Link summon beat cop, pisty, and special summon Crusadia draco to the free zone that beat cop points to, then use it to summon elpy.  Remember that, in case you need it, you can revive borrelsword or borreload by fusion summoning borreload furious, then destroying it with his own effect, and banishing it from the graveyard."

Low level Igknights can be normal summoned which can be relevant because Red Layer / Renaud + any normal summon Igknight is a full combo (desperate hands). High attack Igknights are also valuable. <ul>  	<li>Igknight gimmick is searching Fire Warrior by popping 2 Igknights in scale. That allows you to search a Red layer which I am sure all know by now is a free warrior drop, they can search NEW card <a data-name=""Flame Noble Knight Renaud"">Flame Noble Knight Renaud</a> which can special summon himself if you control a fire warrior monster (Even got an extradeck target for that) ON top of that. Once Noble Knight Renaud is summoned you can add back an Equip (D.D.R) or Fire warrior from your graveyard.</li>  	<li>3X <a data-name=""Summoners art"">Summoners art</a> - This card is only more powerful in Qliphorts. Searches any scale there are 12 targets.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Painful Decision"">Painful Decision</a> - Maindeck space is a reason why I am not running 3 more so then HOPT clause. Searches low level Pendulums also fills your graveyard for Renaud add back. Amazing card</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Ignition Phoenix"">Ignition Phoenix</a> - This card is essentially a fieldspell version of Igknight a good card idk what else to say. I wish I could run a 70 card deck then I would be playing 3 and terraforming.</li>  	<li>1x ROTA - I mean. Igknights are warriors.. but you are mostly searching connector</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a> - loop dealer.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Neo Space Connector"">Neo Space Connector</a> - The best 1 card Isolde in a game. If he gets hit Rescue rabbit is a good replacement.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin"">Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</a> - This deck can loop Omega... add Dolphin to it and viola...</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Super Quantum Red Layer"">Super Quantum Red Layer</a> - Super searchable warrior drop if you control no monsters</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Flame Noble Knight Renaud"">Flame Noble Knight Renaud</a> - Super searchable warrior drop if you control a fire warrior + adds back equips / fire warriors on Special summon</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""God Phoenix Gearfried"">God Phoenix Gearfried</a> - Super searchable boss monster which can negate monster effects and also equip opponent monsters in the battlephase</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite"">Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite</a> - Bounce back that Ignition Phoenix, armageddon knight, D.D.R and loop some more. This is how you make Dugares.</li>  	<li>1x Destrudo - Easy Powertool essential for some hands. Also Quantum, Savage. Never Entered Dugares with him but you could maybe do that to.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a> - Discard that phoenix blade summon ferret....</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Rescue Ferret"">Rescue Ferret</a> - Ugh do whatever the fk you want in Yugioh.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Destiny hero Malicious"">Destiny hero Malicious</a> - well this deck loops Arma Knight. also if you ever Pend summon Malicious..... UGH thats broken</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Blackwing - Steam the Cloak"">Blackwing - Steam the Cloak</a> . This cards token producing effect is not HOPT, the most revived card after Armageddon knight</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Glow-Up bulb"">Glow-Up bulb</a> - just the best level 1 for the... Ferret requirement. If bulb gets hit jet synchron replaces that well</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Doppel warrior"">Doppel warrior</a> - just the best level 2 for the Ferret requirement. Its a warrior.. this is a warrior deck good overall.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a> - The Apex flying beast, the true alpha of infinite negates. You access this with Simorgh, Bird of Kings</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Mist Valley Thunderbird"">Mist Valley Thunderbird</a> - So Avian can bounce a mist valley to negate... this card SS itself to the field. You initially access this with Union Carrier</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""World Legacy World chalice"">World Legacy World chalice</a> - a brick... but this card can be pendulum summoned and then IB can revive from the graveyard when you link / synchro her off, so drawing this card is really not that bad. Also a really good disruption because the deck has 3 cards which offer battle protection for this 0 def &amp; atk monster.</li>  	<li>OVERALL THIS DECK WORKS QUITE WELL WITH COMBO PIECES BECAUSE YOUR STARTERS (PENDULUMS) CAN PENDULUM SUMMON THEM OUT</li>  	<li><a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a> - Just another way to bring back Arma / Steam. Searchable off IB.. Which you summon after Ferret does its thing</li>  	<li>7 Equips - Including Sword of Deep-Seated &amp; Moon Mirror shield which allow you not to run more Equips as they return themself to the deck making Isolde &amp; Powertool almost always live. Phoenix blade is the star as it enables Summoner Monk, D.D.R and whatnot. D.D.R is needed at 2-3 due to power tool (If you are running 2 you will have 33% chance to fail but Deep - Seated ll keep itself in a deck, so you ll be able to activate power tool, succeding is however important)</li> </ul> Extra deck (everything at 1 copy, wish I could run Isolde at 2 tho) <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> - For those chainable cards, those could stop Mist Valley infinite negate lock</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Psy-frame lord Omega"">Psy-frame lord Omega</a> - Doesn't take up field space, snipes kaijus &amp; Dark ruler no mores and whatnot. Loopable with D.D.R</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a> - You don't always have to make Avramax... this card can protect your monsters in battle to</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Power tool Dragon"">Power tool Dragon</a>- Search d.d.r</li>  	<li><a data-name=""IB the World chalice Miko"">IB the World chalice Miko</a> - she needs no introduction</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"">Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</a> - A r4nk which revives...... what could go wrong.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight  Crusadia Astram"">Mekk-Knight  Crusadia Astram</a> - Ahhh very good card, protects your loop in a battle. supper problematic to deal with</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Saryuja skull Dread"">Saryuja skull Dread</a> - Fixes your hand, summons from hand, enables rescue ferret with 3 zones. Essential</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Kings"">Simorgh, Bird of Kings</a> - At end phase this card gives you an Apex Avian</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> - I need some removal in the deck. Masquerena sinergy.</li>  	<li>Isolde - Milk goth mommy</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Mighty Flame Swordsman"">Mighty Flame Swordsman</a> - this card allows you to turn various cards into warrior. 3 cards as long as one is a warrior = Isolde. Also you can suicide this card and loop Armageddon Knight. Also a Fire warrior for Renaud</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a> - Soon to be on a banlist</li>  	<li><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> - Makes Avramax even more annoying with anti destruction slapped on.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Link Kuriboh"">Linkkuriboh</a> - it being dark is relevant, helps you enter Union carrier.

Generally, you want to normal summon red resonator and special summon armageddon knight to send destiny hero malicious to the grave, from here link summon cryston needlefiber, using its effect you want to generally special summon plaguespreader zombie or glow-up bulb depending on other tuners options available. From here utilise malicious and tuner effects to go into scarlight red dragon, hot RDA bane and hot RDA abyss.  Hot RDA abyss is the most important card to get out due to its effect of negating any card on the field for the turn, this is a quick effect. Hot RDA bane has good synergy via its tribute one monster to special summon another RDA from the grave effect, allowing you to further synchro summon. When Bane deals battle damage, it can special summon 2 same level tuners (1 from grave one from deck) and the best options here are red resonator from grave and plague-spreader from the deck. WHen red resonator is special summoned, you can gain life points equal to any monster's atk, Bane has 3500 atk. Following battle phase when these tuners have been special summoned, link summon Apollousa using the 2 tuners and cryston needlefiber to lock down the enemy. Summoning out vanity's fiend also locks the enemy down.  Resonator call is extremely useful in getting red resonators to start combos, or synchron resonators to turn your level 8 synchros into hot RDA Abyss and really control the game.  Lightsworn Wulf is a good addition to the deck as it can be sent to graveyard and special summoned out. If it is caught in the hand you can use plaguespreader zombie's effect to place it on top of deck and then use glow-up bulb for an easy special summon.  The psychics are useful to get into easy combos via emergency teleport and special summoning risebell can help get into a variety of synchro monsters.  Super polymerization clears troublesome dark monsters as most decks use dark monsters. Works very well when using just 2 of the opponents monsters and none of your own however the deck does have dark monsters for its own fusion materials if needed.  This deck is a lot of fun to use, hopefully you enjoy it.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Also I switched out artifact lancea for imperial iron wall for going first, but if wished, you can trade them back. Sorry for uploading multiple decks, I just got feedback on what to change. You can change what you want in this deck, but keep the cards at 43. Personally I think 43 cards is too much, you can take out crackdown if you want, and play Compulsory Evacuation Device instead of the two crackdowns, your choice. Both cards are staples and will not hurt the engine if taken out, but leave one of the two in. Control the board. If opponents deck has non-targetable high attack monsters, try bringing out Borrel Sword or moon mirror shield."

Here you can do 2 things: 1 summon crimson nova and boost his atack if he is too weak 2 summon link monsters to break the oponents board  The optimal play is to summon crimson nova on the board but this is not always possible.  He is very weak against spells and traps and if you are not carefull he's going to get removed from play. He is uneffected by monster effect with an ORIGINAL atack of 3000 or lower. So if your oponent his no set spels or traps summon him and atack for game. He can atack twice if the first atack destroys a monster and in the end fase burn 3000 damage. If you dont have enough atack power boost him with cubic wave or an cubic karma. This is the easiest play and the bread and butter of cubics.  Play number 2 is needed when your oponent has an out to crimson nova you usely do this when the opponent plays an control heavy deck or has a lot of traps set. You want to sent 1 unification of the cubic lord to the graveyard. you can do this with duza or an foolish burial goods. When you draw one use one of your knightmare link monsters to send 1 to the grave if needed. If unification is in the grave it can special summon a cubic monster from the deck or hand when a cubic monster LEAVES the field. Leaving the field happens when you tribute summon or link summon. So get 2 monsters on the field at least 1 cubic monster then link summon a generic link2 banish unification special summon duza and send 1 more unification to grave. Then link summon a link 3 monster activated unification in grave and repeat proces. (Unification is not a once per turn effect).  To play around traps play twin twisters and red reboot. Denko Sekka is also an option but this eats up your normal summon and you cant play there can only be one. This deck also really suffers from handtraps so if this is an problem side deck in called by the graves. Further speedburst dragon can do masive damage and that can easily be an otk but it hurts the consisticy.  &nbsp;

Getting out Zombie World is usually a top priority in most cases, it helps to set up the plays of many of your cards such as Doomking Balerdroch or Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon by making all cards on field and in grave zombie type. This type change is also one of the most powerful parts of the deck due to its counter potential. Decks reliant on their cards being of a certain type such as Thunder Dragon, Dino variants, Cyber Dragon are turned off. Link monster that require a certain type of monster such as Salamangreat Baleynx, Guardragons, or Xtra HERO Cross Crusader are unable to be summoned. True Draco decks are unable to summon monsters under zombie world due to not being able to tribute summon anything except zombie monsters.  The deck does have it's weaknesses, being ash blossomed to prevent grave yard set up or cards like D.D. Crow, Masked HERO Darklaw, or anything else that can banish your cards from grave or stop them from going to grave can stop a lot of plays. Decks like Orcust, Alterguist, and Pendulum as well often don't care about having their types changed making Zombie World not flood gate them.  So why play the deck? For Doomking. A card that can summon itself from grave during every standby phase, can negate any monster effect from field or grave, and has non targeting banishing removal of anything on the field or the grave. Once out he is your beat stick, you negation tool, your link fodder.  Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon can become a massive beat stick based on the number of cards on field or in grave that besides Doomking is very hard to out, and even comes with his own effect to steal your opponents monsters after destroying them by any mean.  The Utopia combo is easily usable with a quick use of Uni-Zombie and a draw of Danger Jackalope or Danger Noodle and can help to deal easy game winning damage.  With Zombie World and Dragonercro Nethersoul Dragon super poly can be the answer to any board there is.  &nbsp;"

The best bet for the deck is to bait out negations or things like Ash Blossom by using spells in hand you don't need at the moment (such as E - Emergency call if you already have Stratos). Being able to get out the Evil Hero plays allows for an easy board wipe as well as good damage due to Malicious Bane's effect.  Part of the side deck is for both match up and budget if you are buying the actual deck. Replacing the evil hero cards with an extra E call and Super Poly is good if the opponents monsters are immune to destruction effects.  &nbsp;

With the introduction of all the moving monsters and magical musketeers specifically, it seemed like it was right around the corner. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. I ended up splashing the mekk's in other decks and then my boy Shannon Long decided to go crazy and make it extremely popular. With that being said I did take a few notes from him, but I did not net deck him. I made a few significant deck changes, and just kept sorta the same style of play. So let me show you the things. Please leave comments if you liked it.  First I play 3 good normal summons. Avram is a searchable normal off of purple, and capshell is just used to be linked off. When he is he lets you draw a card. I decided to play this over ipiria because I feel like its harder to handtrap but only slightly.  I play the field spell at one because I do play 9 different mekk-knights. Most of the time though you use the other effects.  I swapped up the extra deck a bit. Since you don't play the whispers I play the titanic to stop a few spells from Going through. I play the exa beetle because he makes a free column. You probably won't make him often since the only level 6's are Green and the World Crown. Lastly, I play the one Kagari and the Hornet drones because the hornet drones is also a one card column.  The primary goal of the strategy is to set a bunch of mekk-knights on the field with a whispers down to prevent monster effects from going through. Morning star can search secret if you discard another world legacy or mekk-knight monster. Purple can search the indigo for you, and you can special him without a column if you use memory. Its a very fun counter and OTK strategy."

People seem to not realize that mathmech have 0 Turn 1 plays a,"A note to those who want to play this deck, avoid playing a bunch of the cards you typically see in mathmech decks (like the spells, traps, &amp; XYZs). Mathmech have 0 Go First plays and you need to maximize your ability to OTK.  &nbsp;  Make use of Phantazmay to shape up your hand and give yourself a body. Use Pankratops as spot removal to pop anything like There Can Only Be One which is a huge hinderance to this whole strategy. Gameceil is a necessity for this OTK because it makes sure that you won't have to endure annoying monster reliant infernity barriers or annoying quick effect monsters. Hey, Trunade! Gets rid of all the set cards or forces out Judgement. Called by the grave handles the Ash Blossom that can cripple the entire OTK combo. Don't worry about Nibiru, making 6k Final Sigma that can attack twice can be made by 4 summons so you should never be Nibiru'd.  &nbsp;  You want to Normal Summon Nabla (this NEEDS to be your Normal summon) and use Sigma, Addition, or Subtraction as a free body to use as tribute fodder for Nabla. Nabla will special Multiplication from deck where it can then target itself or Nabla. Synchro into Final Sigma and now you can make Final Sigma 6k and attack twice (If your opponent has Called by the Grave they can stop Multiplication). You can then OTK and there's nothing your opponent can do to stop it. Hydrate yourself on their salty tears :)"

If anything goes wrong then just use the link predaplant or super poly on your opponent.  &nbsp;  This whole deck relies on your opponent using a dark type deck. Also super poly bypasses most card negates and predaplants are easily summoned.  &nbsp;  Speedroids are there to quick summon Clearwing, Crystalwing or any of the Speedroids as stall cards for your fusion, so your not stuck waiting for super poly.  &nbsp;  *Note* Forgot to remove beast king jackal.
