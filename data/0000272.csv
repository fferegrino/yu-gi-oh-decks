Bardiche is also here and using the Phantom Knight engine really makes everything more consistent but this deck is still casual level and having trouble competing against tier 0 stuff.

Inclui novos Dragões de alto nível que banem cartas do oponente quando Invocados e ganham mais Pontos de Ataque para cada carta que eles banem. Também estão incluídos novos monstros devotos dos Dragões – guerreiros de baixo nível fáceis de invocar que ajudam a colocar seus Dragões de alto nível em jogo rapidamente.

&nbsp;

Basic combo is as follows:
1) Summon needlefiber using diva, junk converter, unknown synchron + normal summon, goblindbergh, etc.

2) Search plaguespreader zombie with needlefiber

3) Link summon decode talker

4) Plaguespreader effect from grave to special summon

5) Accesscode talker

6) Set traps if applicable and pass

The combo is easy enough for a newbie to pick up imo and ends on a link 4 which I think is satisfying enough. You could use a different link 4 here, and you could also edit the combo a little bit to include some synchro summoning if you wanted.

p.s. auroradon and deskbot are in the side deck in case my boy is feeling particularly adventurous one day :)"

It's probably not the best deck and could use some work but this is so far better than my first draft. I feel I need to replace Dance Princess but since I can't bring myself to doing so she shall remain for now.  If you wanted to go for a more stall deck, running Dai Sojo and Secret Guards is a great idea with Defender. It also wouldn't allow me to add Maxx ""C"" to the side deck so that's what's currently missing. Glad my Ice Barriers got some love at some point after I stopped playing and I can now potentially make my IRL deck better, if I get back into playing! I don't know link monsters well enough yet to know what can be used but there is room to shorten your Extra deck, I'd suggest keeping 2 Gungnir though since he is the easiest to summon, with the best effect."

The <strong>core idea</strong> of the deck is to summon some good troublemakers as <em>Fossil Dyna</em> and/or <em>Rai-Oh</em> whose effects will start blocking the opponent's moves. You want to do everything you can to defend the one which stops your opponent as much as possible and you have plenty of choices to do so.

The <em>Doomcaliber</em> is quite predictable, but a nice attacking monster which also creates some troubles. Also the <em>Grand Mole</em> is useful to push back the Synchros from where they come from. The <em>Veiler</em> is for emergencies and the <em>Banisher of the Radiance</em> is good if the opponent uses the graveyard (which is quite common)

Cards will go away very quickly from your hand and field since you will activate lots of traps and spells, that's why we have the <em>Morphing Jar </em>for a quick reload (might as well disrupt the opponent's plans) and the <em>Pots of Duality</em> do no interfere with our plans since we do not special summon a lot.

The <strong>extra deck</strong> is not relevant to our purposes except for what we could summon in the very rare occasion we use the <em>Veiler</em> as a tuner or when we activate the <em>Starlight Road</em>.

In the <strong>side deck</strong> we can keep cards based on the meta, but a strong suggestion is <a data-name=""King Tiger Wanghu"">King Tiger Wanghu</a>, which might literally ruin the day of an opponent and could easily be swapped in instead of the Banishers or any of the monsters we play according to the deck we are facing.

<em>Please feel free to explore my uploaded decks to find the evolution of my favourite one through the years in a way that reflects a little the story of the game itself! Leave your comments and like if I brought you back some sweet memories!</em>"

Control the board, then OTK! Expecting your opponent to f","An updated, more competitive version of my Charmer Control deck I previously featured back in February. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/charming-control-2022/"">For a more detailed explanation of this deck, click here.</a> This decklist is just so I can do test-hands on my phone so I can practice for locals.

The idea is to go first, control the board, then OTK. OTKs are easily enabled by ""Awakening of the Possessed"" boosting up your monster's attack to ridiculous levels for each attribute on your field. The Adventurer and Dogmatika Engine provide free special summons/attributes for the OTK, as well as interactions that hinder your opponent. Lord of the Heavenly Prison also greatly enhances the deck, since it is a massive free body on board, and searches out any of your important spells like Rite of Aramesia, Spirit Charmers, or Nadir's Servant. Ice Dragon's Prison and Crackdown are the normal traps of choice for this deck, since they eviscerate current meta decks and also provide link material so you can link your opponent's monster away for your Extra Deck charmers.

When you're expecting your opponent to force you to go second, you side in the Kaijus and going second cards by replacing the trap cards + Lord of the Heavenly Prison. Kaijus pick apart your opponent's board then the Kaijus are bounced back to your hand by Luna and Dracoback.

This deck has surprisingly won me many games online in Yugioh OMEGA and Masterduel vs. competitive decks as they are usually caught off guard by it. This deck is also very consistent and can shrug off many of the negates/interaction present in Yugioh nowadays, since it's a backrow control/beatdown deck. However, this deck relies on you to win the die roll and predict your opponent to force you to go second. If that happens you usually win with these charming spellcasters!

Enjoy and GLHF Duelists!"

Junk synchron+ one of the fodders (caligo, junk converter, etc) to speeder, then go into librarian, then celestial, then scarred, summon quasar, it should be enough, if you get interrupted try to go into junk warrior and then satellite if you're going second

It has about the consistency of an Exodia deck and is bound to confuse your opponent. This deck can probably play through an ash blossom maybe two and if your royal magical library is negated by impermanence or effect vailer it isn't the end of the world. The strat is this you want to draw out of your deck four level four special summons (this can include royal magical library) Xyz summon an Angle of Misceif and a Zoodiac with 2 of your monsters.

Surely it's a ""Lightsworn"" and ""Chaos"" Deck, but those are just the engines used to turbo out Scythe Lock.

As someone who dislikes and wishes that Scythe is banned forever and ever because of how annoying and toxic it is, I'm very ashamed to say that I got to Plat 1 this season with 9 winstreaks using Scythe Lock Turbo. Probably my most successful Deck so far, even beating my Adamancipator Deck. And all it takes is just ONE. BAD. DAY. I was playing Dragon Link a while ago (because I have like 80% of the cards), and drop from Plat 2 to Plat 4 in just an hour or so. So I just decided to ruin people day with Scythe Lock the next day, and I got to Plat 1 along the way.

There are multiple variants of Scythe Lock Turbo, and I chose Chaos Danger! Lightsworn because it's my favorite Deck. And now I have tainted it...
<h1>Objective</h1>
This is a Combo Deck, but I'm not gonna show a 1-2 card Combo because the Combo varies and have many different lines. However, all of the Combo really are trying to accomplish one thing: Scythe Locking your opponent.

Ok, I haven't explained what a ""Scythe Lock"" is. For people who lived under a rock and never heard of it, Scythe Lock is basically a floodgate caused by the effect of <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>. If Artifact Scythe is popped during your opponent's turn, it will Special itself from GY and if it's Special Summoned during your opponent's turn, your opponent cannot use their Extra Deck for the rest of the turn, and this is a Lingering effect, meaning that after it resolves, it can no longer be negated. So basically Dimensional Barrier but stronger. Scythe Lock was never been consistent in the past, that is until <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> and <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a> came into the game (They happened to came out from the same Set. Oh Konami, maybe you planned this?) Crystron Halqifibrax can banish itself to Synchro into <a data-name=""T.G. Wonder Magician"">T.G. Wonder Magician</a> (yes this is treated as a Synchro Summon) whose on Summon can pop 1 Spell/Trap (in this case pop your own Scythe). Artifact Dagda can Set an Artifact directly from your Deck when a card or effect on the field is activated. And after that, you can Quick Synchro Scythe and Wonder Magician into Baronne. And boi, those two Link Monsters are SO GENERIC. And it got way worse when DPE came out. Literally any 4 monsters = Scythe Lock while also giving you a broken Boss Monster that pop things and come back every single turn.

Ok now let's actually go into the Deck's objective:
<h3>Starter</h3>
You will start your play with either <a data-name=""Charge of the Light Brigade"">Charge of the Light Brigade</a> or <a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a> into Psi-Reflector. Psi-Reflector is a 1 card Halqifibrax/<a data-name=""Chaos Ruler"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a>. Psi-Reflector can search <a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a> on Summon and Assault Beast can discard itself to search <a data-name=""Assault Mode Activate"">Assault Mode Activate</a>. Psi-Reflector can then reveal the Assault Mode Activate to Summon Assault Beast from GY and increases Assault Beast's Level by 1-4.

Charge of Light Brigade can mill 3 cards as <strong>COST</strong> and search <a data-name=""Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn"">Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn</a>. Raiden can mill 2 cards for free (and bait a handtrap if your opponent isn't smart) and just happened to be a Level 4 Tuner, which is an important factor. Then you can Summon a Level 4 monster, either through Raiden's mill (<a data-name=""Wulf, Lightsworn Beast"">Wulf, Lightsworn Beast</a> or <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>) or from your hand (<a data-name=""Danger! Mothman"">Danger! Mothman</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Danger! Mothman&quot;&gt;Danger! Mothman&lt;/a&gt;!"">!</a>/<a data-name=""Danger! Chupacabra"">Danger! Chupacabra!</a>, <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverbuster"">White Dragon Wyverbuster</a>/<a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>, or <a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a>). Black/White Dragon can be searched through <a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>. With those 2 monsters, you can then Synchro into Chaos Ruler which can excavate 5 cards, add 1 LIGHT or DARK monster from it, and send the rest to the GY. You can easily chain block Chaos Ruler with Black/White Dragon to avoid getting ashed.

There's also an alternative line where you have neither Charge/Raiden or E-Tele/Psi-Reflector. In this case, you can just spam DARK monsters in order to Link into <a data-name=""Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion"">Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion</a>. This is easily achievable thanks to the Danger! archetype. All the Danger! used in this Deck has different Types while also being DARK. This is enough to fulfill Curious's materials. Not only that, these Danger! also happened to have different Types with your other DARK monsters (Dragon, Zombie, Psychic).
<h3>Goal</h3>
Chaos Ruler was just an Extender to get a ton of card advantages before actually setting up your Scythe Lock. All you have to do to set up the Scythe Lock is Link into Halqifibrax using any resources you have and Summon <a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a> from Deck, then you can Link Jet Synchron into <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> and Jet Synchron can revive itself from GY so you can make Dagda. You don't need to Trigger Dagda on your own turn as it will Trigger from Halqifibrax 2nd Effect on your opponent's turn. Additionally, if you have Chaos Ruler on the field already, instead of Linking into Linkuriboh, you can Synchro Jet Synchron and Chaos Ruler into <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a>. Then you can revive Chaos Ruler and Jet Synchron with their own respective Effects to make Dagda.
<h3>Extra Objective</h3>
This part is optional and only happens when you're lucky enough to have the resources to do so.

If you happen to have <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>, you can make <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a> with it and Chaos Ruler. It can protect your monsters from battle (once) while also being a Spell Negate. Curious can then used to make 2 material <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>. It's not much, but it can at least protect you from Nibiru. You can easily caught your opponent off guard on this 6th Summon because your opponent probably won't Nibiru 2 monsters, including Curious (which can add <strong>ANY</strong> card from GY if it gets Nibiru'd).

If you have some Extra Level 4 monsters, you can make <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>. Dweller can completely prevents your opponent from activating GY Effects for an entire turn (or 2 turns even, since it has 2 materials), and this is yet another Lingering Effect just like Scythe. Dweller might win you games on its own against certain matchups like Drytron or Tri-Brigade who relies on GY Effect to make plays. Dweller is also a go-to card to make when you get Maxx ""C""-ed and don't want to give your opponent too many advantages while also making a decent board to not die.

After Dagda does its job and Set Scythe, you can use it as Link Fodder for Apollousa.
<h1>Deck Breakdown</h1>
<h3>Main Deck</h3>
<p>3x <a data-name=""Charge of the Light Brigade"">Charge of the Light Brigade</a>; 3x <a data-name=""Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn"">Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Wulf, Lightsworn Beast"">Wulf, Lightsworn Beast</a></p>
<p>This is the Lightsworn Engine. This is not exactly a Lightsworn Deck, that's why I only play 3 different Main Deck Lightsworn cards. So basically, the way the Engine works is very simple. <strong>Charge of Light Brigade</strong> mill 3 cards and search a Lightsworn. The mill is a cost and the actual Effect is the search, so if it got negated (by <strong>Ash</strong> or something), you still mill 3 cards regardless. Then you can Normal Summon <strong>Raiden</strong> (searched by <strong>Charge</strong>) which can mill 2 cards which is funny because a lot of people decided to Ash, Veiler, or Imperm it despite having such a mediocre Effect. <strong>Raiden</strong> is also a Tuner, so its perfect for <strong>Chaos Ruler</strong> and <strong>Halqifibrax</strong>. Lastly we have <strong>Wulf</strong>, a Level 4 monster that Special itself when sent from Deck to the GY. Its a dead card if you draw it, otherwise Free Summon. I only play 2 copies because I cut the 3rd one for <strong>Trick Clown</strong> which is basically <strong>Wulf</strong>, but Special itself when sent to the GY regardless from where (<strong>Wulf</strong> isn't once per turn though).</p>
<p>3x <a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a>; 1x <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverbuster"">White Dragon Wyverbuster</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a></p>
<p>This is the Chaos part of the Deck. Not too many Chaos monsters, but I picked the best ones out there. <strong>Chaos Space</strong> search any LIGHT or DARK Level 4-8 monster that cannot be Normal Summoned/Set by sending a monster with the opposite Attribute from hand to GY. This pretty much searches all your Chaos monsters. It also has a neat GY Effect to recycle your banished LIGHT or DARK monster that cannot be Normal Summoned/Set to the bottom of your Deck and draw 1. Your best target for <strong>Chaos Space</strong> is <strong>Black/White Dragon</strong>. But if you already have them or milled them, you can search <strong>Levianeer</strong> (DARK) or <strong>Valkyria</strong> (LIGHT) instead.</p>
<p><strong>Levianeer</strong> is pretty much the best Extender you can ever ask for. Easy to Summon, great Effects with great versatility. You can either shuffle 1 card from your opponent's hand into the Deck or Special ANY monster from GY in Defense, or even pop 2 cards without targeting if you go 2nd. <strong>Seyfert</strong> can banish itself from GY to add back <strong>Levianeer</strong> from GY and Levianeer inherent Summon is not once per turn. I only play 2 copies of <strong>Levianeer</strong> though, because I don't want to see it in my opening hand without any GY setup.</p>
<p><strong>Black/White Dragon</strong> is a Free Summon from hand and searches each other when sent from the field to the GY. Since you will be searching them with <strong>Chaos Space</strong> 90% of the time, you can actually use <strong>Chaos Space</strong> 2nd Effect to recycle your banished <strong>Black/White Dragon</strong> so you can get 2 searches instead of 1. <strong>Chaos Valkyria</strong> serves the same purpose, except she doesn't replace herself with another monster like <strong>Black/White Dragon</strong> does. But since all of their Special Summon Effect are once per turn, its better to play <strong>Chaos Valkyria</strong> than a 2nd Copy of the dragons. Also, <strong>Chaos Valkyria</strong> can send ANY LIGHT or DARK monster from Deck to GY when banished. Although, just like <strong>Shooting Riser Dragon</strong>, you can't use their Effects this turn. Best target for this is <strong>Snow</strong>. If you already milled <strong>Snow</strong>, <strong>Seyfert</strong> and <strong>Levianeer</strong> is the best target for follow-up.</p>
<p>3x <a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Assault Mode Activate"">Assault Mode Activate</a></p>
<p>This is the <strong>Psi-Reflector</strong> Engine. As I mentioned earlier, <strong>Psi-Reflector</strong> can search up <strong>Assault Beast</strong> on Summon and <strong>Assault Beast</strong> can search <strong>Assault Mode Activate</strong> by discarding itself. Then, <strong>Psi-Reflector</strong> can reveal <strong>Assault Mode Activate</strong> to Summon <strong>Assault Beast</strong> from GY, modifying its Level to 5-8 allowing you to Synchro into a Level 6-9 Synchro. And guess what? <strong>Psi-Reflector</strong> just happened to be a Psychic, meaning that <strong>E-Tele</strong> can Special it from Deck. So you can go into <strong>Chaos Ruler</strong> without your Normal Summon. If you milled <strong>Assault Beast</strong>, that's no problem because <strong>Psi-Reflector</strong> can also search <strong>Assault Mode Activate</strong> itself. But if you milled<strong> Assault Mode Activate</strong>, your engine is dead.</p>
<p>3x <a data-name=""Danger! Nessie!"">Danger! Nessie!</a>; 3x <a data-name=""Danger! Mothman!"">Danger! Mothman!</a>; 3x <a data-name=""Danger! Chupacabra!"">Danger! Chupacabra!</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Danger!? Jackalope?"">Danger!? Jackalope?</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Danger!? Tsuchinoko?"">Danger!? Tsuchinoko?</a></p>
<p>The Danger! archetype just happened to synergize very well with Lightsworn, because if you draw a garnet, you can use the Danger! in order to put them to the GY while going pluses. Being able to freely Summon themselves while discarding a card at random, then draw 1. When they discard themself, they have some good Effects too. They also happened to have different Types, so you can go into <strong>Curious</strong> easier than ever.</p>
<p>You want to prioritize <strong>Mothman</strong> and <strong>Chupacabra</strong> because they're Level 4 and try avoiding using a Danger! that you have 2 ofs in your hand, because the chances of discarding themselves are doubled (unless you want their discarded Effect).</p>
<p>2x <a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon Frisson</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a></p>
<p>These are the Tuners that can Special Themselves from GY. <strong>Destrudo</strong> pretty much Special almost for Free by paying half your LP, <strong>Plague</strong> by returning a card from hand to topdeck, and <strong>Jet</strong> by sending a card from hand to GY. <strong>Destrudo</strong> and <strong>Jet</strong> are once per turn while <strong>Plague</strong> isn't. <strong>Jet</strong> will be your main target for Halqifibrax, and if you already milled <strong>Jet</strong>, Summon <strong>Plague</strong> instead. You can make <strong>Destrudo</strong> Level 4 by targeting <strong>Jackalope</strong> or <strong>Tsuchinoko</strong>. I only play 1 <strong>Jet</strong> because it's searchable with <strong>Halqifibrax</strong> and only once per turn.</p>
<p>1x <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Fairy Tail - Snow"">Fairy Tail - Snow</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a></p>
<p>I already explained everything with <strong>Scythe</strong> so I'm gonna skip it. <strong>Foolish Burial</strong> is just a good card to play in a GY Deck, you shouldn't use the card immediately, Set it first and use it last to send an Important combo piece that you're missing. <strong>Trick Clown</strong> is basically <strong>Wulf</strong> but better. <strong>Snow</strong> is an amazing card that serves as both an Extender and a disruption, just don't overuse its GY Effect since we don't play <strong>Grass</strong>. <strong>Gokipole</strong> is a Free +1, it's basically <strong>Shaddoll Beast</strong> but better because it searches <strong>Mothman</strong> when sent to the GY.</p>
<p>3x <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>; 3x <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>; 3x <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a>; 2x <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a>; 1x <a data-name=""PSY-Frame Driver"">PSY-Frame Driver</a></p>
<p>These are your handtraps. Not much I can say about them, except for the fact that <strong>Gamma</strong> is a +2. When you <strong>Charge</strong>, <strong>Chaos Space</strong>, or <strong>E-Tele</strong> and got <strong>Ash</strong>-ed or <strong>Maxx ""C""</strong>-ed on your Danger! Just Click <strong>Gamma</strong> and boom, your opponent loses a card for no reason and you just got 2 monsters for Free (1 from hand, 1 from Deck), and <strong>Gamma</strong> just happened to be a Tuner and their combined Levels are 8, which is <strong>Chaos Ruler</strong>. There's a reason why <strong>Gamma</strong> is at 2 (at 1 in OCG right now) while other handtraps are unlimited, even though you must play a garnet (<strong>Driver</strong>) for <strong>Gamma</strong>.</p>
&nbsp;
<h3>Extra Deck</h3>
1x <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a>: That one generic Level 10 Synchro that Negates things. You don't usually Synchro into Baronne on your own turn, except for going 2nd. That's because you can just do it during your opponent's turn with Wonder Magician and Scythe. Baronne also have a once per turn pop for some reason. And the 3rd Effect does come up, if you accidentally milled Scythe, don't worry because Baronne can bring Scythe back on Standby Phase (Scythe doesn't need to be popped to Lock your opponent, just Special Summoned).

1x <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a>: Since you're playing Chaos Ruler and Jet Synchron, why not make this guy? This guy has a unique Negation Effect because it targets. Since you're summoning Baronne on your opponent's turn, Abyss is the Omni-Negate that you want to Summon on your own turn. Sadly it can't Negate hand and/or GY effects (can't be chain blocked though). It has a 2nd Effect, to revive a Tuner from GY when it inflicts damage.

1x <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a>: Very balanced card I guess, mill 4 add 1. AND it revives itself from GY with some little cost that is by banishing 1 LIGHT and 1 DARK from hand or GY. Also, mandatory for Abyss's Synchro material.

1x <a data-name=""T.G. Wonder Magician"">T.G. Wonder Magician</a>: Halqifibrax target, can pop Scythe, and Quick Synchro into Baronne.

1x <a data-name=""Number 38"">Number 38</a>: I'm not saying its full name because that would be 2 colons (:) which is confusing to read. Anyway, good card because it can protect your monsters from battle once per turn by directing the attack into itself. If your opponent doesn't read, good for you. Also it can Negate Spell once per turn. You need to use Levianeer to Summon it because there's no other Level 8 monster in the Deck (Omega is Level 8 but I'm not wasting that for Xyz).

1x <a data-name=""Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn</a> (previously <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Omega"">PSY-Framelord Omega</a>): Ok, I didn't take into consideration about going 2nd, that's why I thought Minerva wasn't that good since I'm only playing 5 Lightsworn Main Deck monsters and thought, why not just go Dweller if you have the materials? Turns out Minerva is very good at baiting negation. If your opponent let your Minerva resolves, you have the ""potential"" to draw 3 cards. Even if they Negate and destroy it, they have to Negate the GY Effect too, or they ""might"" lose 1-3 cards for no reason. Omega is the one I replaced, because it was the least useful EX monster.

1x <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>: Literally the best Rank 4 I can think of. Forget Minerva and Dugares, if you have 2 Level 4s, just make Dweller. Can win you games on its own against certain matchup as it disables your opponent GY Effect for potentially 2 full turns.

1x <a data-name=""Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion"">Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion</a>: Foolish Burial + 3 mills. Actually its not just Foolish Burial because it can send Spell/Trap too. You will most likely mill Plague, or Destrudo, or maybe Snow. Also, it floats into adding any card from GY to hand.

1x <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>: The big boy himself, as long as you can spam monsters, Accesscode will always be in your EX.

1x <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>: It's mandatory at this point to play Unicorn if you play Accesscode, there's no other good generic Link-3.

1x <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>: I'm genuinely too lazy to write anything about this card.

1x <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a>: Set Scythe from Deck, that's it. Wait, it has a 2nd Effect? No one told me that!

1x <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>: <span>Ok, how many times do I have to talk about this card? Hopefully next Combo Deck won't play Halq so I can finally stop explaining the same Effect over and over again. So basically, Halq Summon a Level 3 or lower Tuner from Deck, ""but it cannot activate its effects this turn"" and still get abused anyway. It can also Summon a Tuner Synchro from Extra for some reason. If 1 broken Effect is not enough, why not give it another?</span>

1x <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>: You need Linkuriboh to convert Jet Synchron into 2 monsters for Dagda. It doesn't happen very often in this Deck, but still happen occasionally

1x <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>: Just a monster Negate that you can Summon if you have too many extra monsters that you don't need

(I'm just gonna leave Halq blank like that, don't ask why)
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
First and most importantly, is the Deck consistent? Surely you're playing plenty of garnets, but I gotta say, this Deck is very consistent. All you need is just 2 monsters, including a Tuner and you have Full Combo. And to answer the reason why I don't play Grass, that's because there's not that many GY Effects really in this Deck, so Grass is not really needed.

This Deck can play through multiple handtraps due to the number of Extenders it has, the choke point is pretty much Chaos Ruler or Halqifibrax. Unfortunately, this variant of CDL cannot play through Nibiru as good as the other variants can, because you don't turbo out Baronne like usual.

For handtraps, we have 11 handtraps which is around 60% chance to open 1 of them on your opening hand. Can this Deck play through Maxx ""C""? Bro. Just. Draw. The. Gamma. Jokes aside, yes you can play through Maxx ""C"". It definitely can't Deck them out, but just Scythe Lock your opponent and their 20+ cards means nothing (If they draw an equalizer or Called By, you're screwed). Just Dweller pass them if you got Maxx ""C""-ed.

I don't play Called By because I don't have the space for it. Looks like 60-card is just not enough because there's just too many good cards to play. I can't just replace handtraps for it because I'm telling you, you're gonna need those handtraps going 2nd.

The weakness of the Deck is... It loses to Control Deck. There's nothing you can do about it, unless you want to play Lightning Storm/Twin Twister which is sure, go ahead. But Combo/Midrange Decks are just more common in the Ladder compared to Control. Also, playing both Danger! and hantraps SUCKS. Sometimes you just have to sacrifice your handtrap for extending and there's nothing that you can do about it.

If you have any question about the Deck, or any suggestion to make, feel free to tell me in the comments, I'll try answering them as much as possible.

As someone who hates Scythe Lock with PASSION, I have learned something important from this Deck: <em>""If you can't beat them, join them :)""</em>

(This is the non-optimized Decklist that I used that got me to Plat 1)

I am just using cards I think are underrated in the deck and are actually way better than they seem.

Don't mind me and my casual deck, but some well reasoned tech options/niche play suggestions would be cool. Leaning more towards banishing and recycle plays with the Pot of Acquisitiveness and Nemeses Engine. I don't have IRL access to Pot of Prosperity because I have no luck in opening packs and 1 copy costing $100 is nuts (also I hate giving up access to flexibility options in my Extra Deck).

Like I said, any other tech suggestions geared toward the banishing mechanic would be appreciated

Also, if you wanted to summon shenshen, it has to be the last summon, otherwise you would banish Auroradon that can be used later for Accesscode pops or Borreload. The reason why im not using <a data-name=""Coltwing"">Coltwing</a> is because it is not only another brick but also raises the chance of milling a key card with Chaos Ruler (that last part also applies to 001, so i might add more xyz's as a plan b).

P.u.n.k Therion, to me, is the best therion variant.

&nbsp;

This deck has the ability to defeat Eldlich, Fallen of Albaz, Dark Magician, Blue-eyes White Dragon, synchron, one turn kill exodia ( but you have to play first ),and many other decks. just use it well
my fav combo : if you have lilith and darkest diabolos in your hand you can summon lilith and let it tribute herself to set a virus and special summon diabolos and activate the virus by tributing diabolos in your opponent's turn

when you use lair of darkness you automatically turn all monsters to DARK monsters which is very useful for super polymerization ( which is also cannot be negated )

you can easily tribute monsters which are annoying like : ( All monsters that cannot be destroyed ), ( all monsters that negate effects )"

Epigonen, the Impersonation Invader is still part of the deck given the sheer power of the card in ABC.

While you're looking to end on Therions' ""King"" Regulus, Predaplant Verte Anaconda, DESTINY Hero - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, ABC Dragon Buster, and I:P Masquerena - be sure to destroy Verte with DPE before reviving DPE during the standby phase so that you have enough monster zones to utilize Dragon Buster's tag out effect. Nevertheless, you'll have four forms of disruption with Masquerena leading into the summon of an Appolousa with four negates or Underworld Goddess of the Closed World, which can be summoned with an opponent's monster, when paired with the pieces summoned through Dragon Buster's ability to tag out.

If you open optimally, you can also end, if you so  wish, on Regulus, Verte, DPE, Dragon Buster, and an Appolousa with three negates and with an immunity to destruction effects via Masquerena's effect. You'll still want to clear Verte from the field for the aforementioned reason. I wish I didn't have to remove the PSY-Frame engine from the main deck but it's still present in the side.

I've updated the deck to utilize Artifact Dagda and Artifact Scythe. Whether you choose to rely on the Scythe lock, potentially to the detriment of bearing additional forms of disruption, is up to your preference and the matchup at hand. Although, if you open optimally, you can end on I:P + Verte + Regulus + ABC Dragon Buster (+ Dagda?) with a set Artifact Scythe. Whether Dagda is to be used as material for Verte or be left on the field is dependent on your opening but be sure to ensure there is enough space for Dragon Buster to tag out by destroying Verte and Dagda if necessary via DPE's effect on your own turn. All in all, it is rather easy to set up the DPE and Scythe combo, with there being paths to which enable the combo depending on your opening, in this build for the sake of abusing the Scythe lock."

(Looking at your Dragonmaids)- well then, Gladiator Beasts may be the deck for you","Maybe I've been enjoying too much Edison lately, but man does this deck feel great to play- when you can play it. They're back from their 2010s glory with a fresh coat of ""wait, Andal's actually bad"" paint and a theme park sheen that'll probably convince opponents that this thing's actually pretty competitive. The spell and trap line-up should definitely change with each iteration of the format and any future releases; however, the core that's presented here is probably long-standing enough to supplement future variants. Let's get into the list.

<strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Safety Nets</span>: The sheer amount of disruption and answer cards we're running in this list make it so that our plays are usually insulated in some way. We should never, ever really be in any remote danger during a game as long as we have a Gladiator Beast and a backline to back them up.</li>
 	<li><span>Amazement Engine</span>: This engine isn't the best, but it's definitely non-intrusive and cycles through enough psuedo-disruption and removal that's relevant enough to run parallel to our gameplan here. Honestly, this archetype goes hand-in-hand with Gladiator Beasts as a whole. Just mind your normal summon.</li>
 	<li><span>No Andal!</span>: Rescue Rabbit openers and lines are great for getting into Panther or Dragases or setting up a three material fusion but boy did it suck drawing into that card and not having it be able to tag out like the others. Well, there's none of that anymore. We've compromised the Andal combos and random chance of drawing into Rescue Rabbit before it in the interest of having more playable hands overall. Just protect your guy(s) and run over the opponents. There's no need for any fancy business.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><span>They're all Garnets. All of them</span>: Opening a Gladiator Beast will probably have you saying ""man, I wish this one stayed in the deck or was another Gladiator Beast."" That's basically this deck's entire experience and why we're only playing the ones that matter. Sadly, that little dilemma will always remain in this deck and there isn't much to be done about it outside of Contact Fusing or bringing out Augustus. It feels even worse that a Trinity is being spent on Proving Ground just to increase the odds of finding a Glad, especially in a pinch. Pick a Glad and pray.</li>
 	<li><span>Extra Deck</span>:  The Extra Deck will usually be useless sometimes if you find yourself in a situation where you need to break down a board before you start committing to anything flashy. It's for this reason that we're not on any Extra Deck Trinities here and I'd personally advise against it. Fortunately, this does also mean that we're pretty insulated against cards like Titanocider which is pretty popular this format.</li>
 	<li><span>Forehead Girl is an FTK</span>: Ash solos. Godspeed.</li>
</ul>
Now with that out of the way, let's get into some of the demo setups you'll be wanting to aim for.

<hr />

<strong>OPENERS</strong>

This list isn't about finding gas, it's about opening defenses and protecting your Gladiator. You'll ideally be wanting to always go first. If you're going with no backup, I'd strongly encourage just combat tricking out the opponent. There isn't any specific opener you'll want to look for since Gladiator Beasts take on a midrange playstyle here (without Andal anyway), so your opening hands determine your line of play. Here's a few pointers though if you're inexperienced with them or the Amazement engine:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Phalanx: </strong>Control a Gladiator Beast and protect them with backrow. If there's something you can use to either change a monster's battle position to make them vulnerable on your turn or modify combat stats so your monster will survive the attack, that's ideal.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Blender:</strong> The Amazement engine does well to shake up the usual flow of some games. If you happen upon a Ticket and you're not sure what to do with it entirely, going for Comica and setting Horror House is perfectly fine. If you know you'll be able to beat the monster you book, then you can resolve it on the opponent's monster. If you're confident you can get a lot more mileage out of Comica, use Horror House during the Draw Phase and equip it directly to her. This will enable her to act as a monster negate or book of moon on the dime. I recommend trying to be greedy with Comica when possible, especially if you have back row to back her up. Cashing in for the set effect from Horror House is great too, but the monster effect negation is basically infinite for as long as you can maintain it. Grabbing Coaster or Arlekino are fine as well. Arlekino should primarily be used as a means of removal more than just being a body. You don't really need those in this deck.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ob-Noxious:</strong> If you've opened Noxious and backrow, feel free to set those cards and outright pass. Usually people will just attack you outright, so you punish with Noxious. Bin either something you want to bring back with Darius (who Noxious will tag out into after) or bin something you don't want to draw, like Augustus. Tag as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
The openers aren't always ideal and will vary from game-to-game, especially post-siding. The main thing to do is plan ahead. Measure your options and weigh your forms of interaction well. Everything in your deck is an extremely limited resource and this deck lacks card draw.

<strong>MIDGAME
</strong>

This is where Gladiator Beasts shine really. You'll be doing your best Unchained-meets-Dragonmaid impression here... despite preceding both of those archetypes. Hmm.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Bestiari: </strong>Your Spell/Trap removal. This card's also really important for making Gyzarus who is your Icarus Attack on-summon. S/T hate's pretty restricted across the board in Trinity format and most decks only rely on generics to get it done. Since Glad Beasts tag out often, you have this form of removal going for you on top of the generic removal you're already running here. It's worth noting that this card's effect to destroy is mandatory, so don't summon it willy-nilly otherwise you might end up having to pop your own backline.</li>
 	<li><strong>Murmillo: </strong>Your Monster removal. This card's your go-to for checking the board and clearing potential threats. Its combat stats leave much to be desired, but it doesn't have to partake in combat if it's already won now has it? Use it for fusion material when you can, or take an open attack. Don't get greedy with the fish.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Tag Team: </strong>Gladiator Beast War Chariot's an amazing Counter Trap and since most win conditions in Trinity format revolve around Monster effects, having access to this is nothing to scoff at. Samnite grabs this for you and Equeste loops this for you. Loop these two as necessary to keep up the War Chariot pressure and you'll have your opponent on the ropes.</li>
</ul>
Games should usually resolve themselves by midgame due to all of the removal, but Gladiator Beasts can definitely go into a late or grind game.

<strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS
</strong>

The killing blow. Leave absolutely no room for a comeback. This is the Gladiator's Proving Ground.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Secutor: </strong>Resolving Secutor once basically wins the game on the spot. Resolving it during the opponent's turn? Well, that's probably traumatizing to say the least. Ideally you'll be wanting to bring out those that are all-stars in the midgame (as listed above); however, if you're ready to go in for the kill, summon out Laquari or Vespasius instead for fusion setups we'll cover just below.</li>
 	<li><strong>Domitianus: </strong>Monster effect activation negation with no cost whatsoever and dictates who attacks who during your opponent's turn? Make this when you know it's a valid win condition. Just keep in mind that it only tags out into only 1 other Gladiator Beast. This card is really bad to use mid game as a result since, if it would fall, you would be put severely behind for the contact fusion play. Don't be greedy with Domitianus.</li>
 	<li><strong>Heraklinos: </strong>Your Spell/Trap activation negation station. This card ain't even once per turn. As long as you have cards to discard, you can keep up the suffocation against your opponent. Unfortunately, this card doesn't have a tag out nor a float, so it should be used exclusively as a finisher where you're confident it will win. If it happens to get removed, you'll be set back pretty far.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

The most important thing to note about this list is that any and all Spell/Traps selected here can and should be experimented with and swapped out to fit your playstyle with the deck in a given format. This is not a one size fits all situation and due to the variance concerning the hands, the learning curve with deciphering the best way to spend one's opening turns is definitely pretty steep. Regardless, here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere:

<em>Melffy engine with Andal, Traptrix/Gokipole engine, Trinities on Gladiator Beast's Comeback, Geartown engine, Loop of Destruction, Ancient Warriors - Ambitious Cao De, Amazement Ambassador Bufo, Amazement Precious Park, Archfiend's Staff of Despair, Gladiator Beast's Battle Manica, Burden of the Mighty
</em>

Thanks for reading, and I hope this has convinced you to give the deck a try! This deck's a classic in Yu-Gi-Oh! history and it's honestly incredible to see it in a playable state in modern Trinity's climate.

That limits special summons and graveyard plays. However, there are enough fusion cards and diverse monsters to go into what the situation requires. First Darklord is a big body that prevents effects that target dark fairies (IE Main-deck Despia and Scythe and Dark Honest). Mysterion is good for superpoly, can out dragons and spellcasters, as are both Predaplant fusion monsters, who not only out fusion and dark monsters using super poly, but have good negation effects. Levianeer is a good free summon that can thin hands, and Shaddoll Dragon is for making Winda and for using as material since it lets you pop a backrow. Because I'm running so many spells, Engage and Widow Anchor. Two Crossouts and a suite of handtraps to both use or negate with Crossout.

With (almost) infinite recyclability and good consistance, you almost never brick and when you do it's not that bad. Your Boss monsters are, Eldlich the Golden Lord, Doomking Balerdroch and Shiranui Sunsage (and also maybe Shogunsage). Use your Eldlixer and Golden Land cards to keep constant advantage and pressure, and your Zombie World cards to make your opponent cry as their field gets destroyed. So, Welcome to the Golden Land and let's have some fun.

P.S.

This deck isn't finished as I am use it to do 500 duels, every time I update the deck I'll update this list, thanks. If your making this in Master Duel just remove the Side deck and add cards you see fit."

I'm personally not a fan of pile decks. Every powerful staple and engine packed together abusing the lack of xenophobia with the single goal of trying to break the game with what konami has to offer. Halq combos have reached linkross levels of bullcrap again and a competent deck may cost you 4 digits. You might have a different opinion on pile decks, and it's okay to be in the wrong, but I think we can all agree that the past format was too expensive.</span>

<span>Enter, Albaz Strike. A promising new engine, a new playstyle and all that in the form of a structure deck. For only 30 bucks you too can play competitive Yu-Gi-Oh. Branded Despia, the probably strongest way to play this deck according to the OCG, still costs a lot until <span><a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a></span> has it's reprint in GFTP 2nd Haunting but that doesn't mean that there are plenty of cheap and affordable version of this deck out there. Branded Tri-Brigade is up and coming, I'm sure the Invoked Shadoll Dogmatika Destiny HERO algamation has a way of integrating Branded, too and mark my words, Branded Melffy is gonna be a crazy deck once the support arrives.</span>

<span>For now, the version I chose to built doesn't have any of that...because it doesn't have anything else really. Introducing: <span>Branded Control</span></span>

&nbsp;

<span>Branded Fusion</span>

<span>If you don't know how Branded Fusion works this deck and any Branded deck for that matter might seem a little weird. I'm assuming most of you know how this works but I'll sum it up quickly. You use <span><a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a></span> to send <span><a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a></span> and either a LIGHT or DARK monster from your deck to the GY and use that Fusion Monster's effect to fuse itself with Albaz into <span class=""name_txt selectable""><span><a data-name=""Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"">Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</a></span><span>. Alternatively some decks use Albaz and the sent card to go for other, powerful Fusion Monsters like Dragoon or Winda. This deck sticks to Mirrorjade.</span></span></span>

<span>So here are the interactions with Branded Fusion and Mirrorjade.</span>

If you use Mirrorjade's effect you can then activate Torrential to destroy all monsters and then use Screams to summon your Mirrorjade again. Since it's considered a new copy and has only a ""soft"" once per turn clause you can then use Mirrorjade's effect again, meaning Screams translates into a non-targeted banish.</span></li>

Also if you open</span> <span><a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a></span> <span>you can add the target back from the GY instead of discarding one for Lubellion and then adding the Dogmatika from deck. Branded is very punishing if you mismanage your card advantage so having LIGHT monster to fall back to is very nice. If you don't wanna play Dogmatika you can play</span> <span><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a></span> <span>and/or</span> <span><a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a></span> <span>instead.</span></li>

 	<li><span><a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion the Branded Dragon</a></span><span>: Adds you Branded Fusion to your hand during the EP. The worst of the bunch since you don't really need it for anything but summoning Mirrorjade but that makes it a good Punishment target if you don't need N'tss' effect.

</ul>
<span>Control Cards</span>

<span>Almost half your deck is backrow.</span> <span><a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a></span> <span>(IDP) is great for the mirror match. Steal their Albaz and keep it so they won't be able to fuse it away. Back Jack can only set Normal Traps so even if you have Veiler I highly recommend playing</span> <span><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a></span><span>. Solemn cards are insanely powerful and</span> <span><a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a></span> <span>plus IDP or Torrential can even wipe a fully established board even when going second.</span> <span><a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a></span> <span>is a really strong floodgate that you can side in game 2 or 3 when you know you're going first. It's pretty bad against an established board and does next to nothing against Adventurer Prank-Kids, one of the strongest decks atm, so don't put this one in your Main Deck. It's a perfect fit for the Side Deck. Since you are lacking any other engine you're Extra Deck isn't too tight so</span> <span><a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a></span> <span>can help you out a great deal. You have 3 Mirrorjade and 4 monsters that can summon Mirrorjade. 4 targets for Mirrorjade and 2 additional targets for Punishment. 2</span> <span><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></span> <span>targets that only matter game 2 and/or 3 and Poly can be fired before the Main Phase, allowing your to still use Pot without the risk of banishing your targets for Super Poly. So while there will be rare instances of banishing all 3 Mirrorjade you play enough targets for your individual effects that you don't need to be afraid of using Extrav. Worst case it's Dogmatika beatdown with a bunch of traps at your disposal.</span>

<span>Budget Options</span>

<span>As I said, Aluber is way to expensive so feel free to play <span><a data-name=""Springans Kitt"">Springans Kitt</a></span> instead. It's a little more punishing on card advantage but searches Branded Fusion just as well. <span><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></span> will always be relevant and I can't recommend buying a playset enough but if you want you can play Ogre/Veiler instead. If you don't want to play IDP you could play other trap cards as long as they are Normal Traps. It's a lot worse going second but cards like <span><a data-name=""Fiend Griefing"">Fiend Griefing</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""The Transmigration Prophecy"">The Transmigration Prophecy</a></span> can also deal with your opponent's Albaz if you don't wanna lose the edge on your opponent in the mirror match. The Dogmatika package doesn't cost mutch but if you don't want to spend more money on cards and have a DPE lying around you could play <span><a data-name=""Destiny Fusion"">Destiny Fusion</a></span> instead. If you do that do be prepared to have Prosperity and Destiny Fusion clash if you draw both. If you wanna be a little safer there's <span><a data-name=""Lilith, Lady of Lament"">Lilith, Lady of Lament</a></span>. Six normal summons isn't too many. Playing either allows you to cut Titaniklad to increase the ratio of your other ED monsters to decrease the chances of having all copies of one banished by Extrav. Still, I highly recommend the Dogmatika engine over any of those two options in this deck. </span>

<span>// Not enough Branded cards to be labelled correctly. Guess I'll sacrifice the deckprofile's Side Deck.</span>"

What can go wrong?,"The deck works really simple, it focuses a lot on bringing different negates throughout different stages of the combo, providing several immunity against hand traps/interruptions in general throughout completing the combo.
The deck was inspired from Triff Gaming, but updated it to fit Master Duel rules and to fit the ocg rules.
note this is a common miss consiption: Pend cards are considered spell cards meaning that it can be negated by an effect of a imperial order.

Your aim is to summon Endymion, Jackal king, apollousa/I:P and Odd-eyes vortex dragon.
Each card function:
Cerebrus: usually to bait an ash while searching for jackal king, it makes sure your opponent to waste it or waste a negate. Otherwise, its a free special if you can pull jackal king and activate its effect of summoning cerebrus.
This provides another sort of bait, in case you have 4 spell counters on the field, you can activate cerebrus effect to banish a monster that provides a threat for you, which of course reduces the amount of negates your opponent have in case going second.
Endymion the mighty master: This is pretty much one of your boss monsters, its great going first or going second especially with this build. For going first, usually you want to keep this card in your hand so you can discard it or pend summon it. but if you're stuck and you need 1 spell counter, usually you can place this card in your pend zone if you have a free slot. otherwise its bricky, that's why you want to discard it in the gy or extra deck. if its in the gy, you can bring it out with selene later one, if its in the extra deck you can Pend summon. Going second this card is really good to board wipe your opponent especially if you have left over spell counters. having 6 of them on the field you can destroy a lot of your opponent cards, and it can't be negated by skill drain, since its considered a spell card while bringing it out using this effect, meaning that it can't be negated using monster negates.
Astrograph: good card to search for cards in your extra deck if you search it using electrumite, or if you have it in your hand. Plus its a free summon (and a great lvl 7 card to bring out Odd-eyes absolute dragon).
Empress endymion: good card to collect spell counters, and a great card for low scale pend. Besides it's a great card to remove cards without destroying them (but it still targets them) this card is really situational, but overall really good. Since as a cost to remove a card by returning it to hand, you have to remove a card with a spell counter from your field. Which gives you another card to set in your pend scale or to collect more spell counters.
Jackal King: A really good monster negate, which blocks nibirus and ash blossom while its on the field. It's not a hard once per turn, meaning if you activated one during your main phase, and then summoned it another time, you can activate its affect one more time. Having multiples of this card in your field is very welcoming.
Chronograph Sorcerer: A really good card to summon monsters from your hand, or to collect spell counters. In the pend zone its a high scale that allows you to summon a decent amount of your monsters, while also it allows you to bring out Time Gazer, which either helps you add one more spell counter or a free summon to get into heavy metal foes or starving venom. it works in a similar way to astrograph with its summoning mechanic, also its special summon effect is not a once per turn, meaning you can keep on summoning it multiple times.
Magical Abductor: A really really good card, it keeps on collecting spell counters, searches for your cards, low scale pend zone card, and provides a free destruction for electrumite. Unlike most endymion cards, once you activate magical abductor effect it won't be removed from the pend zone, meaning that you can keep ons tacking spell counters, or destroy it using electrumite.
Sky Striker Raye: A good card and engine for this deck thanks to the amount of special summons it provide. the reason this card is used because of hornets. Since hornet is not a once per turn, which allows you to use it twice, giving you more spell counters, or a recovery in case of your board being wiped.
Magister of Endymion: High pend scale, and great to take monsters from your extra deck. It uses spell counters and can provide you with an endymion from your extra deck, which helps in going into your combos overall, or a free negate.
Servant of Endymion: This card is one of the best cards in this deck due to how useful it is. It allows you to search and summon a monster from your deck, similar to Magister of Endymion. At the same time its usually your go to whenever you want to search for magical abductor (usually, not all the time). It also helps in giving your endymion a free negate and a spell counter on him, making him untargettable by card effects.
Spellbook magician: A good monster to search for more spells to stack spell counters/draw cards. Note he has to be normal/flip summoned to activate his affect, pend summoning him is useless, and usually he's the target of your special summons.
Mythical beast Jackal: a good combo starter if you don't have big monsters, it allows you to remove 3 spell cards from your field, tribute it, and special summon a pend monster from your deck.
Magician's soul: A really good card to draw more cards, free summon for your link summons, and most importantly a great card to sending your endymion/astrograph to the gy, so it can be summoned using Selene later on.
SpellBook of knowledge: A good draw 2 card, and good for sending monsters to the gy. Note that if you activate this card to send a pend spellcaster to the gy, it will send it to the extra deck, meaning that you won't get to draw the 2 cards. so you have to use this card on an effect monster that's not pend to get use of its draw 2.
Pot of desires: a good draw 2 card, adding more spell counters to your field too.
Spell Power Control: a good card to add a lot of spell counters to your field, and helps in searching for monsters based on the situation you're in.
Engage!: helps in starting your sky striker combo (usually you want to search for hornet using this card), and its a great card going first/second and you have no monsters in your main zone. this card comes in action when you link summon and you want to extend your combo. Where you use Engage! search Hornet, use hornet. go into kagari, take hornet, and use hornet again to go into zeke. Or keep them so you can go into a selene once you have a spellcaster on the field. Note that this is perfect if you have Abductor/Servant in your pend zones to stack free 3 spell counters.
The rest of the cards are pretty much fillers and situational draws/negates/sending cards to the gy.
Magical citadel is a great card overall, but it's important to know when to use it. Usually you want to activate this card after activating Servant/Abductor, and you are sure that you can activate 2 other spell cards after it to activate Servant/Abductor. Activating it first occurs when you don't have enough spell cards to activate Servant/Abductor, so you activate it first try to get 3 spell counters to activate servant/abductors effect.
Extra deck monsters:
Starving Venom: Usually you want to copy the effect of Electrumite to get another card draw and a destruction of your pend cards so you can activate chronograph/astrograph again. Plus its a free monster for your link summon if you bring I:P.
Vortex dragon: Generally a good recycle type of negate, you want to bring this card out using the effect of Absolute dragon.
Absolute dragon: Usually you want to summon this card, then link summon/destroy using your Electrumite to bring out vortex dragon. all you need to do basically is send this card to the gy to activate its affect.
Accesscode Talker/Knightmare Phoenix/Unicorn/Apollousa: Your I:p summon target based on the type of situation you're in. Accesscode is your going second solution for a beatstick destruction, Knightmare for interrupting a combo. Apollousa is your target against monsters affects.
Selene: A core card that helps you get a load of free spell counters, summon monsters from your gy, and allows you to pend summon a lot of monsters to your side of the field without worrying much, since you can pend into up to 3 cards from your extra deck based on her free link zones.
Electrumite: Its effect is really clear especially with how many times it have been mentioned on the list, meaning its combo piece is pretty much simple, you summon it add chronograph/astrograph, destroy a pend card, draw 1, get chronograph/astrograph, summon them and activate their effects.
Sky striker extra deck monsters: They are just there, you want to mainly summon kagari most of the time, and at the end phase if you have raye you can summon Shizuku.
Crowley: A good card to collect a lot of spell counters if you summon it, since you'll be able to pick the 3 spell book cards you have in your deck. Regardless of what your opponent picks, they are all good. You want to summon this card only when you didnt use your normal summon, and you don't have any of the spellbook cards in your hand.

This is the deck in general, it might have been a bit of rushed, and if so i advice you to watch the Pend god tutorial himself, However his deck might be a bit outdated with the new banlists.

Theater Kids and Waifus, pretty much just an anime deck.","<span>Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, back with another Fusion list (surprise, surprise), Branded Dragonmaids.</span>

<span><strong>""B-but Grayewick, Dragonmaids have a lot of irrelevant Attributes, didn't you tell people to not play engines with irrelevant Attributes with Branded? Reeeee!!!""</strong></span>

<span>Yes, Dragonmaids do have non-LIGHT and non-DARK monsters, but you're forgetting the most important part. They're all Dragon-types. Not only is Albaz a heavy counter against Dragon-type centered decks, but he also is a Dragon and is also synergistic with them. There's always room for reasonable exceptions.</span>

<span><strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong></span>

<span>Well it's simple, really. Branded is a Fusion heavy deck, and Dragonmaids at its core is also a Fusion deck, technically speaking, so... yeah. Oh, also Dragonmaid Sheou and House Dragonmaid are LIGHT Fusions, so it's really good for the reasons that I'll discuss later further on the list. I'm honestly tempted to make a Dragonmaid Shaddolls list now that I think about it but anyway, the list.</span>

<span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>

<span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>

<span>Before everything else, at this point I gotta explain first that my ratios for a standard splashable Branded engine for all of my lists, unless exceptions have to be made which I would most definitely state, are going to be:</span>
<span>• x2 <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Incredible Ecclesia</a>, <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum</a> for the monsters.</span>
<span>• x3 <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> with/without x1 <a data-name=""Branded In Red"">Branded In Red</a> for the Spells, depending on whether you want to use <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a> or not.</span>
<span>• x1 <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a> with/without x2 <a data-name=""Branded Retribution"">Branded Retribution</a> for the Traps.</span>

<span>If you wanna know what they do, just hover over their names and take a short read, so after this all I'm going to be explaining are only my non-Branded card ratios.</span>

<span>• The Dragon waifus (<a data-name=""Dragonmaid Lorpar"">Dragonmaid Lorpar</a>, <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Ernus"">Dragonmaid Ernus</a>, <a data-name=""Chamber Dragonmaid"">Chamber Dragonmaid</a>, <a data-name=""Kitchen Dragonmaid"">Kitchen Dragonmaid</a>, <a data-name=""Parlor Dragonmaid"">Parlor Dragonmaid</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Nurse Dragonmaid"">Nurse Dragonmaid</a>) - <span>The other half of this strategy. Their effects are, if you're not aware:</span></span>
<ol>
 	<li><span>Lorpar - <span>It's an Infinite Impermanence at a cost of just discarding itself. It also has an on-field card destruction protection while you control ANY Fusion monster.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span>Ernus - <span>Has a Quick Effect to Special Summon any Level 4 or lower Dragonmaid monster from your hand. Shares the same protection as Lorpar, as per every Dragonmaids' Dragon forms.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span>Chamber - <span>Searches any Dragonmaid Spell/Trap, most likely either <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Changeover"">Changeover</a> or <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Tidying"">Tidying</a>.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span>Kitchen - <span>Searches any Dragonmaid monster, but also makes you discard a Dragonmaid monster. Just a one of because of her Attribute.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span>Parlor - <span>Sends any Dragonmaid card from your Deck to the GY. Just a one of for the same reasons as Kitchen's.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span>Nurse - <span>Special Summons a Level 4 or lower Dragonmaid monster in your GY, except a copy herself although it targets so, bummer. Also just a one of for obvious reasons.</span></span></li>
</ol>
<span><strong>Spells</strong></span>

<span><strong>• <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Changeover"">Dragonmaid Changeover</a></strong> - <span>A searchable Fusion Spell is always great, I'm actually considering bumping this up to two, just for insurance against banishing effects.</span></span>

<span><strong>• <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Hospitality"">Dragonmaid Hospitality</a></strong> - <span>Allows you to not only Special Summon a Dragonmaid monster from your hand, saving your Normal Summon, but also lets you send another Dragonmaid monster from your Deck to the GY for set up.</span></span>

<span><strong>Traps</strong></span>

<span><strong>• <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Tidying"">Dragonmaid Tidying</a></strong> - <span>A searchable targeting but non-destruction removal, albeit a bit slow. It also gives you recovery for the grind games.</span></span>

<span><strong>• <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Downtime"">Dragonmaid Downtime</a></strong> - <span>A searchable half-search card and half-Spell/Trap ""removal"". It's a Continuous Trap, so be mindful when using it.</span></span>

<span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>

<span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Sheou"">Dragonmaid Sheou</a> &amp; <a data-name=""House Dragonmaid"">House Dragonmaid</a></strong> - <span>Your Dragonmaid boss monsters. If I had two more Extra Deck slots, I would definitely play one more copy of each of them.</span></span>

<span><strong>• <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a></strong> - <span>Staple for Branded at this point, also because of <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>, since he doesn't negate their effects.</span></span>

<span><strong>• <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a></strong> - <span>Because I'm also playing <a data-name=""Starving Venom Predator Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Predator Fusion Dragon</a>.</span></span>

<span><strong>• <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong> - <span>Understandable. I'm not debating with this one.</span></span>

<span><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></span>

<span>Honestly, I don't really have anything much else to say but, this deck works, possibly even better than I expected before testing. Also, the The First Darklord + Artifact Scythe interaction, I just realized it while making this list because I forgot for a second that Scythe was an Artifact card, and so is Artifact Lancea, so if I can do it with Lancea, surely I could also do it with Scythe, and I was right. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

And for everyone, Sand Stone is to be sent to graveyard and used on first turn with Fossil Fusion to summon Fossil Warrior Skull Knight first turn, then with Time Stream summon Fossil Warrior Skull King. Adamancipators make this deck a little bit faster, and with Halqifibrax you can get to Formula Synchron and get a free draw and access to Baronne since if you got to 1 Adamancipator, you will alredy have Dragite on the field."

Allure as the drawing power and Tragedy / Mercourier as the cost. Still testing but I like the ratios and the hands 3/5 times are playable going first. Going second requires understanding of the deck and proper use of bait tactics. Some side cards were added for testing the newer cards from OCG.

&nbsp;

Best hand possible so far has been Allure, Tragedy, Branded Lost OR Fusion, Veiler, Upstart.

Allure can pitch almost anything for pluses and odds of you getting the cards in hand to combo are pretty good ratio wise. Sadly its not perfect.

&nbsp;

Searchers: Aluber, Kitt, Tragedy, Mercourier, Branded Opening.

Draw Power: Allure, Pot of P (debating subbing it out), Upstart, Tactics

Negates: Mercourier, Veiler, Dark Ruler, Called by

This deck is probably gonna be reuploaded a few times to see how I can tweak it, but I like this build so far."

(Not meta FYI, but it is pretty consistent.)","The go to play is an FTK. Use various Tactics to get a low scale Abyss Actor into one scale, and Abyss Actor - Twinkle Little Star into your other scale. Then fusion summon Despian Quaeritis and change everyone's ATK to 0. Next Pendulum Summon Abyss Actor - Evil heel, And use Twinkle Little Stars effect so Evil Heel can attack 3 times. If your opponent has 3 or more monsters, the take 9000 damage resulting in defeat. The big problem with this deck is so far it doesn't have much of a backup plan other than use Evilswarm Exciton Knight/ Zeus to send everything to the GY if you can't FTK, and it has little backrow removal.

One other thing it can do though, You Won't always draw a hand that lets you fusion summon. So I added Artifact Scythe. If Abyss Playhouse and a pendulum summoned Abyss Actor are on the field, you can change one of your opponents monster effects into ""destroy 1 set spell/trap your opponent controls."", making them waste an effect to destroy Scythe, also locking them out of their extra deck.

Any feedback is appreciated, and have fun!"

Oh no she has airpods in. Oh god oh fu-","(This used to be a deck breakdown of my Master Duel Lyrilusc deck, but that version sucks so bad with how few UR points I spent on it. Here’s my TCG version instead which is better than that bricky mess of a deck)

Lyrilusc is a solid xyz-focused deck that unfortunately had to take a hit for Tri-Brigade’s sins. The deck isn’t dead yet though and can still put up some impressive endboards when played pure. Just be warned that running Tri-Brigades in this deck instead of playing the pure version does make the deck more resilient overall. I just personally love playing decks as pure as I can.

<strong>Deck Breakdown:</strong>

Main Deck Monsters:
<ol>
 	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Turquoise Warbler"">Lyrilusc - Turquoise Warbler</a>: The best starter in the deck. Summons straight from hand on an empty field, and if it's special summoned from hand you can special another Lyrilusc from hand or grave for free. Always run three.</li>
 	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Sapphire Swallow"">Lyrilusc - Sapphire Swallow</a>: The best extender in the deck. Summons from hand if you control a winged-beast, and then summons another level 1 winged-beast from hand. As a bonus, it evens grabs an extra material from grave if you use it to summon a Wind xyz. Run three of this as well</li>
 	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Beryl Canary"">Lyrilusc - Beryl Canary</a>: The second-best extender in the deck. It summons itself from hand and grabs another Lyrilusc from grave as well for the low price of being locked into xyz monsters for the rest of the turn. Really sucks in some other builds that focus on links, but for an xyz focused build it's extremely useful for extending combos. Run three unless you really wanna use links.</li>
 	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow"">Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow</a>: On special summon, it searches any level 1 winged-beast. If you didn't notice, that's the entire archetype's main deck monster lineup. By far your best special summon off Sapphire Swallow, and one of their spell cards. And it protects any Wind xyz summoned with it from being targeted. Its search effect is a hard OPT but running three doesn’t hurt the deck at all.</li>
 	<li>2x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Celeste Wagtail"">Lyrilusc - Celeste Wagtail</a>: This one searches the other half of your archetype's main deck cards. On special summon, it grabs a Lyrilusc spell/trap from deck. The spell/trap lineup of this deck is busted as hell, so finding one for free during a combo is extremely useful. It also attaches itself from GY for free to any Lyrilusc xyz on board. Run two since it’s also a hard OPT and it’s not as flexible as Cobalt Sparrow.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Slower Swallow"">Slower Swallow</a>: The only non-Lyrilusc involved in the combos. Summons from hand for free if 2 or more monsters with the same level are on field. That includes your opponent's field if they ever happen to make that kind of gamestate. And it can even tribute itself to double your draw next turn. You can get two or three searches of level 1 winged-beasts during the combo so you really only need one, but running two or three really wouldn't hurt the deck at all.</li>
 	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Wynn the Wind Channeler"">Wynn the Wind Channeler</a>: By discarding this card and another wind monster you can search any of the monsters listed above. Just an all-around amazing card in this deck and you should run three no matter what build you play. Just be mindful of the discard cost as it can sometimes be a brick.</li>
 	<li>Handtraps: Anywhere between 6 and 12 works well in the deck without killing consistency. I use <a data-name=""Ash Blossom and Joyous Springs"">Ash Blossom and Joyous Springs</a> since it’s the more generically useful handtrap in the game as well as <a data-name=""Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion</a> since it’s super effective against all the decks of the people I play with. There’s also Infinite Impermanence but we’ll get into that card later.</li>
</ol>
Main Deck Spells/Traps:
<ol>
 	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Bird Call"">Lyrilusc - Bird Call</a>: This deck gets an archetypal search card that can also be a foolish burial, and it even summons one Lyrilusc from hand when it resolves. I don't know this got through the R&amp;D department at Konami but this card is busted. Run three until they limit/ban it.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Bird Sanctuary"">Lyrilusc - Bird Sanctuary</a>: The archetype's second-best spell/trap. If you control an xyz monster, you get a free draw. And if you control two xyz monsters, you can attach one to the other to make a huge xyz monster. Run one because it's searchable.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc – Bird Strike"">Lyrilusc – Bird Strike</a>: A searchable archetypal Dark Ruler No More. And it doesn’t even have the drawback of not being able to damage the opponent. Just a crazy card. Run one since it’s searchable, but I run the other two in the side deck since you sometimes can’t search it through negation depending on your matchup.</li>
 	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Wonders of Nature"">Wonders of Nature</a>: This card is just insanely good in this deck. If you open it and any of the Lyrilusc’s with effects that activate on special summon, you can use this to proc those effects and then search a Poly in the end phase. I always run three since it has basically zero drawbacks., but if you play TCG or Master Duel you can run <a data-name=""Summon Storm"">Summon Storm</a> instead in this slot.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>: Summons a level 1 straight from deck. Just make sure you're only summoning Celeste Wagtail or Cobalt Sparrow with this since the others won't get their effects. Run one because it's limited and probably always will be.</li>
 	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Wing Requital"">Wing Requital</a>: Pot of greed for a 600 LP cost if you control 2 or more winged beasts. You're gonna control a lot of winged-beasts. Run three because going +1 is super cool. Just be aware it’s not always online past turn one with how many non-winged-beast options you tend to end on.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a>: Honestly, you probably shouldn't run Poly at all in this deck. Beryl Canary locks you into xyz monsters the turn you activate its effect, so most of the time this is a dead draw. However, I think Independent Nightingale is a cool card and I love summoning it. If you don't share that opinion, there are plenty of better cards to run instead that we'll get into later.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>: Not as great as <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> for dealing with handtraps, but Crossout has a bit much of a deck cost for me to run it. Run one because you can’t run any more than that, but if you don’t mind losing deck space to Crossout targets, run three of that instead.</li>
 	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>: Unironically my favorite handtrap in the game and I run a playset in every deck that I can. It’s like <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> on steroids. You can swap this out for another handtrap though.</li>
</ol>
Extra Deck:
<ol>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Recital Starling"">Lyrilusc - Recital Starling</a>: Searches any level 1 winged-beast by detaching a material. This is only a soft OPT, so every Recital Starling you summon can use this search effect if you can somehow manage to summon this more than once in a turn. It also has an attack increasing effect that has never come up ever. Run one because it’s limited, but bump this up to two or three if it ever comes off the list. If you play OCG or Master Duel, run two or three instead.</li>
 	<li>2x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale"">Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale</a>: The old win condition of the deck. If you stack a bunch of materials on her, she can attack once for each material, and gains 200 attack for each material, AND can attack directly. This card can OTK with 7 materials and can become a huge Zeus with any less. It can also provide destruction and battle protection to your whole archetype while also preventing battle damage. Run one or two since you only need that many to win a game</li>
 	<li>2x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Ensemblue Robin"">Lyrilusc - Ensemblue Robin</a>: The archetype's new ""win condition"". Can bounce any monster special summoned by your opponent without an OPT on the card. This deck also excels at making huge xyz monsters, so you might be able to completely stop your opponent for a turn. Run one or two since you tend to kill your opponent before a third one would even be needed.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Promenade Thrush"">Lyrilusc - Promenade Thrush</a>: The weakest of all the Lyrilusc xyz monsters, but it still has some utility. It can clear one spell/trap by bouncing it and can increase the attack of one of your monsters to help close out a game. By detaching just two materials from this card, you can buff up a 5 material Assembled Nightingale to be in OTK range. Run one because it doesn’t come up all the time, but when it does, you’re about to win the game.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale"">Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale</a>: The fusion boss monster of an xyz deck without any archetypal fusion spell. This card is so bad in its own archetype, but I love it so much and just have toplay it here. This card is prime kaiju bait though and might cost you a game instead of winning it. It could also be used as an Instant Fusion target if you want to run that card. Just be mindful of its limited status. Run one at most.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Downerd Magician"">Downerd Magician</a>: Acts as a bridge between your xyz monsters and Zeus for an extra material. Run one because you only need one Zeus.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</a>: The best generic xyz monster in the game. Can get some insane numbers of materials after you perform your full combo. Run one because you only need one to close out a game.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>: The best way to set up your GY in this deck. It also has a super handy battle phase effect that can save your ass in a pinch. Run one because it self-recurs and only really needs to be summoned once.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>: Just to link off a Nibiru token if you get hit with the rock. Run one because if you're getting Nibiru-ed twice in one game, you already lost it.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Wynn the Wind Charmer, Verdant"">Wynn the Wind Charmer, Verdant</a>: Not super necessary, but can help against other wind decks by grabbing one of their monsters from grave or even searching one of your monsters after it dies. Run one because it barely ever comes up.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Geonator Transverser"">Geonator Transverser</a>: A great generic link that can give you your opponent’s boss monster with just three monsters as an investment. It doesn’t come up in every game, and it conflicts with Wynn and Beryl Canary, but if you manage to resolve its effect you can win a game on the spot. Run one because you only need one to turn the game around.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>: I’m sure everyone’s seen this card before. If you’re like me and want to summon Independent Nightingale, run this card as a way to avoid needing Poly searchers in an xyz deck. If you’re in the OCG or just want to avoid that card entirely, you can drop this for a different card. Just run one Verte since we aren’t using Prosperity or Extrav in the deck.</li>
 	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>: Another good turn 1 option. If you summon this before Beryl Canary, you can have 3-4 monster negates basically for free. Run one because you only ever need one.</li>
</ol>
Side Deck:
<ol>
 	<li>Other Handtraps: I personally run three <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a> and three <a data-name=""Droll and Lock Bird"">Droll and Lock Bird</a> in my side deck, but you can run whichever handtraps work the best for you.</li>
 	<li>Kaijus: Your best options in this deck are <a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a>, <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>, and <a data-name=""Gadarla the Mystery Dust Kaiju"">Gadarla the Mystery Dust Kaiju</a>. You rarely ever normal summon so Sphere Mode and Lava Golem don’t conflict with the deck all that much, and Gadarla is the best Kaiju for this deck since it’s a wind-attribute card. Wynn needs more winds after all, so it’s decent discard fodder if you draw it turn one.</li>
 	<li>Anti-Backrow Cards: Every deck needs at least three of these in the side deck to be able to combat backrow heavy decks. I play a <a data-name=""Harpie’s Feather Duster"">Harpie’s Feather Duster</a> and three <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> in my side decks since the Duster can clear all the backrow at once and Cyclone banishes instead of destroying.</li>
</ol>
Other Options:
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Performapal Trump Witch"">Performapal Trump Witch</a>: If you really want to go deep on the Independent Nightingale route, you can use Trump Witch as extra copies of Poly that can also fusion summon while set in scales. If you don't ever want to fusion summon though, just ignore this one.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Jester Confit"">Jester Confit</a>: This card is the best level 1 extender in the game. I just personally don't like looking at him. He's also a dark-type spellcaster so he's completely unsearchable in the deck and can clash with Wynn. He's not a bad choice for the deck at all though</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> and <a data-name=""Millennium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a>: The best instant fusion targets for this deck. Both can yoink a monster and then be used to extend link or xyz plays.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Number F0: Utopic Draco Future"">Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</a>: This deck summons a lot of xyz monsters per turn, and none of them are Numbers, so you can make UDF super easily to add some negation to your end board. This package does require two extra deck slots to work, and for those with a keen eye, you might have noticed two extra deck cards that sorta work together in Independent Nightingale and Verte Anaconda. They’re the best two cards you can swap out for this package.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Kikinagashi Fucho"">Kikinagashi Fucho</a>: Not that great of a card, but if you brick badly enough summoning this can keep you alive for another turn.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen"">Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen</a>: Non-targeting banish on summon and when another tri-type is summoned to your field. Really good when you're going second, but not as free as he is in a dedicated Tri-Brigade build.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</a>: One of the best generic links in the game, and with how easy this deck can spam the board, you can summon it decently consistently. If you’re in the OCG and still want to run Independent Nightingale, replace Verte with this card.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Where Arf Thou?"">Where Arf Thou?</a>: Another search card to add consistency to the deck. It's a bit wonkier to use though since you can't search until you have a level 1 on board (thanks Exodia...) so I never really run it.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>: Just a way to get another level 1 on board for xyz spamming. I use Ready Fusion in all my decks that could run both, but the level 1 pool of fusion monsters doesn’t have any non-effect monsters.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Storm"">Harpie's Feather Storm</a>: Acts like a Skill Drain for one turn. Just a bit of an eh include with it being a trap in a very fast deck.</li>
</ul>
All in all, I really love this deck and I think it's a great option as a potential rogue deck. Just be warned that this exact version is a bit pricey with the cards I included. Swapping out the handtrap lineup I chose for a cheaper one and tweaking the extra deck by removing the Verte, Apollousa, and Zeus package can make this an extremely affordable deck to play without too much of a hit to how well the deck can perform. Just be warned that Bird Call is like 3 dollars a copy."

Personally I play saffira because you tribute a monster to get it out, so if a hieratic is tributed you can summon labradorite dragon and either summon ultimaya or king of atum. Saffira also has the effect if a light monster (all hieratics are light) was tributed for it's ritual summon, during the end phase you can either, draw 2 cards and discard 1, discard one random card from your opponents hand, or add 1 light monster from your gy to your hand. The ritual spell also helps you protect saffira, if it would be destroyed by a battle or card effect, you can banish it instead. To get both saffira and the ritual spell in your hand you can use pre-preparation of rites, to add 1 ritual spell from the deck, then add 1 ritual monster from the deck or gy which name is listed on the ritual spell. Dragard can summon a normal monster from the gy when normal summon, then you can tribute any dragon-type, then target one card on the field and make it's level 8, so if you summon hieratic seal of the sun dragon overload with it's effect, then tribute a hieratic monster and make itself level 8 and get labradorite dragon on the field because you tributed, now you can xyz summon a rank 8 with dragard and sun dragon overload. Artillary catapult turtle can tribute any monster one the field to summon a level 5 dragon from hand or deck. If a hieratic is tributed you both get hieratic dragon of eset and a normal monster of your choice on the field. Hieratic dragon of eset has the effect that your can target a face-up dragon-type normal monster and make all your hieatic monsters the same level as the normal monster, so after you get both your eset and your level 6 or 8 normal monster on the field with the effect of artillary catapult turtle, you can use esets effect so you either have 2 level 6 or 8 monsters on the field. Piercing the darkness lets you draw a card once per turn when you summon a normal monster, since it's a continuous spell and you more or less summon a normal monster every turn, your can draw 2 cards every turn. Celestial observatory let you return a level 6 monster to the button of the deck to draw 2 cards, so you send saffira (which is a level 6) if it's in your hand without the ritual spell, or if you have 2 Tefnuit in the hand since you only can use it's effect once per turn.</p>"

Gren Maju and Gizmek is in the deck for easy summoning, but also gives you a strong normal monster when your opponent doesn't allow special summoning or their boss monster isn't affected by card effects. Normally you'll only ever use Number 38, 97, and 100 from the extra deck. Use Number 97 to setup an OTK with Number 100 once you've cleared the board or go into Number 38 for defense after your Battle Phase."

I play mine like 3 cards differently than him. I took this to being a TCG deck only, and being able to turbo out some of the greatest heckin fusion monsters Konami has introduced to us and let certain decks abuse, well actually all decks because Verte. The beauty of this deck, there is no need....you know what, I'll let you guys read below.

<strong>""Why play this deck?"", you may ask yourself:</strong>

• It can turbo out <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> without Verte or REF. Do I need to say more?
• It can make DPE without Verte. Do I need to say even more?
• It abuses <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>.
• It can survive without the Brave Token engine.

Here's the list and some strats:

<strong>The Main Deck:</strong>

Monsters
<ul>
 	<li><strong>The Despians (<a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge</a>, <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum</a>, <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber</a>, <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Tragedy</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Despian Comedy"">Comedy</a>)</strong> - Can't play the deck without them. Stuff they do:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li>
<ol>
 	<li>Dramaturge - Main deck boss monster. Can recycle himself when sent to GY or is banished as Fusion material. Has a targeting negation effect when an Extra Deck monster is special summoned (not just from the Extra Deck). You can play more than 1 but 3 can be bricky.</li>
 	<li>Ad Libitum - One of the reasons you can grind and recycle. This can bring back a banished <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> or <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> or in your GY upon getting sent to the GY or is banished as Fusion material. Also has an ok ATK boosting effect that can be relevant occasionally. You can play more than 1 but 3 can be bricky. You can recycle him with your Albaz Fusions anyway.</li>
 	<li>Aluber - He's your main Normal Summon in the deck and THE REASON WHY YOU DO NOT PLAY THE GODDAMN BRAVE TOKENS IN THIS DECK BECAUSE IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO HIM. He also has a targeting negation effect in the GY when a Fusion monster you control is either destroyed by battle or leaves the field because of an opponent's card effect. I only play 2 because I already know how the deck plays but you can most certainly play 3 by cutting anything but the 1 ofs, except for <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Despian Comedy"">Despian Comedy</a>.</li>
 	<li>Tragedy - Playing 3 of this enables you to play draw cards like Allure of Darkness. I do not understand why people only play 1 of this considering how this is your main searcher. I don't recommend cutting this.</li>
 	<li>Comedy - Utility 1 of. Archetypal hand trap to protect your Despia monsters from targeting effects, also allows your Fusion monsters to dodge your opponent's targeting effects while it's in the GY. Feel free to cut this.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a></strong> - Your other relevant Normal Summon in the game. Super Polymerization on legs but can be responded. Regardless, weaker Super Poly is still Super Poly. You can set this against Dragon decks and contact fuse for a lot of the dragon targets in the extra deck. Hell, it can become a free Tyrant Dragon if playing against a Blue Eyes deck.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a></strong> - Can special summon herself. Brings out Fallen of Albaz from the Deck. Also a LIGHT target for <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> + <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a></strong> - The main reason why you can bring out Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon faster than Verte turbo decks. Also a great <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom</a> bait.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion - </strong>It is a light target for any other play while in the graveyard, and then helps cheat out Tyrant Dragon to give a 3400 beat stick that can take out almost anything and can recycle some of the traps in the graveyard</li>
 	<li><strong>Artifact Scythe - </strong>Scythe lock when you have First Darklord on the field, and it's funny to watch your opponent squirm not being able to touch their extra deck, lmao</li>
 	<li><strong>Jizukiru - </strong>Just a kaiju to help out some monsters that can't be targeted for destruction, or effects, which also gives a light target on your opponent's field for any of the super poly plays with the boy Albaz</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Spells
<p><strong>• <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a></strong> - Banishing DARK monsters face-up is not a problem, your Fusion monsters can recycle them anyway. Also pair this with <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> for a +1.</p>
<p><strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a></strong> - Yes, my Fusion Spell uses materials from the Deck, cry about it.</p>
<p><strong>• <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a></strong> - Yes, my Fusion Spell uses materials from the Deck, cry about it.</p>
<p><strong>• <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong> - You're almost always dumping Tragedy</p>
<p><strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a></strong> - The reason why I prefer playing less copies of Aluber, because I can summon him off of this anyway. Also, if you pitch Tragedy with its effect, or if you play a Branded Shaddolls variant, you can chain block Aluber from getting <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a>ed.</p>
<p><strong>• <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong> - You literally have no reason to not play this card. All of your Fusion monsters are Super Poly targets.</p>
<p><strong>• <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a></strong> - Your main search target for Aluber. One of the three reasons why you can summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> in this deck, and also the main reason why it is so worth it to play in this deck, because it can bring him or any Level 8 or higher Fusion monster back from the GY when a non-Fusion Fairy monster you control is either destroyed by battle or was removed from the field by an opponent's card effect. Feel free to cut it to 1, but it's always good to have insurance in case it gets banished.</p>
Traps
<p><strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Banishment - </a></strong><a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Recycles any Despia or lvl 8 or higher fusion monsters in the grave, which then leads to you being able to have another super poly effect, non-target banishment</a></p>
<p><strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Retribution</a></strong> - Searchable <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a> that can also be used to recycle your Branded Spells/Traps by banishing itself. Feel free to bump it up to 3 or cut it down to 1 if you prefer.</p>
<strong>The Extra Deck:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a></strong> - Honorary boss monster. Gives all your Fairies effect targeting protection, can also bring any Fairy monster in your GY OPT. A cute interaction you can do is summon him using <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">as much of your Despians</a> as Fusion Material and Special Summon Scythe during your opponent's Main Phase and lock them from the extra deck</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Despian Proskenion"">Despian Proskenion</a></strong> - Despia boss monster, supposedly. Has a neat effect of either stealing or banishing an opponent's Extra Deck monster in the GY, also burns your opponent equal to the original ATK or DEF of a monster it destroys by battle, whichever was higher. Great Super Poly target.</li>
 	<li> <strong>Despian Quaeritis - </strong>Fun Despian fusion that drops attack points of non-Lvl 8 or higher fusion monsters, and can stall a battle phase or help you deal damage.</li>
 	<li><strong> <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong> - This deck has absolutely NO REASON not to play Dragoon in this deck. It's a Towers boss monster that you can bring out without using Verte Anaconda or Red-Eyes Fusion, which are both the problematic parts of summoning him, has the same omni negate the racist tokens provide, except it's also a Level 8 Fusion monster that has FULL SYNERGY WITH YOUR DECK, UNLIKE THEM EXPENSIVE ASS TOKEN ENGINE, can opt pop a monster your opponent controls and burn it, and can be brought back with either <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum </a>or <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Theater</a>. This is the main reason why I am compelled to make this list even when I've already made like five or more iterations of this deck, all of which have Dragoon and I have tested against post-DIFO decks and survived well enough.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Branded Dragons (<a data-name=""Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"">Mirrorjade</a>, <a data-name=""Lubellion the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion</a>, <a data-name=""Masquerade the Blazing Dragon"">Masquerade</a>, <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad</a>, Alba-Lentus &amp; <a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion</a>)</strong> - The stars of the show, all Super Poly targets with the following effects:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li>
<ol>
 	<li>Mirrorjade - Your most forgiving Super Poly target. Can once per every other turn, banish a monster on the field without targeting at a cost of sending a Fusion monster that lists ""Fallen of Albaz"" in its text from your Extra Deck to the GY. Also destroys all monsters your opponent controls during the End Phase of the turn it leaves the field.</li>
 	<li>Lubellion - One of the main reasons this deck can recycle. It Fusion Summons at a cost of a discard by shuffling the materials of that Fusion monster from your GY or banished to the deck. The second reason you can summon Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon in this deck.</li>
 	<li>Masquerade - The bane of combo decks. Makes your opponent pay taxes in LP for each time they attempt to activate a card or effect. This effect is not a once per copy, so having two of him stacks, bumping it up from 600 to 1200 LP per card or effect activation.</li>
 	<li>Titaniklad - Your main fodder for Mirrorjade, except this time, you won't be searching for a Dogmatika monster, but Special Summoning Fallen of Albaz instead as an interruption.</li>
 	<li>Albion - Ideally you'll be summoning him first before Lubellion, but he's the third reason you can summon Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon in this deck. It Fusion Summons without a cost by banishing the materials of that Fusion monster from your hand, field, and/or GY. It also sets you a Branded Spell/Trap from your Deck if it is sent to the GY this turn, ideally either <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a> for additional interruption or <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a> for protection.</li>
 	<li>Alba-Lenatus the Abyss Dragon - Punish any Dragon deck, Fuse using Albaz's effect OR, contact fusion using both fields for summoning. The second it touches the graveyard, you can search for any normal ""Fusion"" or ""Polymerization"" card, guess what that is, ding ding ding free DPE</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon Starving Venom Predapower Fusion Dragon</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a></strong> - Generic Super Poly targets, one of which has a pretty relevant interruption/floodgate effect, another that can use monsters on either field to negate effects with a predator counter on it.</li>
 	<li><strong>Blue Eyes Tyrant Dragon - </strong>Hex-Sealed target for 3400 beat stick monster that can attack all monsters your opponent controls, and can reset any trap in your graveyard</li>
</ul>
<strong>Final Thoughts</strong>

#1. Don't play it with them Brave Tokens. Not because you can, doesn't mean you should.
#2. This deck needs LIGHT targets, not overpriced engine that does nothing more for the deck. You'd be much better off running Kaijus instead. Speaking of which, if you want a free omni negate but also want a LIGHT target, just play Invoked in this deck, simple.
#3. If your deck can abuse Super Poly, there's no reason not to do it while it's still at 3.
#4. If your deck can abuse BOTH Dragoon and DPE, there's no reason not to do it while they're still both legal in the TCG

Overall, because there are some powerful monsters that can handle so many negates and play through so many damn effects and deal with some larger plays people may throw at you. Since people hate Verte, they hate fusions because of the free fusion summon. Again, thanks to Grayewick for the inspiration and his original list, I tweaked and played it differently, with my side deck being more intuned with copying him exactly."
