Rebuilt the routing to make it legal and made room for the HERO Engine. Use the extra deck in the order it's in, or use the HERO cards if you need to Faris early.

Shoutout to Team SamX1, because I got the idea from his combos. Sam, you've been hugely influential to me.

Fire Flint Lady is going to shake up this deck a whole lot, by giving easy access to 2 card combos that find you your mask changes and polys while setting up a negate (more if you run Apollousa). In the mean time I'm running Maurading Captain, to do the free extending part of things and maybe even search Mask Change off of Shadow Mist."

First the typing on the Fluffal monster give easy access to the shaddoll fusions like <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a> (<a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a>), and  <a data-name=""El Shaddol Shekhinaga"">El Shaddol Shekhinaga</a>( <a data-name=""Fluffal Ca"">Fluffal Ca</a>t, Dog, Rabbit, etc) and even <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> (<a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a>). The Typing is nice but what really matters is that most Several Fluffal monsters have effects that trigger off ANY fusion summon or benefit from being in grave. At a bare minimum the Shaddoll engine gives Fluffals some extenders/starters to help guarantee to break a board. At the maximum Shaddolls are a ridiculous value engine that create insane pluses off of every fusion. P.S. you can mill shaddolls off toy vendor for there effects.
<h3>How does the deck Play?</h3>
The deck plays like a build-a-bear combo, every hand is different but the different value engines all lead up to the same thing: fusion summoning cards like <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger,</a> <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken."">Frightfur Kraken, or El Shaddol Construct to </a><a data-name=""clear the way and then Fusion summoning some more and swinging for game"">clear the way and then Fusion summoning some more and swinging for game</a><a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken."">.</a>  A much simplier way to clear the board for your OTK's are with cards like <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> or <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>. Super poly has crazy synergy with Shaddolls as just 1 Shaddol + any monster is a fusion, and the deck also plays <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a> as an additional target, but another great use of Super poly is for a quick play fusion summon during the battle phase with your own monsters for extra attacks. If you don't draw a super poly or a dark ruler the deck can play around negates simply by playing more cards than your opponent can respond too. Cards like <a data-name=""Shaddoll fusion"">Shaddoll fusion</a>,<a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork""> Frightfur Patchwork</a>, and even just a basic <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> must be stopped by and opponent or they risk losing board state or card advantage.
<h3>What Weaknesses Does the Deck Have?</h3>
<a data-name=""Nibiru, The Primal Being"">Nibiru, The Primal Being</a>. Consistency, the deck is actually very consistent on its ability to get out a board that can OTK, but how good it is at breaking boards varies. Simply you wont have big cards like Super Polymerization or Dark Ruler No More in hand every game. However you can search Super Poly off <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda </a>and set up for a easy Mudragon by using anaconda's effect to make a monster Dark, its just a hard card to make at times. Lastly this deck really doesn't do great going first.
<h3>What to do Going First?</h3>
Try to make <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> like your life depends on it. Most decks struggle to out winda and even if they do it slows them down. My side deck plays some more Shaddoll monsters to increase the chance of making a decent shaddoll fusion. Outside of that just try and use some of your searchers like <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a>, and <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> to set up for your next turn."

I took that deck, and the advice from the comments of Hex_master, and came up with this.

Original Strategy from EmpatheticExodia below:

""To keep it short, here is the main strat.

1 Stall and get Mystic Mine out, invalidate most decks.

2 Use Judgment and Bribe to keep Mystic Mine out.

3a Use all the draw power you can till you get Exodia.

3b Use cards like Cosmic Cyclone to get your LP lower than your opponents.

1. Get two Gouki's on the field using cards like Suprex and Headbat

2. Link summon Isolde and search rematch, Headbat if you havn't used him, and discard fodder

3. use Isolde the pitch Phoenix Blade and summon either Guts or Octo

4. use headbat to summon itself

5. link summon The Powerload Ogre

6. use Rematch to summon two goukis

7. link summon Codebreaker Virus Swordsman so it is co-linked and use its effect to summon Zero Day

8. Link summon Codebreaker Virus Berserker using the other two Codebreakers so it is co-linked, and the summon them back

Between a frog engine and/or closing a Prank-Kids summoning loops on two Dropsies, you can go into TA first turn pretty much every turn, along with a couple Prank-Kids such as Bow-Wow-Bark and Battle Butler. TA can help protect your combos and stop your opponent's repeatedly as he summons frogs and Dodo-Doodle-Doo and Bow-Wow-Bark can infinitely feed Dropsies back to your hand as Aqua tributes, but we also have access to Invoked Raidjin and Millennium-Eyes Restrict through both Instant Fusion and legitimate methods (King of the Swamp), creating further difficulties for an opponent to get anything off. Fansies, Restrict, and even a Token can go into Linkuriboh, Cross-Sheep extends plays after fusions, Union Carrier equips frogs to Dropsies before it links off to further feed frogs into the grave for Ronintoadin plays, or pumps up a monster in a pinch. Accesscode Talker is an incredible board breaker when you're ready to go for the win, which we can make great use of as we run links of every attribute. If you don't have the cash for AT (understandable, got lucky from a pack myself), consider swapping Linkuriboh, Cross-Sheep, Union Carrier, and AT for Daigusto Emeral, Leviair, a second Bow-Wow, and Borreload/sword.

Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable x1
Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess x1
Saryuja Skull Dread x1
Draco Masters of the Tenyi x1
Borreload Savage Dragon x1

&nbsp;

The main goal of this deck is to run two dark souls first turn along with Goddess, Savage, and Gottoms on field. You can do this about 3/5 of the time.

&nbsp;

Saryuja Skull is the most important card in the extra deck for starting the chain. The deck is set up to almost always get 4 different monsters on the field with two cards in hand.

Allowing for a three card hand at the end.

&nbsp;

Main Tactic

MC -&gt; Summoner -&gt; Toss Magic Card -&gt; Cat -&gt; Dark Soul + Air = Link 4 go dread Draw 4 cards -&gt; Ferret(Monk(Full combo needs the ferret and not the monk)/Faul Troll (Hopefully). -&gt; Ferret Special by Dread -&gt; Ferret Effect -&gt; Dark Souls, Rag, Pasuul. If you've drawn the Pasuul or dark soul go with Rag, Tuner (level 1), Rescue Cat. This will allow for Goddess and Naturia Beast on Field. Which at least allow for negate of magic and monster cards plus a few other combos.

Overall I find that it can run a strong -2 to hand, Gooddess and Savage and Gottoms on feild.

to get the needed -2 from hand you run the following Reborn(link Succession), Faultroll, Ferret. The ferret grabs three sabers faultroll spawns off effect. Link off your rag, dark souls, Pasuul and dread, So Goddess is now at 3,200. Then after doing that bring out the level 3 tuner and sync off for Gottoms, link/reborn the rag. Two Sabers on Field allows for Troll to Summon, Pop the Rag and then Gottoms. Leaving you with Faultroll + Summon Pasuul to go into borrel so you will have the following in play Goddess at 3,200, -2 to the hand, 4 counter savage. Two Searching at end phase for Boggart and Rag.

&nbsp;

A lot more to do with this combo as well, you could just go for a plan old rip the whole hand as well if you choose.

This version here is my first complete Version wich is working pretty good.
Main Combo ist to use Raiden for a synchro summon to bring your Chaos Ruler on board. He is the main combo piece in every duell.

This version is a going second Version. I'm not shure if the shaddoll package will stay in this deck, but for now it pretty nice when you draw Shaddoll Fusion and you summon Construct. I will test a going first version soon, maybe with Phantom Knights and Dante or something like that.

This variant is a balance between a few different elements. For starters, I want to be able to combo off, if not in every hand, at least sometimes. It seems like making an Apollousa or Mechaba turn one to protect the Winda from the disruption it cares about (IE: Golden Lord) is really vital to winning, so I wanted to focus on beating Eldlich game 1, and bring in side deck cards for more combo heavy decks. Trick Clown and Damage Juggler are here for their combo potential - they're not strictly necessary but they enable turn 1 Apollousa + Mechaba + Winda, as well as easy turn 2 Accesscode. Called By the Grave is unusual here, in that we're really just trying to snipe/negate Golden Lords with it, not stop hand traps. D.D. Crow does stop most Linkross/Auroradon combos, and is also a Dark monster for Winda - Effect Veiler would help make Apollousa more often, but we're really trying to get Eldlich game 1. Aleister the Invoker/Magical Meltdown/Terraforming are all 1 card Mechabas as well, which helps give the deck a needed boost of consistency.

Cut most of the Shaddoll cards for more copies of Ariel, Resh Shaddoll Incarnation, and Damage Juggler. We're trying to make the combo less bricky, while also increasing the frequency with which we can banish cards with Ariel, leaving in the Falco, Squamata, Wendi, Incarnation chain. Added back in some Shaddolls to get a free search. Trying a low hand-trap count to fit in more Damage Juggler - against the FTK it IS a hand trap, and against Eldlich it is easy access to Apollousa.

Your main combo setup is Kageki with Kizaru, but with a few tech cards as support.

Since you have a plethora of searches for Kageki, you need only run 2, while Kizaru is a little harder to find. You can very easily make 2 Saryuja's in a turn so long as Nibiru does not show itself. You do have a few answers to Nibiru with your spells, so it isn't too big of a hurdle so long as you got through most of your cards getting to Isolde and Battle Shogun.

At times your opponent will get bored and ask if you are almost done because unfortunately, you do take your time to do a lot of setups so your opponent cannot respond in the following turn.

The best setup is to have the Kageki and Kizaru in hand or searched before you begin with a card that gains counters for gateway later, doesn't matter which card. Go into Isolde and add another Kageki, just in case, then send the following equips for Hatsume (or Kizaru if you didn't get him or one of the red/blue if you have the other in hand), Noble Arms, as it does nothing for you other than destroy a spell/trap for 500 atk points on a monster, Overdone Burial, as the cost is too high for what we usually want, it just helps out of sticky situations, and your choice between DDR or Living Fossil. DDR has proven to be more useful as you can get back one of the cards used for Hatsume's effect, and you have a lot of draw/search power in the deck once you get to Gateway with Battle Shogun's effect. Once you have Gateway, if it isn't destroyed from some effect, you are pretty good to go, your opponent can't stop you at that point and will usually forfeit. They ask if this is a hand loop, this is not that variant, but they will immediately go to the next game if they think it is and they don't have an answer. So you can fib, as it makes their hand useless, but you don't need them to know that.

Your ending board should have 2-3 of the following: Utopic ZEXAL which locks your opp out during their turn. Shi En as the staple negates 1 spell/trap. And Apollousa for your next turn, as ZEXAL protects you during your opponent's turn.

For siding, it is truly difficult to know what to side in/out of the deck as everything fills a specific purpose. The immediate answer is either the red reboot if you think your opponent doesn't have Infinite Impermanence or is an Altergeist deck as most decks can only stop you with hand traps. Prohibition is a tech choice of mine that allows me to say, I don't like this 1 card, so I'm going to let it not be part of the duel. This can be good if the only thing that can stop you is Nibiru, or ash blossom, or even an Imperm. The immediate ability to stop your opponent from even having the opportunity to perform an action is great, but it wont stop cards already on the field, so use it wisely.

&nbsp;

Alternate options for the deck are mostly replacing whats in the Extra or Side deck. For Extra deck, you can replace the Beast/Barkion cards for Abyss Dweller to stop combos that happen due to in grave effects or even a Naturia Landoise to negate monster effects if you have enough cards in hand to handle its cost. For side deck, you can always add in Ash Blossoms or Infinite Imperms in place of the royal decree or token collector. The side deck, in my opinion, is where you can throw in your special brand of techs. Back in 2014, I would run Fencing Fire Ferret in my side deck for a Madolche deck as there were a lot of destruction effects that were prevalent. It helped me to get my first top and would single-handedly win some games because people didn't think of that card. You can even change the number of certain Six Sams in deck if you feel that you need to get to other parts of the deck faster. Red/Blue is not mandatory for the deck, but it helps to either 1, get more counters, 2 get to Rebarian Shark for your ZEXAL. Squire is there as another option for a Lvl 1 target for Shien's Dojo that can be revived with Gateway. So experiment with this as the base, and see if there are areas for it to improve for you."

Obviously this doesn't always work out as planned, and when it fails D/D/D transitions into a resource based grind using Savant Kepler and Savant Thomas.

&nbsp;

The primary matchup that is difficult for D/D/D is unfortunately the meta deck of this cup, Eldlich; The fact that Eldlich's hand effect is non-destruction means that it circumvents D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh's float, providing the opponent an easy out to the deck's main setup. Additionally, a freshly summoned Eldlich has attack tied with even D/D/D's biggest bunguses, and can just crash into my bosses by battle.

""The major change I would make to my deck is that Go! D/D/D Divine Zero King Rage should have been legal this month and will be going forward, the card is amazing for the deck, fulfilling the same role as D/D Savant Thomas while also being a game-ending option. The only other changes I would make are in my sidedeck, dependent on the results of the upcoming banlist and the predicted metagame resulting.""

The new F.A. field spell is a 0 card Halq and it doesnt even consume your normal summon. Combine it with powerful normal summon l","Boring deck but strong, you need Hyper Stadium + Meltdown to complete the 0 card engine. Stadium searches Auto Navigator (tuner), use Stadium extra normal summon by revealing Meltdown, normal summon Navigator, use Navigator add Stadium (+1), then play your Invoked line (+1). You will end on Savage + Arc Light + Raidjin on regular basis. Windwitch line is there using lv7 Wind Pegasus for extra interaction, making the line has 2 pseudo interruption, so it's still worth despite the restriction.

Pros: Strong rogue contender, acceptable end board, recursive as hell (less than Shaddoll tho), many staples slot.

Cons: Boring (hence the less explanation), too many counter for this deck cus meta is also combo deck."

So I remembered that everyones been using the 1 card full Synchro combo using <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> and <a data-name=""Jet Synchron."">Jet Synchron</a><a data-name=""Jet Synchron."">.</a> Sadly, Jet Synchron is a one card disaster. The combo goes like this: Normal Jet -&gt; Linkuriboh, Jet summon back, both -&gt; Halqifibrax, effect to summon <a data-name=""Orcust Brass Bombard"">Orcust Brass Bombard</a>. Linkross 2 tokens, Brass + 1 token -&gt; formula synchron -&gt; metal marcher summon back Bombard. At this point you still have the rest of your hand to use and you should be able to get out <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> and use Brass + Knightmare -&gt; Borreload Savage Dragon -&gt; equip Halqifibrax, then full Orcust combo from there. After testing this deck doesn't really brick. Its pretty consistent and can play well against other competitive decks. Hope you guys enjoy!"
