a) if you have dragoons, marksman, or infantry in your hand, use them in the enemy turn for, search one sea serpent, or destroy a set card on the opponent field, or destroy a face up card on the opponent field, also bring one mermail in add to your hand that could be abyssteus

b)if this card is destroyed and sent to the graveyard by your opponent effect or cause your opponent destroy it in battle, you can throw one water monster from your deck to the graveyard and then special summon one water monster from the graveyard, yo can use this for throw the crystal girl and bring it from the graveyard for activate her effect in the turn of the enemy, or if you have the field bring the citadel whale and since it was special summoned you can bring the sea stealth attack from the deck to the field, or if you have the legendary  fisherman III in your hand, use her for bring the legendary fisherman II

I heard some of your recommendations, so i made the deck a little bit small reducing some non very important cards and also i add some more synchro in the deck that could be more useful in more situations"

My first thought about the <strong>Armed Dragon Thunder</strong> monsters were that ""Holy crap, this is so good (for a retrain)."" We are using <strong>Armed Dragon Thunder LV 3</strong> and <strong>Armed Dragon Flash</strong> as a <strong>Rokket Quick Launch</strong> substitute with<strong> LV 3</strong> being more card advantage if it is discarded. This deck (from what I got out of testing) can make at least 2 negates and some large bodies (I'm not the best combo player so don't take my word for it; a good combo player can find ways to make more negates).

This deck needs grave set-up early game to have some revival effects be used.<strong> Dragunity Remus, Dragon Shrine, Dragon Ravine</strong>, and<strong> Cards of Consonance</strong> allow for this. Possible starters for this deck include any of the effects that activate upon a normal summon. These include <strong>Dragunity Aklys, Dragunity Dux, Dragunity Guisarme,</strong> or <strong>Armed Dragon Flash</strong> (to get to <strong>Romulus</strong> or <strong>Guardragons</strong>). Your follow-up is using <strong>Dragunity Arma Mystletainn</strong> to get a possible Synchro material and a <strong>Dragunity</strong> Tuner from when it specials after being equipped. <strong>Dragunity Divine Lance</strong> does the same thing by equipping a <strong>Dragunity</strong> tuner from the deck.

Extenders include literally any non-opt summon from spell/trap zone <strong>Dragunity</strong> Tuner, <strong>Dragunity Arma Gram, Dragunity Remus</strong>, and <strong>Dragunity Legatus</strong>. These special summon themselves for you to get extra link or synchro material. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Barcha</strong> is a great extender, but it's difficult to make once you get deep into your <strong>Guardragon</strong> combo since it needs Winged Beasts.

Searchers include <strong>Dragunity Glow, Dragon Ravine, Dragunity Knight - Romulus</strong>, and <strong>Dragunity Divine Lance.</strong>

Extra Deck includes <strong>Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana</strong> which is a decent option instead of <strong>Barcha,</strong> but it's only here if you can't make<strong> Barcha</strong>. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Luin</strong> is the better option than<strong> Vajrayana</strong> if you can make it. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg</strong> is a searcher and grave set-up. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Barcha</strong> is the best play extender, but is hard to make after your <strong>Guardragon</strong> combo. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Ascalon</strong> is a potential removal option going second, but is a way better floater going first. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Areadbhair</strong> is one of your negates and a <strong>Heavy Storm</strong> when destroyed. <strong>Borreload Savage</strong> because it's an omni-negate, but it does not destroy (WTF???). <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong> is another negate and is an okay choice of negation in this format. <strong>Borrelsword Dragon</strong> is for going second big brrrrrr damage. <strong>Saryuja</strong> is a play extender and another choice for a play extender. <strong>Dragunity Knight - Romulus</strong> is the major extender in this deck. <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres</strong> is a bounce and a floater. <strong>Triple Burst Dragon, Guardragon Pisty</strong>, and <strong>Guardragon Elpy</strong> are for your <strong>Guardragon</strong> Combo.

Side Deck has<strong> Koa'ki Meru Drago</strong> for prevention of <strong>Golden Lord</strong>,<strong> Borreload Savage</strong>, <strong>Borrelsword</strong>, and <strong>Chaos Dragons</strong>(?). <strong>Dragunity of the Hurricane</strong> is for going second or playing on your opponent's turn. <strong>Cosmic</strong> is for more backrow removal. <strong>Called By the Grave</strong> is here if you go against a handtrap-ccentric deck. <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> for the negations.

I really want to make an<strong> Armed Dragon Thunder</strong> deck, but I'm still thinking of a possible engine to put in instead of just simply<strong> Guardragons</strong>.

You would activate Black Garden, then normal summon a musket. That would then trigger Black Garden to give your opponent a token. Once you do that, you can go into Max. Due to how the chain works, you can have Black Garden be Chain Link 2 to give your opponent the token, then use Max effect to search 2. The only problem with this strategy is that it leaves Max somewhat vulnerable, so I would recommend playing cards that can restrict your opponent from killing your Max, preferably Mystic Mine, although you could use anything that protects Max from battle. Outside of the musket cards and black garden, you could run essentially whatever other cards you wish for the deck. This build uses eXceed for Bagooska plays in case you either need a floodgate that can help protect Max if you don't have access to Mine and Extravagance adds needed draw power to a deck that needs it. If you can't afford Extravagance, you could play Desires instead and doing so could also allow you to have a more open extra deck while also allowing some musket effects to go off. Do keep in mind that banishing the targets for Max does suck, so be careful with that. It isn't a perfect list by far, but I think it does add a going first option for Muskets that I felt like they lacked. If there is any advice you could give me, that would be great. I hope you enjoy the build and have fun! :)"

It's fairly consistent but suffers from interruptions, which is why the deck is not going to be meta in its current iteration. It's too reliant on Magistus Zoroa (the tuner that allows searching through Artemis, special summon, AND Halqi access) to pull off its shenanigans. That is why the deck does not have enough hand traps; they reduce the consistency with which you can play Zoroa turn 1. Hard draw, summoner monk, Artemis search through Endymion, foolish burial or Crowley + Vritra Magistus—these are the ways for getting to Zoroa.

&nbsp;

The strategy is to somehow have Masquerena and Halqi on the field (Zoroa search and special summon helps with this a lot). Your target for Halqi is O-Lion. Then, you get Linkross from Halqi, which will grant you two tokens. Then, link summon Metal Marcher and get a level 3 token plus revive your Zoroa. Then, you can synchro summon Savage from the 2 tokens (3+1) and Zoroa (4). You can summon Crusadia Avramax with Marcher, Masquerena, and Linkross.

&nbsp;

If you have an extender plus a Dogmatika in hand or if you have Reborn, you can even summon Halqi a second time for shenanigans during the opponent's turn. For instance, after negating with Savage, you can summon Formula Synchron for a draw, then you can synchro summon using Formula's effect for Stardust Warrior, which will give you a summon negation and a floating effect if it gets removed.

&nbsp;

If you have only one extender (like a spare Dogmatika), you can change the play around a bit. With Linkross, just summon 1 token instead of 2. Then, do the combo normally until you get Crusadia Avramax. Afterwards, alongside Avramax, you will have Zoroa, O-lion token, and your extender (Dogmatika for example). Summon your second Halqi with Zoroa and level 4 extender (NOT TOKEN). Then, next turn, summon Wonder Magician with Halqi for S/T pop, after which you can summon Savage dragon with Wonder Magician's effect and your level 3 token. If you want, you can change your ED so that with Halqi, you can summon Desert Locusts into Ravenous Crocodragon. Personally, I prefer getting Savage for negation but in some matches, the card ripping effect of Locusts may become relevant.

&nbsp;

Overall, the deck is obviously not going to compete with the meta decks, because of its vulnerability to interruptions. Also, because it has a hard time going second due to the lack of hand traps. However, it's a really fun deck to pilot because of the complexity and the satisfaction of beating opponents down with Avramax.

&nbsp;

Please feel free to suggest edits, both for the Main Deck and the ED/SD.

The deck wants to go first. It doesn't brick much at all and since it has so many engines built into it the deck has so many recovery plays its insane. By using <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> to send the Shaddoll engine to the grave to search and recover <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism. And all the Golden Land cards have graveyard effects plus are tribute fodder for the True Draco monsters which is amazing. The engines have so much synergy with each other. Not to mention that sending the True Draco spells and traps using the Golden Lord triggers their effects which is really good. Also, for those who are confused about why Crystron Haqlifibrax is in the extra deck, its because its a Cherry's target since basically every deck is playing it right now. In my opinion using Cherry's to get rid of it makes your opponent at a huge disadvantage especially for those synchro variant decks where they go into </a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon with Haqlifibrax and another machine monster... Without Haqlifibrax they'll need some other machine monster(s) to go into full synchro combo. I hope you guys enjoy the deck, and stick around for more!</a>"

just try to get out king as fast as possible then activate ground collapse while the opponent has an empty field to cripple them beyond repair.

the easiest way to do this is to use fusion recycling plant to discard an ojamagic and then nab a poly from the deck or gy and then grab the three ojamas boom instant king then activate ground collapse from hand.

ths deck is mainly for going first but if you are going second using red to swarm and summon multiple xyz will do like. sky cavalry centaurea or cat shark and gachi gachi with ojama country"

The deck basically works with the Prologue of the Destruction combo, sending cards to the graveyard and summoning (by special summoning) Buster Dragon. Finally, he banishes the Destruction Sword Memories from his graveyard (which was sent there by Prologue) to summon the merger of the Buster Blader, which will be equipped with the Dragon Buster Destruction Sword, because of the effect of the Buster Dragon.

(And also a reference to Kevin Hart)","

&nbsp;

Well, here's a deck that I never thought would become good: Melffy.

&nbsp;

This here is a Tribrigade Melffy deck that uses the latter's newest piece of support, an Xyz Monster called Excited Melffys. Because of that card's name, I decided to name this deck ""So Excited!!"", after a joke from Kevin Hart's comedy tour ""Irresponsible Tour.""

&nbsp;

The ""So Excited!"" joke: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUJVkj2FK00&amp;t=49s</a>

&nbsp;

Due to this deck's abundance of hand traps, Lightning Storm, and Dark Ruler No More, you absolutely HAVE to go second. So Excited's strategy is to use whatever cards you have to punish your opponent's plays, then summon a Rank 2 Xyz--most likely Excited Melffys--to battle with, and then use that to summon Negalogia AA-Zeus after it battles. Also, the Tribrigade Monsters and 3 copies of Tenki are there as play extenders.

The ""Jurrac"" is from way back during the Duel Terminal/Hidden Arsenal era and, even though it pains me to say that, their overall age shows in the power level of the cardboard in question. The archetype itself is consisting entirely of Fire Dinosaur monsters, who (except for some rare cases) do not manage to get over 1700 ATK without a tribute or Extra Deck access and try to lower the opposing life points over the course of multiple turns, since they will most likely not have enough fighting power to OTK to opponent. They also focus on fighting monsters and various members of the archetype profit from destroying opposing monsters in form of being able to use various effects. But despite their shortcomings, they can be used as an effective albeit slow beatdown deck that is easy to play and has some fun plays up its sleeve.</p>
<p>The ""Jurrac"" part of the deck is three copies of ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Aeolo"">Jurrac Aeolo</a>"", your Level 1 tuner and a ""<a data-name=""Circle of the Fire Kings"">Circle of the Fire Kings</a>"" on legs exclusively for ""Jurracs"", three copies of ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Guaiba"">Jurrac Guaiba</a>"", since it is the most used and useful beater who Special summons other ""Jurracs"" when destroying monsters in battle, two ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Monoloph"">Jurrac Monoloph</a>"" who can be cloggy due to the low ATK of 1500 but can become a ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" in monster form with ATK boosts or ""<a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>"" and two ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Velo"">Jurrac Velo</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Dino"">Jurrac Dino</a>"" respectively, who are both not that useful but one can potentially still fetch monsters while the other is a Level 3 Tuner monster.</p>
<p>Help for the deck comes in form of various other Dinosaur monsters. ""<a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a>"" is really good in any Dinosaur-based deck, which high stats, easy summoning condition, helpful setup and disruption at Quick Effect-speed. One copy of ""<a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>"" is also Special summonable with high stats and can destroy stuff by tributing a ""Dinowrestler"" monster, which in this deck is even possible without ""<a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>"" killing itself due to the Special summonable Level 2 Tuner ""<a data-name=""Dinowrestler Coelasilat"">Dinowrestler Coelasilat</a>"". Two copies of ""<a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a>"" are both setup and search, while I personally like ""<a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a>"" at three, since it not only protects your board but can also just banish itself from the graveyard during your turn to Special summon an ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Aeolo"">Jurrac Aeolo</a>"" from your deck at no additional cost.</p>
<p>The Spells and Traps are mostly for consistency and ATK manipulation. On the consistency side of things, we have one ""<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>"" (as either cheeky removal via ""<a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>"" or added material for Synchro summons by summoning ""<a data-name=""Pragtical"">Pragtical</a>""), two ""<a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>"" (since card draw is important and this is the best option to play in this deck since you will miss none of the cards if they are removed), a copy of ""<a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>"" (easy ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Aeolo"">Jurrac Aeolo</a>"" search, who can then either be used for Extra Deck summons or to revive a ""Jurrac"" monster from the graveyard, possibly even the one you discarded as cost), two ""<a data-name=""Fossil Dig"">Fossil Dig</a>"" (Dinosaur searcher) and one ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" (as setup for ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Aeolo"">Jurrac Aeolo</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a>"") . On the ATK manipulation side, we have ""<a data-name=""Lost World"">Lost World</a>"" (protection for your Dinosaur monsters, easy monster summoning to the opponent's side of the field for later battle destruction and ATK decrease for pretty much every your opponent is going to play), two ""<a data-name=""Rocket Hand"">Rocket Hand</a>"" (ATK booster with added removal) and two ""<a data-name=""Rising Fire"">Rising Fire</a>"" (slightly weaker ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" effect, but adds 500 ATK to the revived monster and banishes something when being destroyed).</p>
<p>The Extra Deck usage is rather situational. There are Link, Xyz and Synchro monsters, which a lot of monster combinations in the deck being able to summon something useful to the field, but due to the nature of the deck, you cannot always go into the same options since you will not have the necessary resources to do so. ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Dolkka"">Evolzar Dolkka</a>"" are really good Stun monsters and relatively easy to summon in this deck, the Link monsters really just cover your bases when the monsters combinations on the field don't allow for anything else (""<a data-name=""Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze"">Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze</a>"" as a recovery tool, ""<a data-name=""Duelittle Chimera"">Duelittle Chimera</a>"" as a stat booster, and the ""Knightmare"" monsters for graveyard setup and destruction effects). The Synchro line-up consists of ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Velphito"">Jurrac Velphito</a>"" (kills certain ""<a data-name=""Marshmallon"">Marshmallon</a>""-esque monsters if necessary) and ""<a data-name=""Hi-Speedroid Chanbara"">Hi-Speedroid Chanbara</a>"" (double attacker which gets more powerful for every attack) for Level 5, ""<a data-name=""Coral Dragon"">Coral Dragon</a>"" for Level 6 (more of a filler, since combinations like ""<a data-name=""Dinowrestler Coelasilat"">Dinowrestler Coelasilat</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a>"" rarely happen, but offers a destruction effect and card draw when destroyed), and ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" (board-wipe) and ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Giganoto"">Jurrac Giganoto</a>"" (alternative beatstick) for Level 7. The last two monsters are ""<a data-name=""Dinowrestler Giga Spinosavate"">Dinowrestler Giga Spinosavate</a>"", who plays very well in the deck by aggroing opposing attacks while offering 3000 ATK and a solid set of effects, and ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Meteor"">Jurrac Meteor</a>"", which is the actual boss monster of the ""Jurrac"" archetype and offers the same effect as ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" for more costs, but summons a ""Jurrac"" Tuner from your graveyard afterwards. I would only ever go into ""Meteor"" if the opponent is weak enough to be finished by a 1700 ATK ""<a data-name=""Jurrac Dino"">Jurrac Dino</a>"", otherwise it is probably not worth summoning it.</p>
<p>And that is the deck. ""Jurracs"" are sadly not even close to being a viable archetype, but they are easy to learn and understand, which could make them a nice first deck for beginners. With the added support they should still be able to win a game or two, especially in a more casual and friendly environment.

<strong>Adamancipator Analyzer</strong> special summons himself if you have no monsters, then excavate and special summon <strong>Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite</strong> if possible. If not, either of the other two <strong>Adamancipator Crystal</strong> monsters will do.

<strong>Adamancipator Researcher</strong> Special Summons herself when you have another Rock-type monster on the field then excavate and special summon <strong>Adamancipator Crystal - Raptite</strong>. If not, the other two will do.

<strong>Admancipator Seeker</strong> summons himself if you have another ""Admancipator"" monster is on the field. Then once again excavate and special summon <strong>Adamancipator Crystal - Leonite</strong> if possible, other wise like the other two go for the other <strong>Adamancipator Crystal</strong> monsters.

Once you have used any of your Tuners' effects, Synchro summon for any of the <strong>Adamancipator Risen</strong> monsters. Your main boss monsters are in order.

<strong>Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</strong>. Not only does he give a strong field advantage when using his excavation skill allowing you to return opponents cards to their hand up to the No. of excavated Rock-type monsters by this effect. During your Opponents turn he can negate any one effect and destroy it as long as you have a WATER monster in your graveyard. Making him a great disruption card.

<strong>Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</strong> allows you to add 1 excavated ""Adamancipator"" card to your hand, and if you have a FIRE monster in your graveyard during your opponents turn you can special summon any Rock-type monster from your graveyard. <strong>Leonite's</strong> first ability is great to add a little extra padding if you are in need of it, or setting up for your next turn.

<strong>Adamancipator Risen - Raptite</strong> is much like the Adamancipator ""Tuners"" in the aspect of special summoning an excavated monster, but this time its not limited to only ""Non-Tuner"" monsters. If you have a WIND monster in your graveyard you can banish one of your opponents cards in their graveyard during their turn. This card is best candidate to Syncrho summoning <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong> using any level 2 ""Tuners"" you may have on hand.

<strong>Adamancipator Laputite</strong> the field spell card allows you to stack your deck and gives a nice 500 ATK and DEF boost to all your Rock-type monsters. So if you are able to summon<strong> Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</strong>, <strong>Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</strong>, and <strong>Adamancipator Risen - Raptite</strong> and have <strong>Adamancipator Laputite</strong> on the field on your first turn. Is a perfect set up for ant FTK. Use <strong>Adamancipator Laputite</strong> to stack the top of your deck with five ""Adamancipator"" monsters then useing <strong>Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</strong> effect to return practically all of your opponents cards to their hand. Basically leaving your opponent wide open for 9,100 worth of damage ending the dual.

If you don't have <strong>Analyzer</strong> in your hand but you have <strong>Doki Doki</strong> plus any of the <strong>Koa'ki Meiru</strong> monsters. This sets you up to search out and summon <strong>Analyzer</strong>. By first normal summoning <strong>Doki Doki</strong> then using <strong>Doki Doki's</strong> effect by discarding the <strong>Koa'ki Meiru</strong> and then proceed to search and summon <strong>Analyzer</strong>. Then excavate, summon and Syncrho summon.

If your <strong>Adamancipator Risen</strong> monster are defeated don't worry too much. As long as their corresponding <strong>Adamancipator Crystal</strong> monster is in the graveyard you can return them to the extra deck as long as they are not banished also recycling the<strong> Adamancipator Crystal</strong> back to the top of your deck.

As for the <strong>Adamancipator Crystals'</strong> first effects. <strong>Dragite's</strong> is the best, when it is special summoned by one of the Apamancipators' effects allows you to draw a card. <strong>Leonite</strong> will allow you to recycle any ""Adamancipator"" card to the top of your deck from your graveyard or your hand. Great for recycling used spell or trap cards. <strong>Raptite</strong> will recycle any Rock-type monster to the top of your deck from either the hand or graveyard. I believe this doesn't need to be said but <em><strong>ALWAYS</strong></em> leave at least one of each <strong>Adamancipator Crystal</strong> monster in the graveyard so you can utilize the Synchro monsters' second effects and you'll have the recycling effects of the Crystal monsters if its needed.

The other extra deck monsters are situational cards or just because I think the look cool (The Red Dragon cards). Generally the deck is consistent enough for the first strategy to fire quickly and fast enough to not be in those situations.

Major weaknesses are cards that prevent Special summoning, Search prevention, and banishing.

Edit: So I took out some cards out of the extra and add different ones. So the main change is that <strong>Old Entity Hastorr</strong> has been added. This was to make <strong>Red Supernova Dragon</strong> viable. However, <strong>Supernova</strong> is still tricky to get out. So summoning <strong>Supernova</strong> is mostly gimmicky but is doable, and if your starting hand is <strong>Doki Doki</strong>, <strong>Analyzer</strong>, <strong>Researcher</strong> x2, or <strong>Seeker</strong> x2, or one of each, and<strong> Adamancipator Signs</strong>. If you go first summon <strong>Doki Doki</strong> and use his effect discarding <strong>Analyzer</strong> to summon another one from your deck. then use <strong>Researcher's</strong> and/or <strong>Seeker's</strong> effect to special summon themselves. You could use the second effect of <strong>Researcher</strong> and/or <strong>Seeker</strong> to excavate. Then synchro summon <strong>Old Entity Hastorr</strong> using <strong>Doki Doki</strong> and which ever tuner you used to excavate. Then use <strong>Adamancipator Signs</strong> to bring back the Turner you used to summon <strong>Hastorr</strong>. Then Syncrho summon for <strong>Red Supernova Dragon</strong>. Then Enjoy your 6000 (due to having 4 tuners in the graveyard) destruction immune beat stick. If you go Second just do the same thing."

Step 2: Stall and let Photon Satellite Boost up it's level each turn

Step 3: ???

Step 4: Profit","Target: Get <a data-name=""The Calculator"">The Calculator</a> to millions of ATK points.

Since almost anything meta relevant can deny the attack of  The Calculator or destroy the setup even before it's happening, this is an absolute <strong>Gimmick Deck!</strong>

Build:

The only cards you really need are: 3x <a data-name=""Photon Satellite"">Photon Satellite</a> &amp; 3x <a data-name=""The Calculator"">The Calculator</a>
I also highly recommend to run 3x <a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a> in order to get 3 Photon Satellite on the board ASAP.
The rest of the deck are just generic stall or draw cards.

Strategy:
<ol>
 	<li>Get <a data-name=""Photon Satellite"">Photon Satellite</a> out ASAP</li>
 	<li>Stall the duel so Photon Satellite are multiply their level each turn.</li>
 	<li>If you reached the desired total level, summon <a data-name=""The Calculator"">The Calculator</a></li>
 	<li>If you play against a heavy backrow deck, maybe put some backrow-removal cards in your deck (see sidedeck)</li>
 	<li>Go for lethal with your millions of ATK</li>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFTbj3rBVRc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=lordkai

if u open  1 fusion spell   1 wendi/squamata  + any of the performage  is full combo ,
you can also archive the combo using other cards on the deck like foolish borial , the mathematician or instant teleport .

With the room saved from not needing polymerization, ultra polymerization, or cards that search them, it is able to play a plethora of hand traps, making it much stronger at going 2nd compared to other builds, while not sacraficing much strength in going first.

&nbsp;

This build is focussed more on TCG rules, even though it has crossout designator. Parallel exceed cannot chain block using OCG rules like it can here in the TCG:/

&nbsp;

Either way, this is a super rewarding deck to become familiar with!"

This deck has 7 hard bricks that you don't want to draw (3x Neos, Rainbow Dragon, Burstinatrix, Avian, Neo space). You could reduce this to 6 bricks by swapping out ""Favourite hero"" and ""Neo Space"" (as neo space is the weakest card on this list)."
