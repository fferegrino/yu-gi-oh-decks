The members of this archetype are based on <a class=""extiw"" title=""wikipedia:Yōkai"">yōkai</a> from Japanese folklore and from Chinese mythology. The Main Deck monsters appear to be the humanoid form of the Extra Deck Monsters of the same kind of ""Mayakashi"" (e.g. ""Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi"" transforms into ""Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi"").  The main strategy of this archetype is to Synchro Summon each Synchro Monster, one after the other, primarily by using the effect of ""<a title=""Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dakki,_the_Graceful_Mayakashi"">Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi</a>"". It can be easily Special Summoned by ""<a title=""Hajun, the Winged Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Hajun,_the_Winged_Mayakashi"">Hajun, the Winged Mayakashi</a>"". The said Synchro Monsters are <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Side-unique"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Side-unique"">side-unique</a> and have 2 effects, following the pattern below:   	<i>● If your Synchro Monster whose original Level is [two Levels higher than its own Level] is destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect while this card is in your GY: You can banish 1 other Zombie monster from your GY, and if you do, Special Summon this card.</i>  	<i>● If this card is Special Summoned from the GY: You can [...]</i>  The only exception to the first effect is ""<a title=""Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Gashadokuro,_the_Skeletal_Mayakashi"">Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi</a>"", a Level 11 monster that requires a Link monster to be destroyed, instead. The archetype in fact has a Link monster, the Link-2 ""<a title=""Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Yuki-Onna,_the_Ice_Mayakashi"">Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi</a>"", that cannot be targeted for attacks while pointing to a Synchro Monster and that halves the ATK/DEF of a monster when a Synchro Monster is destroyed by the opponent.  The second Trigger Effect of the ""Mayakashi"" monsters range from immunity against destruction/effects to card destruction and Deck milling. They can be used by being preemptively Special Summoned from the Graveyard by generic effects such as ""<a title=""Book of Life"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Book_of_Life"">Book of Life</a>"", ""<a title=""Mezuki"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mezuki"">Mezuki</a>"", and ""<a title=""Call of the Haunted"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Call_of_the_Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>"", for example, or by ""<a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Return of the Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Return_of_the_Mayakashi"">Return of the Mayakashi</a>"". The two latter can be used to disrupt the opponent's plays, by Special Summoning the ""Mayakashi"" during their turn. Also, if their second effect is triggered by their own <a title=""Condition"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Condition"">condition</a>, they can be combined with ""<a title=""Shiranui"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Shiranui"">Shiranui</a>"" monsters, that can have their effects triggered when banished, especially ""<a title=""Shiranui Spiritmaster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Shiranui_Spiritmaster"">Shiranui Spiritmaster</a>"".  Since this deck can place many different monster in the GY in one turn, ""<a title=""Orbital Hydralander"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Orbital_Hydralander"">Orbital Hydralander</a>"" can be easily summoned and its effect allows the player to destroy a opponent's card while milling the deck.  While it seems that rapid Synchro Summoning in one turn is great since it could bring the 3300-ATK ""Gashadokuro"" on the field easily, the Synchro Monsters actually unlock their full abilities when they are Special Summoned from the Graveyard; in other words, their existence on the field after their initial Synchro Summon is nothing but as monsters that rely on their ATKs only. Cards that shut down the Graveyard, such as ""<a title=""Necrovalley"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a>"" and ""<a title=""Soul Drain"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Soul_Drain"">Soul Drain</a>"" are obvious threats to this Deck and one-shot options such as ""<a title=""Called by the Grave"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Called_by_the_Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>"", ""<a title=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghost_Belle_%26_Haunted_Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a>"" and ""<a title=""D.D. Crow"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/D.D._Crow"">D.D. Crow</a>"" can also be used against it.  The narrow variety of effects can also be a problem, as most Decks nowadays benefit from having their cards destroyed (""<a title=""Tengu, the Winged Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tengu,_the_Winged_Mayakashi"">Tengu</a>"", ""<a title=""Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Yoko,_the_Graceful_Mayakashi"">Yoko</a>"") or their Main Deck milled (""<a title=""Tsuchigumo, the Poisonous Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tsuchigumo,_the_Poisonous_Mayakashi"">Tsuchigumo</a>""), rendering the opponent still able to rebuild their strategy or even benefit from the effect of the ""Mayakashi"" monsters.  ""<a title=""Kaiju"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Kaiju"">Kaiju</a>"" monsters and similar removal mechanics, that bypass the requirement of the Synchro/Link Monsters to be <i>destroyed</i>, can also be an efficient way to avoid the Synchro monsters lurking in the Graveyard, waiting for the on-field monster to be destroyed, leaving the player with no option to Special Summon them and trigger their effects, unless they have cards like ""Call of the Haunted"", ""Mezuki"" or ""Book of Life"", which in turn could still be countered by the likes of ""Called by the Grave"".  The archetype is related to the ""<a title=""Shiranui"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Shiranui"">Shiranui</a>"" archetype. The shrine that appears in the artwork of ""<a title=""Mayakashi Return"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mayakashi_Return"">Mayakashi Return</a>"" is the same as in the artwork of ""<a title=""Shiranui Style Samsara"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Shiranui_Style_Samsara"">Shiranui Style Samsara</a>"", also, ""Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi"" appears in the artwork of ""<a title=""Ghost Meets Girl - A Shiranui's Story"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ghost_Meets_Girl_-_A_Shiranui%27s_Story"">Ghost Meets Girl - A Shiranui's Story</a>"" alongside ""<a title=""Shiranui Squire"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Shiranui_Squire"">Shiranui Squire</a>"", presumably inside the said shrine, while ""<a title=""Fateful Hour"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fateful_Hour"">Fateful Hour</a>"" shows a confrontation of ""<a title=""Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Yoko,_the_Graceful_Mayakashi"">Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi</a>"" and ""<a title=""Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Shiranui_Skillsaga_Supremacy"">Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy</a>""."

I am not really a fan of the meta Link decks, so I made this WITHOUT any Link Monsters or Pendulums in mind (feel free to tweak the Main and/or Extra Deck at your heart's desire, though). This is an up-to-date version of my favorite Chaos deck that includes 3 copies of ""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"" as a staple. Feel free to check out my Blue-Eyes and Red-Eyes variants of this build if you're interested in trying those out! Essentially you run this like you would any Chaos deck with the Lightsworn engine, but with Darkest Diabolos for an anti-Kaiju move and Levianeer for your flexible 2nd-turn game. I hope you enjoy this deck as much as I do!"

Includes support for a Red-Eyes engine in the Side Deck if you ,"This is the Red-Eyes variant of my Chaos Dragons deck. Unlike my Blue-Eyes Chaos build, this deck is more focused on using Red-Eyes for Fusion material and then taking advantage of its DARK Attribute in the GY. It still play very similarly to its Blue-Eyes counterpart, but feels a tad more flexible during the duel. Instead of an secondary strategy in the Side Deck, Red-Eyes gets a few cards for support you can play around with. On top of that, the Side Deck contains Dragon's Rage for those piercing attacks-- a favorite of mine for aggressive casual play. I would recommend swapping the Lightsworn engine for some Red-Eyes support if you want to use them, however, as they don't mesh well in the build. Though I prefer the Blue-Eyes variant, I thought I'd post this in case anyone is bigger fan of Red-Eyes. I hope you enjoy it!"

It's a commonly known Thunder Guardragon, but with a twist(again). Basically, I really dislike using Sekka's Light, so I don't crowd my deck with 37 monsters and only 3 spells. I also dislike using ""Danger!"", but that doesn't mean I dislike using ""Danger!?"", the more ""balanced"" Dangers (in my opinion). One of the spiciest cards, in my opinion, is Omni Dragon Brotaur. It is a free search for Diabolos, Phantazmay, etc if it targets itself for its search effect. The only problem with this deck is Ash Blossom... But that's why we run 3 Called by the Grave lol. Hope you enjoy this deck! Comment down on what I can improve. Thanks! :D"

A simple lockdown deck/Mill deck to fool around with your opponent. Heat Wave is a card which can stall out in case you didn't open up with your keycards. Field Barrier will save your mystic mine from popping itself and even your opponent twin twister at times, which you can activate if you go first without worrying about not having <a data-name=""Metaverse"">Metaverse</a> or DotL. <a data-name=""Prohibition"">Prohibition </a>is mostly used after activating <a data-name=""Contract with Don Thousand"">Contract with Don Thousand</a> and shouldn't be used to guess what card your opponent has in their hand unless you are certain they have that card (most preferably a spell card which also prevents them from setting it). Once you Establish board with the cars I mentioned you pretty much win the game. If your opponent does manage to activate a trap card, there's always Dark Bribe. Tea Break may also help against hard once per turn Spell/Trap Cards (only on your turn is it good).  To completely prevent your opponent from even blowing up your Field Spell card and many measures to prevent your opponent for responding to much. Really good going first, and not too bad going second. It can be Anti-Meta if you want it to, I believe it fits the criteria well.  &nbsp;"

There are many variations of this play which end up netting you celfon.  Sometimes needlefiber summons lantron just so that remoten can net you celfon by banishing him and then often times platinum gadget summons the said celfon.  &nbsp;  Symphonic guitars can also summon Symphonic warrior bases which enables your where arf thou. Often times he also becomes a level 4 monster which is a key since he is machine and a card called Gear gigant X exists. Needlefiber can also summon a level 4 monster because Scopen is level 4 in defense. Later on you can always summon platinum gadget and summon whatever GGX searched  Ib the world chalice Miko allows you to re use celfon with world Legacy inheritator.

The idea is to get Meteor Dragon Red Eyes Impact on the field, then use his Gemini Effect to make all his Red-Eyed buddies pseudo-invincible as quick as possible, while giving him the same capabilities with trap cards, and a super attack boost by summoning Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword using Claw of Hermos. Making it difficult for the opponent to break through the defenses. It seems to work better for the long game, because it takes a lot of moving parts to get the defense-through-offense going. It seems I can get half of it going, to where I can get my Gemini cards, but no field card to speed up the process. Or maybe no Claw of Hermos for the extra kick. I'm just looking to increase the consistency. My favorite part about this deck is that it doesn't require any Synchro/Xyz/Link summoning, but under the right circumstances can stand up against them."

The deck also does well online but is n,"So this deck is designed to abuse current tournament time rules. The deck does play well online but is not built for it.  The goal of the deck is to stun with mystic mine and prevent your opponent from drawing outs. You stall/control the game into time and win in life point advantage although it is possible to end the game with just Wave-Motion Cannon and ring of destruction. Prohibition after testing is a great card that you can use to call any out a card the opponent might have in the main deck game 1 and is even better game 2 if you call the right cards. Oracle gives you chance to see what cards they sided in to out mystic mine giving you a chance to call the right cards with prohibition instead of calling something blind.  &nbsp;  For the side deck i chose to run Leonidas, Emergency Provisions, and Michion mainly for the mystic mine burn mirror but Emergency Provisions and Michion can be played against just about any deck to help guarantee you win in life points advantage. Heat Wave is there to help stun if you dont feel confident in mystic mine resolving, it lets you stall until you can use prohibition to help guarantee the mystic mine sticks to the field.  &nbsp;  The only thing to note about the extra deck is you should run all link monsters. This is because of Nurse Burn and Tri-and-Guess which i have yet to see anyone else play but i still recommend all links just in case."

Though this deck does not specifically rely on Lair of Darkness, this deck plays on the fact, many decks do not currently plan for defence against Mirror Force cards.  <strong>PLEASE NOTE: This deck is a fun deck which helps revive the use of Mirror Force in a somewhat fun and odd way. This deck is for casual use only and is not for use in competition. This deck has no defined win condition but aims to win by disrupting your opponent and slowly killing with fusion dragons.</strong>  This deck contains multiple different mirror force cards and was originally made as a joke deck using the old mirror force cards. However, in testing this deck has done surprisingly well in local tournaments and it is very much a troll and almost meme like deck. Below is some information on key cards to help people who are interested in playing this deck. (This deck is also a cheap budget deck)  <strong>Lair of Darkness</strong> <em>This card will be referred to as LoD for the remainder of this article. </em>LoD is a field spell released in the structure deck: LoD. This card has a variety of effects, the first effect of this card is that it changes all monsters on the field into Dark Monsters. This synergises with the card's second effect, you can use one of your opponents monsters for the tribute of a dark monster to activate one of your card effects. Though this can only be used once per turn, this is useful for removing your opponents monsters for the effects of traps such as Crush Card Virus, which otherwise might have been difficult to remove. Not only this, the LoD also adds tokens to the turn players side of the field during the end phase up to the number of monsters tributed during that turn. This helps you build up targets for other virus cards and can synergise well with cards such as Gozen Match. Though this card has a lot of useful effects, it should also be noted that LoD must activate at the end of every turn whether monsters were tributed or not, this makes the card highly susceptible to Ghost Ogre which means this card does not currently see a lot of play in meta.  <strong>Mirror Force Launcher</strong> Generally with this card you will want to leave this card set for the cards second effect, however the first effect of this card can also be useful. It should probably first be noted that Mirror Force Launcher can only search for the original Mirror Force and can not be used to search for cards such as Storming Mirror Force, however as we are running The Fang of Critias, then this can assist with bringing forth the Mirror Force Dragon. The set effect of this card means that if your opponent was to destroy the card with something like twin twister or heavy storm duster (which are both common plays against virus' on LoD decks), your opponent lets you set a mirror force from your hand/deck/GY as well as setting itself again from your GY. This both helps setup for Fang of Critias and provide protection on what can often be an empty field in this deck.  <strong>The Fang of Critias</strong> For those who have watched the original Dual Monsters series, you are probably familiar with this card as one of Kaiba's cards during the arc following battle city tournament. Of course in the anime this card was somewhat more consistent and more powerful, however it is nice to know that the card has perfect synergy with this deck as well as providing some powerful monsters to your field. This card can be used with Ring of Destruction, Mirror Force, Crush Card Virus and Tyrant Wings to make fusion versions of the legendary dragon. More information on the fusion monsters to follow.  <strong>Mirror Force Dragon</strong> Probably the most powerful card in this deck, Mirror Force Dragon is not only a monster, but basically a powered up version of the original Mirror Force card used in its creation. Mirror Force Dragon does not only destroy your opponents monsters when it is attacked, Mirror Force Dragon also destroys every card your opponent controls including spells/traps. But it doesn't stop there, Mirror Force Dragon does not have to be attacked for this effect to take place, but will happen when your opponent targets any of your monsters with an attack OR card effect while it is on the field.  <strong>Doom Virus Dragon</strong> This card is actually an interesting fusion card of The Fang of Critias and Crush Card Virus, though a while ago Crush Card Virus got errata'd, Doom Virus Dragon maintains the original effect of the first Crush Card but without the monster tribute. Firstly on summon this card will destroy all monsters your opponent controls which have 1500atk or higher on the field or in hand (hand is revealed). Then for the next 3 turns your opponent draws a card, they must reveal the card and send any monsters with 1500atk or more to the GY which can really limit your opponents plays. This makes it harder for your opponent to be able to kill this 1900atk monster.  <strong>Destruction Dragon</strong> This is the newest monster in the legendary dragon series. Destruction dragons effects are actually more powerful than they first appear and it has a nice 3000def points to help make it harder to remove. So what is it that makes this card powerful you ask? Unlike ring of destruction which is used in this monsters creation, you can destroy 1 card your opponent controls per turn and if this is a monster, deal the monsters original attack directly to your opponents life points, you do not take any damage from this effect so this is almost like an upgraded form of Ring of Destruction with Ring of Defense built in and can be used multiple times. However, a commonly missed feature of this monster is that it can destroy ANY card on the field. Though you don't do any damage to your opponent if the card you destroy is not a monster, this can be very useful for clearing your opponents restrictive spells/traps.  <strong>Lilith, Lady of Lament</strong> I'm not going to go through all the LoD cards, however for new players, this card requires a mention. Lilith is a 3* monster with 2000atk, however on Normal summon it will halve its attack to 1000atk. However, Lilith is a monster with a very interesting quick effect. By tributing 1 Dark Monster you can select 3 normal traps from your deck and your opponent must choose 1 to be set onto the field. Your opponent selects this trap randomly and they do not get to see which card was set, however if you select 3 of the same trap your opponent will know what card it is. Lilith is useful in the LoD archetype but is also very useful for setting up traps to be used with Fang of Critias. The most dangerous thing about Lilith is that its effect is a Quick Effect which when combined with LoD means that it can tribute your opponents monster to gain a trap during both your turn and your opponents turn. It also can tribute itself when needed.  <strong>Spirit Reaper</strong> Odd card for 2019 and I daresay a lot of people have not seen this card since about 2007, so why use this here? I often get asked this question and I can only really show its usefulness in a duel, but there are quite a few reasons to use Spirit Reaper. Spirit Reaper is a monster which can not be destroyed by battle or card effect making it a useful stall tactic, however it will destroy itself if the monster is targeted in any way, whether this is by a monster or card effect and also if you try to equip the monster with an equip spell. Although this seems risky, it is somewhat essential to note that the number of ""target"" effects have decreased in a lot of more modern decks, that isn't to say they are gone entirely, but you can often sit a couple of turns with the monster as a protector of your LP. However, what if this monster is targetted? Well oddly with this deck, that's not entirely the end of the world. According to Spirit Reapers effect, it will only destroy itself after the targeting has resolved, this means we still have the monster throughout the length of the chain. Spirit Reaper is a monster with low attack and a dark monster meaning that you can chain Crush Card Virus to a targeting effect and not only will your opponents effect miss its target as it is tributed for cost, but they will also lose all monster with 1500atk in both hand and on field (However this is best to avoid where possible with some decks as the opponent will also get the option to send up to 3 monsters from their deck to GY with 1500 or more attack which against some decks can give a big disadvantage).  <span>WEAKNESSES</span> This deck has a lot of weaknesses against the current meta and would probably have been stronger many years ago, however this does not mean the deck does not do reasonably well in casual play and in local tournaments. As the category suggests this is more of a casual fun deck, the decks main weaknesses are with trap negation and decks with large numbers of spell/trap removals which can often result in your hand falling empty. The deck also works on mainly disrupting your opponents plays, so other than Diabolos and the Dragons, there is no real set win condition.  <span>OTHER INFORMATION</span> This deck has a lot of room for variation and can even be used in conjuction with cards such as Raging Tempest (As you have field removal and you can make monsters from spells/traps) Please remember again, this is a fun deck, however this deck is only really for casual and local play, feel free to use this as a template for other decks or as a budget deck as the parts of this deck are all cheap and mainly from structure decks."

There are of course many ways to build this deck, and though this deck is by no means going to be a top meta deck, it still does reasonably well today and against many of the main meta decks.  <strong>PLEASE NOTE: This deck is meant more as a classic fun deck which has reasonable play in the current meta. Do not expect this deck to top in regionals, but you should still get a decent score with this even in the current meta.</strong>  This decks main focus is the summoning of Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, however with the addition of shaddolls, this deck gains many extra effects from the main dinosaur discard effects. This deck is not to be confused with the slightly more popular True King Dinos. Below you will find a few different notes for those who have not played this deck before.  <strong>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno </strong><em>For the remainder of this article, Ultimate Conductor Tyranno will be shortened to UCT. </em>UCT is the big bad monster of most Dinosaur decks, in its time and even now it is considered a card which is massively overpowered. Why you ask? UCT is a monster which is easy to summon, both by its own effect and via double evolution pill, which can perform a variety of dangerous effects. The first effect is that UCT can destroy any 1 monster from your field or hand to flip all your opponents monsters into face down defence position during either players turn. Though this has lost a bit of its power since the advent of Link monsters, which can't be switched to defence position, this still can serve to disrupt link decks as your opponent can not link with face down monsters. If the disruption was not enough, UCT also has the ability to send a defence position monster to the GY at the start of the damage step (this is just before a monster flips up) and inflict 1000 damage to your opponent at the same time, and this is not once per turn. Sound bad enough yet? It gets worse, UCT can also attack every monster your opponent controls once each, this means if your opponent summons a monster after your stop attacking with UCT during the battlephase, you can continue attacking with UCT even if another monster has attacked since. UCT does have a clause where you can't special summon it unless it has first been special summoned by its own effect, but that does mean if you summon it correctly you can then use Monster Reborn to revive it.  <strong>Souleating</strong> <strong>Oviraptor</strong> For anyone who has played against dinosaur decks before, you will probably recognise this card as the main staple for almost all dinosaur deck builds. But for those who have never seen / played against a dinosaur deck, the main thing to note about this card is that it is basically a big search card for almost any dinosaur card. With this card alone we can put a dinosaur from our deck into our hand or graveyard (watch out for Ash Blossom, more will be explained how to deal with this later). In this case we often do one of two things, the most common option is to put Overtex Quoatlus into the GY. Another option is to add Miscellaneousaurus to hand if we already have a Double Evolution Pill. This card can also be used to put Giant Rex into the grave, or to search out: Dinowrestler Prankotops, Dogoran the Mad Flame Kaiju or UCT depending on the current need.  <strong>Overtex Quoatlus</strong> Probably one of the most important cards in this deck after Oviraptor. Though this card is not often used in other dinosaur decks, in this deck it is quite essential. IF this card is sent to the GY, you can add a Double Evolution Pill to hand. Other than hard drawing Overtex and sending it to GY with another card effect, this can usually only be done by Oviraptor, but in dinodolls we can do this with Shaddoll Fusion straight from the deck. However, be careful not to send all of these to the grave for this effect as Overtex is also the main recycle card for the deck. By shuffling 5 dinosaurs from the banish zone into the deck we can summon this monster to the field, which means that Overtex works well with the effects of both Miscellaneousaurus and Double Evolution Pill. Unlike UCT, Overtex can not be summoned back from the GY even if was special summoned correctly before. It is still useful to summon this monster to the field with Double Evolution Pill if you already have UCT on the field as Overtex is able to destroy 1 dinosaur monster in hand or on field to negate the activation of a spell/trap your opponent activates, this is a Quick Effect (it can even destroy itself to give you a Double Evolution Pill), this is useful against decks such as Subterror and Altergeist.  <strong>Giant Rex</strong> Another staple in most dinosaur decks. To be honest, in this deck you're likely not to bother with the effect to gain ATK points, but use it mainly as a lv.4 field presence from its special summon when it is banished. Giant Rex can be banished in a variety of ways, including Double Evolution Pill, UCT and Miscellaneousaurus. And it can also be searched out by Oviraptor to be added to grave or hand. When summoned back, you can XYZ with Oviraptor to make a rank 4 monster from your extra deck. In most cases this will be either Evolzar Laggia or Evolzar Dolkka.  <strong>Double Evolution Pill</strong> As you have noticed this mentioned in the previous card information, you've probably been wondering what this card is. Double Evoltion Pill is one of the most important cards in this deck for setting up your field. Using this spell, you can banish 1 dinosaur and 1 non-dinosaur monster from your hand and/or GY to special summon any lv.7 or higher dinosaur from your deck or hand ignoring its summoning conditions. This card means you can summon either UCT or Overtex straight from your deck to setup your field while also providing synergy with the earlier mentioned cards.  <strong>Miscellaneousaurus</strong> After UCT, this is probably the most overpowered dinosaur card in existance and even managed to warrant getting itself put on the <em>Limited</em> list until the most recent banlist where they suddenly removed it from the list all together. But why is this monster so powerful? The first is the discard effect. Like a handtrap, you can discard Miscellaneousaurus during either players turn as a quick effect card, this can also be done in chain to your opponents effects. When discarded Miscellaneousaurus makes your dinosaur monsters you control become immune to your opponents activated card effects during the current main phase. This can be used in response to things like Ash Blossom when you activate Oviraptors effect resulting in our opponent wasting their ash blossom and not stopping your search effect, it can also be useful for protecting UCT from things like Ghost Ogre or Effect Veiler. This monster is also easily searchable by both Oviraptor and Fossil Dig (which you can also use to find Oviraptor). But that's only half of what makes this monster dangerous, Miscellaneousaurus also has a GY effect. By banishing itself and other dinosaurs in the GY, you can special summon a dinosaur from the deck with the same level as the number of monsters (including itself) banished by this effect. Most commonly this will be used to banish itself + 3 monsters to summon an Oviraptor from the deck. In other builds this can also be used to summon Babycerasaurus and Petiteranodon. The banished cards can then be recycled to summon Overtex by its own effect.  <strong>El Shaddoll Winda</strong> For those who have been playing Yugioh for a while, you have probably heard stories about a really annoying fusion monster called Winda. But why exactly is it that people hate Winda? Well, other than the fact she can't be destroyed by card effect, Winda limits both players to 1 special summon each per turn while she is on the field (not including her own summon). Using this card you have to be careful to check your special summons so you don't lock your own play, but generally a UCT + Winda in 1 turn isn't a bad option. Not to mention that to summon Winda you must use 2 dark monsters, one of which must be a shaddoll. With Shaddoll Fusion which we will be using in this deck, we can summon Winda using monsters from our deck when our opponent controls a monster summoned from their extra deck. This means we can send a shaddoll (which all have IF effects for when they are sent to the GY) and Overtex (to get a Double Evolution Pill). This setups the grave to use the Double Evolution Pill to make a UCT as well.  <strong>El Shaddoll Construct</strong> Until recently this monster was a forbidden card, however it has finally come back as a limited card. Construct in modern play is not that powerful as it can't spam the field like it used to in MR3. But it has the highest attack of the shaddoll fusions and if it battles a special summoned monster, at the start of the damage step it will destroy that monster. The other main use, is that on its summon you can send an additional Shaddoll from deck to the GY to get another shaddoll effect in that turn.  <span>OTHER THINGS TO NOTE:</span> 1) Shaddoll effects are all Hard Once Per Turn, other than on the fusion monsters. 2) Shaddoll cards can only use one of their effects per turn, other than on the fusion monsters. 3) IF a shaddoll fusion is sent to the GY, you can add the Shaddoll Fusion from GY back to your hand, however you can only use the Fusion once per turn. 4) All GY effects in this deck are IF effects and not WHEN effects, this means you can resolve these effects immediately after the current chain resolves without losing timing. However, be aware that the effects do lose timing for things like Twin Twisters (side deck), where the discard is a cost. 5) Miscellaneousaurus can be discarded more than once per turn meaning you can discard 2 in MP1 or MP2 or one in each. 6) Miscellaneousaurus ONLY protects for the CURRENT Main Phase. Monsters are not protected in Draw Phase, Standby Phase, Battle Phase or End Phase. 7) This a go second deck, this can sometimes be difficult in meta when to go first is more common in order to setup the board, but at the time of this writing, go second has started to become more viable. 8) Both Double Evolution Pill and Shaddoll Fusion can be stopped by Ash Blossom, so it is usually best to bait out Ash Blossom with Oviraptor, Fossil Dig or Shaddoll Fusion before playing double evolution pill.  <span>Weaknesses</span> This deck is able to play through a lot of disruptions, but cards which limit spells, stop special summons and cards which stop search's can be deadly if you don't draw the right cards. Another major issue with this deck can be consistency, however this deck is not majorly inconsistent, it is not as consistent as a lot of meta decks.  <span>Other Information</span> As has been mentioned previously, there are many ways to build dinosaurs, this is purely a shaddoll version and you may find some slightly different setups of the deck might be better for you. An example of an optional change is the use of Super Polymerisation (at time of article currently semi-limited). This can be used with the shaddolls, and with Mudragon of the Swamp. Generally Lost Worlds is a waste of space in the main deck for dinodolls, however I side this card as a response to SkyStriker which do not like to have monsters in their main monster zone and they can not target your own monsters with any of their effects while the token is on their side of the field.  <span><em>Update:</em></span><em> Grammatical fixes and minor rewording to make the effects more accurate.</em>"

Folgo, Fur Hire would be one of the most important cards of the Deck because he will allow us to draw more cards and summon a Fur Hire from our Deck to make our plays with the other Fur Hire we have in hand. The idea is to take advantage of the different effects of our Fur Hire Monsters to have more options during the battle."
