Deck problems:

 	<li>For dissruptions you mostly rely on drawing hand traps and skill drain</li>
</ul>
Deck bonuses:
<ul>
 	<li>2 card combos end on 4 cards in hand mostly (which means that you maybe have Skill Drain, Imperm etc.)</li>
 	<li>Big monsters</li>
</ul>
Deck is tons of fun and can fight some meta but you need to pilot it well. Good Luck, Have Fun."

If your opponent has out DPE the racoon token itself will be at 4000 ATK with just one copy of solidaridy. It continues to stack higher and higher each token you make. it gets pretty silly with multiple racoons and multiple solidaridy even the boost from missus radiant is nothering to laugh at. So if your looking for a deck to suprise OTK and have insanely hilarious tokens play this deck. Also a side note Fabled Unicore is called the NOOBMUNCHER because if u fail to read his effect it can cause some game changing mistakes on their end. If im not mistaken last i checked Fabled Unicore has the fastest Spell speed negation of any monster as he can negate counter traps. pretty dope

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.

This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.

Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.

1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.

2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!

3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions

4) Other than Xyz, Pendulum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a Tier List
You can only have
3 Cards on the A Tier List
5 Cards on the B Tier List
10 Cards on the C Tier List
In your deck.
https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList

5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.

6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.

Full Chazz it up from 10 to 10,000.","The point of the deck is to end on either A-Z Buster Cannon or Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon.

The best play is to go second so that you can crash Ojama Blue into your opponent's monster to search two Ojama cards, first adding Ojamatch and Ojamagic and later adding two Ojamasimilation. Since it's 2022, your opponent will likely have a board of monster negates to stop ojama blue, that is where Dark Ruler No More and Forbidden Droplet can help out. Rescue cat is the best opener for the deck, allowing you to summon two Ojama Blues from the deck, allowing you to go plus 4 fromthe two searches and plus three when discarding Ojamagic.

If you want to play this on Master Duel, Replace one ABC Buster Dragon with Underworld Goddess of the Closed World.

<a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a> has also no once per turn, that means with Alpha u can tribute 4 Monsters :D

Needed:
<strong>Chaos of the Light Brigade</strong>, <strong>Foolish Burial</strong> and <strong>Chaos Space</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Activate Chaos of the Light Brigade, add Raiden (if you are lucky Snow and Juggler were milled)</li>
 	<li>Use Juggler's effect to add <strong>Performage Trick Clown</strong></li>
 	<li>With Chaos Space send Trick Clown to grave and add <strong>Black Dragon Collapserpent</strong>; activate Trick Clown's effect to summon it</li>
 	<li>With Foolish Burial send to graveyard <strong>Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</strong>; activate it's effect targeting Clown</li>
 	<li>Summon <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax</strong> using <em>Destrudo</em> and <em>Trick Clown</em>; summon <strong>Plaguespreader Zombie</strong> with Halq's effect to M-4</li>
 	<li>Summon Collapserpent using Clown</li>
 	<li>Normal Summon Raiden to <em><strong>M-5</strong></em> and use it's effect</li>
 	<li>Summon <strong>Striker Dragon</strong> using Collapserpent; add <strong>White Dragon Wyverburster</strong> with Collapserpent</li>
 	<li>Banish Collapserpent to summon Wyverbuster to <strong>M-1</strong></li>
 	<li>Use Chaos Space effect to return <em>Black Dragon Collapserpent</em> and draw 1</li>
 	<li>Summon <strong>Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</strong> to <strong>M-1</strong> using Raiden and Wyverbuster; chain 1 Chaos Ruler, chain 2 Wyverbuster</li>
 	<li>Add something that is not <span class=""name_txt selectable""><strong>Destiny HERO - Malicious</strong>, <strong>Wulf, Lightsworn Beast</strong> or <strong>Felis, Lightsworn Archer</strong></span></li>
 	<li>Wulf and Felis summon</li>
 	<li>Striker and Chaos Ruler into <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres</strong></li>
 	<li>Wulf, Felis and Plag into <strong>Baronne de Fleur</strong> to <strong>M-2/1</strong></li>
 	<li>Malicious into Malicious (own effect); banish wulf and Striker to revive Chaos Ruler; Revive Plaguspreader (do not return Collapserpent); link them into <strong>Curious, the Lightsworn Dominio</strong></li>
 	<li>Both Cruious effects (send Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner/Fairy Tail - Snow depending on which one of those you alredy have in graveyard)</li>
 	<li>Revive Fairy Tail - Snow (that was probably milled by now, otherwise you end here and probably lose) but don't banish Lumina, Raiden and leave at least 3 spells in grave.</li>
 	<li>Link summon <strong>Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</strong> using Halq and Snow; use it's effect to put at least 3 counters on her</li>
 	<li>Remove 3 counters from Selene so she can revive Lumina</li>
 	<li>With Lumina's effect discard a card (don't discard Collapserpent) and revive Raiden; link them into <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong></li>
 	<li>Link Summon <strong>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</strong> using Curious and Selene</li>
</ul>
You ended with this: Apollousa with 2 negates, Baronne with 1 negate, Heavenly Spheres that bounces card and can give you Starliege Seyfert, I:P Masquerena that can  become Knightmare Unicorn using any monster that is on your field, Snow that represents two dissruptions against link and synchro decks (or 1 if not sent to graveyard with Masquerena) and 3 cards in hand (also if discarding for Unicorn, don't discard Collapserpent for a backup if needed). You will be able to get Seyfert out and search even for Judgment Dragon or Chaos Dragon Levianeer on your next turn and be able to pop at least one card your opponent has.

There are problems that this deck has and those are:
<ul>
 	<li>If hitted with 1 handtrap it alredy can struggle, 2 can mean end</li>
 	<li>If you don't get right cards from mills or even in first hand sometimes (because lot of things can actually make something) it's over (so you need some luck)</li>
 	<li>Dark Ruler No More means end for this deck</li>
 	<li>1 wrong placement makes your combo lot harder</li>
 	<li>Dimension Shifter, Macro Cosmos etc. also kill this deck</li>
 	<li>Going second against multiple dissruptions is end for the deck</li>
 	<li>Brick cards such as Wulf and Felis and Performage Damage Juggler sometimes get to your hand</li>
</ul>
This deck is still fun, asks for luck which makes it more fun than some others in my opinion."

The best use of Pyros I can come up with and a very fun non-meta dec,"So this is the final build of a Volcanics deck that I have been working on as a fun, fiery casual/decent non-meta deck where I tried my damnedest to make Pyros playable. I don't think this deck will win you a lot of tournaments, and it won't have a flashy OTK or huge boss monster, but I rate it 10/10. The deck is extremely fun to play with an emphasis on using resources effectively and playing one step ahead of your opponent to stay alive. The main strategy is to use the volcanic engine to wipe the opponent's monsters and whittle down their life points and resetting it to go again with RFG and POA. The secondary strategy to fill out the rest of the deck is using Rekindling targets to get access to the extra deck through synchros (or links). You can consistently send the synchro material you need to the grave with Canoneer, Foolish burial, and the volcanic engine, while consistently bring them back with rekindling, call of the haunted, and monster reborn. This consistency makes the deck often run like a well-oiled machine, though it can occassionally get bricked with rekindling targets in hand, there is enough card draw and deck filtering through the volcanic combo and resets that this is a fairly rare outcome. I also run mirror force and magic cylinder for protection if I cannot get scattershot's effect off for some reason, and to keep my opponent guessing as to whether or not they should risk destroying set traps as Blaze Accelerator Reload can be activated from the graveyard. Ogre is my hand trap of choice because this deck struggles most against monster-heavy decks that can rebuild their boards and because ash blossom is not in my budget. Magic planter can be used to send a BAR to the grave for great value and helps Call of the haunted pull double duty as it is not destroyed if the monster it summoned is used as summoning material. Finally, change of heart can be used to use an opponent's monster against them to finish them off and easily removed though link or synchro summoning.

The extra deck is a little different and will be used as a last resort and finishing move. Knightmare cards work great as easy to summon answers to single cards at the cost of discarding a card (usually a monster that can be recurred later). But the main focus is using Formula Synchron and T.G Hyper Librarian to set up for synchroing into bigger cards, namely Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon and Shooting Star T.G. EX. or Shooting Star Dragon These cards are threats that need to be answered and can answer nearly any threat your opponent has on field. Easy access to tuners through rekindling and non-tuners through the volcanic engine means that despite not having cards that search other materials specifically, this deck can still consistently achieve whatever extra deck play you need to stay alive and take the game.
Bonus Option: Look for uses of your opponents' cards as materials with Monster reborn and change of heart
Finally for the Side Deck we have access to more board wipe cards if your opponent sports tons of creatures but no protection, MST if your opponent plays more back row, other hand traps like effect veiler and Nibiru if Ghost Ogre isn't your style, and magic cylinder if your opponent uses single boss monsters or you just want to end the game as fast as possible.
When swapping out for side deck ideally you would trade traps for traps, keeping what is most effectively going to counter your current matchup. Removing any monsters throws off the balance of various level markers needed to get the ideal synchos off, and cards like shell and scattershot require you to run 3 of each.

Why is that ? Cause Borrelend-Dragon took everything away maids had over Dragonlink: The grindgame with a boss monster that negates and floods the board. Even worse, Borrelend is stronger, easier to make and cuter.

But lets focus on the idea behind this new kind of Pendulum Dragonlink deck aka Beyond Dragonlink.

While cards like Odd-eyes revolution, Chaos emperor and Supreme King have all three been on and off tech choices for dragonlink, it was rarely because of their pendulum gameplay and rather cause of them being good chaos enabler or just free extender. With this list this changes....well not completly, we still use them also as free extender and chaos enabler.

The gameplan of the deck doesnt stray to far from what Dragonlink wants to do, make borrelend + 1-2 negates, a set up gy for grind and in best case also a sphere to loop a card back. Just that in this version there is a few more lines that can end with you drowning in material , break hard boards and play through hand traps.

A slight warning before we go in the card by card though, this list is not perfect, specially the extra deck needs some smoothing out. But it is already able to compete with current decks on a decent level.

We will split the deck in 3 Parts : Pendulum, Chaos , and Rokkets

The pendulum work best hand in hand with the rokkets, your favorite hand will always be Ravine + either Absorouter or Supremeking Dark. You will discard one, to send the other and have freely the choice to now go all out with rokket lines or pendulum lines.

Its really hard to put this deck in words on how to play it, and I would recommend to just try things out for yourself and get a feeling for it as it doesnt play linear at first but after you get used to including pendulum lines , it will get a lot simpler to pilot.

If there is interest I will try to put down a few endboards and how to get there of cause, but for now I wanted to just get this list out and hopefully find some people who try and give it their own spin until its polised and clean."

In order to summon Number 99, you need to use Utopia Double or a Rank-Up spell. Ideally you want to go Double -&gt; Number 39-&gt;S39-&gt;Rank-Up, so that you can use Number 99's effect twice.

The deck's main weakness is when it has to go second into an Apollousa board, since it needs to resolve Utopic Onomatopoeia and/or other monster effects to combo."

For full combos, watch: https:/","This is an update to my Spirits Of The Forest Traptrix Deck featuring some of the latest support for this archetype added by the BritishPiper mod. If you like to check my older build, you can find it here: https://ygoprodeck.com/spirits-of-the-forest-traptrix-deck/

In the current meta, add these cards: Lord of the Heavenly Prison x2, Gallant Granite x1, Traptrix Cularia x1, Traptrix Vesiculo x1 and Pot of Prosperity x3.
Lord of the Heavenly Prison is for backrow protection, a 3k beater that can set any spell and trap directly from the deck. Gallant Granite is to add Lord of the Heavenly Prison to hand. The Traptrix are new addition that are usually run. Pot of Proesperity will help a lot with consistency. You can change whatever you like to add these cards.

For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more. Check the Description of this video on YouTube for more info.

Is Mechaba even still good? (Hey, Mechaba is pretty good!)","See, sometimes good things come from playing with silly ideas!

This is kind of the natural ""try-hard"" evoltion of Live AID, a deck that was produced out of not feeling like the Invoked and Dogmatika engines really filled out a deck enough, and a bad pun. But it got me thinking about Aleister, and about how to actually round out the deck, and got me looking at packages. In the end I decided on trying the P.U.N.K. engine. Here, it is making Halq into Herald of the Arc Light plus an 8. This is kind of neato, actually, in that this deck can actually make almost all of it's Dogmatika bricks profitably, and allows for Mechaba to protect Halq, creating Nibiru resilience. It also actually can make plays! Yay!

I feel like the card-by-card should be pretty self explanatory. You're a sort of combo/control deck trying to draw Nadir Servant, Aleister the Invoker, and Emergency Teleport, and then you win by using your one for one interruptions really well. You're basically a Control shell that occasionally makes 4 negates + Punishment, so the real trick to playing the deck is knowing chokepoints, having matchup and meta knowledge, and applying it correctly. Since this is a hidden information game with incredible complexity and an eternal format over 20 years old, that will be difficult for newer players, but if you have a little bit of experience this deck could do you pretty well, and occasionally it will just ""full combo"" and take over a game, something a lot of control decks can struggle to do.

Savage and Herald never came up, wheras I think Accesscode will, and VFD definitely does. This list is spicy, this is a very wacky pile, and I'm still improving with it, but you're basically playing a very non-linear deck that has some combo hands and some control hands and some hands that do both, and it is explosive and flexible, so I'm enjoying it. Very much my style of pile.

I cut an Ecclesia and one Cosmic for a lone Skull Meister (very good in simplified game states), and an Ogre Dance (the lack of Ogre Dance was coming up, where you'd see Foxy Tune as your starter but not be able to play with just Foxy Tune. Now you can, and you also see Baronne + Auroradon slightly more often and Dogmatika slightly less, so you're bricking on Dogmatika and P.U.N.K. less with these numbers, and playing more towards the explosive hands than control. 3 Cosmic was fine, but I was seeing it just slightly too often, and I wanted to diversify. Meister has always impressed me so long as it is my second hand trap, but even with the minor conflict between Imperm and Gamma the deck is running 13 hand traps plus a handful of board breaking cards, so I suspect Meister will be good as a one-off tech card."

If you don't see skill drain, the effects on the tribute summon of stealth, helix and carrier will help you deal with your opponent's board. Scout can search the other qliphort monsters thanks to its effect and monolith recovers your resources by drawing cards when you tribute summon up the number of monsters you tribute. Lose 1 Turn is there because it synergizes a lot with the archetype as the effects of the main deck qliphort monsters are on tribute summon and the cards only affect special summoned monsters. Cards like dark ruler no more, monarch stormforth and harpie's feather duster are there to make life easier going second as this deck really wants to go first. Feel free to change the ratio of the monsters and to try different floodgates.

About this deck keep in mind that it was released in the ARC-V era when pendulum decks used to be able to special summon many monters from the extra-deck instead of one. Qliphort genius is a good way to play around that as it opens up two extra monster zone and searches a qliphort when yu pendulum summon two qliphort monsters from the extra. However, keep in mind it will not be unaffected by skill drain if skill drain was alrady on the field before you link summoned it.

Towers is not played because while it's not completely terrible it suffers from the fact that link monsters exists. Although not all decks play those many still do. Also it's very unlikerly you'll be able to summon it turn one considering hand-traps exist."

A large benefit to this deck is that few cards in the current meta game can out apoqliphort towers as monsters like knightmare unicorn a very good counter to towers see little to no play in this meta game with branded, swordsoul and P.U.N.K. not using it. Also with the large reliance on high level boss monsters this format backed with low level starters the searchable Re-qliate feels extremely strong."

""Vernusylph"" is an archetype centered on supporting EARTH monsters. All lvl 3-4 ""Vernusylph"" monsters share the once per turn effect of discarding themselves as well as either 1 other monster or 1 ""Vernusylph"" card to activate a unique effect, followed by a shared effect to special summon 1 EARTH monster from the GY, at the cost of being unable to use monster effects, aside from those of EARTH monsters.

<span>how to build it yourself:</span>

To play your earth engine with <a data-name=""vernusylph"">vernusylph </a>cards you need to consider 4 things:
<ul>
 	<li>searchability : the engine should have monsters that search a couple of times in a row in average, the more they search each other the better, that way you can get the most value of your vernusylph monsters, if you only search 2 times of less than thisn then try playing one <a data-name=""Vera, the Vernusylph Goddess"">Vera, the Vernusylph Goddess so when you have 2 Vernusylphs in hand you search it with the first and summon it with the other one.</a></li>
 	<li>starters : a.k.a what you want to see in your opening hand alongside vernusylphs, play as much as possible of them, and to improve consistancy you need to look at: 1/ do they work with <a data-name=""Vernusylph of the Awakening Forests"">Vernusylph of the Awakening Forests,if not you probably only need one of him in the deck which will lower onsistancy 2/ do they need your normal summon, if they don't you can run </a><a data-name=""World Soul - Carbon"">World Soul - Carbon, also worth mentining that you probably should play prosperity and small world or else you are susceptible to brick.</a></li>
 	<li>endboard: and here you have to prioritise thinking of the 2 card combos because they are the most likely to come up, and you need to look at both what your extra deck can offer and what your searchers can end on, and i should say that this's the first thing to think of before building your deck , <a data-name=""Vera, The Vernasylph Goddess"">Vera, The Vernasylph Goddess</a>  is good option going second but it's not enough.</li>
 	<li>Garnets: a.k.a cards you don't want in your opening hand, any deck can go 7+ negates if you just have enough garnets to play with, but this's where you should find a balance between power level and consistancy, i would say that if you play more than 5 garnets then it's going down bad.</li>
</ul>
<span>Couple of Dino Cards To Talk About:</span>

<a data-name=""Dinowrestler Systegosaur"">Dinowrestler Systegosaur is exaclty the key card my decklist built around, not only it's both an Earth and a searcher </a><a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">for</a><a data-name=""Dinowrestler Systegosaur""> </a><a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops, it's also lvl 4 so you can make an Evolzar Xyz.</a>

<a data-name=""Carboneddon"">Carboneddon</a><a data-name=""carboneddon"">is not only a tool to access lvl 10 synchros but also a crucial bridge for </a><a data-name=""Small World"">Small World</a><a data-name=""carboneddon"">, and you don't need to play more than one copie of </a><a data-name=""Labradorite Dragon"">Labradorite Dragon</a><a data-name=""labradorite dragon""> as you can shuffle it back with </a><a data-name=""Mudora the Cestus Oracle"">Mudora the Cestus Oracle</a><a data-name=""labradorite dragon""> alongside opponent's gy.</a>

I can't possibly think of a deck, or engine, that summons level 7s and doesn't like normal summo","<span><strong>This is an In-Depth look into Kshatri-La.</strong></span>

<span>The Kshatri-La's &amp; The Main Deck.</span>

<span>The Kshatri-La's all have similar effects, allowing you to search a Monster/Spell/Trap from the deck, and when the opponent uses a monster effect or when that Kshatri-La declares an attack, they can banish a card from the Field, Extra deck, and the Main Deck. In addition, they can summon themselves for free, when you control no monsters. They're very good for rank 7 spam, which gives them really good tech options. And, may as well say it now, Kshatri-La is a control deck, but it's actually quite fun. They allow a great resource loop, allowing you to banish the opponents extra deck, the cards from field, hand, gy, and top of the deck. They can also use a lot of level 7 engines in order to go into level 7 Xyz monsters, use hand traps to go into rank 10 Synchros, or go into Halq and Selene and Accesscode stuff. I'm going to go into almost every card and engine, as to why they're in here. </span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Kshatri-La Ogre"">Kshatri-La Ogre</a></span>

Kshatri-La Ogre adds a Kshatri-La trap from the deck to the hand, currently the only target being Kshatri-La Prepare. Prepare allows you to summon a Kshatri-La that's banished in in your hand, at spell speed 2. This isn't the best, but if you're trying to get more Kshatri-La's to banish more cards, this is a great way to do it. It also banishes a card from the opponents hand if the opponent activates a trap. This is mostly going to happen if the opponent is playing Infinite Impermanence, or possibly Floowandereeze. If the opponent is playing Floowandereeze, you  can use this trap to summon a card, banish a card from the opponents hand, like a hand trap or a tribute summon. It's not the best, no matter what you banish, since A. you're banishing it, and Toccan exists, and B. You can't banish the card Robina gets, since the way Kshatri-La's work is that they activate their effects after the trap/spell/monster effect has resolved. But it is still good, and worth playing. Who knows, maybe it's Eldlich. Ogre has the 2nd effect, when the opponent uses a monster effect or when it declares an attack, you can look at the top 5 cards of your opponents deck, and banish one of them.  This makes it so you can banish a card that could out the board, while also giving you information on what deck the opponent is playing. To note, this does not shuffle the deck, and this card will be banned in Remote Duels. I play this at 3, the trap isn't good, but it's a name, in a deck with only 3 of them, the banish effect is decent, and it has the most attack of any Kshatri-La main deck card. As for the trap, I play 2, because it's still a decent card, and it's good to have multiple if one is outted, but you could play 1.

<span><a data-name=""Kshatri-La Unicorn"">Kshatri-La Unicorn</a></span>

Unicorn adds a Spell to hand, with the only target being Kshatri-la Berth. Berth is a monster reborn for the deck, allowing you to summon a Kshatri-La from the GY or Banished zone. It also allows a Kshatri-La to be normal summoned without tributing, and when the opponent uses a spell card, banishes 3 cards from the opponents GY. So, in one card, it's a Reborn, a free normal summon of any Kshatri-La, to help spam them out, and then a D.D. Crow. This card is pretty good. Going back to Unicorn, when it attacks, or an opponents monster uses an effect, it can do one of the best effects in the game, and look at the opponents extra deck, and banish it. This is the reason to play the deck. If the opponent is a synchro deck, banish Halq. Therion P.U.N.K., banish Chaos Ruler. Branded Despia, pray to god they have one Mirrorjade/Albion/Lubellion, and if not, Chimera I guess. For me personally, definitely a 3 of. As for the spell this card searches, definitely play 2 of it. It's a really good spell, and you always want it in rotation.

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Kshatri-La Fenrir"">Kshatri-La Fenrir</a></span>

<span>Kshatri-La Fenrir is the ""Stratos"" of the deck, the main monster. He can summon himself, then search any Kshatri-La monster. Then, when the opponent uses a monster effect, or when he declares an attack, it can banish any face up card on the field. It's a 3 of for sure, and has some really nice interactions with one of the upcoming spells I'll talk about in a sec. This part of the guide to Kshatri-La isn't that long, due to me already covering the monsters. But this is absolutely a 3 of.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Danger! Engine</span>

<span><a data-name=""Danger! Nessie!"">Danger! Nessie!</a></span>

We are playing a small danger engine in here, both for the Draw power, and for the ability to summon level 7s like Nessie for Xyz. There's 3 Nessie, 1 Chupacabra, and one Jackalope. 3 Nessie's since it's the best danger in this deck, and is a level 7, 1 Chupacabra, this is if we have a 1 card hand and it's just Nessie. You can use the Nessie, get Chupacabra, then ss the Nessie from the gy. You could play 2 or 3 Chupacabra, since it's a good way to keep Nessie in rotation, but I think it's much better to play just one. The same goes for Jackalope, both as just another Danger, and if we use it, discard itself, it just summons Nessie from deck. I considered playing Dogman, but it's just terrible. Doesn't search, ya it's a level 7, but it's just horrible.

<span>Adventurer Token Engine</span>

This engine is amazing in this deck. You do normal summon with the Berth, but most times, you're using that monster for Xyz material instantly, so it won't even matter. It also summons level 7s, meaning that in cases where you don't need an Illegal Knight or Gryphon, it's a level 7 Engine. I'm playing both Gryphon and Illegal knight, since it's good to have names, and multiple monsters due to hard opt. Also, the Interactions with Illegal Knight and Dracoback are just amazing. Theoretically, you can use Aquamancer to go into Selene and Accesscode, but that rarely comes up, but it's nice to keep that in mind.

<span>Ghost Ogre Engine</span>

<a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a>

This engine doesn't technically exist, but I think I'll just make it up and say it does. Ghost ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit is a pretty good hand trap, able to destroy monsters/spells/traps when they activate their effects. It can stop Therions from using Discolosseum, in a mirror match it can destroy Kshatri-La's or their Spell/traps, and against Albaz, it can.. do.. something? I think? It's not great against Albaz, but it's decent. And against P.U.N.K. it can stop Ze Amin from being used as synchro material for Chaos Ruler to start their combos. But why is this an Engine? Well, notice that Ghost Ogre is a level 3 Psychic monster. You can summon this from Emergency Teleport, and then summon Ghost Ogre from the deck. This allows you to access both Baronne de Fleur, by using it and a Kshatri-La, or Halq into Accesscode by summon Veiler from the deck. And if you can't do either, and you have E-Tele and only that, you can summon Ghost Ogre anyways, since it can use its effect on field. There are 3 Synchro's you can summon with this engine, but I'll get to them later.

<span><a data-name=""Sacred Sword of Seven Stars"">Sacred Sword of Seven Stars</a></span>

This card is the other reason to play the deck. The first being Unicorn and the extra deck control, the 2nd reason is this card. You banish a level 7 from Hand or Field, draw 2. As far as this deck is concerned, it's pot of greed and special summon one from hand. It's fairly simple to understand why this is good. The deck is full of level 7s, banishing has no real cost, and the fact that you can banish from field can do some silly things. One ""Combo"" you can do with this is Sacred Sword and Fenrir. You summon Fenrir, search Unicorn, Sacred Sword, draw 2. Then you Summon Fenrir, get Berth, summon Fenrir with Berth, make a level 7. After that, you can summon any additional Kshatri-La's from hand with the normal summon effect of Berth. Once used in Dragon ruler as literally pot of greed but you draw one more card, now used in Kshatri-La where it's Pot of greed but you sometimes draw 2 more, since you make a 7, summon something from deck with Shangri-La, then search if you summon Ogre from Berth.

&nbsp;

<span><strong>The Extra Deck</strong></span>

<span>The Synchros.</span>

As of now, there are 3 really playable level 10 Synchro's. The first, obviously, is Baronne de Fleur. Omni Negate, once per turn destroy one, and if useful, reborn a card during the SP Phase. One thing you can do is use Baronne to summon from the gy after you use its negate, and bring back Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit. This allows you to use Ghost Ogre again to synchro into Baronne again, or summon one of the other synchros. The next synchro is Ruddy Rose Dragon. If the opponent is playing a gy deck, this wins you the game. We don't care if our cards are banished, since we can summon them with Berth, and give Prepare a purpose, since they both summon from banished. But if the opponent is playing something like Eldlich, or another GY Focused deck, this can sometimes win you the game. The last card that I'll be talking about for the Synchro's are one of the Swordsoul synchro's, Chengying. If the opponent has a lot of banished cards, say 10 or more, this can be used for OTKs, and to get in for a lot of damage. It also has protection, and then banishes from the opponents field &amp; Gy if something is banished.

<span>The Link Monsters</span>

For the Link monsters, there's not much in terms of ""Spicy Tech Choices."" I just use a standard Halq, Selene, and Accesscode lineup for an otk. This is one of the reasons for the Ghost Ogre &amp; E-Tele Engine, as Ghost Ogre and and monster turns into a 5300 that destroys 2 cards.

<span>The Xyz Monsters</span>

These are the main extra deck cards, and there's a bit of variety in here. First, the Kshatri-La Xyz Monster, Shangri-La. 0 Attack, 3k Defence, so a reverse link monster, and this card is insane. It summons a Kshatri-La from deck during the Standby Phase, it has protection by detaching a material, and whenever a card is banished, it blocks a zone from being used. This is the 3rd reason to play the deck, as locking the zones is amazing this format. As soon as you get 3 monster zones locked, you basically win the game. It can also summon a Kshatri-La from deck, so you can summon Fenrir or Unicorn to banish from field or the Extra deck respectively, while also allowing you to search for cards when it gets to your turn. The next card in the Xyz list is Number 89: Diablosis the Mind hacker. This allows you to continue the Extra deck control by banishing one card from it, and in the late game, allows you to banish cards from the top of your opponents deck equal to the amount of banished cards your opponent has. This allows you to possibly mill their deck if you're late in the game, banishing up to 10 cards from the opponents deck. Ya, that's basically a desires, but they don't draw two, and you can possibly mill swordsoul cards, Fusion spells, Therions, Ze Amin, the cards that need to stay in the deck.

Next on the list is Number 11: Big Eye. Generic materials, and allows you to take any monster the opponent controls. They control Mirrorjade that's already been used? It's yours now! They control a regulus after they've used their negate? Take it. Really good for breaking boards, and a must include for the deck. Next on the list is F0 Utopic Future and F0 Utopic Future Draco. These are niche, but if you overlay a 2nd Shangri-La and the other rank 7 I haven't talked about yet, you can make a pretty good monster negate that steals, in a deck that lacks negates of any kind. This is Niche, but it can come up. Next on the list, Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus. This card is good in almost any deck that uses Xyz and battles, and this is perfect with one card in particular. The next card is probably the most interesting card in the list, Dark Anthelion Dragon. It is a pendulum, so ring the Pend alarm. Generic Materials, 3k Attack, and has a really good battle phase effect. It can detach a material, halve an opponents monsters attack, then gain the attack. This is a quick effect, which means you can do damage step shenanigans. It also helps for OTK's by being able to deal 3k damage to your opponent, and combine that with your Kshatri-La's for easy OTK's. This is also amazing for Zeus, since it can always run over a card the opponent controls. Unless it's a Psychic End Punisher, Arrival Cyberse @Ignister, or a Crooked Cook. Otherwise, this is an easy Zeus line, with good OTK potential. But, if the opponent has a negate for this that also destroys it, it sets itself in the pend zone. While there, it does have a pretty good pend effect. Once per turn, just halve the attack of an opponents monster. This allows you to beat over the opponents boss monsters by halving them, then summoning Kshatri-La's and Adventurer tokens.

<strong><span>Final Notes</span></strong>

The deck is a really good control deck, allowing use of really good engines, rank 7s, and level 10 Synchros. The games are fun with this deck, but admittedly, as soon as you start locking zones with Shangri-La, the game starts losing its fun. But I do think that this deck is good, the only thing that would be better is if we had Galaxy Tomahawk.

&nbsp;

P.S. The side deck can realistically be anything, the current side deck is just my personal side deck of choice for this format. Also, I tried adding pictures to the Deck Description, not sure if I did it right, hopefully it's not 50% pictures of Kshatri-La Ogre.

&nbsp;

Focus is on setting up Winda w/ either Mechaba, Mirrorjade, or both, plus handtraps and disruption like punishment and droplet.

&nbsp;

Siding Summon Limit to really pile on the Winda lock and act as a fail safe

&nbsp;

Branded openings used in the same way as a hero lives in the dark law package. The destruction protection is nice too and comes up. You really wanna see branded stuff so this expedites it.

&nbsp;

Pros: Very versatile

Cons: (flips d barrier) response?

<span>The Deck's strategy is very simple, we will discard the cards in our hand in order to be able to use the special effects of our monsters, which will allow us to discard more cards, draw cards and also Special Summon ourselves.</span>
<span>The Extra deck is set up in a way that I believe is very situational, we can use Saryuja to buy more cards, make monsters stronger and also perform a special hand summon.</span>
<span>Number 38 and Apollousa are essential monsters to have good negations against our opponent. They are the main negations because we don't have handtraps in this deck, and for a very obvious reason, it is very likely that they will be discarded by accident due to the effect of dangers.</span>
<span>You can either come out first and try to get 38 and Apollousa on the table, or second and try an OTK by performing multiple invocations.</span>
<span>Another interesting card is the Eradicator Epidemic Virus, it may seem like a silly card, but it has saved me in many duels and when we have opponents that rely heavily on traps or spells, this card is a great choice to end our opponent's advantage. I also preferred not to put Harpie's Feather Duster, I thought it might be interesting to put the twin twisters instead, because as a cost we will discard at least one card.</span>

<span>However, it may be more interesting for you to change the virus for Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite, I left it on the side, but it fits perfectly in the main deck, even better than the virus, because with it you can invoke it, preferably returning a danger and so use its effects again, or even a dark world if you have ways to discard it</span>

<span>Whenever possible, try to discard Sillva with Dragged Down Into the Grave, because in addition to having his special summon, you will make your opponent return two cards to the bottom of the deck.</span>

<span>Otherwise, I will create another list in the future for when the new structure deck devil's gate is released, because then we will have some more interesting card interactions.</span>"

I love Lavals, and I would like it to have some good support, but there's barely any without sacrificing spaces or augmenting the possibility of a brick. I have to admit that the last help that had in Lightning Overdrive and Ghost From The Past was a good support (a negate and a hand Shuffle/discard), but it was too late for it to enter the Meta and with Lavalval Chain being banned cause it doesn't specifies for lavals how it should be, there's less options for the deck. So I want to share what I've found through all this time with the current cards for anyone who wants to try it.

The idea of this deck is that you can do a plague in 1 turn with the correct setup. here are some examples of combos. (You can do a rekindling or Birth of The Prominence Flame after any of the next moves):

1) Molten Conduction Field + Rekindling:
- The classic combo that can be stopped with a single Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. The idea is:
- 1 Laval Archer and 1 Laval Volcano Handmaiden.
- Then with effect of Laval Volcano Handmaiden search for the 2 copies and do the same.
- At the 3rd copy, you can send a Laval Archer or Laval Lakeside Lady (if you already have a level 4 monster in the hand for normal summon).
- Rekindling
- Synchro summon T.G. Hyper Librarian.
- Then, you can go for Crystron Halqifibrax with both Laval Volcano Handmaiden and search for a Laval Lakeside Lady and do a Synchro summon of Lavalval Salamander.
- For next turn activate Crystron Halqifibrax in the opponent main phase to Synchro summon T.G. Wonder Magician
- After you draw the card for the synchro summon, you can activate the effect of Wonder Magician to Summon Baronne de Fleur or Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying.
- go crazy.
At the end you should have at least 1 negate monster. If you are lucky, you can draw another Rekindling, Birth of the Prominence Flame or Left Arm Offering so you can extend the combo.

2) Special summon True King Agnimazud, the Vanisher/ Nine-Tailed Fox:
- The condition for special summon from Agnimazud/Nine-tailed fox triggers the search for destroying Laval Volcano Handmaiden if you send it with another or have a Laval in the GY besides Handmaiden. Plus, you can vanish a card with Agnimazud from the Field or GY. You can even normal summon if you have a level 1 tuner in the hand (or Jet Synchron in the GY) for a quick 7 or 10 Synchro summon.

*Note: if you destroy Agnimazud from the hand or field with another card (Laval Archer effect from GY for example), it triggers the effect to add from the GY to the hand a ""Non- fire Wyrm"" so, in this case you can add Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda to the hand. In the case of Nine Tailed fox, Generates two tokens.

3) Tenyi Spirit - Mapura/ Laval Lakeside Lady,
Laval Archer/ Laval Lakeside Lady
or
Tenyi Spirit - Mapura/ Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring:
- The idea is that you can do the synchro summon of Lavalval Salamander, send Laval Volcano Handmaiden (if it's in the hand) to the GY and do the combo or you can clean your hand for better cards. You can even do a little gamble looking for Handmaiden/Rekindling, but beware, cause you need at least 1 Fire Monster in the hand or say goodbye to it.

*Note: I know using Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring that way is not the best, but is a possibility for desperate times.

4) Gold Sarcophagus + Laval Cannon
or
Foolish Burial + Searing Fire Wall + Laval Cannon:
- Banishing Laval Lakeside Lady with Gold Sarcophagus and with a normal summon of Laval Cannon you can do a easy level 7 synchro. Same with Searing Fire Wall and Foolish Burial, but you can go for a level 8 synchro thanks to the token.

5) Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda + Any Tuner:
- A no brainer for a fast level 8 or 10 Synchro summon, just special summon Vishuda, then normal summon the tuner.

*Some notes or clarifications:
- Mistake: there's only one card in the whole deck that search's and add to the hand so it's a good way to make them play at your level.

- Dustflame Blast: Panic button. Bear in mind that it doesn't let you chose how many monster you want to banish for the effect to work, so make it your last resort.

- Saryuja Skull Dread: if you want to and have the resources, you can clean your hand like with salamander, same but +1 in hand and the buffs and effects of saryuja are a great add on. You can even search draw for rekindling like this.

- Pot of Desires: YOU NEED THE EXTRA DECK, so other pots like duality, extravagance and Prosperity are not the best option. The idea is to play it once you have all the lavals on the GY, so you don't lose resources, but beware of banishing Rekindling, which is the main card for the deck. Once you have all the cards you need it doesn't matter what you banish. or in the worst case you can use it to try to save those bricks.

- Pot of Avarice: simple, handtraps and some synchro, DON'T TOUCH THE LAVALS. Remember that you need the resources for the panic button and the Rekindling, unless you have almost no cards in the hand.

- Searing Fire Wall: Used mostly as a second panic button for a defensive wall. Unlike Dustflame Blast you can choose what card you want to banish and how many so it's a plus in terms of strategic banish, like the example before with Laval Cannon. In case you want to play Quasar/Blazar, this is the replacement of boost warrior, why?, because it has so much potential and use unlike boost warrior who is only used for the combo, at least like these you have more opportunities for plays.

- Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying: The alternative to Baronne de Fleur, this card with Dustflame Blast, Searing Fire Wall, Gold Sarcophagus, Agnimazud, Pot of Avarice, Lakeside Lady, Birth of the Prominence Flame, Called by the grave or any card that banish does a good match for this card, and you end up banishing so much things that you can even go over some 4500 monster, plus, the banish to prevent destruction effect doesn't specify if it has to be a wyrm like the swordsoul archetype, so you can select a laval or any magic/trap card that you don't need.

Some alternatives:

-Number 60: Dugares The Timeless: For those 2 lvl 4 monster at first hand. Watch out for those ash blossom and remember that if you use the ""draw 2, discard 1"" you won't be able to draw in your next draw phase.

-Nine-Tailed Fox: Same use as Agnimazud, but it doesn't destroy from the hand so it a little hard to make it work. But you can play it with Agnimazud so you can Generate the tokens.

-Cosmic Blazar Dragon/Shooting Quasar Dragon: Being my preference Blazar, you can still make a spot for this card, but I don't play it cause uses too much resources for the little that does as 2-3 negates in field. I'm not saying is bad, but for me it's better to have 2 Negates than 1 omni negate.

-Flamvell Counter: being a card that says ""NOPE"" to spell/trap cards a cost from your resources is a good alternative, if you like to play Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon in the spot of F.A. Dawn Dragster you can use it. Even better, it works with Chengying.

-Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon: I Love this card, is a good way to make some defense if you don't have a good start, and it has 2 negates, 1 from a monster and 1 if a level 5 or higher monster will be targeted cause of a monster effect, Both effects which can help you in early or late game. You can switch it with F.A. Dawn Dragster, but you will have less defense against spell/traps."

The main rank 4 enablers are Thousand Blades and Morning Star, so if you try to make your own heroic deck, keep in mind that you need quite a few heroics for Blades.

The real important thing is all of the cards that I <em>don't</em> run.

Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights

The reasons that you would want to run isolde, is that it can summon a Thousand Blades from deck which, of course, is a good payoff.

The issue with Isolde is that you actually need to make it before you can use it.

What I mean is that, the only cards that you would actually <em>want </em>to use for Isolde would be non-level 4 warriors, because making a rank 4, even if it isn't the otk, has more payoff than Isolde.

The reason for this is that if Isolde summons Blades, then you would need to have 3 heroics in hand to discard for Blades, otherwise you aren't getting any actual payoff from making the Isolde in the first place.

One could argue that you only need 2 discards since technically that would leave you with 3 lvl 4s and Isolde herself, but the only thing that gives you over the same play in a deck that doesn't run Isolde, would be a unicorn, which <em>also </em>needs a discard, albeit a generic discard, leaving you in essentially the same vice.

Wether you have 2 heroics or 3 in hand with the Isolde play, the issue is that more often than not, heroics are free lvl 4 extenders, and you wouldn't need to use material on the Isolde anyways.

Assuming that you are in a situation where you have 2 or 3 dead heroics in hand, AND you need to get 2 Isolde material on field, that would leave you with 2 cards in hand to actually be hts or board breakers. In most match-ups, that isn't enough to win, unless it's specifically the one(s) you need, and running Isolde (which would need 4+ brick equip spells, mind you) wouldn't be able to rescue you.

Heroic Challenger - Clasp Sword

Fun fact for all of the 2 (max) people reading this: one of the many, MANY, reasons that I've detached myself from the rest of the ""heroic community"" (one other player and his abusive friend) is over disputes of the usefulness of clasp sword, many of which ""ended"" with me getting muted after getting insulted and yelled at for about an hour because I managed to realize that Clasp has no actual place in a heroic deck.

But all of my deep hatred of them aside, I can certainly understand why a new player with no heroics experience would believe that Clasp is useful, although I must admit I don't understand the staunch defense of it.

The reason that I despise Clasp so much, is that it just plain isn't worth making. The reason you would play clasp is so that you could add another lvl 4 heroic extender after summoning it w/ Blades (one of 2 ways to trigger Clasp, the other being Ambush Soldier), However all that leaves you with is (assuming you have nothing unrelated) is Blades, Clasp, and a lvl 4, but if you didn't run/summon Clasp, then you would be left with Blades and whatever lvl 4 you would summon off of blades.

At first glance, this seems to prove that Clasp truly does have a use. After all, it gives you another body, and since this is a rank 4 spam deck, Clasp would <em>also </em>be a lvl 4...

...right?

It isn't. It's lvl 1.

Not to mention the fact that using Blades's effect locks you into heroics for the rest of the turn, so you can't even use it for link material.

Now, if any Extra-pilled fellow such as I were to explain this one of the filthy Clasp-pilled lot, I can assure you they would respond with ""Clasp doesn't add a lvl 4, it adds Knuckle, then you summon Knuckle from hand with its own effect, so you can make Jarn and summon a lvl 4 from your gy.""

(Side note: Knuckle will usually be classified as another lvl 4 extender, but in this case you wouldn't use its 2nd effect and it would stay lvl 1)

However, as my brothers have already figured out, the difference between using Clasp that way and not using it at all, is that using it gives you a spent Jarn.

Filthy Claspians would argue that that is better than not running it, which while technically being true, is overlooking a few things.

First and foremost, Clasp is a HARD GARNET. This means that if you draw it, it is entirely <em>useless.</em> And before someone can get a chance to say it, no, being a discard for Blades is <strong>not </strong>a use.

Secondly, Jarn's protection won't matter that late, since most always anyone would just use anything that pops would just quickfire it on the summon of Blades, so you wouldn't be able to summon anything at all. And keep in mind that, even the people who would die on Clasp's hill would agree that Blades is the only reasonable way to trigger Clasp anyways.

Forbidden Droplet

You literally just can't afford to discard a bunch of stuff, I don't really know how to elaborate at all.

&nbsp;

Now that I've gone through all of the things that I get lambasted for not running, I'd like to take this time to explain some of my ""spicier,"" as some would say, deck-building choices.

Denko Sekka &amp; Bujinki Ahashima

Yes, I know that Sekka is a thunder monster and not a warrior, just hear me out here.

If you win game 1 against a backrow heavy deck, then a Sekka backed by your 15/17 hts is usually just a free win.

Some of you may be wondering why I've paired Ahashima with Sekka, and that's because Ahashima is what you use Sekka for turn 3.

Sekka herself may not be a warrior, but she's still a lvl 4 monster, so if you summon a lvl 4 warrior on turn 3 and make Ahashima with that and Sekka, you can still make Claive assuming you have another lvl 4 warrior in your hand.

And before you ask, yes, this IS Ahashima's only use, but the ED is really open in heroic decks.

Extra Sword

I'll admit, Extra isn't important.

At all.

The reason that I run it is because it's the 2nd best thing to summon off of Blades after Morning Star, and given the fact that Morning Star is a 3 of with 4 searchers, I would like to have some back-up. If you would like to, you can absolutely replace Extra with anything else (unless it's one of the things I said to not play, as my word is next to law).
