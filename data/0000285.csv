I have spent about 3-4 years playing this deck. After all this time what you are seeing in front of you is the best I was able to come up with. I proudly present to you ""COMBO GEARGIA""!!! To play Geargia you basicaly have two options. The first one is to play many floodgates and traps while sitting on one 'Gear Gigant X' and waiting for your opponent to lose interest. The second one is to try and summon monsters like 'Megaclops' , 'Zeus' or 'Utopic Future'.  Since we are obviously focusing on the latter here are some of the hands you may be looking for going first, and also what they end on.  Geargiauger + Machine Duplication: NS Auger - add Accelerator - acc Dup, targeting the Auger - SS the Accelerator - SS Gigant X - acc Gigant, detaching Accelerator, add another Accelerator    *repeat a few times until you have 3 Gigant X*  link all three away into Megaclops and hope that your opponent didn't draw an out.  Geargiaauger + Machine Duplication + Infinitrack Anchor/Accelerator:  If you happen to open with an additional Accelerator all you have to do is replicate the strategie above now just beeing able to summon an extra Number 27 which can be considered a mini tank with high hopes for its future. Anchor Drill on the other hand can give you the option of either going into the Megaclops line again or to summon Utopic Future + Number 27. You do that by summoning Auger via Drill then SS Accelerator and prociding to acctivate Machine dup, in this line you do not use the effect of Auger and by that are not ristricted to only summoning machines.  A way to summon two monsters without using Auger + Geargiagear/eXceed: Link the two monsters away into I:P and set Geargiagear. On your opponents turn you summon Apollousa. OR Link into I:P summon two eXceeds link those into Virus Swordsman and summon, now or later, Avramax!  Going second its all the same exept that you can now use Schedule + any earth machine to summon out Avramax, due to it being summond with I:P it cannot be destroyed by card effects!  So yeah thats about it. A way to improve the deck is probably to look into some of the rank 8 and 9 plays Anchor Drill provides but I'm not going to be the one to do that. Hopefully this can be considered usefull and I have been able to demonstrate that there are other ways to play geargia than just set 5 pass.  :)"

For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more. Check the Description of this video on Youtube for more info.  In the gameplay, I opted not to use the Field Spell's effect (Once per turn: You can target 1 Set card in your opponent's Spell &amp; Trap Zone; while this card is in the Field Zone, that Set card cannot be activated until the End Phase, and your opponent must activate it during the End Phase or else send it to the GY) because I wanted to do more plays.

If you have a few Mysterune Quick-play Spell card, those non-Mysterune must be strong. You can build a deck with those properties with 40 card quite easily, and there are a lot of Mysterune Decks like this have been top in some Tournament. But how to build a 60 card Mysterune Deck? To ensure the property 1, you must play all Mysterune Spell card at 3 except the Countinous Spell card, because it is a dead card. But still, you just have 1/3 Mysterune Quick-play Spell in your Main Deck, so the deck must have card/archetypes/engine that can Draw/Mill or Disrupt/Control strongly. -Among non-Mysterune card, Pot of Desire and Grass is the must have card, and Triple Tactic Talent/Metalfoes Fusion are good Draw card that you should play 1. Another very strong Draw/Mill cards are Maxx ""C"" (which also Disrupt card) and Reasoning/Monster Gate, but sadly, those card can't be play together because you don't want to have a lot Monster in your deck for Reasoning/Monster Gate, and Maxx ""C"" whatever how many you play in this Deck is very arkward. So either 3 Maxx ""C"" or 3 Reasoning+3 Monster Gate, not both. You must choose between strong going second or going first ability. -Among non-Mysterune archetypes, Tearalaments is the best choice. This archetypes is very strong, it works very well with Grass, it can Mill sometimes and it can Disrupt/Control with just 1 Rainoheart or 1 Tearalaments+some lucky, and the best thing this archetypes can do is El Shaddoll Winda, which one of the best Floodgate in Meta game. -And is there any good engine for this deck? Luckily, Konami have realeased ""the Ancient"" archetypes, which can mill 5 CARD with Kelbek/Agido!!! So you can play this deck without Reasoning/Monster Gate by replace them with the engine Kelbek/Agido so you can play 3 Maxx ""C"" while still have strong going first ability!!! And you can play more Tearalaments monster, like Haufenis, so you have 9 hand trap Maxx ""C""/Haufenis/Kelbek for going second!!! And after add some good card, you now have a good Mysterune Deck as show here. It still weak to hand trap or going second (sadly) but if you lucky, it is very fun to play."

A similar deck is not to be found on this side, so I decided to share it here.  In an effort to not copy the deck 1 to 1, I made some minor changes to MBT's decklist.  &nbsp;  The idea behind the deck is to use the Branded engine as tribute fodder for the Monarchs.  Your combos are very hand dependent.  &nbsp;  The side deck presents some options to play with the ratios in the deck, but can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!  &lt;&lt; Edit:  I removed the Shaddoll package and included the Dogmatika cards. Escalation is the backup way to tribute summon during the opponents turn. &gt;&gt;"

Going second always feels good with the deck though!

Most expensive cards are Pot of Extravagance and Foolish Burial Goods but they make the deck more consistent. Can add more handtraps, I just included Effect Veilers since they are only 1 dollar each and generally useful against most decks. Pretty much just an outline for the deck. I excluded extra deck since it doesn't matter what's in it, just make sure that there are 15 cards if you want to resolve your Pot all 3 times. Side deck is whatever, make sure you have some sort of spell removal."

I've already made a definitive guide on how to use Megalith that I consider a deck that needs a lot of training to know how to use but that is not among the most difficult decks in the game at the DDD level: https://ygoprodeck.com/megalith-master-duel -apr22-format/  The main change I made to what I used before is to <strong>cut </strong><a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a><strong> to 1 copy in the deck</strong> because it is a necessary card for combos to work but the second copy is not that relevant compared to the second copy of <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a> or of <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a>, so by decreasing the number of Megalith Ophiel in the deck I was able to put <strong>more tech cards</strong> improving the deck's blind second against meta decks.  The deck has good qualities to be used: - <strong>Consistency</strong>: despite the <strong>high number of hand traps</strong> (11 slots) you have a lot of <strong>combination of 2 card combos</strong> so you can build a Ritual Summon deck that manages to have a balance between engine and tech cards. - The deck <strong>engine is cyclical and manages to generate an advantage every turn</strong>, whether yours or the opponent's turn, which makes the game volume very high and oppressive for the opponent because you are always proposing new moves with each passing turn. No wonder it's common for you to end turn 3 of the game with between 12 and 14 cards in the deck so absurd is the <strong>Megalith's search power</strong>. - The surprise factor also helps a lot because there are starting hands that you open that in themselves are <strong>resilient to 1 Hand Trap/interaction</strong> and depending on the opponent's ignorance about your moves you can combo up 2 Hand Traps and I even managed to make my 1 turn setup up to 3 Hand Traps. - The <strong>end board you make is very good against any match up you face</strong>, whether it's combo decks, control decks, that have several layers of play or that just set 5 traps and pass the turn so it's very difficult for you to lose to random decks and meta decks most of the time will have to open with a very <strong>strong combination of cards</strong> to go over their field and I practically never took OTK when making my turn 1 setup so <strong>resilient is it to Blind Second Cards</strong> like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> etc.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// /////////// Now I'm going to talk about some cards that most positively surprised me in the use of the deck:  <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och:</a> when using the card in the deck I didn't regret testing it because it really makes the <strong>Megalith engine plays better whether to build field or break</strong>, mainly because it's a <strong>fourth name of low level Megalith Monster</strong> to use the effect of Ritual Summon on your turn allowing you to build moves that aren't possible if you don't use it. And on the opponent's turn it works almost like <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> being able to Ritual Summon <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> to the field, but you'll have to have it in hand first and that's good if your <strong>Megalith Phul eff from Ritual Summon doesn't resolve</strong> because your opponent used <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> or <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> type of card to negate it.  <a data-name=""Cyber ​​Angel Benten"">Cyber ​​Angel Benten</a> and <a data-name=""Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands"">Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</a>: These cards greatly increase your grind game because it's <strong>very simple to loop Benten for Ritual Summon</strong> and add Manju to your hand every turn which allows you to access <strong>XYZ's Toolbox Rank-4</strong> easily to control the game.  <strong>Impcantation Engine</strong>: It's a fantastic engine to <strong>deal with opponent interactions</strong> because you can Ritual Summon saving cards and leaving the rest in your hand as push moves, so for example I've managed to deal with Virtual World <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a> which is a <a data-name=""Macro Cosmo"">Macro Cosmo</a>s field without having any of my Ritual monsters banished because I just used <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> and Impcantation monsters to Ritual Summon <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> who brought <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a> from the deck for example and as I had done NS <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> on the turn I was able to RANK-4 <a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a> to shuffle the Shenshen back to the deck and play cool afterwards. So it's an engine that is not only good against interactions, but also <strong>helps to play around cards that are out of your control like some Floodgates</strong>.  <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a>: This card plays more than one role in the deck because in addition to saying <strong>""No"" to field-breaking cards</strong> like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> it <strong>adds two follow ups to the hand</strong> so it's a card that always leaves you on par with your opponent in card advantage and since you can <strong>always loop Benten back to your hand</strong> in this deck your opponent is short on time to take it out as you will always have the negate spell/trap live effect again to use.  <strong>Extra Deck Monsters</strong>: Among the XYZ monsters, the ones that surprised me the most were <a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a> which is basically a <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> for face-up cards on the field, which is important to avoid card effects like <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"">Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</a></span> or <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Despian Quaeritis</a></span> that don't activate its effects if gets back to the Extra Deck.  Another card that was very useful was <a data-name=""Number 101: Silent Honor ARK"">Number 101: Silent Honor ARK</a> because <strong>LINK monsters can't play around</strong> its effect and after stealing the opponent's LINK monsters you go to the battle phase and <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> in Main Phase 2 to deal with even more opponent's cards. Simply <strong>Number 101 and AA-Zeus can take a lot of boring card out of the field</strong> like <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></span> because even taking 3k damage with Silent Honor ARK you do AA-Zeus on M2 and take it out of the field.  And finally we have the <a data-name=""Drill Driver Vespenato"">Drill Driver Vespenato</a> that has the utility of being made on top of <a data-name=""Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk"">Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk</a>, <a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a> that are out of material and give <strong>piercing damage</strong> to the opponent or simply make it difficult to take it off from the field because if not <strong>you reborn any Level5 or lower monster from GY</strong> like a Megalith Phul for example.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ////"

Oh and also it's a control deck I guess. ,"So, the idea behind this deck is simple - I've always liked the idea of a Cyberse deck, because there is a lot of really good generic cyberse link support, but the pieces aren't all the way there yet - there's an absence of good things to end on going first (yes, Tri-Gate exists, but it takes a lot of resources to turn on and doesn't have many partners). Also, while going second has sweet OTK potential, there isn't really a ""generic"" 1-card engine that puts up Update-Transcode-Accesscode - however, you can do that with the salad engine. It's pretty brilliant all things around - you get to run Micro-Coder and Cynet Conflict, letting you stack up even more Omnis going first while having more tools to jam out Accesscode. You have good Salad grind game to fall back on, looping Ashes, looping the traps, basically if you get ground into a halt trying to kill or combo you most likely have some interruption still. Suddenly, going first your common end board is Transcode protecting self-linked Sunlight Wolf with backrow galore, whereas meanwhile you're tuned to very often just kill outright with Accesscode on a turn you have a battle phase. Add in a couple Pot of Avarice for a little greed and a hell of a lot of extra grind, and suddenly you're the deck that can do anything... almost.  The truth is, the end board is very weak to sweepers, and going second is always a huge risk if you don't see Droplets. I don't see this as a tier 1 or even 2 threat, even if it is respectable and will just suddenly kill out of nowhere. I also don't think this is the best version of Salad if you want to play Salad - this is a link deck that OTKs with Accesscode first, and Salad plays are just to get you there.  I've also included I:P into Crusadia Avramax because 1) it is funny, 2) it's kinda lowkey good in the Master Duel meta rn, and BO1 makes it more viable, and 3) it actually synergizes with the Salad engine and gives you something to actually work towards when you can just extend for days."

Although the End Board is often not cool for your opponent to face, what I find interesting are mainly the use of <strong>several generic engines that have some synergy with the Fluffal deck</strong> such as <a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos"">Illusion of Chaos</a> and <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> and especially <strong>Destiny HERO package</strong> to make <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dangerous"">Destiny HERO - Dangerous</a> and I'm using <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a> to have more ways to Fusion Summon. I made these other deck profiles that explain how the deck works and are very useful for playing Fluffal correctly because this is not a linear deck and each starting hand changes the way you build plays: https://ygoprodeck.com/fluffal-fusion-format-may22/ https://ygoprodeck.com/fluffal-may22-format/  ////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Combo details</strong>:  - During your combo, think about <strong>which peaces you need right now and which ones you can leave and add later</strong>. So many times you will use <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> to send <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and add the <a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Fluffal Bear</a> that will set you to <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> from the deck which is a very good move <strong>depending on your cards</strong> in hand especially if you have <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a>, <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> or some other good discard for the GY like <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> or <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a>. <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">- Bahamut Shark</a> you will always use as a material link so if you made it without having Link Monsters before you put it in the Extra Monster Zone so you don't create conflicts when you special summon the field.  - It's common for you to take hand traps/interactions or <strong>when you can't access</strong> <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> at all you do <a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a> just to <strong>force the opponent not to destroy it</strong> because if you don't you <strong>add Scythe to the hand</strong> and Fusion Summon on his turn.  ////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Details about the engines used</strong>:  <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> sends Spells/Traps as a cost to GY so if you have 2 <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> on the field it doesn't matter if the opponent denies DRAW 2 because you will still have <strong>2 Toy Vendor search</strong> which will most likely be <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> and <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a>. The only detail of this engine is that you only use the <a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos"">Illusion of Chaos</a> effect when you <strong>have already done the searches</strong> and now you will activate Toy Vendor eff of draw so that the <strong>top of the deck does not change</strong>.  <a data-name=""Destiny Hero - Dangerous"">Destiny Hero - Dangerous</a> package with <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Denier"">Destiny HERO - Denier</a> and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a> = RANK-6 <a data-name=""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"">Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal</a> to send <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> <strong>without wasting your Normal Summon</strong> and has easy Link Climb to make <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> move for example. You do this combo by opening only <strong>one of the HERO ""Bricks"" and Frightfur Patchwork</strong>. This engine can also be useful for you to <strong>send</strong> <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> <strong>to the GY if you haven't had access to the card yet</strong> and <strong>add it back to the hand</strong> with <a data-name=""Fluffal Octopus"">Fluffal Octopus</a>. It also helps you to play after taking <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> when solving the <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> effect because you do <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dangerous"">Destiny HERO - Dangerous</a> and basically you <strong>have 3 more Special Summons</strong> for the field which allows you to Link Climb to <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> or even make the <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a> that allows you to Fusion Summon your Frightfur monsters to give OTK if you bring the <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> for example.  <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a> = Fusion Summon plays, he's not as bad in this deck as at first although you <strong>need to have the Fusion Materials on the field</strong> because you have cards like <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> and <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> that make it <strong>easy for you to setup for Fusion Summon</strong>. And it's Fire attribute which gives you another pop for Accesscode Talker.  ////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Examples of Test Hands</strong>: Here I've copied some moves I've made with the deck by playing matches in the Dueling Book so you can get an idea of ​​how to make the deck engine spin and build boards. So it's basically me repeating the same steps I did in the match and even demonstrating the gamestate of the opponent's field in one of the replays so that the move makes sense.  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-39587859 Example 1 versus PUNK Therion  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-39589406 Example 2 versus Despia Predaplant  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-39590690 Example 3 - Two examples of Full Combo from the deck I made, in one of them I played Beatrice send Scythe to GY to add to the hand. And you can see the luck factor present in the random draws of the deck because it's not always guaranteed to pass with the interaction of Scythe + Penguin on the opponent's turn if your draws are redundant.  ////////////////////////////////////////////////  A very <strong>important Ruling</strong> with <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> is about the <strong>atk boost</strong> because if you <strong>successfully resolve the Boost effect and then the opponent negates the effects</strong> of the Fusion monster you targeted and increased ATK that monster will <strong>continue with the Boost ATK</strong> until end of turn. So a common situation in which this happens is you use the <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> trigger effect when Fusion Summoned and the opponent tries to negate it with <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> or <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> for example and in <strong>chain link 3 you use Cruel Whale to increase its ATK to 3900</strong> and when the chain link resolves the Cruel Whale will be with the effects negated but will continue with the ATK Boost. So call a judge if your opponent thinks the ATK goes back to the original of the Fusion monster because I know this ruling ATK modifiers and that's the difference in many cases between losing and winning.  ////////////////////////////////////////////////"

The strategy now has 2 new monster extenders, Springirl and Sleepy Maiden, an incredible spell card, Marincess Dive, and two fantastic new link monsters, Aqua Argonaut and Coral Triangle. Along with an engine that provides near-endless amounts of recyclability and follow-up, Marincess is ready to grind out the best in the format, positioning itself as one of the strongest control decks in the game!</span>  <b>Main Deck- 41 cards</b>  <span>Marincess Engine (Monsters)</span>  <b>3x Marincess Blue Tang-</b><span> Blue Tang is your most consistent starter. On Normal or Special Summon, she can send one Marincess monster from your deck to your graveyard. When she's sent to the Graveyard as material for a Water Link Monster, she can excavate the top 3 cards of the deck and, if there are any Marincess cards among those 3, she can add 1 to your hand, like a Normal Summoned Salamangreat Foxy. This 2nd effect is great for chain-blocking your Link-1 effects, and because the deck now plays more Marincess cards than ever before (19 in this build), your chances of adding a card off this excavation are about 80% or more if this is your starting play.</span>  <b>3x Marincess Sea Horse- </b><span>Sea Horse occupies a unique place in the deck. On first release of the archetype, Sea Horse was the strategy's best Normal Summon and extender. Now, she's essentially the jack-of-all-trades of the deck, good for just about any occasion. She has no effect on summon (Adventurer Marincess is another possible build!), but can special summon herself to the zone a Marincess Link Monster points to without starting a chain. Additionally, in the Graveyard, she can special summon ANY Water monster from your hand to a Marincess Link Monster's arrow, but not on the turn she was sent. If she was a level 4, she'd be perfect but she's still an easy 3-of for her versatility.</span>  <b>3x Marincess Springirl- </b><span>Marincess has a new level 4 extender! Springirl allows you to banish 1 Marincess monster from your graveyard and special summon herself. Previously, if your opponent managed to get rid of your Normal Summon with something like Swordsoul Blackout, the deck crumbled rather easily. But, thanks to cards like Springirl and Dive, this is less of a problem now! Additionally, when she's sent to the Graveyard as Link material, she can send cards from your Deck to the GY equal to the number of Marincess monsters you control, and inflict 200 damage for each Marincess card sent.</span>  <span>This effect might seem rather innocuous but it serves 3 important purposes. First, this effect can chainblock, extremely useful for preventing an Ash on your Sea Angel search. Second, the mill can help win in time in some cheeky scenarios. And third, (yes, this structure is a Vrains reference), not only can you mill cards that provide extension/be added back to hand with cards like Blue Slug, Coral Anemone, Marbled Rock, and Toadally Awesome but in the Adventurer or Swordsoul matches, milling a Token Collector for free can be a huge momentum swing.</span>  <b>2x Marincess Pascalus- </b><span>I wasn't even playing Pascalus for a while, but I've seen the light. Pascalus can be hit-and-miss, but if you're playing Bahamut Shark and Toad, she is a must. On Normal OR Special Summon, Pascalus can Special Summon a Marincess monster from your hand, other than herself. This effect is near-useless if she's the only Marincess in your hand (especially if you open both copies of her), but if she isn't, she can be very powerful.</span>  <span>In a good hand, Pascalus can get Bahamut Shark into Toadally Awesome by your 4th summon, before you even go into your full Marincess combo, or slap down an early Crystal Heart. She also has a neat Graveyard effect where, other than the turn she was sent to the Graveyard, she can banish herself to add a Marincess spell/trap back to your hand. This means you can add back a Dive, a Battle Ocean, a Wave, whatever you may need. You really don't want to see two in- hand, hence not maxing out on her, and Blue Tang is your best 1-card starter, but Pascalus adds that extra layer of pressure that can mean everything in both the opener and the grind.</span>  <b>1x Marincess Sleepy Maiden- </b><span>Sleepy Maiden is the strangest Main Deck Marincess to-date, but neatly fills a spot in the deck others can't. She's a level 5, which can be frustrating (you can’t use her for Sea Angel or Blue Slug), but she is a very unique special summon. Sleepy Maiden targets a Marincess card on the field, special summons herself, and, as long as she's on the field, that card cannot be destroyed by your opponent's card effects. This is great for protecting your Battle Ocean from cards from spell removals like Lightning Storm and Twin Twisters and also popular bosses like Baronne de Fleur and Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer. She can be an excellent simple extender, but if she's included on your endboard, the deck has another level of difficulty to crack.  Additionally, in the Graveyard, she can banish herself to equip a Marincess Link Monster in the GY to another Marincess Link Monster on the field. This makes Sleepy Maiden a go-to send for Blue Tang, for times when Sea Angel gets negated or for Wonder Heart to put an extra body on the field.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>1x Marincess Mandarin- </b><span>Mandarin is likely the worst Marincess monster, but she deserves her spot in the deck. Mandarin can special summon herself to the zone a Water Link Monster points to if there are 2 or more Marincess monsters on the field, but she is banished when she leaves the field. Notably, this effect works in either the Graveyard or the hand, so she can be a great send off of Forbidden Droplet, Cynet Mining, Coral Triangle, or Great Bubble Reef, and can even help boost Bubble Reef's attack in a pinch. And, as she can be used for either of the Link-1s, she's still a one-card combo thanks to Marincess Dive.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x Silent Sea Nettle- </b><span>The only non-handtrap, non-Marincess monster in the Main Deck! Silent Sea Nettle is a level 4 extender that can special summon itself from the hand, as long as you control another Water monster, but it locks you into only summoning Water monsters for the rest of the turn... </span><span>Yeah, I think we can live with that.</span>  <span>This card is straight-up perfect. Excellent for an early Bahamut into Toad, an easy way to continue a turn, and, while it's in the Graveyard, you can banish it to shuffle 3 Water monsters from the Graveyard back into your deck (this can also include another copy of the card, and can be used the same turn it special summoned itself!). Running low on Extra Deck resources? Silent Sea Nettle can fix that, easily. Even sending/milling the card isn't a loss by any means. Just an outstanding card.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Marincess Engine (Spells + Traps)</span>  <b>3x Cynet Mining- </b><span>A neg-1 but a strong way to boost consistency, and if you send a Marincess card off of Cynet, it is more than likely the card will find itself back in your hand shortly. However, watch out for Droll and Lock bird in games 2 and 3. Droll isn't a silver bullet against the deck like it would be against something like Dragon Link or Drytron, but it can still hurt, especially if your first search is off of Cynet Mining.</span>  <b>3x Marincess Dive- </b><span>Oh my God, is this card amazing! Marincess Dive is Monster Reborn for any non-Link Marincess monster but, if you have Marincess Battle Ocean up on the field, Dive can summon from deck. You want to open this card as much as possible. And remember that 3 different Marincess monsters can add this card back to your hand from the graveyard, so it will continually wind up back in your hand. As a note, the effects are bulleted, allowing the player to choose which effect they'd like to activate if Battle Ocean is on the field, playing around certain handtraps that may ruin your day otherwise.</span>  <b>1x Marincess Battle Ocean- </b><span>The heart and soul of the deck, Battle Ocean is a fascinating and unique Field Spell. When it is face-up on the field, monsters in the Extra Monster Zone that were Link Summoned using Marincess Crystal Heart are unaffected by your opponent’s card effects, and all Marincess monsters gain 200 attack base plus 600 attack for every Marincess monster they're equipped with. How do Marincess monsters become equipped?</span>  <span>Well, when a Marincess is Link-Summoned to the Extra Monster Zone, Battle Ocean can equip up to 3 differently-named Marincess monsters from your Graveyard to the newly-summoned monster. This is amazing for giving your Marincess monsters some extra attack, and also provides some very interesting interactions with cards like Forbidden Droplet, which is getting a reprint in Duels from the Deep as well! Most funny scenario? A 3500 attack Marincess Blue Slug crashing into an Eldlich under Skill Drain.</span>  <b>2x Marincess Wave-</b><span> Wave is a recursive, searchable monster negate that turns all face-up monsters on your side of the field into Towers (unaffected by opponent’s card effects). This card can even be activated from the hand if you control a Link-3 or higher Marincess monster! This is another key feature of your Marincess endboard, and being able to essentially put an Infinite Impermanence back in your hand every turn can make life quite difficult for your opponent. Because the card can be added by Coral Triangle, added back to the hand by Anemone, Marbled Rock, or Pascalus, isn’t a once per turn, and isn’t great going 2nd, 2 copies is the best ratio.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span><b>Utility (Handtraps + Going 2nd cards)</b></span><b> </b><b> </b><b>3x Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring- </b><span>Too much use to not play at 3 in a mid-range deck!</span>  <b>3x Effect Veiler- </b><span>Not as good as Infinite Impermanence but still hits a vast majority of decks, and while drawing Imperm off of Great Bubble Reef on the opponent’s turn is a dead card, Veiler is live from the get-go.</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>3x Infinite Impermanence- </b><span>The better Veiler, good in just about every matchup.</span>  <b>2x D.D. Crow- </b><span>Crow isn’t a once per turn, and is impactful against almost every meta deck save Floowandereze (it can still stop Stri but that’s about it).</span>  <b>1x Cosmic Cyclone- </b><span>It’s an out to Mystic Mine, but also, banishing a Swordsoul Blackout before it can pop 2 of your cards, forcing an early Branded in Red, banishing a Discolosseum or Sunavalon Bloom, it certainly comes up.</span>  <b>1x Called By The Grave- </b><span>Can we just ban this sacky-ass card already?</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>3x Forbidden Droplet- </b><span>Marincess struggles with going 2nd into an established board. It can play through multiple disruptions, but being able to set up while breaking is difficult. Droplet is a massive boon to the deck for both your going first and second plays. Marincess cards sent to the Graveyard off of Droplet won’t stay there long.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>Additionally, Battle Ocean’s effect to equip Link Monsters isn’t a once per turn, so you can use Droplet while link climbing going 2nd. Additionally, sending a Coral Anemone off of Droplet in the S/T zone will put a Marincess card back in the hand, so you can even gain free resources/follow-up off of negating your opponent’s monsters!</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><b>Extra Deck</b><b> </b><b> </b><span>The Marincess Links</span>  <b>2x Marincess Blue Slug- </b><span>Blue Slug is a very simple Link-1 that adds back a Marincess monster from the Graveyard on Link Summon. It can only be summoned once per turn, but you’ll want two of these in the grind game. Remember, as soon as you use this effect, you’re locked into Water monsters. Some builds may care about that, but this one doesn’t at all.</span>  <b>2x Marincess Sea Angel- </b><span>On Link Summon, Sea Angel adds a Marincess spell to hand. Previously, the only spell was Battle Ocean but now, Sea Angel can add Dive, which makes her so much more powerful! It is very likely that your opponent will attempt to negate Sea Angel, so if you have a way to chain-block her search, it is wise to use cards like Blue Tang and Springirl as material. Playing 4 Link-1 monsters is excellent for the grind game and resource management.</span>  <b>1x Marincess Crystal Heart- </b><span>Crystal Heart is the only card in the extra deck that isn’t necessarily a piece of disruption or advantage generation, but it is entirely unique. She’s unaffected by monster effects while in the Extra Monster Zone, which is very funny if your opponent uses Nibiru while she is the only monster on the field (she is often the 5th summon), and has a niche battle protection effect for herself and other Marincess monsters that has come up precisely 1 time in dozens of hours of playtesting.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>Crystal Heart is in the Extra because, with Battle Ocean up, any Link-Summoned monster in the EMZ that uses her as material is unaffected by your opponent’s effects. This means no Nibiru, no Super Poly, no effect destruction, no banishing, any of these monsters can only be tributed or destroyed by battle under this protection. Very interesting card.</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>2x Marincess Coral Anemone- </b><span>Coral Anemone is a 2000 attack Link-2 that can special summon any Water monster with 1500 or less attack from your Graveyard to a zone she points to, without negating their effects. This is very powerful, but it does target </span><b>and</b><span> does have to summon to her link zone, so Imperm, Crow, Veiler, Gamma, and Ghost Ogre can all interact with her. If your hand has a good starter and extender, make Anemone using Crystal Heart and prevent your opponent from being able to interact with her.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>When sent from the field to the Graveyard, Anemone can add </span><b>any </b><span>Marincess card from the Graveyard to the hand. She does not have to be sent by card effect or anything, so even sending her as a cost for Droplet triggers this effect. This is normally the card you’ll most want equipped to your Marincess Link Monsters.</span>  <b>1x Marincess Marbled Rock- </b><span>The original Marincess boss monster still has a place in the deck! Once per turn, Marbled Rock can add 1 Marincess card back to your hand from the Graveyard, similar to how Coral Anemone works when she’s linked off. In battle, she has a non-once per turn ability to send a Marincess monster from hand to the Graveyard to prevent damage/battle destruction when she or another one of your monsters is attacked. Mostly, she’s used for link-climbing in later turns to recur resources, and having a 2500 body on a Link-3 is nothing to sneeze at, especially when she reaches 4500 under Battle Ocean with 3 equips.</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>1x Marincess Coral Triangle- </b><span>The new Link-3! Coral Triangle can send 1 Water monster from your hand to the Graveyard to add a Marincess trap, which is just Wave for our purposes. Any level 4 or lower Marincess monster can get to Coral Triangle + Wave, which makes this very easy to accomplish even without a strong starter or extenders. Searching Wave is amazing for the deck, as it no longer has to focus so much on drawing into the card for turn or off of Bubble Reef.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>Her Graveyard effect can provide immense crackback if your opponent isn’t prepared. If only your opponent controls a monster, you can banish Triangle from the Graveyard and special summon any number of Water Link Monsters from the Graveyard whose total Link Ratings equal 3. This is usually Anemone + Angel/Slug, but can also include Marbled Rock, Crystal Heart, Eria, and so forth. The effects of these monsters are also not negated. So essentially, if you make Triangle as part of your turn 1 combo, your next turn is already set to go, even if there aren’t any cards in your hand. Coral Triangle is a huge boost for the deck!</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>1x Marincess Aqua Argonaut- </b><span>Marincess’ new Link-4 is also likely their best to date. On your turn, Argonaut can bounce 1 Water monster you control and 1 card your opponent controls back to hand. On your opponent’s turn, she can negate the activated effect of a Spell/Trap by special summoning a Marincess Link Monster she’s equipped with (watch for Ogre!), and while she’s in the Extra Monster Zone, your opponent can only attack her. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>Normally, she is unaffected and at somewhere between 3700-4900, depending on your equips, so destroying her in battle is easier said than done. This is also great if an opponent attempts to destroy Toadally Awesome in battle before you’d like to use their effect to negate, or to out Sleepy Maiden to go after your field spell. In my opinion, the deck’s best endboard for power and follow-up is an unaffected Argonaut in the EMZ equipped with Anemone + 2 others, Sleepy Maiden in defense (summoned by targeting Battle Ocean), Toadally Awesome, Coral Triangle in the Graveyard, and 3 cards in-hand, including Wave. This board is not only difficult to crack, with multiple pieces of interaction, but also provides 3 possible follow-ups from Triangle, Toad, and Anemone.</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>1x Marincess Great Bubble Reef- </b><span>Great Bubble Reef is another eccentric, 3-effect Link-4 in your arsenal! Each time a monster is banished face-up, Bubble Reef gains 600 attack for the duration of that turn (this card is hilarious against Fairy Tail Snow), and during the Standby Phase, she can banish 1 Water monster from your Graveyard or face-up field to draw 1 card.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>By sending a Water monster from your hand to the Graveyard, Great Bubble Reef can special summon back any of your banished Marincess monsters, including Link Monsters, without negating their effects. And, once again, if she is outed and in the graveyard, you have 5 different monsters that can put her back in the Extra deck!</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>1x Marincess Wonder Heart- </b><span>Wonder Heart is mostly used to push for damage. Some people play Accesscode/Transcode instead of, say Eria and Wonder Heart, but I enjoy not having to worry about the Water lock, and Wonder Heart has tricks that Accesscode simply doesn't. When she battles an opponent’s monster, she can special summon a Marincess monster she’s equipped with, and protects herself from damage/battle destruction. If she is destroyed on the field by your opponent, she can special summon a Link-3 or lower Marincess from your Graveyard.</span>  <span>Wonder Heart can help close out games, or get in some quick damage in a pinch. I really like doing a combo in the late game, if I’m not at lethal, where I’ll make Marbled Rock, add back a Marincess card, summon Wonder Heart, equip Wonder Heart with Marbled Rock, attack with Wonder, summon Marbled, attack with Marbled, and then go into one of the other Link-4s in Main Phase 2. It’s a little dance of link juggling that I find super fun!</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>The Marincess Extra Deck Supporting Cast</span>  <b>1x Eria The Water Charmer, Gentle- </b><span>Eria is likely summoned the least out of every monster in this Extra Deck but, for her particular niche, she is extremely useful. Eria can get an annoying Contact “C”, Nibiru, or Knightmare Corruptor Iblee off of your board, as she just takes 2 monsters including a Water, but on destruction, she can also add any of your Water monsters to your hand, save Pascalus and Sleepy Maiden.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>Additionally, though her effect to special summon a Water monster from your opponent’s Graveyard will come up only on occasion, I have been able to take cards such as Swordsoul of Mo Ye and Tenyi Spirit Shthana to make Bahamut Shark, though in theory, you could also take cards such as Sky Striker Ace Shizuku, Plunder Patroll cards, and even Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign Chengying.</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>1x Bahamut Shark- </b><span>This card just reads “Slap together 2 level 4 Water monsters, detach 1 material, and summon one of the best negations in the game.”</span>  <b>1x Toadally Awesome- </b><span>As many people already know, Toadally Awesome is entirely befitting of their name. Their effects are:</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1. Standby Phase: Detach 1 material, special summon 1 Frog from the deck (is not used in this deck)</span><span> </span><span>2. When your opponent activates an effect (Monster, Spell/Trap), you can send 1 Aqua monster from your hand/field (including itself!) to the GY to negate that effect, destroy the card, and set the negated card to your field. </span><span>3. If this card is sent to the GY (in any way), you can target 1 Water monster in your Graveyard (including itself, again!) and add it back to your hand.</span>  Toad is just incredible. The negation is excellent, the set card can have a variety of uses, and the ability to recur itself or any of your Marincess monsters makes the deck even more difficult to fully take down.  <span><b>Side Deck</b></span><b> </b><b> </b><b>Tailor this to your locals/liking! Remember that, going first, Marincess can also play under cards like Skill Drain, Gozen Match, Rivalry of Warlords, and Summon Limit, to name a few!</b>"

Use the force Raye. Engage and destroy. ,"Hello everyone and welcome to my Skystriker Enforcer deck profile.  With Skystriker winning YCS Hartford with a Mystic Mine/D-Barrier variant of the deck, uptake for that particular build is no doubt going to skyrocket. With that in mind I'm opting to play a more grindy Enforcer build. The deck is solid against the rest of the meta, but is also able to laugh in the face of the mine/barrier mirror match.  3 Raye and 2 Roze is still the correct ratio. Once Linkage makes its way into the TCG Roze can be cut to 1, but with 1 Drones, Area Zero and Multirole that's roughly 7 ways to get into your Ace monsters and that's good enough for me.  Handtrap wise 3 Ash and Veiler are used, as well as 2 D.D Crow and 1 Nibiru. The deck has enough in built monster negation with Widow Anchor so I fell adding imperm is somewhat unnecessary but Veiler is due to it being required for the Accesscode Talker package. 2 D.D. Crow is really good against a lot of meta, hitting Tenyi's, Fusion materials in the grave when Albion is summoned in Branded, banishes Eldlich itself and the Golden Land traps, as well as ridding the mirror of Engage/Raye.  1 Engage, 3 Widow Anchor, 1 Multirole, 1 Hornet Drones and 1 Afterburner are fairly standard so no more needs to be said there. Where my build does differ is the inclusion of 1 Jamming Wave over 1 copy of Shark Cannon (which is usually played at 2). My reasoning behind this is I wanted an additional something to force lone backrow such as Dreaming Town or Branded fusion cards to activate prematurely, and also Shark Cannon has no utility against Floowandereeze. Waves is also decent against the mirror too.  The draw engine consists of 3 Foolish Burial Goods, 1 Metalfoes Fusion, 1 Upstart and 1 Avarice. While desires was OK with Engage at 3, it isn't great with it at 1. This build also plays a fair few important 1 of that I cannot afford to be banished. Pot Of Prosperity takes a lot of the grind game away for my liking. You either permanently lose the ability to go into the accescode engine, DPE or you lose ace monsters that could be very important if you do end up in a grind game with a lot of attrition. My view is Striker needs to retain it's extra deck to remain flexible enough for any opportunities to close the game. Goods is amazing as it puts 2 spelks in thd grave, and looping metalfoes with it for additional draws is always great. Avarice is a key card as you can recycle the Striker links, the DPE engine and the handtraps, as well as draw into 2 cards.  Lightning Storm and Forbidden Chalice are additional board breaker cards. The ED is pretty much standard. Skystriker engine links, DPE, Accescode package and Dhrac. Dhrac being a spellcaster means you don't have use up what could be a precious Effect Veiler to go into the Accesscode package, plus bringing back opposing Raye, DPE, or any dark monster with a powerful effect is too good to pass up.  3 Droll in the side mainly for Floowandereeze but does also impact any deck that searches quite often too. 2 Nib for combo, 2 Contact ""C"" is really strong this format. Sunlavon typically struggle to play around it, ABC Therion is forced to play IP early to get rid of it, this makes the unable to use platinum gadget, which at the very least makes it difficult to get ABC on the field. And of course shuts off Branded Despia unless they're playing Sprind in the ED or can poly into Chimera. 3 Twin Twisters and 2 Evenly Matched for backrow and 3 D-Barrier for going 1st against Branded and Swordsoul.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Anytime you grass looks greener you feel like you can't lose the game at that point. I really was impressed with how strong the deck ended up being and I think you should give it a try.

I was first introduced to this card when I did a mini tournament at an anime convention where my opponent was playing a sacred phoenix dark dust spirit deck. I was impressed. The only reason I won was because I got lucky and drew a chaos sorcerer off the top, even though looking back, my deck was definitely lacking.  When I dove head first into goat format during covid, I was really disappointed with the design choices of the standard phoenix decks. Historically there have been some zombie decks that splashed a phoenix engine into their deck since it somewhat matched vampire lords effect, but it was effectively just a redundant and somewhat worse version of vampire lord. The common builds I have seen on sites have a weird defend the castle linear phoenix deck idea that is so paranoid about chaos that they run solemn judgment and multiple one for one backrow removal. The problem with this is that sacred phoenix is only good if you use it so that you can put pressure on the opponent without being so worried about their own back row. If you play defend the castle with heavy back row, you just end up damaging yourself instead of actually doing anything useful with your own phoenix since you just pop your own stuff on revival. Phoenix decks deserve better than this!  My idea is to have a jack of all trades master of none goat phoenix deck. It isn't as useful as an aggro deck in all out offense and  it will get out goated by a standard goat deck. So why run this at all? The ability for this deck to pivot in the middle of a match from a defensive to offensive, or offensive to defensive strategy while still keeping field presence and momentum is surprisingly powerful. Instead of being stuck on phoenix being your only win condition, you can choose to summon it when useful, and when you do you can be very aggressive with it, because if it is taken care of you have other options to still carry out a win.  I know I have probably committed heresy, but this deck does run 41 cards. Space is pretty tight so I decided it was better to just go slightly over than to get rid of or lower the count of certain spell/traps since the power and utility definitely comes up in longer games. That being said, consistency is not really a significant issue with the one card difference, and since the deck relies heavily on recruiters you actually go through a lot of deck thinning in the process.  The recruiters allow for you to have a defensive wall that toolboxes some powerful cards when you need them. Mystic tomato and shining angel having 1400 attack allows for you to potentially put your opponent on a clock if you need to, while still being a good defensive wall while grabbing useful cards along the way. Mystic tomato is the best recruiter in the deck, since you can grab  apprentice magician and sangan  and shining angel provides easy access to magician of faith or d.d warrior lady when you are really needing removal options. If you have tsukuyomi or book of moon you can flip magician of faith down or even go for an old vindictive magician in a pinch. Since you are running so many recruiters, creature swap becomes a very useful way to gain the upper hand. Remember, apprentice magician's old goat rulings mean that it is not usually a good card to use creature swap on, since its effect does not activate in grave, so if it is destroyed while in your opponents control they get the effect.  Kycoo the ghost destroyer is a good offensive, anti chaos monster that does really help keep your opponents at bay and synergizes well with phoenix. Breaker the magical warrior is a good standalone monster with solid attack and the ability to pop spell and traps, and also synergizes with apprentice magician since you can give it an extra counter. That being said, it does not come up a lot so it is best to think of it as a situational bonus and not get stingy with breaker hoping to keep adding counters to it. The same can be said with old vindictive magician and tsukyomi together. It can be great when you recycle it's destruction effect, but it is almost always better to use it as soon as it will give you any monster destruction as a way to keep momentum/one for one your opponents.  This deck runs a mini goat/ metamorphosis engine. This can be useful in slower games, but your strategy does not depend on you pulling it off all the time. It gives you an adaptable strategy and access to thousand eyes restrict is always useful. Sinister serpent fits in well with this engine and has synergy with creature swap and graceful charity. Book of moon is used over enemy controller since enemy controller does not have nearly as much use as book of moon in this deck. The ability to tribute a goat to snatch a monster seems tempting, but since you only have two monsters that could situationally be used to tribute that monster you steal, you are much better off with the utility that book of moon gives you. It works much better with your magician engine as well as the metamorphosis engine while also being a good battle trap alternative and way to protect your monsters in a bind.  This deck does not run a heavy trap lineup since phoenix is not good in a trap heavy deck. The traps that are run synergize with phoenix and the rest of the deck. Torrential can punish priority chaos monsters trying to out phoenix, call of the haunted plays reacting to your opponents spell/trap removal options with a phoenix, jinzo, or sangan in the grave is very powerful, and ring of destruction works with phoenix, is a great game ender, and also a solid chainable one for one removal that pressures the opponent.  This deck does have a solid lineup for using BLS, which can apply pressure to the opponent at all points in the game. Chaos sorceror is tempting, but it does end up contributing to possible bricking, and since it's not as game warpingly powerful as BLS, it is not really worth running in this deck.  While this would not likely contend with the powerful meta decks found in the goat format meta, I believe this is a much more solid take on sacred phoenix as a deck choice and creates a very fun, adaptive deck to use.  &nbsp;"
