This series is not made by a professional, so bear with me. With all of that being said, I would like to welcome you to...</span> <h1>Reviving Old Powers</h1> <h2>Deck 2 - Magical Musket</h2> This deck may seem weak, with only one extra deck monster and it's strongest monster having 2500 ATK/DEF, but this deck can defeat monsters such as Red Supernova Dragon, Red Eyes Black Dragoon, and Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus. It all comes down to getting the right monster on the field with the right spells and traps to back them up. Now that it has been said, let's get into it! <h3>Monsters</h3> <span>We should probably go by level and work our way up, ending with our Link monster. But first, I should tell you that all Magical Musket monsters have the effect allowing you to use any Magical Musket spell or trap on any turn, at any time, from your hand! Also, they all have a second effect, but this effect can only be activated by starting a spell or trap in that card's column. Caspar can give you any card from your deck and add it to your hand, while Doc can get that card from your Graveyard. Kidbrave allows you to discard one card and then add two cards to your hand. This gives you the opportunity to refresh your hand when you are in a tough spot. Starfire helps you get any Magical Musket monster except for Zakiel on the field in Defence position, perfect for a Link summon. Calamity helps you get a monster back from the grave, while Wild gets three cards from the grave and puts them in the Deck. Zakiel, our strongest monster by ATK and DEF, allows you to draw cards equal to the number of spells and traps activated by you on your opponent's turn. Finally, we have Max, which lets us either get spells and traps equal to opponent monsters, or summon monsters equal to opponent spells and traps. Do I have you hooked yet, or do I need to continue? Continue? Ok...</span> <h3>Spells/Traps</h3> <span>Now we get to the part that makes this deck powerful. All of the following cards I will talk about require a Magical Musket monster on the field to be able to use them. Anyway, Cross Domination can take one monster on the field and destroy all of their ATK and DEF, as well as negating their effect for the turn. Steady hands does the opposite, giving one Magical Musket monster a double on their ATK and DEF. Crooked Crown lets you summon one Magical Musket monster from your deck, while Fiendish Deal makes it where your Magical Musket monsters cannot be destroyed by card effects. Last Stand negates a trap or spell, while Desperado destroys one monster on the field. Finally, we head to Dancing Needle, which banishes 3 cards from either Graveyard.</span> <h3>Lore</h3> <span>Usually I would like to have more here, but I could not find that much on the web. From what I can tell, this deck is based off of a German opera by the name of Der Freichutz. A Freichutz is someone who makes a deal with the Devil and aquires 7 bullets. 6 bullets are completely in the user's grasp, while the seventh is in the control of the Devil. Most of these cards also share looks and names with people of Western folklore, such as Kidbrave being Billy the Kid. They also share a characteristic among the cards themselves. All of the monsters have a bluish arm holding their weapon.</span> <h3>Final Notes</h3> <span>I have really enjoyed writing this article, and I also like looking at the comments I get. Thank you for the feedback, and I will try to improve my deck. I might be a bit late on my next articles, as I will be travelling. Now for a hint on my next deck... Oh come on, look at yourself! Thanks for reading, and goodnight.</span>"

The deck is supposed to mill itself to have fodder on the grave for berserkion's effect and summon block dragon and valkyrion with delta. Am recently coming back and properly learning the game tried to fit negates to accommodate the modern meta a bit. Any suggestions or improvements for the deck or just deck building ill appreciate the comments  <hr />  The deck banks on its excavates and searchers to get as many magnet warriors on the hand grave or fild to activate their effects to get berserkeion out as soon as humanly possible and maybe mill a valkyrion special summon with delta. Once berserkion is out mill for the king of the swamp if it isnt already in the hand for a poly search and get imperion out with support of the extra deck and hand traps to keep him on the field.

OwO  <strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong>  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  https://youtu.be/relyrPUi4hg  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  <strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>  Al final se necesitará varios dragones, pero éstos son fáciles de spamear en la baraja. Siempre la idea es ir por Romulus y los Guardragon para acceder a sus efectos de spam y traer a Brotaur para obtener a Rescue Ferret.  <strong>Extenders para iniciar el combo</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Dragunity Arma Gram: </strong>Se invoca desde la mano o cementerio removiendo 2 dragones del cementerio. Es un buen target de Foolish Burial / Dragon Shrine y no es un ladrillo!</li>  	<li><strong>Absorouter Dragon: </strong>Se invoca solo si controlamos un Rokket. Aún así, siempre se puede enviar al cementerio para añadirnos un Rokket a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Noctovision Dragon: </strong>Se invoca solo si invocamos otro dragón de modo especial. Además, cuando se va del campo, nos da un robo!</li>  	<li><strong>Linkbelt Wall Dragon: </strong>Se invoca gratis cuando hacemos Link Summon, pero por su efecto, debemos hacerlo cuando invocamos a Striker Dragon y usarlo como material para Romulus.</li>  	<li><strong>Black Dragon Collapserpent: </strong>Se invoca gratis removiendo un monstruo de luz, además nos trae a Wyverburster.</li>  	<li><strong>White Dragon Wyverburster:</strong> Se invoca gratis removiendo un monstruo de oscuridad, además nos trae a Collapserpent.</li>  	<li><strong>Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm:</strong> Se invoca gratis del cementerio, por lo que es un target de Foolish Burial y Dragon Shrine.</li>  	<li><strong>Starliege Dragon Seyfert: </strong>Una invocación normal excelente, ya que con su efecto tendremos en mano a Collapserpent o Wyverburster.</li>  	<li><strong>Rokket Tracer: </strong>Normal Summon de último recurso, además de tener excelentes interacciones con Section Boot y Absorouter.</li>  	<li><strong>Crusadia Draco: </strong>Se invocará gratis hacia donde apunte una flecha link. También es buen Normal Summon.</li>  	<li><strong>Defrag Dragon: </strong>Se invoca gratis descartando un monstruo.</li>  	<li><strong>Black Metal Dragon: </strong>Se usa de Normal Summon. Nos añade al Red Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, que es un +1.</li>  	<li><strong>One For One: </strong>Nos trae a Black Metal Dragon.</li>  	<li><strong>Dragon Shrine y Foolish Burial: </strong>Pueden enviar a Darkwurm o Arma Gram al cementerio.</li>  	<li><strong>Monster Reborn: </strong>Nos da un cuerpo adicional.</li>  	<li><strong>Chaos Space: </strong>Efecto similar a Seyfert, pero sin gastar la Normal Summon.</li>  	<li><strong>Quick Revolve: </strong>Nos trae a Rokket Tracer gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Guardragon of the World Legacy: </strong>Efecto similar a Monster Reborn, pero además nos permite mover a un dragón (por lo general un Guardragon).</li>  	<li><b>Living Fossil: </b>Invoca algo del cementerio, pero lo destierra cuando deja el campo, por lo que no se debe traer piezas de combo como Phalanx.</li>  	<li><strong>Dragon Ravine: </strong>Funciona de una peor manera que Dragon Shrine / Foolish Burial, pero puede servir de extender.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene un burn infinito, por lo que no importa cuántos LP tenga el oponente, igual perderá.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene muy pocos bricks/garnets</li>  	<li>El deck tiene extenders muy poderosos, por lo que es posible que sobren recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck depende de varias adiciones específicas a la mano. Si nos niegan alguna, será gg.</li>  	<li>Por la naturaleza del deck, éste no tiene acceso a protección.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck consume varios extenders, por lo que es necesaria una buena mano para realizar los combos.</li> </ul>"

With all of these new cards I felt obligated to make a fleur deck. This build has a combo oriented strategy and 10 cards to open horse of the floral knights which is a one card chevalier de fleur or baroness de fleur in some cases. You can also occasionally summon road warrior who can set up all sorts of plays despite being a monster that’s kinda hard to get out road warrior is always well worth it for it’s powerful ability. I considered synchro overtake but ruled against it because you also like to summon Isolde and halq a lot.  Thanks for checking this deck out and have a good day!

This deck is fairly co,"<strong>This deck has two different win conditions: Decking your opponent out or getting Exodia. </strong> Before we go into the serious and technical stuff, consider making some tea or whatever you consider your favorite beverage. Your duel is going to take a while. Sit back, relax, put on some slow jazz, and duel! <strong>  -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~- </strong>  Keep in mind you're playing with &amp; against tons of negates, so it's very important to know how a chain works: The higher the number (that is, if that card was activated last), the sooner the effect will activate. For instance: If your opponent activates Typhoon to destroy your Mystic Mine, his chain number will be 1. If you activate Magic Jammer after, your chain number will be 2. Your effect is going to go first, destroying the Typhoon and rendering its effect useless, keeping your Mystic Mine safe and sound. Bottom line: Read the cards.  If you would, please take a closer look at your side deck. It mostly includes cards that have a card-drawing effect. If you feel that you can go a bit more aggressive vs an opponent and that you can win earlier, feel free to put in more of these cards. However, if your objective is to eat glue and drink gouache, this is the deck for you.  The obvious weak spot of this deck are decks that can send Exodia to the GY, or banish it. Be wary of that, and make sure to deck accordingly!  Other cool cards that you can use are:  - Burial from a Different Dimension (if your opponent has banishing cards, and they actually manage to banish a part of your Exodia) - Monster Reborn (opponents that run Card Destruction or Morphing Jar can sometimes send Exodia parts to the GY. Always a good idea to have something in mind. I picked Monster Reborn, but feel free to add monsters with effects too, such as Legion the Fiend Jester). - Exodia Incarnate/Exodia Necross + Contract with Exodia  (if all else fails it's good to have this as a hail-mary, but I wouldn't strategize around it). - Battle Fader (the monster equivalent of Threatening Roar and Waboku). - Skill Drain (negate the effects of face-up monsters. Pretty cool.) - Mirror Force - Performapal Kuribohble - Mad Reloader (trades 2 cards from your hand with 2 cards from the deck. Really cool since you can attack a silent wobby with it and just kill yourself, activating its effect). - Raigeki - Gold Sarcophagus (basically handpick one card from your deck, pretty much always gonna be mystic mine, and add it to your hand after 1 turn). - Sangan - Witch of the Black Forest - Dark Bribe (although I really think you don't need more disables LOL) - Nibiru: Primal Being (for those poopooheads that like to summon 8 monsters in a row) - Infinite Impermanence (EXTREMELY good card. I can also see this working in the main deck). - Unending Nightmare (destroys lingering spell/trap cards. Kinda cool vs Cauldron if someone is playing that). - Ash Blossom (Also extremely powerful vs combo decks. Negates drawing effects from monsters, spells, and traps. Consider playing this in the main deck as well or side decking it) - Super Polymerization (Listen, your extra deck is just there for discards and memes, but if you'd like, you can definitely surprise your opponent by pulling out your huge dong and summoning a 2.8k ATK monster. How's that sound?) - Toll (pay 500 LP to declare an attack. Overall a pretty trash card but I can see it working). - Reload (hand reset if you're feeling spicy) - Supply Squad (great for comboing with Sangan, Witch, Battle Fader, Performapal, and Mad Reloader. If those monsters are destroyed in battle, draw a card. Really really good if you're going with the monster approach). - Obliterate!!! (This card is almost exclusively used with Exodia Incarnate and Necross, so definitely combo it with them).  That's all I can think of right now. As you can see, the further I invest into this guide, the more my sanity fades. Just by quoting the names of the cards I start remembering the countless hours I spent looking at the screen and clicking ""End Phase"".  Have fun frustrating people and losing friends.

To enable this, we run a few cards to set him up. We combine his ability with a lot of power spells, mostly fusion spells to ensure his effect goes off hard. Most of the spells however can also just regularly be used, like Red-Eyes Fusion or Neos Fusion. We run a few garnets in the deck to facilitate these spells, but a lot of them have other uses like being targets for Dark Calling. On top of that, the Predaplant link also gives us consisten access to the various fusion spells to make for a powerful fusion powerhouse."

Easy Battle Butler + Rusty Bardiche + Knightmare Gryphon just by using Prank-Kids as starter while still having staples lol,"https://youtu.be/nTI8uuFE0Jg  Phantom Knight and Ogdoadic are 2 of my favorite archetypes. Together, they increase Prank-Kids combo ceiling as extenders. Watch the combo in the video below. You only need <strong>2 Prank-Kids cards + lv4</strong> (normal summon, Prank-Kids Prank discard, and random lv4). Combo is surprisingly consistent because we run 18 Prank-Kids cards with 16 lv4 monsters (Rocksies acts as both, so as the field spell and Terraforming).  Pros: More negation, floodgate, and recursion.  Cons: Doesn't solve the ""dying to Ash"" problem.  <a><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/9VtzDTi.png"" alt=""image"" /></a>"

These monsters are extremely powerful in how easy they can be summoned and provide key access to the Rank 7 engine of Big Eye and Volnigesh. You can use Tempest to ditch a card in hand that is not useful to grab a copy of pet dragon. <h2>Best Harpie Girl</h2> Acting as a bridge between the two engines is one of the strongest cards in the deck: Harpie Channeler, which (with a discard) instantly become a Rank 7 XYZ with Pet Dragon. However, she can also grab one of the other level 4 Harpie monsters, for either a Link play into Harpie Channeler and Simorgh OR into a Rank 4 XYZ such as Zerofyne and Lightning Chidori. <h2>Harpie Searchers</h2> One of the best targets for Harpie Channler are the various searchers: Harpie Perfumer and Oracle. Note that these cards are once per turn and Oracle is in the end-phase. Which can instantly bring to hand spells such as Alluring Mirror, Feather Rest, Hunting Ground and (most importantly) Elegant Egotist. <h2>Elegant Egotist &gt; Instant Fusion</h2> Elegant Egotist is a non-once per turn card that can summon a Harpie Lady from the deck, making it a costless Instant Fusion. Note: the various Harpie cards are only treated as Harpie Lady when in the Grave, which limits the targets.  I have personally chosen Harpie Lady 1 because a 300 ATK boost has helped on ocassion overcome a larger enemy. There are other builds which use the original normal Harpie Lady and the spell Unexpected Dai, however because of the Windwitch engine we have decided to go for the effect variant (since you cannot summon Ice Bell and activate Unexpected Dai). <h2>Which Windwitch is which?</h2> The Windwitch engine adds an additional degree of power to the deck as it Snow Bell provides protection and Ice &amp; Glass give access to powerful Synchro monsters. The typical combination is: <ol>  	<li>Summon Ice Bell on an empty field.</li>  	<li>Special Summon Glass Bell from deck.</li>  	<li>Search Snow Bell with Glass Bell's effect.</li>  	<li>Special Summon Snow Bell.</li>  	<li>Synchro Glass and Ice into Ignister Pegasus (feel free to destroy opponents backrow at this point).</li>  	<li>Synchro Pegasus and Snow Bell into Clear Wing.</li> </ol> At the end of this one card combo you have a Wind Pegasus in grave to shuffle cards into the deck and a Crystal Clear Wing which cannot be destroyed, and you still have your normal summon! <h2>The Harpie and the floodgate.</h2> There are two additional monsters in the maindeck that we have yet to talk about, the first is Harpie Harpist, which is a perfect target for Harpie's Pet Dragon's effect to send monsters (since it searches during the end phase when sent) and provides disruption on the normal summon. The final is Barrier statue of the Storms, one of the few floodgate's left untouched this can be devastating when summoned as you are nearly unimpeded by its effects. However, in a match against a wind deck it is an obvious side option. <h2>Spells and Traps: Pop Hysteric sign</h2> The spells and traps are rather straightforward. Hysteric sign and Alluring Mirror exist to be destroyed by card effects for their fantastic summoning/searching (esspecially Hysteric Sign). The optimal way to destroy them would be through the Hunting Ground Field spell or through Harpie Conductor. Feather rest is a brilliant draw card that has gotten better with the new version of Pet Dragon. Hysteric Party is a dangerous card that is a turn 3 or 4 move to recover from a board wipe or to push for game. Finally, Feather storm is one of the best negation traps esspecially because it can be activated from the hand, even during your opponents turn. <h1>Extra Deck</h1> <h2>Synchro Monsters</h2> <h3>Just here for the Windwiches</h3> As previously mentioned Ignister Pegasus and Clear Wing exist for the Wind Witch engine's combo. The Speedroid synchro is present in case you have Snowbell + a level 4 Harpie monster, that way you can have a monster that is immune to destruction and gains attack. This engine is designed to be unobtrusive in the extra deck so that it might potentially be sided out. <h3>When is a tuner not a tuner? When it's a Harpie!</h3> The newest Harpie synchro has a large amount of power behind it capable of being being a complusary exacuation device forever. This monster is very easy to summon, as it can treat a Harpie as a tuner which means that it is one Elegant Egotist or Channler away from being summoned. However, it can also be brought out through Glass Bell + a Harpie or a Dragon + Snow Bell. Finally, as it is treated as a Harpie Lady in the Grave it can be brought back though Hysteric Party (as long as it was summoned normally first). <h2>Link Monsters</h2> There are two Link monsters: Harpie Conductor which serves as another means of destroying your own spells (which is a good thing), it provides protection and a combo's well with the Harpie Synchro. The other link monster is Simorgh, which serves as a dangerous powerhouse in the deck, providing another layer of protection for the monsters it points to. Additionally it can summons monsters during the End Phase (of both players turns), a popular choice is Barrier statue or Perfumer (or if you are desperate for an attck boost then Harpie Lady 1). <h2>XYZ monsters</h2> <h3>Rank 7: Here be Dragons ... again.</h3> There are two Rank 7 monsters: Big Eye which can snatch a monster perminantly (an incredible effect) and Volnigesh (whose effect is Quick because of the method it is summoned). Depending on the situation either might be useful, however you cannot overlay into Divine Arsenal as both of these monsters cannot attack the turn you use their effects. Regardless they are strong standalone cards. <h3>Rank 4: Wind Winged-Beast's have some amazing non-generic's.</h3> There are two non-generic XYZ monsters: Lightning Chidori (who can spin cards to the top and bottom of the decks) and Zerofyne (who can Skill Drain all monsters on the field and then gain a huge boost from all cards, including your own). The prevalence of Harpies means that these are effectively generic. Finally we have Excition Knight and Abyss Dweller, which to this day are among some of the most powerful rank 4's designed. <h1>Side Deck</h1> <h2>I wanna play Harpie's not Windwitches!</h2> The side deck contains additional Barrier statues, a set of Swallow's nest's (which are designed to summon them) and 3 XYZ monsters. These are designed to replace the entire Windwitch engine, Synchro's and all. The Utopia cards are designed for a powerful OTK whilst the Barrier statue locks them down. <h2>Need more self destruction? Need less? we got you covered.</h2> Droplet is placed in for additional methods to destroy your own spells and traps. Finally Elborz is a powerful field spell, which works better in the pure variant within the Windwiches, it can facilitate and additional normal summon (which can be a barrier statue or a Harpist) and it also serves a method to save the Simorgh Link from battle as well as providing an additional attack boost. Recommend siding either of these cards if your opponent does not run many spells and traps (as they can replace the Hunting ground's)."

Pot of desires used for thinning deck and Imperial order is meant to mix with Gryphon.  Side deck and extra are simple, added Luster solder recently as an out for alot of stuff and because I try to summon Chaos Ruler alot, this card basically makes this deck work really well. Alot of going second options in case I am forced to go second and most are light so I can use them as materials for chaos.  Jinzo in side deck, for fun and also in case I run into trap decks."

I really wonder what Konami was thinking when they made this archetype. In theory, some of the cards have potential and they have amazing art. A solid Link-2 could solve almost all of the decks issues right now. But as it is, you have to be a masochist to voluntarily play this deck. Especially picking this deck up in real life would be a terrible decision. If you seriously invest into this deck, do everyone around you a favor and please get some help."

You accomplish this through cards like Lightning Storm, Raigeki, HFD, and IKS.  Your best and most important card is B.E.F. Zelos, as it enables the entire deck to function. Your main ways of OTKing are through cards like limiter removal and getting big kaijus like jizikiru on board. If you don't manage to OTK, all is still well, the deck has an excellent grind, albeit without much interaction. Turns out its hard to out cards that get replaced after destruction and cannot be targeted or destroyed by card effects.  Note: Extra is pretty flexible, most of it never comes up, you may want to add rank 9s and replace the 7s with 6s. The only ""mandatory"" cards in the ED are probably the Cydra cards, but even those can be replaced."

Want to spam your opponent with huge dragons? Look no further!,"The goal of this deck is simple; open Crimson Resonator, and another level 4 monster, preferably a monster that can search a self summoning level 4, like Witch of the Black Forest, Dawn Knight or even Damage Juggler. Then you go into a board of atleast Abyss + Bane. If you open Synchro Call or Trap Trick one could even go into King Calamity in the draw phase of the opponent, virtually FTKing against most decks. Big synchros like Nirvana High Paladin ensure you can OTK the next turn."

The side deck is made so I can chose between 3 play styles and it has some specific cards so that I have an answer for (almost) any situation. This doesn't make it meta. Meta decks can beat it more than 50% of time by brute force. And the reason is because they can play a lot of hand traps and still be consistent. Cyber angel decks just can't do that.

In case you're going 2nd you can use the numeron engine to force your opponent's disruptions, if you win the dice-roll you definitely want to go first and finish the game with the numeron engine or activating scapegoats in the opponent's end phase (keep in mind if you use condemned witch during your opp's turn you wont be able to activate scapegoat, unless the opponent negates it).  The side deck and maindeck traps can be switched for any counter trap that could be more effective depending on the format or what you currently own except for the solemn traps that are a must have in most of the situations.  When you're side decking its best to take out 2 artemists for the 2 pathfinders and add the 2 numeron callings, broken line is also there to switch some counter traps for going 2nd (you just set them where your opponent has cards)."
