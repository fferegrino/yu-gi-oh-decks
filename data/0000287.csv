Writing up so I can refine this monstrosity,"<span><strong>Intro</strong></span>  This deck somehow won a local. Dinomight semi limit is stellar and the eminent Inspector boarder is my saviour in a branded infected locals.  Sad time for casual decks as everyone is running branded and the branded structure deck at my locals so might as well stick to competitive and switch off of earth machine sadly  <strong>2-0 vs flunder however the fuck you spell that awful name</strong>  Went first set rivalry solemn lose 1 turn tribute summoned dinomight opponent scooped  Went second opponent set 2 cards I activated disciples to summon Ignis heat and tribute summoned dreiath III opponent scooped following turn  <strong>2-0 vs despia/branded dark lord </strong>  Went second opponent ended on mirrorjade set 1 pass. Special summoned pankratops to destroy mirrorjade at chain link 2, tribute summoned 2 dreiath III opponent set torrential tribute I attacked for game.  Went first set dimension barrier and solemn tribute summon majesty maiden opponent scoops on activation of dimensional barrier they bricked on 3 morningstar 1 superbia and one branded fusion incredibly unlucky  <strong>2-0 vs despia/branded</strong>  Went first and established inspector boarder with solemn strike and rivalry of warlords full combo won the following turn .  Went second impermed aluber and used ash on branded fusion they ended on a El shadoll winda with a negated aluber. Established dinomight and Ignis with a set solemn strike, opponent top decked aluber I used solemn strike and opponent scooped.  <strong>2-0 vs dragon link? With some synchro stuff no baronne </strong>  Went second opponent ended with hot red dragon abyss and zombie vampire. Tribute summoned dinomight knight using True king apocalypse destroyed red dragon abyss set lose 1 turn and rivalry opponent scooped on activation of rivalry of warlords  Went first normal summoned inspector boarder opponent scooped  <span><strong>Card ratios/inclusion notes</strong></span>  I own 2 ash blossoms and have no desire to spend 20 quid on another  2 pot of extravagance I ran out of time when deck building but this should be a 3 of  2 dreiath III is nice against exactly mirrorjade end phase effect or other destruction effects and if I draw 1 dreiath III and 1 majesty maiden. Two dreiath III create an annoying board if both are on field they both get protected by each others effect  0 skill drain I should definitely play this at 3 just cannae be arsed to spend 10 to 15 quid per copy  0 card of demise forgot to include it but very unlikely I would see it due to it being limited. If I did use 1 I would cut 1 Evil Eye Pareidolia  0 nibiru I don't own nibiru waiting for a reprint replace the 3 waterfall in side deck with whatever meta call handtrap e.g. skull meister nibiru d.d crow  Evil Eye cards, serziel and selene equip spell create a really annoying 1 card distruption that does not mess with the stun game plan. Gorgon sadly did not come up but having a monster negate in the extra deck that is easy to make is never a bad thing. Evil eye retribution is a target for the second serziel summon and just a good draw if you get it. Evil eye of selene can go to 2 copies  <span><strong>Weird extra deck anomalies</strong></span>  White aura bihamut, Orichalc and last warrior are all targets for Metaltron XII effect if it happens but you usually just win if you summon him as long as you tribute a spell and monster . You totally do not need the extra deck with this build and can play a monarchs erupt variant I just wanted to play an extra deck for metaltron.  I will say that relinquished anima and geonator transverser are excellent vs mirrorjade pass if you bait out the banish effect it has helped me out in my evil eye eldlich deck a surprising amount so give it a try if you can't fill up the extra deck it's very flexible.  <span><strong>Side deck </strong></span>  3 Waterfall of Dragon Souls, this searches any true draco and can unbrick your hand by discarding true dracos but is too slow sadly so this can definitely be replaced by 3 of any meta call hand trap or Bophades  3 Cosmic Cyclone, mystic mine is pure cancer also messes up eldlich trap rotation/engine this will stay until mystic mine eats a dick  3 Token Collector, is excellent against swordsoul which is another popular deck at my locals  3 Dimensional Barrier, this card fucks branded and swordsoul and the future tearalament when that hits TCG so this is staying in the side deck forever <strong>BUY THIS WHILE YOU CAN</strong>  3 Gamaciel Kaiju, a generic out to any big monster which can be dealt with in battle phase with all true Dracos except Dreiath III  <span><strong>End notes </strong></span>  Side deck is more tailored to the decks I see at my local place so results will vary and will change over the months  Just done this write up so I can refine this monstrosity and try for a 40 to 50 over the weeks.  Thank you to inspector boarder for completing my ghostrick angel of mischief playset and nabbing me an ultimate rare fusion destiny.  &nbsp;"

The Ice barrier protections and special summons for each other to make the rank 4 XYZs. Make Trishula Zero Dawn, going first, you'll get the field negated off Trishula Dragon of the Ice Barrier, and have a 3300 beatstick on board. Going second you get the pop three if they don't negate the summons and you are set up for their next turn when they destroy it and summon your Trishula then. Running Ice Knight and Silent Sea Nettle nearly make extending our Defender easy, Revealer makes it even easier.  ________  Deep Sea Diva into Guitar, Guitar effect to banish the top two of opponents deck, Guitar double Divas level, Synchro Prima Donna, Prima Donna effect to give one of the banished cards to the opponent hand (careful) and special summon level one Deep Sea Artisan, she can send your top deck into grave to special summon a level 4 or lower from grave (Guitar), then Prima Donna and Guitar synchro away for a Barronn de Fleur who can't be destroyed by card effects. One card combo.  __________  Crystron Halqifibrax special summons:  •Plan A &gt;&gt; Citree, on opponents turn, Citree effect with a level 4 in grave to make Powered Inzektron and follow up with Halq into Crystron Quandax, and Quandax into Swordsoul Champion Cheng who will off the citree play have at least +200ATK/DEF and the Opponents cards will have at least -200ATK/DEF and he will respond to any banishment with his own, also indestructible as long as you have cards in the graveyard.  •Plan B &gt;&gt; Defender or Hexa, Make White Aura Whale on your opponents turn using Crystron Halq into Quandax with any level four extender, or Prima Donna and the Token summoned by banishing Speaker from grave (assuming you used Speaker and 1 Ice Barrier tuner to make Halqifibrax).  If Zujin is in grave he can come back off the Defender to trigger Defenders protection from battle.  If Zujin is not in grave, Send him off with Defender, so next turn is set up for his return.  ____________  If you are able to get Ice Knight and Silent in turn 1 with any other level 4 you can Bahamut Shark into Toadally Awesome, protecting your plays keeping Ice knight on field, or hoping you had Defender of the ice barrier and your 3rd level four was Revealer to get him or Speaker to follow him up. You have the Defender and Ice knight and Toadally to send away off the Toads effect.  __________  General Wayne can get Ice Barrier to hand if you need to protect what you've got, then dump it for the one Kaiju, or get Medallion if you need specifics, or Freezing Chains if you want protection from extra deck monsters and have a play in grave.  In a tightspot, you can use Silent Sea Nettle to return any extra deck monsters or combo pieces in grave, or summon Mistar Boy to crash with the opponent, and Summon White Aura Whale from grave, or try to get Borrel Savage Dragon on the field when Mistar Boy and Halq are in grave.  &nbsp;  _________________________________________  HANDTRAPS &gt;&gt; a ratio I use in every deck so far to at least compete in the meta.  2x Ash  2x Maxx-C  2x Infinite Impermenance  _________________________________________  BOARD WIPES &gt;&gt; must haves when all else fails  1x Feather Duster  1x Raigeki  _________________________________________  Comments :  Prior of the Ice Barrier was too slow. The larger Ice Barriers were bricks, though Raiho can work with some changes.  I haven't had the materials to try the Atlantean Prince Nebatyss with 3x Atlantean Dragoons, but what I'm doing feels consistent.  Crystal Wing Synchro is very easy to make, could trade Borrel Savage Dragon for him.  I've seen Desert Locust played, the level 9 Crystron, the Moulinglacia but I felt what I had to remove to add them wouldn't be worth the reward.  I was playing with targets for Prima Donna other than the 1* Deep Sea Artisan and 3 cards could work if you take something out for them ; Needle Fish (when sent to GY, 1 monster your opponent controls loses 500ATK), Mermail Abyssnerei (When Sent to GY, mil a card and discard a card) works well with Zujin, Speaker, and Revealer if you already have another Revealer in hand, and Hammer Shark (Opt: reduce the level of this card from *4 to *3 and special summon 1 level 3 or lower monster from your hand.)  Open to suggestions please comment if you find something cool, or want to tell me your experience with the cards!"

This deck has a simple 1 card combo which ends on a board of Dragostapellia and mirrojade with bufocolia and triantis in scale with either a set retribution or a follow up with branded fusion for next turn.  This combo requires Lonefire/Scorpio and 1 monster to discard.  Normal summon Lonefire and then activate effect to summon scorpio from deck (Skip this part if scorpio is already in hand).  Activate scorpio's effect on summon to discard the monster in hand and special summon Chlamydosundew.  Use Chlamydosundews effect to fusion summon into Ambulomelides.  Activate Ambulomelides' effect on summon to add bufocolia to hand.  Activate Ambulomelides' effect to tribute itself and special cobra.  activate cobra to add branded fusion.  Activate branded fusion sending albaz and romarin going into Albion the branded dragon.  Chain link 1 albion, chain link 2 romarin.  Romarin to send Byblisp to GY. Albion to fuse ambulomelides and albaz into mirrorjade.  activate byblisp in GY to add Triantis.  Scale Triantis and Bufocolia.  Activate Bufocolia to fuse into Dragostapelia using Albion and Cobra.

Hi so this is my first deck sharing, when I first saw Tearalaments, I saw infinite fusion potential. So in order to make use of it's full power before the new card updates. I've added a few core fusion in the form of predaplant, tearalaments &amp; venom. I had a lot of fun with this deck and it's even called anti-meta by my friends (I highly doubt it's anti meta YET) <strong>So going through the Extra Deck</strong> <br />1. Starving Venom Predator Fusion Dragon - this will be your master negate once you've setup the whole board (both yours and your opponent) with preda counter. Even if this big fella gets taken out in your GY there will be at times one more fusion monster which you can bring back to restart or counter 2. Guardian Chimera - summon him with the effects of any of the 3 main girls of Tearalaments + Predaplant Buffolicula with Predaplant Triantis and trigger his draw effect. Although it won't have its immunity without polymerization but you will get your draw power <br />3. Tearalament Kaleido Heart - This will be one of your troublemakers for your opponent to keep sending something back into their deck and come back (once per turn) should he get sent to the GY. He will be your catalyst searcher to fusion summon extra by sending another tearalaments monster to the GY. <br />4. Starving Venom Fusion Dragon - Struggling with high attack monster? Use his effects to help you <br />5. Predaplant Chimeraflessia - Well this is another trickster... Always use it to manipulate atk values of your opponent monster. It may look like a worthless 2.5k atk monster buts its actually a 3.5k with a -1k penalty to your opponent monster that its attacking. This predaplant would also help you to find instant fusion once its in the grave... <br />6. Tearalaments Chaetocaros - She is your main catalyst of this deck to either be used as a fusion material and sent to the GY or mill some cards with the hopes to send a few cards (EG: predaplanning, any of the three girls of tearalaments) and trigger a chain effect from the GY, The only reason keeping her at 2 at the moment because you can easily bring her back because you will use her as a fusion material (always) <br />7.&nbsp; El Shaddoll Winda - Your main special summon lock. ALWAYS summon her LAST otherwise she will lock all your fusion combos <br />8. Predaplant Ambulomeloides - your searcher for predaplant and also another popper to help u pop something with preda counter on opponent field <br />9. Tearalament Lulucaros - Waifu yes but also a very cute version of D Hero Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer with a self-revive the same turn she sends herself to the GY or just send any of her sisters from the field after you negate <br />10. Time Thief Redoer -Well he's here for 2 things the effects from material detach and locking any possible cards your opponent may use against you each turn <br />11. Predaplant Dragostapelia - YAY for preda counter disabler. Use him to disable any effect before they trigger and rack up your counters for the big dragon <br />12. Raider's&nbsp; Knight - if you're thinking him as a placeholder why yes he's just going to sacrifice himself for Arc Rebellion.... <br />13. Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon - THIS IS A LAST RESORT or when you think you have the field secured for OTK purpose. I'm very 80% sure of the time you won't be using them at all the same goes for Raider's Knight <br /><br /><strong>Monsters in the Deck Summary</strong> <br />Tearalaments will be the catalyst for fusions Predaplant will be the traps to disable synchro summon, disable effects (if Dragostapelia is present) <br />Shaddoll Beast is just for draw power and Winda &nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>So why are there pendulum monsters?</strong> In a situation where you need more monsters on field to mill the deck or be used for material, this was the best answer to it because that way should your opponent take down any of the 3 tearalaments girls, they're basically asking you to summon as many as you can to ruin the board for them <br /><strong>Important Magic &amp; Trap Cards</strong> <br />Field Spell Pelreino, the Primal Parallel Ruined Realm - chain its effects with any tearalaments especially Kaleidoheart and you can clear 2 cards on the field (well this got limited to 1 but it will slow down the chains you can make with it)<br />Predaplanning - this is another one that adds problems for your opponent, if its in the GY any fusion monster u summon will allow it to be removed from play and destroy 1 card on opponent field <br />Tearalaments Heartbeats - a switcher Tearalament card, use wisely or just remove from the deck <br />Tearalaments Grief - another switcher card with a search for your trap card (this keep at least 1 in the extra deck) <br />Tearalaments Scream - KEEP 2 at all times (never use just 1)</p>"

This deck works by using the power of P.K. to be able to get both a materialless <a data-name=""Break Sword"">Break Sword</a> and a <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a> to make an <a data-name=""Ophion"">Ophion</a> during your opponents turn, while also setting up a back of interruptions to keep you monsters in check. While this is the main strategy is by and far your only one as you also have access to strong cards like <a data-name=""Arc Requiem"">Arc Rebellion</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Requiem"">Dark Requiem</a> to close out or slow down your opponent even more so. With the plethora of starters in the game this build can be modified to fit one's one taste, even going so far as to become a 60 cards list should on desire it.  Side Note: This deck is very much capable of using the Adventure Engine to setup and easier time with the rest of the combo lines. I personally do not prefer that way but if one desires it would be easy to add it in.  &nbsp;"

By using a deck with strong otk power and good flood gate monsters like plasma and colossus. This deck has alot of potential and has alot of cool interactions.

The first two need no introductions, first is the iconic <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> straight off the banlist and ready for some action while the other one has been off for a while and has been one of the low-key GOAT's among traps, <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>. The third, and most searchable, is the impressive two card combo of <a data-name=""Volcanic Scattershot"">Volcanic Scattershot</a> + <a data-name=""Blaze Accelerator Reload"">Blaze Accelerator Reload</a>. This combo has been the heart and soul of Volcanic deck for years, being able to both build advantage for yourself and deny your opponent of board presence. Unfortunately the deck has not seen any support since 2015 and it shows. While it can get one part of the combo easily enough with <a data-name=""Volcanic Rocket"">Volcanic Rocket</a>, the other half has always been the blasting power and without it you have nothing but a card filter. Fortunately Reload has an effect while in the grave to banish itself to send Scattershot to the grave and activate it's effect that way. Now we come to the question that is a mystery to all; how do we get reload into the grave consistently?  This is where the power of modern cards comes in. There is three ways to get a card into you grave; from your hand, from your field, or from you deck. From your hand and field share the same issue being you need to actually get the card into you hand, so the better way is to get it out of the deck directly. This can either be achieved by self mill (taking cards from the top of your deck and sending them to grave) or by binning (taking cards directly from your deck to grave). While mill is plentiful, it is by far the worst of the two options since you may mill cards you didn't want in the grave to begin with. On the opposite side though, binning is better as you can send the exact card away but there are only an handful for cards that actually bin to begin with, let alone a spell/trap. There is exactly one card that can bin spell/trap's and that's <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>. One bin card isn't nearly enough, so we need another card and one that is preferably searchable/summonable and as it turns out we have that card in the form of<a data-name=""Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion""> Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion</a>. He's a hard to bring out, needing three monsters of the same attribute but different type, but fortunately we have a couple of combos for the boy.  The Classic Combo: I did not choose to use this combo but it is perfectly viable. <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon <a data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a> &gt; add <a data-name=""Opening of the Spirit Gates"">Opening of the Spirit Gates</a> (this can be achieved if either or is played first)</li>  	<li>Activate Spirit Gates &gt; add <a data-name=""Chaos Summoning Beast"">Chaos Summoning Beast</a></li>  	<li>Use Dark Beckoning to normal summon Chaos Summoning</li>  	<li>Link away Chaos Summoning for <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></li>  	<li>Use Spirit Gates effect &gt;discard&gt; special Chaos Summoning from Grave</li>  	<li>Link away Chaos Summoning for<a data-name=""Relinquished Anima""> Relinquished Anima</a></li>  	<li>Use all three monsters on field to make Curious &gt;effect to bin Reload</li> </ol> This is the old way, though still good enough if you like it. However I have found a far better, and flexible, method to create Curious using the power of Scrap <ol>  	<li>Open <a data-name=""Scrap Raptor"">Scrap Raptor</a> (achievable through the use of <a data-name=""Fossil Dig"">Fossil Dig</a> as well as <a data-name=""Scrapyard"">Scrapyard</a>)</li>  	<li>Use Raptor effect &gt;destroy Raptor&gt; add <a data-name=""Scrap Chimera"">Scrap Chimera</a></li>  	<li>Normal summon Chimera &gt;special Raptor from grave</li>  	<li>Link away both cards for <a data-name=""Scrap Wyvern"">Scrap Wyvern</a></li>  	<li>(IMPORTANT! YOU MUST HAVE SET A CARD BEFORE YOU PROCEED) Use Wyvern effect &gt;summon a Scrap from grave &gt;destroy the Scrap &gt;summon <a data-name=""Scrap Golem"">Scrap Golem</a> from deck &gt;destroy set card</li>  	<li>Use Golem Effect &gt;summon a Scrap from grave to YOUR (do not misclick or you will be very sad) field</li>  	<li>Link away to make Curious.</li> </ol> The reason I like this combo more is it easier to find your starter in Raptor, and when you get to the point where you could summon Curious you have other options to link to instead. In addition, normal Volcanic decks use <a data-name=""Royal Firestorm Guard"">Royal Firestorm Guard</a>s to reset the Scattershot so that it can be used again however this is not good as it uses up your normal summon and you need to have another Pyro type in your grave. With the Scrap line you can go into <a data-name=""Daigusto Emeral"">Daigusto Emeral</a> to reset if you have already Scattershot.  All in all, I feel this is a fun and flexible rouge deck that can easily go up again many decks."

Besides the <em>rokket </em>engine I am using the <em>Buster Blader</em> archetype to end in a more powerful board. The inclusion of the <em>Albaz</em> cards is for a better support and interruptions.  For the <em>dragon link </em>part of the deck you would do the same combo to end on a <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Sphere </strong>and a <strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong> with <em>typically </em>2 counters.  <strong>Dragon link basic combo path: </strong> <ol>  	<li>Summon a lv 4 or lower Dragon</li>  	<li>Link-1 <strong>Striker Dragon</strong> <ol>  	<li>Search for <strong>Boot Sector launch</strong></li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Summon a Dragon</li>  	<li>Link-2 <strong>Dragunity Knight - Romulus</strong> <ol>  	<li>Search for <strong>Dragon Ravine</strong></li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Dragon Ravine</strong> <ol>  	<li>Discard a card</li>  	<li>Send <strong>Absorouter Dragon</strong> from Deck to GY</li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Absorouter Dragon</strong> Effect and search for <strong>Rokket Tracer</strong></li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Boot Sector Launch</strong> <ol>  	<li>Special Summon <strong>Rokket Tracer</strong></li> </ol> </li>  	<li>(If you manage to have another dragon on the field) <ol>  	<li>Link-2 <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Sphere </strong>(Before using <strong>Rokket Tracer</strong> effect)</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>(If you only have <strong>Rokket Tracer</strong>) <ol>  	<li>Active Rokket Tracer effect to destroy a card and Special Summon <strong>Rokket Recharger</strong></li>  	<li>Synchro Summon Borreload Savage Dragon (Depending on the card that you destroy with <strong>Rokket Tracer<em> </em></strong>in this scenario that will be the amount of Counters that it will have based on the link monster in the GY.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> The Buster Blader archetype is very easy to use and is good as a backup if your opponents spend all their resources to stop your d<em>ragon link </em>combo and have a smaller hand to start their turn.  <strong>Buster Blader combo:</strong> <ol>  	<li>Normal summon <strong>Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman</strong> <ol>  	<li>Activate its effect to search for <strong>Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman</strong></li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Set <strong>Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman</strong></li>  	<li>(In your opponent's turn) <ol>  	<li>Activate <strong>Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman</strong> <ol>  	<li>Send <strong>Destruction Sword Memories </strong>and <strong>Buster Blader, The Destruction Swordmaster </strong>(this step is cost!)</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Since it was cost, activate <strong>Destruction Sword Memories </strong>as part of the chain <ol>  	<li>Banish <strong>Buster Blader, The Destruction Swordmaster </strong>and <em>any</em> dragon from the GY</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Resolve and Special Summon <strong>Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman</strong> and <strong>Buster Dragon</strong></li> </ol> </li> </ol> And basically that's it! Even if you opponent interrupts your search, you can use <strong>Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman </strong>to start your d<em>ragon link </em>combo since it is a dragon and level 4 monster. It can be use as an interruption bait.  In some cases you can manage to have <strong>Dragon Buster Destruction Sword</strong> in the GY and you can equip it to your <strong>Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman </strong>with <strong>Buster Dragon</strong> and have your opponent's Extra Deck unavailable!  For the <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong> part of the deck is very simple, if you manage have <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Sphere</strong> on the field there is a cool interaction with <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong>.  <strong>Fallen of Albaz scenario:</strong> <ol>  	<li>Have <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Sphere</strong> on the field <ol>  	<li>Use its effect to tribute <em>itself</em> to send back a card to the hand</li>  	<li>Since you tribute it, his other effect will trigger in the GY to Special Summon a dragon monster from your deck.</li>  	<li>Special summon <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong> <ol>  	<li>Activate its effect, discard a card and use it to Fusion summon with an opponent's monster</li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> I consider this scenario to be better than using <strong>Omni Dragon Brotaur </strong>as the summon from <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Sphere </strong>effect, since you can have a better board and interruptions with the <em>branded</em> fusion monsters.  Also, if your opponent manages to use the effect of <strong>Nibiru, The Primal Being</strong>, while you have <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Sphere</strong> on the field. You will have the same scenario. You special summon <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong>, use its effect to fusion summon with <strong>Nibiru, The Primal Being</strong><strong> </strong>and, since it's a <em>light</em> you fusion summon <strong>Albion the Branded Dragon. </strong>After that is up to you to decide which other fusion you want to make. You can go straight into making <strong>Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</strong>.  A good option is <strong>Albion the Branded Dragon → </strong><strong>Borreload Furious Dragon</strong>. Since you can use <strong>Borreload Furious Dragon </strong>effect to destroy your <strong>Albion the Branded Dragon </strong>and another card from your opponent. This will send <strong>Albion the Branded Dragon </strong>to the GY and at the <em>End phase</em> you can search for <strong>Branded in White</strong> to have another fusion for the next turn since you will have <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong> in the GY.  For the trap cards there's no much to say. They are self explanatory. Red Reign is a very good protection for your boss monsters since all, except links and one synchro monster, are level 8.  And that's it. I have being playing a lot with this deck, its super fun and very powerful. A lot of people never expect to be locked with the <strong>Buster Blader</strong> combo."

The main rank 4 enablers are Thousand Blades and Morning Star, so if you try to make your own heroic deck, keep in mind that you need quite a few heroics for Blades.  The real important thing is all of the cards that I <em>don't</em> run. <p>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</p> The reasons that you would want to run isolde, is that it can summon a Thousand Blades from deck which, of course, is a good payoff.  The issue with Isolde is that you actually need to make it before you can use it.  What I mean is that, the only cards that you would actually <em>want </em>to use for Isolde would be non-level 4 warriors, because making a rank 4, even if it isn't the otk, has more payoff than Isolde.  The reason for this is that if Isolde summons Blades, then you would need to have 3 heroics in hand to discard for Blades, otherwise you aren't getting any actual payoff from making the Isolde in the first place.  One could argue that you only need 2 discards since technically that would leave you with 3 lvl 4s and Isolde herself, but the only thing that gives you over the same play in a deck that doesn't run Isolde, would be a unicorn, which <em>also </em>needs a discard, albeit a generic discard, leaving you in essentially the same vice.  Wether you have 2 heroics or 3 in hand with the Isolde play, the issue is that more often than not, heroics are free lvl 4 extenders, and you wouldn't need to use material on the Isolde anyways.  Assuming that you are in a situation where you have 2 or 3 dead heroics in hand, AND you need to get 2 Isolde material on field, that would leave you with 2 cards in hand to actually be hts or board breakers. In most match-ups, that isn't enough to win, unless it's specifically the one(s) you need, and running Isolde (which would need 4+ brick equip spells, mind you) wouldn't be able to rescue you.  &nbsp; <p>Heroic Challenger - Clasp Sword</p> Fun fact for all of the 2 (max) people reading this: one of the many, MANY, reasons that I've detached myself from the rest of the ""heroic community"" (one other player and his abusive friend) is over disputes of the usefulness of clasp sword, many of which ""ended"" with me getting muted after getting insulted and yelled at for about an hour because I managed to realize that Clasp has no actual place in a heroic deck.  But all of my deep hatred of them aside, I can certainly understand why a new player with no heroics experience would believe that Clasp is useful, although I must admit I don't understand the staunch defense of it.  The reason that I despise Clasp so much, is that it just plain isn't worth making. The reason you would play clasp is so that you could add another lvl 4 heroic extender after summoning it w/ Blades (one of 2 ways to trigger Clasp, the other being Ambush Soldier), However all that leaves you with is (assuming you have nothing unrelated) is Blades, Clasp, and a lvl 4, but if you didn't run/summon Clasp, then you would be left with Blades and whatever lvl 4 you would summon off of blades.  At first glance, this seems to prove that Clasp truly does have a use. After all, it gives you another body, and since this is a rank 4 spam deck, Clasp would <em>also </em>be a lvl 4...  ...right?  It isn't. It's lvl 1.  Not to mention the fact that using Blades's effect locks you into heroics for the rest of the turn, so you can't even use it for link material.  Now, if any Extra-pilled fellow such as I were to explain this one of the filthy Clasp-pilled lot, I can assure you they would respond with ""Clasp doesn't add a lvl 4, it adds Knuckle, then you summon Knuckle from hand with its own effect, so you can make Jarn and summon a lvl 4 from your gy.""  (Side note: Knuckle will usually be classified as another lvl 4 extender, but in this case you wouldn't use its 2nd effect and it would stay lvl 1)  However, as my brothers have already figured out, the difference between using Clasp that way and not using it at all, is that using it gives you a spent Jarn.  Filthy Claspians would argue that that is better than not running it, which while technically being true, is overlooking a few things.  First and foremost, Clasp is a HARD GARNET. This means that if you draw it, it is entirely <em>useless.</em> And before someone can get a chance to say it, no, being a discard for Blades is <strong>not </strong>a use.  Secondly, Jarn's protection won't matter that late, since most always anyone would just use anything that pops would just quickfire it on the summon of Blades, so you wouldn't be able to summon anything at all. And keep in mind that, even the people who would die on Clasp's hill would agree that Blades is the only reasonable way to trigger Clasp anyways. <p>Forbidden Droplet</p> You literally just can't afford to discard a bunch of stuff, I don't really know how to elaborate at all.  &nbsp;  Now that I've gone through all of the things that I get lambasted for not running, I'd like to take this time to explain some of my ""spicier,"" as some would say, deck-building choices. <p>Denko Sekka &amp; Bujinki Ahashima</p> Yes, I know that Sekka is a thunder monster and not a warrior, just hear me out here.  If you win game 1 against a backrow heavy deck, then a Sekka backed by your 15/17 hts is usually just a free win.  Some of you may be wondering why I've paired Ahashima with Sekka, and that's because Ahashima is what you use Sekka for turn 3.  Sekka herself may not be a warrior, but she's still a lvl 4 monster, so if you summon a lvl 4 warrior on turn 3 and make Ahashima with that and Sekka, you can still make Claive assuming you have another lvl 4 warrior in your hand.  And before you ask, yes, this IS Ahashima's only use, but the ED is really open in heroic decks. <p>Extra Sword</p> I'll admit, Extra isn't important.  At all.  The reason that I run it is because it's the 2nd best thing to summon off of Blades after Morning Star, and given the fact that Morning Star is a 3 of with 4 searchers, I would like to have some back-up. If you would like to, you can absolutely replace Extra with anything else (unless it's one of the things I said to not play, as my word is next to law).  Have fun"

The main goal of this deck is to completely shut down your opponent's ability to summon anything, then lock down the duel with any combination of hand/field control options.  Ground Collapse, Ojama Knight, and Ojama King all terminate your opponents ability to use Main Monster Zones. Royale Decree negates all trap effects. Silent Swordsman can negate any spell card once per turn without cost. Robbin' Goblin can tear apart your opponent's hand. These pieces in any combination will severely gimp your opponent's ability to play the game.  Ojamagic is the hidden gem here. When sent to the graveyard, it allows you to add one Ojama Green, Yellow, And Black to hand which you can use to bring the big boy Ojama King out (or if you have an Ojama Red in hand, you can finesse out the Ojama Emperor himself). This effect is easily activated with Raigeki Break, Magical Hats, Gagaga Gardna or Ojama Country.  Big Shield Gardna is not only a beefy defender, but when Ojama Country is active he is a massive 4-star 2600 beater.  Raigeki Break has two uses here. The first is generic removal, but the second is discarding Ojamagic (which it can still do even if Royal Decree is in play!)  If you are feeling extra cheeky you could add in a Yata-Garasu for a cheeky little Yata-Lock"

You ns the Debris and use its effect to summon Lightning from the gy, and then you synchro summon a Shooting Riser Dragon. After that, you use REDMD or Flash to get another lvl 3 non-tuner on field, and use Riser to synch with it for Baronne.  At least, that's the main combo. Of course, as a Tier 6 far sub-rogue deck, the main combo doesn't always happen, which is why I play things like the full Armedra package.  If you have a lvl 3/ flash and lvl 5, then you can summon the lvl 3, use it's effect discarding lvl 5, lvl 5 gy eff adds lvl 7, lvl 5 on field eff discards lvl 7, lvl 7 gy eff adds Armed Dragon Lightning, Armedra Lightning adds lvl 3 from gy, lvl 7 on field discards the lvl 3 to summon lvl 10, lvl 3 gy eff draws one.

I built a Gem-Knight FTK deck in master duel. The deck works incredibly well.  Your job is two things, one trigger block dragon and two get Gem-Knight fusion out of your deck, once you do that take it from there and ftk them.  The backup plan is dpe pass and if you REALLY brick hard then try surrendering but most times you’ll be able to make a play of some sort.  When you ftk it’s usually this setup, 6 monsters all special summoned including a lady lapis lazuli and master diamond along with a gem-knight monster in your hand usually achievable and gem-knight fusion in your graveyard with a banish target.  What you do from there is pitch another lady lapis lazuli with the first one and use master diamond to do the same for 6000, then you use gem knight fusion fusing the gem-knight in your hand, master diamond, and lady lapis lazuli for a second master diamond, who pitches for game.  If you want you can swap out Seraphinite for another master diamond to give the deck more wiggle room but for me the first two master diamonds are usually good enough at preforming the ftk themselves."

(the other one is in the side for going second against decks that can't deal with it.) be carful about when you activate neos fusion he's not just straight broken like dragoon or enforcer if they have an answer it can mess you up a lot. Also by no means do I think this is the best version of 60 eldrich so just have fun with it and make changes as you see fit. :)
