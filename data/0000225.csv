Trading Card Game Known as the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game (遊☆戯☆王オフィシャルカードゲーム, Yū-Gi-Ō Ofisharu Kādo Gēmu) in Asia, is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami. It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series.  ""Floowandereeze"" is a combination of ""wander"" and ""breeze"", with an additional ""Floo"" added to the front to approximate the archetype's Japanese name (while also being reminiscent of the English word ""flew""). The original Japanese name's first part instead comes from the Japanese word fuwafuwa (""fluffy"").  Link tutorial for this deck :  https://youtube.com/watch?v=QGGACtZmGzs"

Hopefully stall out the enemy with Gozen Match, Mistake, Barrier Statue, and maybe Skill Drain if it is drawn.  Play Flawless Perfection and Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi as support possibly getting a Gagagigo the Risen or a Blue-Eyes Ultimate (if Barrier Statue or Gozen has been blown up) when Fists gets blown up.  Keep summoning monsters. Maybe summon an XYZ monster if the board gets too big. Abyss Dweller is pretty good for making sure the lv8s can beat over things AND has a good stall ability (assuming Skill Drain isn't around). Snow-dust giant will also help make the water monsters seem bigger. Use ancient rules to summon the lv8s.  Heart of the Underdog will hopefully maintain card advantage.  Hopefully win with a Raigeki or Mirror Force.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

You will proceed with the next step by activating “<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>” effect to send out “<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>” from your hand to the GY. Then use ""<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>"" effect to become Earth Attribute that allowed you to Summon “<a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend"">Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend</a>'' card from either hand or Deck by sending both “<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>” and “<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>” from the field to the GY, which make them to trigger of their effects by Chain Link 2 and bringing it back “<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>” from the GY to the field along with “<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>” by it own effect. Now you have finally had a chance to Summon “<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>” from either hand or Deck by its own effect. After that use “<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>” effect to search out “<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>” from your Deck then add it to your hand which is the only best Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF/Level 4/Light Attribute monster that can be able to search out by ""<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed - Dharc"">Familiar-Possessed - Dharc</a>"" effect when it Summoned by it own effect.  <strong>Reminder:</strong> Do not activate ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" effect during your turn when it Summoned to your field, it will disable you for summoning from the Exta Deck unless if you have too. (This is an Optional)  <span>You will soon basically understand the concept of which cards you might ever use during the set up once you finally figure out how the Charmer's strategy works. Do the rest which I already listed of all the cards that might be used for the final board set up at the below.</span>  ___________________________________________  <strong>[End Board]</strong> • <em>Field:</em> - <a data-name=""Borreload Salvage Dragon"">Borreload Salvage Dragon</a> - <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> + {<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a> = <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Magicians</a>} (Opponent's Turn) • <em>Spell/Trap:</em> - <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> (face-up) - <a data-name=""Possessed Partnerships"">Possessed Partnerships</a> (set) = <a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a> (Opponent's Turn) - <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a> (Spell/Trap Zone)(Equipped by ""<a data-name=""Borreload Salvage Dragon"">Borreload Salvage Dragon</a>"" effect) • <em>Hand:</em> - 1 Draw (Your turn) - Extra Draw (During your Opponent's Turn) - Added: <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted</a> (During your Opponent's Turn)  ___________________________________________  <strong>Tips</strong>: You might not actually get them from the opening hand with exactly cards. So I prefer you to try something else with different cards in your hand if one of the Key Cards are missing. You should better rely on your additional cards in your hand that might help you to set up your cards. Keep it in your mind that ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" is just an additional card to use Familiar-Possessed - Lyna's Effect to search out ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" from your deck to the hand.  Since Lyna &amp; Dharc familiar monsters haven’t been revealed yet in TCG. I came up with those ideas by adding “<a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>” and “<a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a>” from the Deck to gain more consistency. I didn't actually plan to add them on my Deck in the first place since I want to prove that this Deck can win without relying on any Limited cards. <span> I might actually replace the “<a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>” and “<a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a>” including the “<a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>” later once the Light and Dark familiar’s monster has been finally released in TCG. By replacing it with two copies of “<a data-name=""Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin"">Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin</a>” Field Spell card and one “<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>” Spell card.</span>  ___________________________________________  <strong>[Additional] </strong>for more Consistency You can use ""<a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>"" as additional for ""<a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>"" or any Level 4 monster from your Deck like ""<a data-name=""Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre"">Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</a>"" or any Performage monster depending what card you need. Requirement: 1 any Spell card, except ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" card, if not, you can use it as well if you have too. I include “<a data-name=""Summoner Mon"">Summoner Mon</a>k” from my Deck Profile since It actually works very well for any Level 4 monster."

If you're tired of making the exact same soulsword or drytro,"Despia is an archetype of dark fairy and light fusion fiend monsters that focus on fusion summoning. The archetype was initially released in dawn of majesty but didn't see much competitive success. However recent support in Burst of Destiny and changes to the surrounding meta game make this deck poised to be a powerful threat in the upcoming season. While there are many variations that can be done on the archetype, such as combining it with darklords for potential big boards and aliester for better fusion targets, this variation of mine combines despia with a shaddoll and predaplant package for going second and breaking boards. Let me go through some of the key cards.  Aluber, the Jester of Despia: This card is your main normal summon. He can search out either the field spell that fusion summons, or either of the quick play spells that can be used for offense or recovery. He also has a GY effect when a fusion is destroyed but since his effects are once per turn, once that turn, it doesn't come up much.  Despian Tragedy: This card is low-key amazing. Because his search effect triggers on either banish or sent to the GY by card effect, he can trigger off being fusion summoned, banished for allure, or sent by the quick play spells. His GY effect to reset a branded spell is also extremally useful.  Dramaturge and Libitum: these 2 Level 8 monsters are in the deck for extension plays when used as fusion material. They can be quite useful to go into dingirsu when you need to remove a problematic card.  Despia, Theater of the Branded: The deck doesn't die without the field spell up but it is easily much stronger when it is up. Obviously it fusion summons but the more interesting effect is when your non-fusion fairy(despia monsters are fairys) leaves the field by card effect or battle, you get to summon back a fusion monster from the GY. This turns so useful against something like nibiiru or a board wipe, since chances are you had both a fusion and a despia on field so it will trigger.  Branded Opening: This card is really good. It locks you into fusion monsters after usage but it puts a body on board or in hand, its discard is not a cost so it will trigger both tragedy and any of the shaddolls, and while in the GY it can protect a fusion by card destruction. all around a good card.  Shaddoll package: The shaddoll choices can vary and while they are not necessarily garnets, you don't want to see too many in your hand without a despia in there too. The only shaddoll monster you can(or rather want to) make with the field spell is construct and unless you side in some nibiru or effect veiler, you will have to rely on either your fusion monsters or your opponents light monsters. But Shaddoll fusion is still and amazing card and triggers basically any effect you want it too. Schism can be a great way to close out games by making winda as well.  Predaplant package: this is honestly a cuttable part of the deck. The reason I included it is monstly just cause its another way to make fusions, it is another super poly target, and its an allure banish at worst. If I can find something more powerful and consistent I will gladly swap it out.  EXTRA DECK:  Masquerade the Blazing Dragon: This is one of the new cards and frankly its amazing. Against heavy combo decks, even just one of these on the field means your opponent has just 13 card activations before they need to deal with it. which may sound like a lot but you would be surprised how many card activations it takes before a deck can get a pop or negation live. And since you're going second, this is both a super poly target and if you can't beat your opponent, you can still lower their life enough that they might have only 2, 1, or even 0 card activations left. Also its level 8 so another material for Dingirsu.  Despian Quarteris: This card is for cleaning up boards that don't have a dragoon or Phoenix enforce on them(that's what super poly is for), and floats into jester, which if the field spell is up will float into despian. A nice card all around.  Despian Proskenion: While a despia monster, a light, and a dark monster sound like a lot of material for a fusion, I can think of 2 decks whose end boards tend to have on them a light and dark( looking at you soulsword and drytron). Honestly, nothing feels better than summoning a jester, activating super poly to send away someone's herald of ultimentness and dragoon, then bring back their dragoon with Proskenions effect and win that way.  &nbsp;  GENERAL GAMEPLAN: Your typical game plan is to blind second. Let your opponent set up and use bait cards like Opening and allure to bait interaction before blowing them away with your power cards of shaddoll fusion and super poly. If your opponent goes first, thats generally fine as masqurade or Quarteris can generally keep you alive with their floating and recusion, or if you open decent end on a winda. As noted earlier, Drytron and soulsword can get regularly hosed by this decks power cards, so your side deck should consist of counters to backrow heavy decks(which your only counter here is dragon and dingirsu) and specifically flunderezz(since that deck doesn't use the extra, isn't weak to superpoly, and doesnt special summon)"

It can bring a copy of itself from the GY to the hand, so it's good at combo-ing with Astolfo.  Sublimation Knight - Sublimation Knight is one of the best cards in this deck, since when it's summoned, it can let you bring out a free Isolde thanks to good synergy with Squeaknight. If it isn't in your starting hand, you can use Isolde's second effect to discard 3 Equips from the deck to summon out Sublimation Knight and continue your link plays.  Squeaknight - Squeaknight is almost solely here to combo with Sublimation Knight, but it also lets you bring out some syncrho monsters if you ever want to.  Infernoble Knight Renaud - Renaud is an amazing card, being a free special summon in almost any hand an can also return an equip spell from the GY, which is situationally useful.  Infernoble Knight Astolfo - Astolfo combos well with Isolde and Red Layer, being able to use the card they add to summon itself. It is also a combo piece with DDR, being a neat tech combo.  Boost Warrior - Boost Warrior is something you can use your normal summon on, or you can summon it if you have a special summoned Squeaknight on your field.  Fire Flint Lady - This card is a free special summon as long as you have any fire warrior on the field, which is easy for this deck. It can also be used to bring out Red Layer or Sublimation for extending Synchro plays."

Snake Rain gets your combos going: Pitch any card, send Nunu, Nauya, Zohah, and a Keurse. Special summon nunu since you have no monsters, tribute it to Keurse, then summon Nauya. Nauya searches for your Lily, which you use to send you Aleirtt. Normal summon Zohah after you put it into your hand by dumping a card using his effect, and XYZ Nauya and it off for rikka queen. This is what I love about the deck: Rikka is your 5th summon, and since Nibiru tributes, you will still get the negate. Activate Aleirtt's effect to get rid of Rikka (If you haven't been Nibirued) and then use Queen's effect to summon your negate. If you are going first, take Keurse and Aleirtt, to XYZ summon for either Number 38 or 97. 97 will still get you into your Harbinger, but it is an extra body on the field.  If you are going second, take the above combo, but do not go into harbinger, go into Draglubion who then will summon an 18K attack Numeron Dragon.  Sadly this combo is pretty fragile, one Ash CAN and WILL make you probably lose the game, but if it is Ashed, go with this combo if you have it:  Nunu Combo: Pitch Nunu to send Zohah, Dump a card to add Zohah to hand. Special Summon Nunu, Normal summon Zohah to XYZ into you King Of The Feral Imps. King searches for Nauya, then Nauya pitches for Keurse. Tribute your King Of The Feral Imps for Keurse, and summon Nauya. Nauya searches for your Lily, and Lily sends Aleirtt. Then it just becomes your basic snake rain combo at this point.  There are other combos that this deck can do, with the reptilianne cards, but this is an Ogdoadic deck, after all  &nbsp;  Other cards you may consider: Borreload Savage Dragon. In testing this card, it does get me out of rough spots, I would probably replace your Ahashima for this. Borreload or Borrelsword are also good cards. Also replace Ahashima with these.  I Fell that's all I can really say about this deck. It's incredibly easy to get into and learn."

Even when faced with something that can effectively disrupt them, pendulum magicians can be surprisingly resilient with a decent hand, typically able to play through 1 or 2 interruptions without much difficulty. Their biggest weakness is consistency, due to the inherent fact that pendulum decks need at least 2 pendulum scales and a few monsters in hand to make any significant plays. They are somewhat prone to brick hands that can only make 1-2 interruptions and get stopped by 1 hand trap. Nevertheless, they are definitely strong enough to pick up a win at locals as long as you can draw well and dodge Anti-Spell Fragrance.  <span><strong>Main Deck</strong></span>  3 Harmonizing Magician: Harmonizing gives you a free material for an extra deck monster just for pendulum summoning it. You want to go out of your way to set this up above any of your other plays except maybe popping a Double Iris. Just remember it can’t be pendulum summoned from the extra deck  3 Double Iris Magician: The pendulumgraphs are really good cards with StarGraph offering combo extension and recovery and TimeGraph being one of the strongest spell speed 2 destruction effects of all time. Double Iris is a searcher for them that is very searchable itself due to being a magician as well as being treated as a pendulum dragon for Duelist alliance. Don’t forget that it can pop itself if you control a dark spellcaster if you don’t have another way to do it. Also it’s not once per turn.  3 Wisdom-Eye Magician: Wisdom-Eye’s pendulum effect that pops itself to put another magician in your scales is highly appreciated consistency and it can be pendulum summoned afterwards to directly generate card advantage. Also it’s not once per turn.  2 Oafdragon Magician: Oaf is the best low-scale magician because its pendulum effect is a free +1 that isn’t that isn’t hard at all to activate. Also Konami actually remembered to keep this one to a HOPT.  2 Performapal Skullcrobat Joker: Joker is pendulum monster Stratos, it makes the deck consistent enough to be playable and when it inevitably goes to 3 on the next banlist you add in the last copy.  2 Performapal Pendulum Sorcerer: Unfortunately, not a magician monster, but its effect on summon is a +1 at worst and it is also the best way to pop Double Iris. It can also be used as a low scale in a pinch.  1 Performapal Celestial Magician: This one is played more for what it is than what it does. Both of it’s effects are pretty niche but it is the only monster that is both a pendulum magician and a performapal (not including Five-Rainbow Magician because that card was never intended to be played in actual pendulum decks). This makes it searchable off Pendulum Sorcerer if all you need is another magician.  3 Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer: The dracoslayers are an incredibly splashable engine for a million different pendulum decks. Luster’s pendulum effect is a free +1 and the dracoslayer extra deck monsters give pendulum decks a lot of extra utility and card advantage for only a Luster and some level 4 pendulum monsters on board. Also it’s not once per turn.  1 Tuning Magician: Halqifibrax target. Because of Selene, you can make your rank-4 play without using Tuning Magician’s effect so if you have magicians in your scales you get a free extra deck material afterward.  3 Effect Veiler: Veiler is the most synergetic hand trap for pend magicians because it is a tuner and spellcaster monster so it can be used to make Selene and Halqifibrax.  3 Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring: Any tuner hand trap works because of Halq and Ash is the most flexible one.  3 Duelist Alliance: ROTA for pendulums. You can search Luster, Pendulum Sorcerer, Pendulum Treasure to get any pendulum monster, and even Double Iris because it is a pendulum dragon.  3 Pendulum Treasure: The other ROTA for pendulums. Note that Harmonizing can’t be summoned from the extra deck so you will want to have an Oaf available to put it into your hand if you need to search it with Treasure.  1 Called By the Grave: Pend magicians are decently resistant to hand traps but your brickier hands can still be ruined by an ash and running one-of Called By means that you can occasionally sack your opponent when you should’ve been shut down.  3 Pot of Prosperity: Out of the 15 cards in the extra deck only 12-13 of them are needed. Prosperity lets you banish your worst 3 extra deck monsters to improve your consistency, which is something that pendulum decks struggle with.  1 Star Pendulumgraph: StarGraph the worse of the pendulumgraphs but still worth playing because 1 search per turn is strong and pulling off 2 Double Iris pops in a game is something the deck does just by working correctly.  1 Time Pendulumgraph: This is the reason to place such a high value on Double Iris. It’s a spell speed 2 pop every turn, but what makes it overpowered is the “Then, if this card didn’t destroy 2 cards, DIngirsu effect” clause that makes the pop impossible to avoid, gets around almost all protection, and has no reason to exist.  1 Treacherous Trap Hole: For Rafflesia.  1 Gravedigger’s Trap Hole: For Rafflesia.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span>  1 Abyss Dweller: Dweller is a generic floodgate monster that locks the entire current meta out of at least half their deck. You would be stupid not to play it.  1 Traptrix Rafflesia: Rafflesia is the only XYZ boss monster that is sometimes worth making over Dweller. Either a spell speed 2 double pop or a monster negate. Because most of your plays happen in the spell and trap zones, making this before or as your 5th summon is trivially easy, so you are effectively Nibiru-proof as long as you don’t draw Gravedigger’s.  1 Majester Paladin, the Ascending Dracoslayer: Majester, Ignister, and Dinoster are a simple combo with each other if you have Luster and any 2 level 4 pendulum monsters on board with at least 1 being non-tuner. Synchro luster and a level 4 into Ignister, Ignister ef summon another Luster from deck, then you can use Ignister ef to pop a scale and spin a card without targeting, XYZ Luster and a level 4 into Majester, Majester effect to search a pendulum in the end phase, Majester ef detach a material to summon Luster from extra deck, contact fuse Majester and Luster into Dinoster, Dinoster ef summon Luster from grave. It turns a few monsters with no effects on field into a search in end phase, a non-targeting spin and scale pop, and scale protection. That isn’t much, but it’s practically free because it only requires some monsters that get replaced with the same number of better monsters.  1 Linkuriboh: Linkuriboh  lets you link off your Tuning magician for your Halq combos so that you can go into Avramax and get another attribute in grave for Accesscode.  1 I:P Masquerena: Masq does a lot of things for this deck. Generic materials, 2 down arrows for pendulum summoning, and it’s an interruption because it can go into Knightmare Unicorn on your opponent’s turn.  1 GranSolfachord Musecia: There are some cases where you want to make this when link climbing to swap a Wisdom-Eye for an extender or a Joker for next turn. It’s very specific and not all that good so this is almost always banished to Prosperity.  1 Knightmare Phoenix: I had some free space in the extra deck so I threw in a Phoenix. It’s nice to have so that you can get rid of floodgates with any 2 random monsters.  1 Crystron Halqifibrax: Up the link ladder we go! Summon Tuning Magician, link it and Halq into Selene, Selene ef summon Tuning Magician, link Tuning Magician into Linkuriboh, link Selene and Linkuriboh into Accesscode or Avramax.  1 Selene, the Queen of Master Magicians: The only thing Selene does is facilitate Halq being a 1 card link-4.  1 Knightmare Unicorn: Spin away anything annoying you for 3 monsters and a discard. Unless they are immune to targeting, in which case you need to go the extra mile for Ignister Prominence or TimeGraph.  1 Accesscode Talker: This is what all the link climbing is for, pop your opponent’s entire board and beat them to death.  1 Crusadia Mekk-Knight Avramax: This is the other thing you link climb into, make a huge untargetable beat stick that protects the rest of your board and spins your opponent’s best card if they manage to deal with it.  1 Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess: You don’t get your pendulum monsters back into the extra deck if you use them as XYZ materials, so going into 4 material Apollo is a fine alternative to Rafflesia or Dweller if you have no other plays to make or you want to avoid topdecking for Joker on your follow up turn.  1 Ignister Prominence, the Burning Dracoslayer: See Majester Paladin, the ascending Dracoslayer. Ignister is pretty good on it’s own as well because it can pop a scale for a non-targeting spin while also summoning a Luster from deck to continue your plays.  1 Dinoster Power, the Mighty Dracoslayer: See Majester Paladin, the Ascending Dracoslayer.’’  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Combos</strong></span>  Pend magicians don’t really have specific 2 or 3 card combos, they’re more about figuring out how to turn 3 or 4 random combo cards in your hand into the same kinds of end boards. Playing every hand optimally takes a little bit of practice, but here are some general things to think about:  The main cards you are looking to use are Harmonizing, Double Iris, Luster Pendulum, and Pendulum Sorcerer.  Try to work in something that will give you a follow-up play, whether that is a search from Joker or Majester, set pendulum scales, or something else like an Oaf effect.  Use Wisdom-Eye whenever possible, it’s free advantage and not HOPT.  Link climbing isn’t very good going first. You would rather make Apollousa, I:P, or some XYZ monsters.  Popping Double Iris is very annoying to do without Luster Pendulum or Pendulum Sorcerer."

Spell/Trap, 1 Ecclesia, 1 True Draco monster, the other 1 don't matter what it is, but the good one is Nadir Servant.  <strong>2nd Turn</strong> : 1 Cont. Spell, 1 Ecclesia, 1 either Pot of Extravagance / Duality , 1 True Draco monster. <ul>  	<li><strong>Commentary</strong></li> </ul> So, this deck is pretty consistent, has a lot of searcher, and most importantly you can use Pot of Extravagance &amp; Duality in one turn. This deck also has a lot of backrow removal, so don't worry.  But I'm not sure if this is good enough compared to other control decks, so I'd be happy if you guys give me some advice to make this deck better.  I emptied the side deck so you can fill anything. And lastly, this deck is quite fun LoL"

""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"" can be Summoned by using copies of the ""Cyber Dragon"" monsters and has immense OTK potential, especially if Summoned with the help of ""Power Bond"" and ""Cyberdark Chimera"". ""<a title=""Cyber Dragon Sieger"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyber_Dragon_Sieger"">Cyber Dragon Sieger</a>"" adds further OTK potential to this Deck by increasing the ATK of any Machine monster with 2100 or more ATK by another 2100, thus including the ""Cyberdark"" Machine monster with sufficiently strong Equip Cards. <h4><span id=""Equip_options"" class=""mw-headline"">Equip options</span></h4> ""<a title=""Attachment Cybern"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Attachment_Cybern"">Attachment Cybern</a>"" is the ideal Equip Card for the original 3 ""Cyberdark"" monsters, as it grants them total of 3000 ATK if equipped by their effects.

""<a title=""Leng Ling"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Leng_Ling"">Leng Ling</a>"", while having only 1500 ATK, will also set the ATK of any ""Cyberdark"" it is equipped to at 2500 ATK and allow it to attack twice, and it can summon itself to the field while equipped. ""Cannon"", ""Claw"" and ""<a title=""Autorokket Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Autorokket_Dragon"">Autorokket Dragon</a>"" are second to ""Hunter Dragon"" in terms of original ATK, with 1600 ATK each. ""<a title=""Masked Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Masked_Dragon"">Masked Dragon</a>"" is both an eligible target for the Level 4 ""Cyberdark"" monsters and can search most other eligible targets. ""<a title=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Red-Eyes_Baby_Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a>"" can add a Level 1 Dragon monster from the Deck to the hand when sent to the Graveyard while equipped to a monster.  ""<a title=""Cyberdark Invasion"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyberdark_Invasion"">Cyberdark Invasion</a>"" and ""Cyberdark Realm"" also expand the scope of cards ""Cyberdark"" monsters can be equipped with.

","Welcome to my version of Floowandereeze Dogmatika.  Floow is an incredibily strong strategy when it goes off, but sometimes really struggles to get past interrupts, which requires a lot of cards that can impact the core strategy due to the increased chance of bricking. It can also really struggle with it's going second game because of the resilience of other meta strategies to intteruption. This Dogmatika build somewhat alleviates the consistency issues, as well as add cards that can board break increasing the chances of being able to play. It also further increases the odds of dealing with the mirror match going 2nd (as long as Shifter isn't dropped.)  The 4 Tribute monsters consist of 2 Empen, 1 Raiza and 1 Apex. I chose these ratios purely because should i lose one Empen to the graveyard, I can always search another without having to resort to Strich/Toucan/Raiza to bring it back into play against most of the meta decks. Having 2 really helps when playing against Lyrussic Tri-Brigade which can play around Barrier Statue, as you can continue to prevent them playing the links, as well prevent them the XYZ's from using their protection effects when trying to attack directly, making them easy prey for cards like Raiza, Punishment and Book Of Moon. Some Floow decks don't use Avian, but combining it with unknown winds and it's looping negation can really eat through your opponents cards, so it's more than worth it.  The deck uses a really standard Floow setup of 3 Robina/Eglen, 2 Strich and 1 Toucan. I really like Strich at 2, as not only is it useful for recycling Empen and the spell/traps but becomes a looping DD Crow, banishing cards from your opponents grave every single turn.  The Dogmatika package of 3 Nadir, 1 Ecclesia and 2 Punishment is the ratio i like best. Nadir can act as Ash bait, but also can dump Omen/Barren Blossom into the grave, allowing a free winged beast search or hand fix, depending on the situation. 2 Punishment to increase the chances of drawing one copy in case i get interrupted and at least get something to use.  Dark Ruler No More was added because the deck doesn't run handtraps in the main and is instead opting for a board breaker approach when going second, things like DPE, Dragoon are fairly painful to get around otherwise. Pot of prosperity is used in the Dogmatika build (I play extravagance in the pure build though) because the extra deck is more utilised in this build. Book Of Moon is temporarily here until Journey Preparations  comes in, but fulfills the role of avoid imperm/veiler in the mean time, as well as being a potent weapon if set when going first.  The side deck rather shockingly has uses, although mostly as Nadir/Punishment targets and banishes for prosperity. N'tss because it really helps to break boards, Barren Blossom/Omen as mentioned before can be dropped with Nadir to further dig into the deck and get what i need. Dragon Master Knight if i need to get rid of something particularly large Punishment. Nightingale, Downerd and Zeus can be utilised if you need to completely board clear, though it rarely happens the option is there.  I've relagted Shifter to side, just like I have in my current Gren Maju build (see my drck uploads if this interests you). It's useless in the mirror, interferes with  Dogmatika and only really affects the Tenyi portion of Swordsoul builds, and while this means the actual swordsoul plays are more vulnerable, me not running handtraps means I cannot take advantage of this, plus a lot of the time they'll still power through anyway. However it outrights shuts off every other deck in the meta. Droll for the mirror match and gets swapped right in with Shifter when going second against most decks. Lightning Storm to destroy backrow against the mirror and other Trap heavy decks, Macro for more banish. Appointer to stop anything likely to interfere with my board and 2 Evenly Matched to round of the Side.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Perfect fusion material as it comes back when used for fusion material, even if its banished.</span>  <span>1x Tribrigade Mercourier - Good search target for brigand or can be banished with branded in red/white for a search.</span>  <span>3x PSY Framegear Gamma - Great going second handtrap</span>  <span>1x PSY Frame Driver - Dont draw this</span> <blockquote><div>Spells</div></blockquote> <span>1x Branded in High Spirits - Can mill construct for free graveyard material for Mirrorjade, but is searchable and not required to play at high numbers. </span>  <span>2x Despia, Theater of The Branded - This Collosal Base is one of the fusion spells of the deck. It can also revive a fusion monster if your opponent destroys a non-fusion despia, but that most likely won’t happen</span>  <span>2x Branded in White - Uses materials from hand field and graveyard as long as you use Albaz or Albion(most of the time Albaz) as material</span>  <span>2x Branded in Red - The best fusion spell in the deck, can fuse monsters at quick effect speed and uses cards from hand field and graveyard without needing to use dragons.</span>  <span>3x Branded Opening - Grabs a despia straight from your deck.</span>  <span>3x Dark Ruler No More - Negates the effects of all opponent monsters at the cost of losing all battle damage</span>  <span>3x Super polymerization - Even if Aluber or Albaz are negated, super poly can be used to insulate plays and break boards</span>  <span>2x Forbidden Droplet - Another going second negation tool but is played at 2 because of how many cards in hand it requires</span> <blockquote><div>Trap</div></blockquote> <span>1x Branded Condemnation - Your primary target to send off of Albion, as it can recycle your other branded spells</span> <blockquote><div>Extra Deck</div></blockquote> <span>2x Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon - Good new endboard card, but be careful with its effect as if you use it in one turn, you wont be able to use it on the next turn</span>  <span>1x Rubellion the Divineflame Dragon - An extender that recycles materials</span>  <span>1x Guardian Chimera - Draws and pops cards and in this deck has little downside to its materials</span>  <span>2x Albion the Branded Dragon -  The other albion, this card is another fusion monster that lets you extend into other fusion plays</span>  <span>1x Titaniklad the Ash Dragon - A beater that you will rarely ever summon. Fuel for mirrorjade</span>  <span>1x Brigand the Glory Dragon - better fuel for mirrorjade as it can search mercourier</span>  <span>1x Despia Proscenium - I have stolen a dragoon 3 times with this card.</span>  <span>1x Masquerade the Blazing Dragon - another end board card that burns the opponent for cards used. I dropped this after a battle phase and my opponent had 2500 lp left. Like nibiru but if you activate 5 effects you lose</span>  <span>2x Despia Quaerteris - Easiest despia monster to fusion summon</span>  <span>1x Starving venom fusion dragon - super poly target</span>  <span>1x El Shaddoll Construct - Fuel for high spirits</span>  <span>1x PSY Framelord Omega - when you gamma on your own turn.</span> <blockquote><div>Tips</div></blockquote> ALWAYS GO SECOND  <span>Banish the Construct sent off of High Spirits as material for Mirrorjade</span>  <span>If your hand isnt all that good, you can leave ecclesia on the field to use albaz on the opponents turn.</span>  super polymerization doesn't have to be used at the beginning of a turn. super polymerization is also somewhat of a negation insulator as you can fuse off your and your opponents monsters to dodge some negates like impermanence or effect veiler  &nbsp;"

Winterkills has a wonderful masterclass video over the deck if you're looking for a means of entry into the deck. He also has another deck profile in the video so I suggest checking it out.  &nbsp;  The main thing with this deck that is different is that it has revolving switchyard (only 2 cause you draw so readily). It allows for the ability to play through more hand traps and has another resource loop in bullet train and railroad stampede.  I'm also not playing any monster hand traps cause so many people are on triple tactics talents.  &nbsp;  The forbidden chalice would be droplets if they were a little cheaper, but even with the upcoming reprint, I'm not sure they will be under $50, so they aren't going in anytime soon, but if you have them, this deck has a lot of cards that work in the grave.  &nbsp;  Overall, the deck is extremely fun.... and rather competative too! There are tons of videos on youtube for this decks combos (the train community is kinda huge at this point lol) so there are plenty of resources to learn to play it!"

And why wouldn't they? It's recursive sport removal, a potential special summon and hand card advantage. Above all, drawing the Fusion Spell's a good thing for once. After countless Red-Eyes Fusions that have been met with an Ash Blossom, this might just be my favorite aspect of the DPE engine.</span>  <span>Don't get me wrong, activating Destiny Fusion after your combo for an additional interruption's coolio but it could be so. much. more.</span>  <span>Presenting:</span>  <span>Magical Musket ft. Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</span>  <span>Besides being what are probably the worst names for high school wannabe rapppers, DPE offers Magical Musket two things: Friendship and Bars. Just kidding, it's synergy and even more going second potential.</span>  <span>The issue with Dark Ruler No More is, if you don't have spot removal, building your board of negates uninterrupted only to then trade with your opponent's board of negates during their own turn during which they can potentially create even more resources doesn't accomplish too much. Yet a deck with spot removal can break an opponent's board and from there outgrind them with ease.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Magical Musket - Cross-Domination"">Magical Musket - Cross-Domination</a></span> <span>and</span> <span><a data-name=""Magical Musket - Desperado"">Magical Musket - Desperado</a></span> <span>allow for easy removal (yes, you can cross dominate a negated monster) while</span> <span><a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a></span><span>,</span> <span><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a></span><span>,</span> <span><a data-name=""Magical Musket - Last Stand"">Magical Musket - Last Stand</a></span> <span>and the aforementioned</span> <span><a data-name=""Magical Musket - Cross Domination"">Magical Musket - Cross Domination</a></span> <span>help ensuring that</span> <span><a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Max"">Magical Musketeer Max</a></span> <span>resolves its effect. <span>Who by the way is probably the most broken Link-1 in the game, only justified by being part of a mediocre archetype. <span><a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a></span> too helps Max resolve while enabling an easy OTK or a strong r4nk for the grind game.</span></span>  <span>Not only does <span><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a></span> allow for an additional spot removal, it also improves the deck's grind game by a lot. You can now easily use your resources on your opponent's turn as you'll draw 3 cards during yours and the free Special Summon off of Dasher allows for an additional body on the field in a deck that can only Normal Summon from hand (I know there's a trap that let's you Special Summon but I'm not playing it so this holds true at least for this decklist).</span>  <span>Everything else in this deck is more or less summarized by going second good stuff:</span>  <span>Some Kaijus because why not.</span>  <span>Droplet and Ruler because they hurt a lot.</span>  <span>Imperm forces a negate,</span>  <span>While Red Reboot tricks your opponent,</span>  <span>So Max can summon more bodies in their face.</span>  <span>See, I told you I'm a rapper. This only gets better. This deck's called DPE Magical Musket and I haven't talked about the latter. (Sorry I'll stop)</span>  <span>I kept the Musket Spells/Traps simple, only playing the good stuff while keeping Dancing Needle in the Side since it's an absolute force against decks like Drytron and Phantom Knight. Caspar and Starfire are the obvious three-ofs while the other ratios are very flexible. Doc, Wild and Calamity are very niche but still enable your Musket Spell/Traps and are good summons off of Max. Kidbrave I play at 2 since it's a pure deck with a lot of names to discard but it does require another card in hand to be useful. </span>  <span>The Extra Deck is one giant toolbox. Ningirsu is non-targetting non-destructive removal, two eXceed can go into Jammer who can then be linked off for Equimax, who'll easily OTK your opponent with DPE in it's zone. Or yknow, just use Accesscode like all the rich kids do. Underworld Goddess since why not, the usual Knightmare, Verte because you can make Verte and a little bit of a r4nk here, a r4nk there.</span>"

After a lot of thought i decided to go for a relatively pure build with Enforcer, simply because Floowandereeze and Shifter can result in a lot of Tenyi build hands unable to really go off. The Swordsoul plays themselves, while more vulnerable under Shifter, still often result in Chi Xiao/Baronne boards and should be sufficient to stop most Flundereeze hands on the first turn by themselves. Enforcer and it's looping destruction is also super handy for the deck as well.  The basic Swordsoul core is in there, with the possible exception of Summit. Some play it, some don't, however having that additional chance of a 3rd/4th monster going 1st with the better hands is too tempting to ignore. Usually going blind 1st I setup Chi Xio, Baronne, and either Omega if they've already tried to handtrap me, to rip an additional card from hand as well as gain deck knowledge, allowing me to have a better idea of where to use my interruptions or Riser due to the vast amount of powerful spell/traps there are. Games 2 and 3 i can change the 3rd monster to whatever is more devastating to that particular deck.  Handtrap wise i went with 2 Ash, 1 Nibiru, 2 Droll and 2 Imperm. The Droll are most effective against Lyrussic Tri and Floowandereeze because i want to try and prevent Barrier Statue from hitting the field. Also Droll is still effective against a lot of other meta decks due to the number of searches they have. If someone has the same idea as me it can also be a crossout target too, as sometimes i need to dig with Desires/Emergence and being droll'd there can make things awkward. Nibiru is mainly a crossout target and is beginning to be mained a lot as well, Ash and Imperm are the generic handtraps that can be used as well as crossout targets if needed.  Not much to be said about the spells. 2 crossout i believe is about right, 3 feels too bricky when you factor in the fusion destiny package. 2 DRNM simply because trying to out things like Statue, Dragoon, Herald and the mirror match can be a headache. The additonal traps are 2 Blackout because I want as many Swordsoul names as possible and extra grinding capability and Imperial Order to prevent opposing DRNM as well as any strategy heavily reliant on spell cards to carry out their plays.  The Extra deck is somewhat standard, perhaps the only thing that is different is the one copy of Dingirsu. The deck has a lot of capability in generating level 8's and also has two that can float. Having additional non targeting removal and an arguably easier way to get to Zeus can sometimes be of great benefit.  The side deck is primarily equipped to anticipate going second. 3 copies of Dimensional Barrier allow me to prevent many decks from being able to play. Shutting down the mirror, the ritial part of Drytron, the Lyrussic part of the Tri-Brigade builds, Fusion strategies, VW Synchros and the XYZ PK plays allows the deck to not be overwhealmed with too many things to try and interrupt.  &nbsp;"

Depending on the starting hand, you can get out a strong Gaia to try to set up a BLS search/summon, search/summon BLS Super Soldier with access to Beginning and Evening Twilight Knights effects, or do a bunch of extra deck summoning. It also has a lot of room to play from the graveyard with Odd-Eyes Advance Dragon and other special summoners and has answers to card effects with Castel, Almiraj, and BLS Soldier of Chaos. The side deck changes the main deck into a ritual-heavy one. This is an all-around fun and pretty useful deck!"
