I loved playing the deck pure during TOSS format, and have overall enjoyed my time with it. Without Harp, the deck was seen as a lost cause to many, and the deck was thought to return with Girsu coming out in the TCG. Girsu is still an incredible card, but harp not being legal doesn’t make it as crazy as people want. I still believe this deck is very fun, and has a resource game unlike many others"

&nbsp;

before i get into anything what i mean by Semi-competitive is the way i will use it. my friends and i like to build old archetype based decks with meta-ish staples. with these decks we make we play a mini-tourny. The winner gets $30 USA dollars. the label is not at all meant to mean it can compete with the meta.

this is like the other red-eyes deck i published. you hope to start with fusion and a few handtraps. go meteor for moderate damage. this deck primarily bases around filling up the board with defenseless beatsticks that are easily summoned. overrun the opponent with all the big mansters. that simple.

The main point of the deck is to use your normal on the Marincess's, use them to load up the grave with the Marincess's you want in there. Afterwards, you use the Frog package, Scryp, etc, to climb up into one of the link-4's, which you use to activate your main card, a archetypal Imperm, from the hand. There's also the Bahamut plus the frogs to get an extra negate on board, plus some bodies. There's also the small Paleo package to strengthen the backrow and add in on the negates and interuption."

It still can keep up with the current meta due to all of the support it gets through out the year.
<ul>
 	<li>Droll &amp; Lock Bird-This card is a counter to a lot of cards in the meta and a great option to have in any deck. Running three of this card helps the deck keep up with many decks in the meta.</li>
 	<li>Forbidden Droplets and Harpie's Feather Duster- Both cards can easily help clear boards. Most Hero monsters in the extra deck have high attack and can easily get over most monsters. Sunrise's effect of destroying a monster on the field when an attack is declared involving a Hero monster becomes more effective with Forbidden Droplets negating monster effects and cutting the attack in half. Harpie's Feather Duster is obviously one of the best ways to clear spells and traps.</li>
 	<li>Fusion Destiny-Good combo piece. If you haven't watched Teamsamuraixi's new Hero Deck profile he shows a combo from just playing Fusion Destiny.
<ol>
 	<li>Use Fusion Destiny to bring out Dangerous by sending Malicious and Shadow Mist to the graveyard.</li>
 	<li> Banish the Malicious in your grave and special summon the Malicious from your deck.</li>
 	<li>Link into Cross Crusader with Dangerous and Malicious then use its effect to bring back Dangerous to the field.</li>
 	<li>Then use Cross Crusader's effect to tribute Dangerous to search Liquid Soldier</li>
 	<li>Normal summon Liquid Soldier and bring back Shadow Mist</li>
 	<li>Use Shadow Mist's effect to add mask change to your hand</li>
 	<li>Link Dread Decimator with Liquid Soldier and Cross Crusader</li>
 	<li>Use Mask change during your opponents turn to bring out Dark Law</li>
 	<li>Using Shadow Mists effect you can search Honest Neos for extra protection for a 2900 Atk due to Dread Decimator's effect.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Evil Hero Engine-This engine is pretty expensive because of Malicious Bane so it's completely optional to run. I have it in the deck because of how much of an impact it has on the field. It can nuke the field and also can't be destroyed by card effects or battle.</li>

Combos Are fairly non-linear but the end board is typically a dark rebellion with a RUM set to go into dark requiem for a pop and three negates, an apollousa for three, and a set fog blade.
<h2>Ratios and Stuff:</h2>
<h3>The Main deck:</h3>
<h4>Monsters:</h4>
3x Torn Scales, a great starter and extender for the deck, being able to dump any PK card as well as revive itself from the graveyard is very good in a deck like this

3x Silent Boots, an extender that also fetches a piece of backrow for your troubles

3x Tour Guide, the best starter in your deck, being able to fetch a graff from deck is really good

3x Kagemucha Knight, is a great extender that can chain block your tour guide so it can;t be ashed

2x Ragged Gloves, you mainly use this to dump either a fog blade or wing to get their graveyard effects to revive a card

2x Ancient Cloak, It can fetch you more cards for extension and that's about it

1x Stained Greaves, this is a fringe extender that can be decent for some combos

2x Graff, it floats into a BA, need i say more

1x Cir, You use this in the combo to revive Cherubini, but I tend to see that it bricks at more than one in this version

1x Scarm, You can use this during the end phase to search another tour guide for more plays the following turn

1x Tsuchinoko, this is just a really good extender

1x Jackalope, Another just good extender

1x Armageddon Knight, honestly not very good in this deck, but it can be used for some fringe combos

3x Ash, just a generically good hantrap, nothing really else to it

3x Belle, This is a meta call, both Drytron and VW rely on the grave, I typically prefer skull meister, but this one's level three so it won't be dead going first
<h4>Spells:</h4>
1x Foolish Burial, a good card to just be able to dump any monster from your deck

1x ROTA, It searches a lot of good cards

1x Called By the Grave, This helps you play around handtraps, I wish this would come back to three

1x Upstart Goblin, This is a placeholder card, you could play whatever over this, I just couldn't think of anything

1x Rank-Up-Magic Force, this lets you go into dark requiem during your opponent's turn, giving you a pop from rusty and three negates
<h4>Traps:</h4>
3x Fog Blade, this is a searchable negate that also can revive cards from the graveyard

1x Wing, this you use only for it's grave effect to revive a card

1x Shade, you use this as a free 4 for some fringe combos with AK
<h3>The Extra Deck:</h3>
2x Break Sword, This card is main use is to be popped by rusty to get two level 4s out to make dark rebellion, but it;s scrap dragon like effect is also good

1x Leviair, This can revive a banished card which comes in handy often

1x Dante, This card is a last resort if you've been interrupted or something and you need more stuff in the grave

1x Dark Rebellion, you use this to rank up into dark requiem

1x Raider's Knight, used for fringe going second arc rebellion combos

1x Dark Requiem, This is three monster negates

1x Arc Rebellion, This is a going second card used to OTK or go into zeus

1x Zeus, a plan B for most situations, but it's a very good plan B

1x Rusty, this dumps a PK and set's a fog blade, as well as popping break sword for the requiem combo

1x Cherubini, This is you main starter, it dumps a level three, that can be a graff, or a scales depending on the combo

1x Apollousa, It's more negates

1x I:P, this can let you go into knightmares on your opponent's turn

1x Unicorn, this can just spin away any card, great catch-all removal

1x phoenix, it's backrow removal
<h2>Some Neat Tech Choices:</h2>
<h3>The Dragoon Engine:</h3>
This deck struggles with the lack of backrow negates, Dragoon can fix this, but it tends to be bricky
<h3>The Utopia Engine:</h3>
The Utopia engine uses utopia double as well as utopia kaiser to let you go into Kali Yuga or VFD using the other RUM, it's just not very consistent and works better in it's own dedicated deck
<h3>The Dogmatika Engine:</h3>
I think that Dogmatika could suppliment the deck nicely, especially since requiem has the ability to revive an XYZ monster after a negate, such as number 38 for a backrow negate, however I find that I don't really know how to make the full value of this engine work, so if a better player can make it work, there are some cool interactions to be had there.
<h3>The Predaplant engine:</h3>
This could be another starter, it gives you 3 level threes for your plays by searching out instant fusion with cobra. I haven't found the space for it, but it seems like more copies of tour guide. Just a thought.

You then proceed to beatdown with a bunch of easily summonable Level 4 / Rank 4 / Link monsters that become much more threatening with the additional ATK.

Dark Doriado makes all non-LIGHT or DARK monsters gain an additional 1000 (1200 if a DARK card is in play).

Magical Abductor searches Dark Doriado or a copy of itself and opens up a Pendulum Summon option.

Link laddering is easy by using Artemis if you don't have a LIGHT monster, then Lyna, then Selene. Lyna can steal an opponent's LIGHT monster from GY to make it even easier to summon Selene. Trick Clown can go into Selene by itself if you use it to summon Artemis, revive it, then use those two to make Lyna, then steal a LIGHT monster.

Fairy Tail Rella can use Bamboo Swords or Wonder Wand to draw more. Awakening of the Possessed combos with Lyna, Selene, FP Lyna and Rella to draw 1. Pre-Prep searches Doriado and its Ritual Spell.

Selene can summon Jowgen the Spiritualist from your hand or GY on the opponent's turn to lock them out of Special Summons. If you trigger Jowgen to destroy Special Summoned monsters while you control Awakening of the Possessed, your Familiar-Possessed monsters will survive destruction. This also goes for Time Wizard of Tomorrow.

Bujintei Tsukuyomi or Dugares the Timeless can be used as a draw extender and then goes into Drill Dozer Vespinato, which benefits from both Awakening of the Possessed and Dark Doriado's ATK gain.

The Dogmatika monsters can freely summon from hand if you turn 1 monster into Artemis or use Instant Fusion, which makes Link Summoning or playing Rank 4s easier.

Artemis and Fairy Tail Rella can be used to manipulate Cursed Bamboo Sword by attaching it and linking away or discarding it to attach another copy to Rella, then search Golden Bamboo Sword. Foolish Burial Goods also triggers it to search Broken or Golden Sword.

In a pinch Bagooska can be useful since it doesn't negate Doriado's effect (it doesn't activate) and your Link monster (Lyna or Selene) is unaffected by it."

While the new support don't change much for metalfoes(the archetype lacks something crucial: a starter card!), the AW package real helps going first or even second. Giving access to a bounce, link arrows or r4nk is really something valuable.

Masterful Sun Mou provides a good way to search for a metalfoes and can co-exist with Baobaboon(As Sun Mou can be pendulum summoned), and honestly, way better than Magician's Soul in a way.

The main issue is drawing too much interaction. Some hands will be belle, ash and punishment.

You like dragons? Got 'em. You like to bet your soul with cursed cards? It'll do that. You want to,"This deck is meant to shift and breathe, giving you a wide breadth of tools to adapt to your opponents on the fly like some sort of terrible Blue-Eyes swiss army knife or a particularly draconic hydra. As soon as they think they have you figured out, you can pivot on a dime and hit 'em with something completely different before they have time to react.

The goal is to let you get creative; it draws consistently well but rarely plays the same way twice—that's the joy of it, in my opinion. Even when I lose with this deck I pretty much always feel good about the duel, and it's versatile enough to hold its own against just about everything I've thrown it at in MR4* casual play. I'm told it's fun to play against, too. It's a puzzle box for everyone on the field, not the sort of deck just out to curb stomp without mercy.

And, as a bonus, it's super cheap.

&nbsp;

So! Let's break this puppy down:

The extra deck is minimal, because if you pull Orichalcos, it'll lock you out of summoning from it. As a result, getting an Azure-Eyes out early is helpful to keep grabbing Blue-Eyes from your graveyard, and once it's initially summoned you can revive it again after Orichalcos is played. Plus, its effect-immunity is triggered by any special summon of it, not just the initial synchro, which can be handy if you find yourself backed into a corner. There aren't many link monsters released as of early 2020 that work well with this deck, but Defender and Decode Talker are nice to have around if you've got the materials to keep making more Azure-Eyes or want the attack bump, and Decode Talker can be handy to tribute opponent's monsters who are causing you trouble.

This deck basically has three kinds of monsters: Blue-Eyes, things that can get you Blue-Eyes, and ritual summons that will just absolutely ruin your opponent's day.

You've got lots of options both for searching your deck for Blue-Eyes, and retrieving it from the graveyard. As a bonus, Melody of Awakening Dragon also lets you snag BE Chaos MAX out of your deck if you want.

The ritual summons are the powerhouse of this deck. If you're playing Master Rule 4, they dance right around the restrictions on summon location, and they come with some extremely solid effects to hamstring whatever nonsense your opponent thinks they're up to on the other side of the table. Pre-Prep can net you the materials for Lord of the Red in one shot, and any Blue-Eyes card is enough to pay the cost—then just rebound it from the graveyard again with whatever retrieval method is easiest at the moment, and chances are that in doing so you'll give yourself a chance to activate one of his effects right out of the gate. Chaos Form takes a little more work, but if you pull it and don't have a matching ritual, chances are high you've got the materials to either pull BE Chaos MAX from your deck or strip it to the GY, and from there just bounce it into your hand with a relevant effect.

BEWD variants tend to be pretty chunky as a baseline, but if you can add extra ATK onto them they become scary fast. You won't want to bulk up your baseline normal-summon BEWDs, since those are the pistons in your engine, but the effect, synchro, and rituals are all fair game. BE Chaos MAX makes god cards look like chumps if you can get her out and boost her effectively, because card effects don't kill her and she does double piercing to defense-position monsters. Power of the Guardians is a reliable way to start stacking ATK, and if you can get Black Dragon Sword out mid- to late-game, she'll just walk right over your opponents for fun. If you're really lucky, you'll have gotten Orichalcos out before her; that'll boost her by another 500 just for giggles, and also protect the weakest card on your field. You see where this is going. BE Chaos MAX in attack position, boosted, is a nightmare to take on in a battle of sheer ATK and card effects don't touch her.

Claw of Hermos into Black Dragon Sword is a great way to give an ATK/DEF boost to just about anything. It can make Maiden even more annoying of a wall, or like we've already touched on, skyrocket BE Chaos MAX's double piercing damage to outright rude proportions once you've gotten a few dragons into your GY.

Obelisk is... just a fun guy. Look at his big ol' arms. Who wouldn't love him?

Maiden is a great stall if you're having trouble getting something you need, since looking at her wrong will grab a Blue-Eyes from pretty much wherever you may have misplaced it. And you can bounce quite a few other cards in the deck off her with a targeted effect if you want to trigger that yourself, too. Both she and your other tuners are there to get BEWD wherever you need it at a given point in time, but can also help recall BE Chaos MAX if it gets offed, or another Blue-Eyes variant with useful effects for the given game state.

You've also got a handful of cards to drop your tribute requirements for BEWD and Obelisk. If you don't want to run Obelisk, swap your two Kaiser Sea Horses out for Keeper of the Shrines for some more GY versatility.

The rest of your deck is dedicated to spell cards, largely ones that help you shuffle around your various dragons to where you need them. Depending on your opponents, and what sorts of decks they're running, you'll want to swap these around a little bit. Most of your control over your opponents should be coming from your monster effects rather than your spells and traps, but this is a good place to cover any gaps you find in your deck (my default build will go down fast and hard to banishings, for instance, because my local crew hasn't been running much offensive banishment lately). Just watch out for adding too much and disrupting the overall balance, because this deck's ability to keep shifting its loadout on the fly is its main strength and if you bog it down you'll find yourself in trouble with no way to keep monsters on the field. The BEWD effect cards are also a good place to swap things in and out to balance as you need.

Beyond that... enjoy!**

&nbsp;

*I built this because I'm a hopeless nostalgic and thought it'd be fun to craft a BEWD deck for Master Rule 4, which could weasel its way around the lack of link monsters that sync well with the archetype.

<ul class=""_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"">
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">New Ritual-based combo deck from Genesis Impact that has a lot of recursion from the Graveyard, boasting a strong grind game as well as potent turn 1 boards that can win the game outright.</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The level 1 Drytron cards tribute other Drytron cards or Ritual cards in hand/field, so this deck abuses Cyber Angel Benten's lack of a once per turn clause to gain a ton of resources and search a lot of power LIGHT Fairy cards, such as Herald of Orange Light and Vanity's Ruler.</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Drytron Nova is an automatic 3-of inclusion in every competitive version of this deck, but also currently sits at around $40 each in NA. Novas are a massive boost in consistency, though the deck is honestly still playable without it, and is quite cheap otherwise. With even one copy of Nova, you should look to also include three copies of Drytron Fafnir (their Field Spell) which can search Nova as well.</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The absence of Nova + Fafnir from the main leaves a lot of space to be filled. There are many ways you can go about this.</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The sample list plays a small Pre-Prep engine with Herald of Perfection. It's very simple to play, especially if you're unfamiliar with the deck, and helps raise your overall ceiling - athough optimized competitive builds have generally moved away from Pre-Prep.</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Another viable Ritual engine is the Megalith engine, which provides numerous options. These variants generally also suffer from consistency issues, made worse by the lack of Novas in the budget version. Less consistent access to Alpha means less consistent usage of extra Ritual monsters.</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">You could play cards that search Drytron monsters in an attempt to patch up consistency. Examples include Where Arf Thou, or normal summons that fetch Drytrons such as Cyber Dragon Core (getting Emergency) and Mathematician. Also viable is Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin, which is an interesting tech in Drytron that helps you beat handtraps like Droll &amp; Lock Bird.</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Finally, you can always just play more handtraps or generic power cards.</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">This deck is a relatively new deck, and is getting support in Lightning Overdrive, which might indicate that it's relatively safe from the next banlist. However, there's no telling what Konami will do, so don't take my word as gospel.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Have you ever wanted to infuriate your opponent using a bunch of frogs, some weird looking insects, a cat looking mannequin and a statue? Well if your answer was yes, then this deck is for you! If not, then......Why are you here?

Jokes aside, it's time for some real talk.
<h1><strong>Deck Description.....</strong></h1>
Here I will describe the deck and talk about the purpose of every card in it, starting with.....

The<span><strong> FROGS: </strong></span><span>First is ""Ronintoadin"" of course this friggin frog doesn't need an introduction, he banishs a frog from the gy to revive itself and it's not opt, which makes it great for extra deck summoning and other things.</span>

Second is ""Swap frog"" this froggy is great for setting up your gy and for providing extra deck material as well, because when it's summoned (normal or special) it allows you to send one aqua type monster from your deck to the gy (not opt) , it's second effect is to return one monster you control to the hand (usually itself) to allow you to normal summon a ""Frog"" monster in addition to your normal summon/set, it's third effect is to discard one water monster to special summon it.

Third is ""Dupe Frog"" this smart boy allows you to search any frog monster from your deck when it's sent from the field to the gy, also while it's on the field your opponent cannot target other monsters for attacks except itself, which means that if you control 2 of  them you basically lock your opponent out of attacks.

These were all the main deck frogs, now to the other main deck monsters.

""Barrier statue of the torrent"" this blue statue prevents both players from special summoning non-water monsters, this doesn't matter much to you since most of your monsters are water, also this monster is involved in the lock this deck was built around.

Now for the Kaijus starting with....

""Gameciel, the sea turtle kaiju"" turtle boi here doesn't need an introduction, all that matters is it's attribute (water) and that it's involved in the aforementioned lock.

""Thunder king, the lightning strike kaiju"" same as gameciel, the only reason it's in here is because ""interrupted kaiju slumber"" is here.

And the last main deck monster is ""Graydle slime jr."" you basically use him to swarm the field, and to special summon ""Dupe Frog"" in case of an emergency.

Now that the main deck monsters are done, let's get to the spells and traps.

""Surface"" basically a monster reborn to your frogs

""Card destruction"" To fill up the gy and getting to your combo pieces.

""Foolish burial"" to send ""Graydle slime jr."" to the gy, so you can use the one in your hand (if you have it).

""Interrupted Kaiju slumber"" nuke the field, summon Kaijus, and search Kaijus need I say more?

""Fury of Kairyu-Shin"" Search ""torrential tribute"" and protect your monsters.

""Moray of greed"" Draw power (can be replaced with ""pot of avarice"" since you might have monsters in the gy that you want in your deck.)

Now on to the traps.....

Let's start it off with the ""Paleozoic"" traps.

""Paleozoic pikaia"" Allows you to discard a ""Paleozoic"" card to draw 2 cards, good for consistency and triggering your ""paleozoic"" cards in the gy.

""Paleozoic canadia"" basically a book of moon in trap form, good for disruption.

""Paleozoic olenoides"" allows you to target and destroy a spell/trap card on the field, non-monster backrow removal is good to have.

""Paleozoic dinomischus"" allows you to discard a card then target and banish one card on the field.

Now for the other traps....

""Storming mirror force"" protects your monsters (since most of them have low attack and they most likely won't run over anything) and Allows you to bounce back your Kaijus.

""Torrential tribute"" destroying all monsters on the field can catch your opponent by surprise.

Now that all of the main deck is over let's move in to the extra deck.

""Paleozoic anomalocaris"" and ""Paleozoic opabinia"" things to summon using your ""Paleozoic"" cards on the field and to search them.

""Toadally awesome"" Omni-negation, ""Frog"" searching, and recovery on death, there is a reason why this unholy abomination is the deck master.

""Number 29: Mannequin cat"" when a monster is special summoned to your opponent's field she allows you to special one monster from your hand, deck or gy with the same attribute as a monster your opponent controls (you summon ""barrier statue of torrent"") she also allows you to detach an xyz material to special summon one monster from your opponent's gy to their side of the field (only use this effect if your opponent has a water monster in their gy or if they have ""Gameciel, the sea turtle kaiju"" on their side of the field.) Needless to say, she is involved in the lock we talked about.

""Mistar boy"" and ""Mermail abyssalacia"" basically serve the same purpose, attack boost and recovery on death.

""Marincess coral anemone"" allows you to special summon a water monster with 1500 or lower attack from your gy

""Salamangreat almiraj"" you use it to send a normal summoned frog to the gy (usually ""swap frog"".) to special summon it, and it protects your monsters from effect destruction, so that's nice to have.

""Paleozoic cambroraster"" something to use your ""Paleozoic"" cards for and to search them.

And that's all of deck, now to the strategies and combos...
<h1><strong>Strategies &amp; Combos....</strong></h1>
Turn 1: Summon ""Swap frog"", send ""Ronintoadin"" to the gy, activate ""Swap frog"" return it the hand, Activate ""Swap frog"" discard a water monster to special summon it, send a ""Frog"" monster to the gy, activate ""Ronintoadin"" banish a ""Frog"" from the gy and special summon ""Ronintoadin"", XYZ summon ""Toadally awesome"", set traps if you have them, then end your turn.

Turn 1 alt: Set, pass.

The lock: Summon ""Number 29: Mannequin cat"", tribute an opponent's monster to summon ""gameciel, the sea turtle kaiju"", activate ""Number 29: mannequin cat"" target ""gameciel"" special summon ""Barrier statue of the torrent"".

And that pretty much sums up everything you need to know.

&nbsp;
<h1>Notes &amp; Afterthoughts</h1>
The side deck isn't really important as this deck is just for fun, and that's why the the side is filled with random water support. You can adjust it however you like.

No one will probably read anything I wrote which makes me ask myself, why did I wasted almost 2 hours of life making this and submitting it? Which in turn depresses me.

Well whatever I hope you enjoy the deck.
<h1>THE END.</h1>

Dinosaur list based on turboing UCT, running some neat value in the extra deck.

1 Terraforming and 3 Lost World. I can't believe I used to cut this card, it might be dead sometimes, but in combination with other dinosaurs the card is nuts. 3 Token Collector, here for the combo - very bad as interaction since Linkross was banned, but I love the explosive potential of the deck. This card + Lost World + any dinosaur is the nuts. But generally the goal of the deck was just to turbo UCT, so most of the time all this is doing is getting to pill + dinos in the GY. Lost World also adds to Dinosaur's built in protection.

Miscellaneosaurus is really good, and a card you want to see rather than search, so it is a pretty obvious 3 of. Oviraptor searchs Tyranno and builds combos, but genterally your goal is to play under Nibiru, so who cares? They're one card starters, I'm running them. Animadorned Archosaur starts your combo so long as you have something to pop, and is an essential combo piece, so it's a 3 of even though you're usually searching it. 2 Pill so that you can usually pop something with it - that's the engine.

Pankratops is an obvious auto-include, I would run 3 of these in going second dinos if I could. Overtex Qoatlus is another spell negate, at its best the deck can still combo off turn 1 to a board full of negates, and this helps make that possible. 3 UCT because in this version you want to see it. I made sure to keep space to run 3 of these, I know you can often search him, but I want to come in under Nib as often as possible. Giant Rex helps make Rank 4 Xyz monsters, while Jurrace Aelo helps make Needlefibre. 3 of each of the babies and 3 searchers helps us to see dinosaur normal summons for Lost World. I also really like ending on an extra Pankratops early, and more Petiteranadon helps do that.

Ash and Nib because Ash and Nib are usually good going second.

Side deck is 3 Gamma and a Driver, for when you really need the power, 3 Dark Ruler No More and 3 Lightning Storm to break boards when you're going second, 2 Evenly Matched to go with the Lightning Storm and Pankratops for Spell + traps, and 3 Imperm because it is Generic and powerful.

No Extravagence because I don't like the card. It is powerful, and I have run it, and I will run it in the future, but I don't like it so this time I'm not running it. That technically makes the deck slightly less powerful, but I'm willing to give up card advantage for full playsets of the cards I want to run. If you were to run this list and have Extravagence you could just add them on top - the consistency you'd lose from having a 43 card deck is more than made up for when you do see those 3 cards.

Extra Deck is Halqifibrax, usually summoning Ash, sometimes using Ash to summon Aeolo. The Fire and Water Charmer are cards you can go into from there - The Water Charmer has a great target in Needlefibre, whereas the Fire Charmer can let you summon and opponent's Ash to go into Halqibifbrax, hopefully getting enough advantage to make a Link 4, usually Accesscode. Selene can be gone into when you make Needlefibre with Ash by making Aeolo into Relinquished Anima, or through other routes by making Archosaur into Anima. You could run Effect Veiler to make this even more efficient, but I wanted Imperm and Nib, and I wanted to run Anima anyways. Linkuriboh, Salamangreat Almiraj, and Secure Gardna help you get monsters into the GY for Pill while making few summons, a super nice emergency button.

This is my very first deck build, so please tell me if something is wrong or I can improve it. I was inspired by this Trif/Yacine video (https://youtu.be/PBz63A_Bx_4) and tried to make a different VFD build based on odd-eyes pendulum support.

This is a very long combo and I want to tell you step by step how you do this combo. Of course, this combo has vulnerabilities: it is not Nibiru-proven and Droll &amp; Lock maybe make you cry... But I still think it's a very good alternative to play using our lovely odd-eyes monsters.

<em>Edit1: I forgot the Elpy effect so in this first version I would not be able to summon Apex. I changed the Elpy target from Sloth to Persona. I still have one Extra-Deck negate if I need to and I can negate Elpy's effect and summon Apex on the End Phase. I think it's still a good combo. I will explore more variants later...
</em>

<strong><span>Combo</span></strong>

The main combo starts having Pendulum Call, Darkwurm, and Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon in your hand. Let's go to the recipe:

1- You activate pend call, send darkwurm to GY and get Harmonizing and Nobledragon.

2- Special Summon darkwurm and get Gate Zero.

3- Normal Summon Nobledragon and link summon Halqi.

4- Special Summon the Winged-beast tuner which you prefer (I use Windmaster)

5- Link Summon Simorgh

6- Adjust your pendulum scales using Arc Pendulum and Gate Zero.

7- Pendulum Summon Nobledragon, Darkwurm and Harmonizing.

8- By harmonizing bring Stargazer Magician

9- Synchro Summon Meteorburst and activate it's effect summoning Gate Zero from the scale.

10- Activate Gate zero effect, target and destroy meteorburst. You will Special Summon Darkfire here.

11- Chain Link 1: Arc Pendulum Dragon | Chain Link 2: Gate Zero

12- Gate Zero comes back to the scale and you special summon Odd-Eyes Synchron by Arc's effect.

13- Now you just make two synchro 9 monsters using harmonizing and stargazer and using odd-eyes synchron and gate zero (by synchron's effect)

14- Go for VFD :)

15- Link Summon Elpy using the Darkfire to Elpy and bring Odd-Eyes Persona.

16- Negate Elpy's effect using Persona (to be able to summon Apex).

16- End Phase: Bring Apex to your field.

That's it. Now you have the VFD, one omni negate, and one extra-deck monster negate.

This is the main combo explanation, and for this One of the starters will be Starliege Seyfert, and the 2 extenders will be Noctovision Dragon and World Legacy Guardragon. The starting hand will consist of the 3 cards mentioned above, and 2 random cards. First, normal summon Seyfert, then use his effect to send himself to the graveyard to add Black Dragon Collaserpent. Then use the effect of Black Dragon to banish Seyfert and summon it. Link Black Dragon for Striker Dragon, chain noctovision's summon, and add White Dragon Wyverburster and Boot Sector Launch to the hand. Banish Black Dragon to Summon White Dragon and then link the 2 (White Dragon and Striker) into Dragunity Knight Romulus, and search Dragon Ravine. Everything up until this point should be standard dragon link plays. Use and activate Dragon Ravine and discard 1 random card to put Absorouter into the grave, adding a Rokket (search Rokket Tracer) monster to the hand. Then swap the field spells for Boot Sector Launch and summon Rokket Tracer from the hand. Then, link Rokket Tracer and noctovision into Crystron Halqifibrax. Draw 1 card from noctovision and summon Rokket Synchron From the deck as your tuner. Link the Romulus and Halqifibrax into either Apollousa or Unchained Abomination. (Going first make Apollousa, going second make Unchained) Link Rokket Synchron into Elpy and put him on the right-most zone Abomination or Apollousa points to. Activate Elpy's effect and summon Armed Dragon Thunder LV5 fom the deck. Activate Armed Dragon Thunder LV5 and discard a monster (Hopefully you have one in hand from your starting hand or Drew one off of Noctovision) Summon Armed Dragon LV7 from the deck and add Tempest from Armed Dragon LV5, because you can add a level 5 or higher wind dragon if it is sent to the grave to activate a dragon monster's effect. (Literally his own effect) Discard Tempest to activate LV7 and summon LV10 from the deck. Then using World Legacy Guardragon, revive a dragon from grave, and then link it into Pisty and then revive tracer from grave. Banish 2 dragons from grave to summon Tempest from grave, then banish Tempest,(Dont forget to add Crusadia Draco to hand when Tempest is banished) Pisty and Elpy, and summon Trishula from the extra deck. Activate Trishula and banish Dragondark to add Thunder Dragonhawk. Discard Dragonhawk to summon Dragondark from the banished. Summon Crocodragon (using Rokket Tracer and Thunder Dragondark) from the extra deck and draw 1 card. Then XYZ summon VFD (True King of all Calamities) using Trishula and Crocodragon. If you drew into Quick Launch, Monster Reborn or World Legacy Succession off of Crocodragon then you can revive tracer and pop Boot Sector Launch to summon a Rokket from the deck and then synchro summon Borreload Savage Dragon, and equip Halqifibrax from the graveyard for some negates. (Make sure to put your VFD and Savage into defense to counter Lighning Storm) Overall, I wanted to bring something new and interesting to the table, I hope you guys like it. Feedback is always appreciated.

Combo 2: 1 starter, 1 extender

Pretty much go through the exact same combo as shown above, except summon Omni Dragon Brotaur from Elpy instead. Then discard and target itself and add Chaos Dragon Levianeer, link Brotaur into Pisty. Summon Levianeer by banishing 3 dark monsters from the grave, (including Tracer) then summon Tracer back off of Pisty's effect. Then Banish Levianeer, and the 2 Guardragons to summon Trishula and banish Thunder Dragondark to add Thunder Dragonhawk. Discard Dragonhawk to summon Dragondark from the banished. Then do the same thing of synchro summoning crocodragon and hopefully draw into either Quick Launch or a revival spell for the additional Borreload Savage. Lastly, overlay into VFD for the icing on the cake and pass turn. (Make sure to put your VFD and Savage into defense to counter Lighning Storm)"

The new support monster <strong>Lu Feng </strong>(and not <strong>A man's honor</strong> that card is<strong> garbage</strong> ) helps with the problems of Ancient Warriors a lot and gives the deck a little bit more consistency and power.

<strong>The tech cards I decided to play: </strong>This deck is a pure second going deck, so I run three copies of <strong>Gnomaterial.</strong> Not only is this card a very good hand trap right now, it also fits perfectly with decks like Ancient Warriors which go blindly second. You want your opponent to build a board with some monsters, but an useless board which is easy to break and <strong>Gnomaterial</strong> makes sure it does that.  Next up I decided to run three copies of <strong>Foolish Burial Goods.</strong> When you usually look up for some Ancient Warriors deck profile, you will never see that card to show up. And I don't understand why. That card lets you dump <strong>Borrowing Arrows</strong>  or <strong>Metalfoes Fusion</strong> to the GY. <strong>Borrowing Arrows</strong> is a very important card because it searches out your best continous spell card in your deck and that is <strong>Three Visits</strong>. But if you already got the <strong>Three Visits</strong> on the field, just search out <strong>East-By-South-Winds </strong>so <strong>Double Dragon Lords</strong> doesn't have to do it and instead can search out a monster. I also decided to run <strong>Metalfoes Fusion </strong>because if you draw  <strong>Goods</strong> and <strong>Arrows</strong> that one card becomes useless in your hand so running that single copy of <strong>Metalfoes Fusion</strong> not only makes <strong>Goods</strong> more useful , but also boosts your consistency. <strong>Borrowing of Arrows and Metalfoes Fusion </strong>can both be send from the hand or field to the GY as a cost for your Ancient Warrior monster effects, so why would  you not play it?

The reason why I decided to run <strong>Desires </strong>instead of Extravagence or Prosperity is because they cost a whole lotta money and it doesn't lock you out at drawing cards for the rest of the turn. If I run Extravagence in my deck, I can't use the second effect of Liu Xuan (tho you most likely use him as link material), the metalfoes fusion and the upstart goblin. <strong>NO SYNERGY. </strong>Also you don't really care about the resources you banished with desires, tho banishing your win conditions like <strong>East-By-South-Winds </strong>can suck.

I also run a single copy of <strong>Cao De.</strong> I see a lot of decks cutting him out and I kinda see why because he is a win more card. But one of the main reason I run him is because of <strong>Lu Feng</strong>. He is much easier to summon now, because you actually have a way to pop one of your opponents cards ( not including mst or feather duster because they arent searchable..). Also I feel like he is the heart and spirit of the deck and probably my favorite monster and he is big beefy and chunky so run him at one copy.

A lot of people cut out <strong>Lu Jing</strong> aswell, but in this deck, it is very easy to have at least one Ancient Warrior spell in your GY because of <strong>Goods.</strong> To control two Ancient Warriors with different Attributs is very easy, you just need to control him and a <strong>Guan Yun</strong> or a <strong>Lu Feng</strong>. Both easy and free special summons. His second effect is actually not as garbage as the one from <strong>Zhou Gong, as he can pop one of your opponents spell/trap card going +1.</strong> But <strong>Sun Mou</strong> has the best effect among all of them, because he searches a monster and bounces a monster your opponent controls.

<strong>How to play this deck?</strong>

One of the most common plays I do is I summon<strong> Guan Yun</strong> and pop one monster my opponent controls. Then I can normal summon <strong>Sun Mou</strong> and search out<strong> Lu Feng. </strong>After that I summon <strong>Lu Feng</strong>, pop and <strong>Sun Mou</strong> will bounce one card. Then I use <strong>Guan Yun</strong> and <strong>Sun Mou</strong> as link material for <strong>Double Dragon Lords</strong> and search out <strong>East-By-South-Winds.</strong> Then I bounce one card <strong>again</strong> and send <strong>East-By-South-Winds </strong>to the GY. Now my opponent cannot respond for the rest of the turn whatever I try to do and pop one card (non-targetting effect) as soon as I declare an attack. That also means they can't activate cards like mirror force or any of them annoying battle traps.

With that being said, thanks for listening and I hope you enjoyed my deck list

Edit: Refreshed the deck list a bit. Playing now a total of 6 handtraps and decided to play <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> instead of <strong>Ghost belle</strong>. If you can afford <strong>Infinite Impermance</strong>, go ahead and buy 3 of them thangs...

The main idea is to turbo out the links while using N'tss, Golden Lord, and the spells to interupt and clear the opponent's board. This allows you to build a way bigger board than normal Striker variants allow. Dogmatika has a good amount of synergy with the deck, as you can easily get their bodies on the field and dump extra deck monsters, although their restrictions mean you have to change the usual Striker gameplan somewhat. Eldlich allows you to beef up the regular backrow tremendously, and get another body on field along with clearing the opponent's board. Eldlich also allows you to easily reccur resources, making the grind game of Striker easier.
Any suggestions would be appreciated. Have a good day."

There is always space for changes.,"Try to bring Supreme King Gate Zero and Gate Infinity at the start to summon big monsters in first turn. If you couldn’t bring gate infinity during the first turns, better go for another pendulum because of it’s effect. If you need an emergency pendulum summon, you will probably need monsters with high pendulum scales but what if you have low scales and it needs to be done? DO IT. After this.

SO I will be uploading exclusive deck profiles and replays on my discord server, this is also where I upload what is going to be my next deck and things like that.  (lets try and get 50 people ASAP).

The only downside to deck is drawing desires with desires even tho u play 2 desires, IT STILL HAPPENS. Constructive Feedback is always advised, for the next deck you will get to choose on a poll on my twitter. I am OrcustPlaya on there.

After using it for a minute (and watching more of Pend God's videos) I made a few adjust,"For the most part I'm still using the same standard Endymion/Mythical Beast combos, however I increased Cerberus from 1 to 2, since it is a free way to get Jackal King/Garuda in my hand, and he's also a nice target for Magicians' Souls going second so that I decrease my chances of drawing into him and bricking (sometimes, when I already have a scale that I can't readily pop), and also for Selene to bring back so I can banish one of my opponents monsters.

I used to have 2 of Purple Poison and 1 Black Fang Magician, as well as 1 Allure of Darkness for those darks, but they were just really bad to have if I wanted to combo off and go into a full board of negates, as I would usually want to save my normal summon for Blue Boy for the spellbook engine, and also it just seemed really dumb to pendulum summon them out to link into crowley if I didn't already have Jackal King/Mighty Master in hand, as I would just use the spellbook engine to draw into my negate cards then with no way to summon them out.

Instead, I put in 2 of Magician's Restage and 1 Foolish Burial. This has turned out to be a pretty solid way to rack up spell counters while also adding more monsters to my field for link materials and drawing more cards. Here are some examples (its entirely possible this is just common knowledge for Endymion players but I am also fairly new to playing Yugioh):

1: If I had practically no pendulum monsters/search cards in hand, but I had 1 Restage and Foolish Burial, I would use foolish burial to send a Magicians' Souls to the GY, then Restage to bring it back and then use Souls to pop Restage/ (sometimes Institution too depending on my spell counters) to then draw more cards. This is really my main use for Foolish Burial, but I will also sometimes use it to send Reflection or Cerberus to the GY as a target for Selene, depending on whether I go first or second, if I don't have Magicians' Souls in hand to do this. If I do have one of my starters, then again this is also a really good way for me to rack up a ton of counters to search/special summon.

2: If my starting hand had Spellbook of Knowledge and no blue boy or secrets, but I had either Magicians' Souls or Jester Confit--preferably Souls--as well as a Restage (or if I draw into Restage with Knowledge instead of like Servant/Reflection/Abductor/Spell power mastery to start my combo) then I would use restage to bring back it back (and then send less helpful spells to the GY to draw more if its Souls).

3: If I have Souls and Restage in hand, then I activate souls, then Link 1 into Artemis, then Restage to bring back Souls, pop Restage to Draw 1, and then Link 2 into Crowley to run my spellbook engine.

There's probably more combos, but these are just the main ones I tend to use. Again, with all of these examples, assuming the worst: I am unable to scale anything and therefore I am not racking up counters, but with all my draws I will almost always get a starter and enough spells to get its counters, but if I am to scale even just one thing, then I can just get counters for days.

Also, Restage is generally just a good target for my Mighty Master to destroy whenever I want to pop him from my high scale on turn 1. I normally target Citadel if I have it out, so that I can use Citadel's effect to avoid destruction, but then Mighty Master won't get his counter for additional protection (occasionally I will also target Mythical Institution if I feel like I don't need it).

For my extra deck, I replaced Abyss Dweller with Bagooska since Bagooska seems like a more general way to negate monster effects (although I did side Dweller for me to switch out with Bagooska depending on the match up).

I replaced Geonator Transverser with Apollousa. Transverser was really just in there as a potential out to Dragoon, but I almost never used it to do that. In fact, I pretty consistently have been able to out Dragoon with Accesscode, so it made more sense to free up a space for Apollousa to get more potential negates, although I usually will end my turn with Selene out and Reflection in my hand/the GY so that I can bounce back a potentially bad extra deck summon/normal summon (and then I'll also keep an extra space for me to use Garuda to bounce back another similar summon if I can't use it to MST a facedown or an annoying continuous spell/trap. I still need to find a way to work Apollousa into my combos without removing my other negates.

Lastly I took out Thousand-Eyes Restrict, since Millennium-Eyes just felt like a better target for my Instant Fusion to its ability to chain onto a monsters effect and grab it for myself (especially the ones that ""Can't be destroyed by card effects""), and I replaced it with Day-Breaker, for its ability to pop spells/traps, free up my scales, and also to get some more counters for my negates to use. I toyed around with using Saryuja instead to fix bad hands, but usually, by the time I have enough cards out to use his draw 4 effect, I would have already played most of my hand, so I would be removing 4 monsters from my field to draw one card, this being after I had already pendulum summoned/normal summoned.

When I'm siding out, I will usually take out 1 Cerberus, 1 Jester Confit, and 1 Restage. If I need to side out more than 3, I will then side out 1 Blue Boy and 1 Secrets, and I normally don't side out more than 5 cards, but also I might just not know how to side deck (please keep in mind that I have just been playing for a little more than a month at this point). Of course, it goes without saying that I'm interested in hearing any differing opinions you guys might have regarding side deck decisions or card ratios, since I am also posting this in part to get some feedback to improve my deckbuilding. Thanks!"

","Ignore the side deck I was testing some stuff and didn't get rid of it

UPDATE: Ignore the part where I said you need two dark for anaconda I forgot it was only 2 effect monsters also I  linked the video.

This is a deck I use against my two friends that I play with. They play Shaddols, Mathmech, and Heros so my deck is based around fighting them, but more so with fighting Heros and Mathmech since I struggle with fighting them the most, at least the version my friend plays. Also I'm new to writing plays and combos and with posting decks and I am honestly not the best with making decks in general so bear with me who ever is reading this. Also I feel like this deck I made can be meta but since I am inexperience I tagged it non-meta and would like other peoples opinions on what they think. All tips and ideas are welcome if you have anyway I can improve my deck I am more than welcome to hear also if anyone has any ideas for a good side deck to add please let me know. Also I am using cards that I own in real life so I am going for a more budget deck since there is no way I can afford 3 copies of lighting storm. I also have a 60 card version which was the first deck I made and then updated to this.

This is if you are going first. Now you have a few things you can do depending on what you have in hand, If you are able to get tracer on the field and use its effect at the end to pop dragon ravine to summon another level 4 dragon you can have enough resources to end on a <strong>anaconda</strong>, <strong>winda</strong>, <strong>dingi</strong>, and <strong>savage</strong>. You need spiral dragon, romulus, tracer, 1 level 4 dragon, and two other dragons one must be dark to go into anaconda. If you cant get enough resources you should still be able to end on <strong>winda</strong>, <strong>dingi,</strong> and <strong>anaconda</strong> for a <strong>winda lock</strong>.

First thing is to go into striker to search boot sector

Then use an extender and go into romulus

Use boot sector to summon 1 or 2 rokkets rokkets

use extender if possible to summon another dragon like monster reborn

Link romulus and one the other dragons on the field into anaconda

Use dragon ravine to send one card from hand to graveyard to send spiral dragon to graveyard, use its effect to summon itself

If you have enough resources at this point use tracer and on level four to go into savage and equip the romulus in the graveyard

Then use spiral effect to change other monster to a level 8 and rank up into dingi

Use anaconda effect and target insta fusion summon winda

Go to end phase and use dingi effect to keep winda on field on opponents turn

Hope this isn't too confusing to understand, might link a video later of me doing some test hands and combos.

Especially when we already have an archetype based on EARTH Warrior's, am I referencing Gouki? I could have, but no, I'm thinking of an archetype that's older, Amazoness.

Amazoness was already a powerful deck based around Amazoness Queen and then later Amazoness Empress. However, they also fell short to what they can give at the table as spamming the field was difficult. Even with cards like Amazoness Spy and Amazoness Baby Tiger, it was missing something.

That's where War Rocks come in, most of them are indeed outdated and they are considered the Internet Explorer archetype since they came a little too late for their time period. However, Amazoness benefited off this new archetype, how? Maybe Gactos? Well, with Gactos around it did made it easier for Amazoness to spam the board and make Rank 4 plays off Swords Woman and Gactos being that they are both Level 4, but what's interesting is not only Gactos, but Amazoness also got a beneficial replacement Field Spell out of War Rock Mountain compared to their older in-archetype Village Field Spell which was not enough of a Field Spell to even consider running it as Village did absolutely nothing, however Mountain not only searches Gactos, but also protects ALL of your Warriors, not just War Rock. Its also the best dummy spell you could give to your opponent through Set Rotation while giving yourself something like Mystic Mine since it'd do absolutely nothing for your opponent (unless they played War Rock)  This being said, is this enough to consider running a War Rock engine?

Well...yes? There's also one other card that is in my new Amazoness build, because if you haven't noticed, I'm also using an easily accessible War Rock Skyler. But why Skylar? Well, its true you're not going to use her effect too much as it kind of sucks (but I guess if you wanted to revive a Amazoness Queen or similar then you could) But the biggest thing about Skyler is not only that she is spammable by both Gactos and Mountain, but she's a Level 6. Guess who else is a Level 6 that is also easily spammable by Amazoness Princess, oh right, Amazoness Queen. So not only does War Rock provide extra searches, protection, and Rank 4 plays, but they also grant Rank 6 plays as well. Which is why Photon Strike Bounzer is in the Extra.

With all of this in mind, I've based my new Amazoness build around the War Rock engine, and also added a few techs here and there like Mystic Mine, Set Rotation, Fusion Recycling Plant, and etc. that allows Amazoness to be at their best possible to not only spam the field, but still be able to control the field through various effects. At the same time, this is the closest thing right now where Amazoness can actually have a presence with Rank 4's and 6's and have access to a larger Extra Deck pool. Because Amazoness really needed another powerful Level 4 and also be more consistent. So even though it wasn't a new in-archetype card that helped, I can say that Gactos, Mountain, and possibly Skyler was good enough to at least give Amazoness more playability.

Keep in mind, this is my first time here, and also first post, but also wanted to share what I had on my mind recently and hopefully you'll enjoy this deck profile as much as I've had recently."
