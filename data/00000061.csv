This format is compatible for 2-4 players.<br /><br />This deck built from the Atlantean and Mermail archetypes is a starting point to understand the format and should not be considered competitive-focused. It primarily focuses on bringing out your XYZ monsters and swarming the field with monsters while also recycling them to your deck and hand, often with high risk, high reward tactics. Worldsea Dragon Zealantis is the avacard.<br /><br />More information, including a link to the rulebook for the format, is forthcoming.</p>"
