This format is compatible for 2-4 players.<br /><br />This deck built from the Atlantean and Mermail archetypes is a starting point to understand the format and should not be considered competitive-focused. It primarily focuses on bringing out your XYZ monsters and swarming the field with monsters while also recycling them to your deck and hand, often with high risk, high reward tactics. Worldsea Dragon Zealantis is the avacard.<br /><br />More information, including a link to the rulebook for the format, is forthcoming.</p>"

These water attribute robots get a consistency powerboost in the form of 5 cards - Inclusion, Cluster, Suldafor, Tristaros and Eleskeletus Crystron surprisingly goes toe to toe with top decks like Blue-Eyes, Branded and Fiendsmith variants and can grind them out in an extended duel. The deck is now consistent enough to jam in about 20 staples, it has a ton of inherent gas, and by nature of how Crystrons combo many common handtraps don't effect them much. They can weave and make plays through powerful lingering handtraps like Shifter, Mulcharmies Droll and Nibiru - and of course, minor handtraps like Veiler, Ash Blossom and Imperm get shrugged off.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The Horus engine also grants Crystron extra plays, protection and beatsticks as well, giving them a significant buff!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Crystron is a difficult deck to play because of all the combo lines for each sort of gamestate, so it rewards a highly skilled pilot. If you're looking for a powerful midrange deck that catches duelists off-guard on ladder with weird combo lines, I highly recommend playing Crystron!<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong data-olk-copy-source=""MailCompose"">ARCHETYPES AND DECKBUILDING</strong></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>CRYSTRON</strong>&nbsp;cards form the foundation of this deck, and it is a strategy that turbos out tuners that enable it to make quick-synchro plays during your opponent's turn. The Crystron deck core is fairly compact, consisting of 17 cards.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The 3-ofs in the deck are Inclusion (searches any Crystron card) and Smiger (searches spell/trap, basically Inclusion) since they are both 1-card combos that get you your full board and GY set-up. Sulfefnir is a 3-of as well since it is a important combo piece that replaces itself (just like Kashtira Fenrir)!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">2-of Tristaros are used since it is the key piece of the deck which allows synchro summoning during your opponent's turn, and can summon 2 Crystrons at once from your deck. It is this deck's best normal summon, since if your opponent does something, it can react to it to immediately and synchro summon. This number can be bumped up to 3 if you like extra consistency. Sulfador is used at 2 as well since it's a double foolish burial! It's a highly searchable combo piece, but two is needed for an extended grind game.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">1-of of Prasiortle (extender that summons from hand) and Thystvern (searches monster) are used since they are highly searchable combo pieces, each with a certain specific use in different situations. 1 Cluster is used as this deck's ace trap card interruption, able to destroy an opponent's card by shuffling back Crystron cards from the GY or Banishment - giving the strategy potentially infinite grindgame!&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">A tiny <strong>HORUS </strong>package of 5 cards. It makes the deck more powerful because it boosts consistency (The Zombie Vampire), provides protection (Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord). The Horus monsters are fairly powerful themselves, bulldozing most threats off the board during the battlephase, especially with King Sarcophagus' removal.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">This Crystron decklist has 17<strong>&nbsp;STAPLE </strong>cards! The standard ""Maxx C"" package is included as well as Crossout and it's targets. 1 Foolish Burial is added for consistency.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">In terms of interruption, the board that Crystron sets up is relatively straightforward. It ends on 1 targeted pop with Cluster, 1-2 spell/trap negates with F.A. Dawn Dragster and potentially triple monster banish from field/GY with Quariongandrax. Some hands can pivot into Cyber Dragon Infinity's omni-negate.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Regarding execution of the Crystron strategy, it's fairly difficult&nbsp;to sequence interruption properly, especially if your opponent doesn't play into it. Crystron's gimmick is all about quick-synchroing during your opponent's turn, and those actions are only available during your opponent's Main Phase or Battle Phase. If you don't have proper synchro materials on-board or in GY, the quick synchros won't work, especially Quariongandrax which specifically requires two tuners.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">That being said, if you get handtrapped, you can generally still end on Cluster's targeted destruction and sit on your handtraps. Next turn, you can attempt to combo again with your set-up GY/Banishment.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Here a regular 1 card opening for Crystron:&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Inclusion = Double F.A Dawn Dragster (x2 S/T negate), Crystron Quariongandrax (triple monster banish in-field/GY), Crystron Cluster (targeted pop), + follow-up for next turn.&nbsp;</div><ol style=""text-align: left; flex-direction: column; display: flex;"" start=""1"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_1997""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Inclusion to search for Sulfador.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Sulfador targeting Inclusion to destroy it.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">On-summon, Sulfador sends to the GY Cluster and Thystvern.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Banish Thystvern in the GY to search for Tristallos.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Normal Summon Tristaros.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Synchro summon Eleskeletus using Tristaros + Sulfador.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">On-summon, Eleskeletus recovers Cluster from the GY.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Banish Tristaros from the GY to destroy Eleskeletus and summon Sulfefnir and Rosenix.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Eleskeletus' trigger effect when destroyed to summon Tristaros from Banishment.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Rosenix's effect to targeting Sulfefnir to destroy it and summon Citree from deck.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Sulfefnir's effect to summon another Sulfefnir from deck.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Synchro summon F.A Dawn Dragster using Citree + Sulfefnir.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Banish Inclusion from the GY to summon Citree from the GY.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">During your opponent's Main/Battle Phase, activate Citree to summon Sulfefnir from the GY to synchro summon a second F.A Dawn Dragster using Citree + Sulfefnir.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">During your opponent's Main/Battle Phase, activate Cluster to target destroy 1 card your opponent controls by shuffling back Citree from Banishment.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">During your opponent Main/Battle Phase, activate Tristaros summoning Citree from deck to synchro summon Quariongandrax using Tristaros + Citree + level 5 F.A.

Learning to properly sequence your interruptions, especially in the heat of the moment is difficult, so practice a lot!

The strength of Crystron comes from resilience through interruption and a robust grindgame. If you can force out a grindgame from your opponent with full Crystron set-up you have a high chance of winning.&nbsp;</div></li></ul><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

All of the other threats that the deck suffers from are still present in some way. The deck is still quite susceptible to interruptions like Ash, Imperm, Veiler, Belle, Impulse, Purge, the list goes on. That's why our non-engine cards are meant to help break boards (Super Poly &amp; Fenrir) OR stop those hand traps. You might think that we could just run 12 hand traps/staples, but Ursarctic's inconsistency and neediness for other cards (there's no 1 card combos) makes this kind of weird non-engine, in my opinion, kind of necessary.</p><h2 id=""mcetoc_1itbrko4r9l"">Tips</h2><ul><li>Use your Ursarctic cards&nbsp;<em>first&nbsp;</em>if you have any of the necessary pieces to start the basic Mitsurugi combo. The Mitsurugi engine is much stronger, and baiting out common hand traps with the Ursarctic engine can allow you to give you some sort of board to work with.</li><li>Activate Mitsurugi Prayers during your Draw Phase in order to play around Droll - just a little, anyway.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have a Habakiri, Mitsurugi Ritual, and an Ursarctic in hand, you can Tribute the Habakiri to add Murakumo - this can allow you to access Futsu.</li><li>Use Habakiri's effect to Special Summon (ideally Saji or Aramasa) BEFORE you Tribute it with an Ursarctic monster.</li><li>If you have nothing good to add to your hand off of your Mitsurugi cards, add Habakiri. It's a great tribute and can be used as discard fodder for some of your other cards if need be.</li><li>If you have a Level 4 Mitsurugi monster, a Level 7 Ursarctic, and also a Level 8 Ursarctic Tuner, Synchro Summon Crimson Dragon first, add Synchro Rumble, then revive your Ursarctic Tuner. If you control Crimson Dragon, avoid going into your Ursarctic Synchros unless absolutely necessary. Opt for a Synchro 9 so you can Special Summon Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss.&nbsp;</li><li>Shenshen is TERRIBLE unless you're playing against Mitsurugi or pretty much almost any other deck. Don't risk a bad Maliss matchup and opt for Wolfrayet (if you know what they're playing and it isn't Maliss then just opt for Shenshen)</li><li>Special Summon Fenrir before you do anything else. He's the best bait and utility card we have in the deck.</li><li>Avoid using Droll while your Mitsurugi cards are still live. If you don't want them to access certain cards, you have tools to stop that.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Tech Options</h2><ul><li>Azamina Engine - A 6-card engine I&nbsp;<em>heavily</em> considered and tried out.

When you have two monsters on the field, Link Summon Azalea with these two as materials and pop anything but Azalea. If you have more, use materials and pop in a way that Taotie would point to empty spaces.</p><p>2) When you have destroyed something with Azalea, you can trigger Chronograph, which lets you bring forth itself and Director. There, you can Synchro Summon Z-ARC with Chronograph + Director.</p><p>3) Replace Z-ARC with Arcray and Link Summon Taotie with Azalea + Arcray.</p><p>4) With Chronograph + Z-ARC + Arcray remaining steady at Extra Deck, set Smile + Simochi and end your turn. When it's your opponent's turn, activate Smile and chain into Simochi. By Special Summoning Chronograph + Z-ARC + Arcray with Smile, your opponent would gain LP. However, Simochi converts it into 2000 + 4000 + 4000 = 10000 damage and kills the opponent on the spot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Magicians' Souls"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Trade-In"" can be collected by purchasing ""Origin of the Galaxy"" deck. 90 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Summoner Monk"" can be found within ""True Awakening of the Oathbound Knights"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Chicken Game"" can be found within ""The Most Dangerous Race of the Cosmos!"" Secret Pack to save 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Upstart Goblin"" can be found within ""Bonkers Bikers' Wild Wheels"" Secret Pack to save 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Pseudo Space"" can be found within ""Cyber City Guardians"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Performapal Monkeyboard"" can be found within ""The Bizarre Playing Board"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Taotie Dragon"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Sky Striker Ace - Azalea"" can be found within ""Sky Striker Awakening"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Chronograph Sorcerer"" + ""Supreme King Z-ARC - Synchro Universe"" + ""Odd-Eyes Arcray Dragon"" can be found within ""Counterswing Mages"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 360 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

If it either was a Level 1 monster, or it was a searcher for Mimighoul Spell/Trap cards as well, it would be an amazing card for the archetype, but the fact that it is neither of those makes it harder to use, hence why everyone runs it at 1 copy (imagine a monster that searches on summon being a soft garnet lol). I even wonder if there is a world where you could play Mimighoul without Master. Also, be aware that <a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=40366667"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/40366667.jpg"" data-card=""40366667"" data-name=""Dominus Impulse"">Dominus Impulse</span></a> completely shuts down the Mimighoul effects for the entire duel, I got lucky and didn't have to deal with it though.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the deck. I also attached a video where you can see some nice duels I had, even though it doesn't really showcase the standard Mimighoul combos (you can probably find other videos that explain those though).

I've tried a lot of different decks I've seen posted and a lot of them have been really fun, but this behemoth of a deck is the most fun I've had since I got back into Yu-Gi-Oh.&nbsp;<br /><br />This 60 card beast of a deck was partially inspired by KingMahde and RoyalGamesYT. KingMahde gave me the idea that maybe a 60 card DM deck isn't that bad and RoyalGamesYT gave me the idea of adding Fiendsmith.<br /><br />Playing this deck is a little more advanced that just playing Primite Dark Magician, but honestly it's not super complicated at all. I'll list some key points I've noticed while playing this deck.</p><ul><li>Not every hand will allow you to open with a floodgate/boss monster, but it is a lot more consistent now than it has ever been for Dark Magician decks.</li><li>Opening with ensuring you can get Dragoon out either Turn 1 or at the draw phase of Turn 2 with Gaze is going to be your main objective.<ul><li>If you cannot open with Dragoon, try and just get either fiendsmith, primite, negates, or a strong link monster out.</li></ul></li><li>Make sure you do not use Gaze of Timaeus during your turn unless you can dodge the banish effect at the end of the next turn.<ul><li>For example: fusion summoning with Gaze, then immediately getting it off the board for something else (possibly bringing it back in the same turn). You could also use I:P Masquerena to link it during your opponents turn to dodge the banish.</li></ul></li><li>Do not flood your spell &amp; trap zones. It is really easy with this deck to set out multiple continuous/face down spells &amp; traps. Be careful not to overdo it so you can still use something if needed.</li></ul><p>While this deck may not be a meta killer, it can definitely put up a good fight against some good decks. There are better combinations (like Diabell and snake eyes) that are more competitive, but if that's not your thing I would recommend giving this deck a try and see what combos you can pull off. If you do try this deck, let me know what you think or if you would maybe swap a card in/out.</p>"

Both these lines go into Backfire, adding Dark Calling. You would then use Cross Sheep to revive a card of your choice. With the right extenders, you can make Appo, Verte &gt; DPE, Dragostapelia and potentially more.

This isn't just a deck; it's a forbidden concerto where fallen angels serenade divine melodies, and the chaos of the Lightsworn fuels the abyssal depths of the Tearlaments. Unleash the Darklords to dominate the field with their immense ATK and LP-recovering effects, endlessly recycling powerful spell and trap cards. Then, witness the angelic might of the Melodious monsters, whose harmonious calls flood your board, setting the stage for devastating fusions and synchros. The unpredictable Lightsworn engine will mill your deck at blinding speeds, populating your graveyard with essential resources while occasionally summoning powerful monsters like Judgment Dragon to wipe your opponent's board clean. But the true secret weapon lies within the Tearlaments. They weave through your graveyard, fusing with your other archetypes to unleash terrifying boss monsters like Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart, disrupting your opponent's plays and ensuring your dominance. This deck thrives on synergy and surprise, constantly adapting to your opponent's strategy. Will you overwhelm them with a swarm of Darklords, lock them down with Melodious fusions, or unleash a sudden Lightsworn-Tearlaments combo that leaves them in disarray? Every duel is a new performance, a delicate balance between order and chaos, light and shadow.</span></p>"

You'll witness the legendary Dragon Rulers, like Blaster, Tidal, and Tempest, rise from the banished zone to dominate the field, while the angelic voices of Shopina and Soprano serenade your opponent into submission. But don't be fooled by the harmonious tunes! Hidden within are the disruptive forces of the Windwitches, ready to chime in with their devastating Synchro plays, leading into the likes of Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon and Cyber Slash Harpie Lady. And just when your opponent thinks they've weathered the storm, the chaotic mill of the Lightsworn engine will unleash a torrent of graveyard-based comebacks, setting up explosive plays with cards like Charge of the Light Brigade and Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn. ""Elemental Crescendo"" thrives on calculated risk and explosive comebacks. It's a deck that demands a duelist who can adapt on the fly, weaving together disparate archetypes into a cohesive, and utterly devastating, strategy. Will you unleash the full fury of the elements and conduct your way to victory?</span></p>"

That, and the facts that Crystron doesn't care about Bystials, has solid grind game capabilities and has good in-engine answers to popular decks like Fiendsmith (Quariongandrax) and Blue-Eyes (Quariongandrax and Cluster) make it a very solid pick right now. You could play it completely pure, but the Speedroid package and the Millennium engine facilitate the Crystron gameplan and can provide extra disruption or going 2nd capabilities.</p><p>This is one of those decks where it can take a little time to click with, but once it does, it is very fun and competent. I was able to reach Master I this season using this list, so let's start breaking it down, starting with the Crystrons themselves.</p><p><strong>Crystron&nbsp;</strong>is a Synchro archetype focused on Machine monsters. Their tuners have some quick effect to allow for Synchro Summoning during the opponent's turn. Then, each of the Crystron Synchro monsters has some effect when summoned, and float into some monster when destroyed. Most main deck Crystron monsters also have some kind of effect in the GY.

It requires 2+ tuners and 1 non-tuner, but when Synchro Summoned it lets you banish monsters from your opponent's field or GY, up to the number of synchro materials used (generally 3), making it very strong in the current meta. For example, summoning it during your opponent's turn destroys the Fiendsmith engine.</li><li>To allow summoning Quariongandrax during the opponent's turn (as well as other synchros), the strongest tuner is the newly added <a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=99471856"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/99471856.jpg"" data-card=""99471856"" data-name=""Crystron Tristaros"">Crystron Tristaros</span></a>.

However, the deck could lack in Go 2nd and against some handtraps/freespots that kills the strategy (Fuwalos, Purulia, Banishment, ...).</p><h3 id=""mcetoc_1iu01n85g3"">Concept of the Deck</h3><ul><li>We're on a Fiendsmith/Handtrap control deck : the goal is really to manage the pace of the game with those tools. It's the reason why the decklist relies a lot on the Fiendsmith engine than the Eviltwin one (a lot stronger, recursive, allow use to play throught many threats).</li><li>Twins remain still insane for the ability to draw many freespots and to bring disruptions during the opponent's turn, in conjuction with the Fiendsmith.</li><li>Freespots : the choise here is more to rely on active Handtrap for the opponent turn even by drawing them during this one (main reason why I run Veiler instead of Impermance). Charmies are not that important in the Deck (Fuwa is the more generic but you draw so much with the engines that you don't need more : you prefer high-impact freespots).</li><li>Bodies : Kisi-kil is now our main starter overall even with bodies on board. Futhermore, we like having additional bodies to OTK, go on higher Links, ... (Nibiru &amp; Bystial).</li><li>Extra Deck : The Extra deck is pretty standard : there is for me only one flexspot (the second Lil-la). <a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=45445571"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/45445571.jpg"" data-card=""45445571"" data-name=""The Duke of Demise"">The Duke of Demise</span></a>&nbsp;is for me mandatory because of his utility to play throught Nibiru, to give us extra plays with the normal summon.</li></ul><h3>Some Options</h3><ul><li>Main Deck : Adapt the freespot to the format.

However, another deck I love that cares about Dinos is Ryu-Ge, the forgotten deck from Crossover Breakers. After seeing a deck list that combined Ryu-Ge with the new Jurrac support, I knew I had to cook something, and I even tweaked the list to give it a bit of sauce.</p><p>The list has the typical Ryu-Ge ratios (any list running more than 1 Kaiva is wilin'), though the Jurrac/Dino ratios are a bit different than the norm. Even if Misc ever comes off the limited list, running two Ovi and one Petite will always be the most optimal ratio for the combo. Also, I'm personally running Petite over Baby is to summon Pankratops if I'm doing the combo through Droll. UCT is UCT and needs no explanation.</p><p>While UCT may need no explanation, a certain monster in the extra deck does, and it honestly makes playing Jurrac with Dinos more worthwhile. Grenosaurus Giga-Cannon is a retrain of the rank 3 Grenosaurus, both of which are cards that see no play. Though, with Jurrac Stego's Dinosaur monster lock, this may change for Giga-Cannon. Since the Evolzars are Dragons, they can't be made, but instead, you could use two level 4 monsters to make Giga-Cannon and have it as pop fodder for UCT. But, why does this matter?</p><p>Well, when Giga-Cannon is destroyed, you can pop a card and burn your opponent for 1000. Dinos having a way to pop any card on-field along with having a way to cheese a win in time now is really cool.

The Fabled Confluence is not just a deck; it's a living, breathing testament to the forbidden arts of milling and graveyard recursion. Watch in awe as Lightsworn beasts flood the GY, feeding the insatiable hunger of Judgment Dragon and triggering the devastating Ice Barrier floodgates. Then, from the depths of despair, Orcust rises, orchestrating an unbreakable board with relentless precision, while the aquatic might of Tearlaments fuses into unstoppable fusion monsters. And as if that weren't enough, the ancient power of Horus lends its unyielding might, ensuring your reign is absolute. This deck doesn't just play the game; it redefines it, turning your graveyard into a second hand and your opponent's into a wasteland. Prepare for a truly unique dueling experience where the lines between order and chaos blur, and victory is always within reach.</span></p>"

There are 13 copies of Ze Amin (3 Ze Amin, 1 Ogre, 3 Foxy Tune, 3 Rising Scale and 3 Emergency Teleport) giving the duelist a fair chance of drawing into it with their starting hand. 6</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The two archetypes in this deck are of course&nbsp;PUNK (16 cards) and Fiendsmith (6 cards). PUNK forms the main strategy and Fiendsmith is essentially the backup crutch the deck falls on if you get droll'd. Fiendsmith also adds another layer of powerful interruption since it converts two of your extra bodies at the end of your PUNK combo into Caesar (double special summon negate) or Desirae (omni-negate).&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Due to the increased consistency given to PUNK thanks to Rising Scale giving three more starter/extenders, more staples can be jammed into the deck. 17 staple cards are used in this deck, with 16 of them are handtraps.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Despite the introduction of Rising Scale and JAM FEVER, the strategy of PUNK remains the same - interrupt your opponent as much as possible while building as much resource advantage as you can with multiple draws and searches through your multiple engines. The turn after, if your opponent hasn't surrendered yet, both&nbsp;PUNK&nbsp;and Fiendsmith have massive follow-up to enable an easy OTK. If your Fiendsmith cards are still in the GY and Field, they can recur and resummon themselves to generate a lot of attack while simultaneously picking apart your opponent's board! The PUNK cards have follow-up to, since Jam Session and Amazing Dragon is on the field and Dragon Drive is in the GY. Both engines can OTK independently!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The combo for this strategy is the standard PUNK combo -&gt; Fiendsmith combo via the two spare bodies on the field.

This isn't just a deck; it's a meticulously crafted fusion of Witchcrafter elegance, Artmegia's divine artistry, Tearlaments' abyssal power, and Lunalight's feral grace. Prepare to confound your opponent with the Witchcrafters, weaving a web of spell-based disruptions and resource recursion that will leave them guessing your every move. Just as they adapt, the Artmegia will reveal their divine might, locking down the field with continuous effects and summoning formidable deities. But the true spectacle begins when the Tearlaments plunge into action. Watch as your graveyard becomes a tempest of card effects, effortlessly Fusion Summoning powerful monsters like Kaleido-Heart at a moment's notice, disrupting your opponent's plays and fueling your own. And when the time is right, the Lunalights pounce, transforming into an unstoppable force of multi-attacking Fusion Beasts that will shatter your opponent's defenses! With a robust arsenal of hand traps to negate crucial plays and powerful Field Spells to establish your dominance, this deck offers unparalleled adaptability and control. Whether you're gracefully out-resourcing your opponent with Witchcrafters, strategically summoning with Artmegia, chaining devastating combos with Tearlaments, or delivering the final, ferocious blow with Lunalights, you'll always have the perfect answer. Master this intricate dance of destruction and creation, and become the maestro of the duel!</span></p>"

Dark World archetype is pretty limited to Edison Format and a lot of cards can make you brick. I've tried a lot of different approaches to make this deck worth it and that's my final built. In the Youtube video you might see some different cards or ratios , I am sorry... One of the biggest weakness of Dark World monsters is that they don't have actual effects on field and can lose to other Boss monsters with higher ATK. Solidarity is a big plus and a reason to play only Fiend monsters. Necro Gardna and Plaguespreader Zombie can banish themselves from graveyard. Morphing Jar might be the only card we miss in this deck. For even more options you can look in your side deck.</p><p>The biggest problem with Dark World is the ruling or the ""miss timing"" rule. If you discard for cost , the effect can't be activated and cards like Raigeki Break or Lightning Vortex are not usable...</p><p>Stygian Security and Giant Germ can give you some time to set a play and special summon some cheap bodies on field without cost. Stygian Sergeants is a pretty cool card and valuable card that can turn the tides of the duel with some Solidarity cards on field.&nbsp;</p><p>Dark World, GOLDD / SILLVA are basically the same card so chose which you like most art-wised. You really need patience and practise to play this deck. I've tried Caius, the Shadow Monarch + Battle Fader too. It was good, but it can brick. You can remove Allure of Darkness for +1 Hammer Shot maybe.</p>"

If you did the Snake-Eye Combo before, and you still have Flamberge Dragon in the field, you could activate its effect to put one monster from your GY in your Spell/Trap Zone, then synchro summon using Primera and Flamberge Dragon, activate its effect to summon the 2 Snake-Eye monsters from your GY, and use then to summon Masquerena, then use Dramatic Chase in the GY to summon the monster you have in your Spell/Trap Zone, so you can use Masquerena to summon Little Knight in your opponent's turn.</p>"

One of the biggest weakness of Dark World monsters is that they don't have actual effects on field and can lose to other Boss monsters with higher ATK. Solidarity is a big plus and a reason to play only Fiend monsters. Necro Gardna and Plaguespreader Zombie can banish themselves from graveyard. Morphing Jar might be the only card we miss in this deck. For even more options you can look in your side deck.</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #d4d1d0; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">The biggest problem with Dark World is the ruling or the ""miss timing"" rule. If you discard for cost , the effect can't be activated and cards like Raigeki Break or Lightning Vortex are not usable...</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #d4d1d0; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">Stygian Security and Giant Germ can give you some time to set a play and special summon some cheap bodies on field without cost. Stygian Sergeants is a pretty cool card and valuable card that can turn the tides of the duel with some Solidarity cards on field.&nbsp;</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #d4d1d0; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">Dark World, GOLDD / SILLVA are basically the same card so chose which you like most art-wised. You really need patience and practise to play this deck. I've tried Caius, the Shadow Monarch + Battle Fader too. It was good, but it can brick. You can remove Allure of Darkness for +1 Hammer Shot maybe.</p>"

You can win with the Ashened, Volcanic, or Diabell/Snake-Eye package and they all can play into each other. Only important thing to consider is to save your Ashened package for last because it will lock you out of the non pyro extra deck monsters.</p><p>You can look up any of the old Snake-Eye combo videos to understand the Snake-Eye package. You're basically just summoning a million things to link climb and end up with your pyro monsters on the field or in the graveyard.&nbsp;</p><p>Volcanic is pretty cool in this deck because it basically puts volcanic bodies on the board or in the graveyard. When you end up with volcanics on the board you can use them to link climb or fusion summon via your ashened package or super poly package. When they're in the graveyard they're volcanic emperor targets.&nbsp;</p><p>Ashened is the one that will throw your opponents for a loop since nobody knows how Ashened works or pays attention to it. Fusion Veidos wipes backrow, can't be destroyed by card effects or targeted by monster effects, quick effect destroys a face up card, and gains 500 attack for each material used to summon it when summoned by the Endlessness trap. Super Poly really messes people up with the Ashened package because the field spell causes all of their monsters to be targets for summoning the pyro fusion monsters.&nbsp;</p><p>There are multiple recycling effects in each package that set you up for grind game if things get dicey.&nbsp;</p>"

A fun deck for those who want dynamic and non-linear game play!,"<p>If you aren't comfortable with 42 cards here are some cards you can chop off to make it a nice 40: ""Time thief hack"", ""Raigeki"", and ""Infernoble arms-durendal"" but you can mix and match until you get the ratio's you want. Have you ever looked at a vanquish soul deck list and thought: "" Why are they all similar and run degenerate cards like shifter?"" or running high risk cards like pot of desires or extravagence where they banish random cards that could have been used to go into other combo's.&nbsp;</p><p>Well here is something different and using the utility of Vanquish Souls recursion and engine to control the state of the board with cards like time thief, using Vanquish souls unique ability to have a 2nd win con through burning your oppenent, or even board wiping and OTKing your oppenent! Even if you go 2nd into a board you can likely come out on top.</p><p>IT SHOULD BE NOTED: Vanquish Soul by itself is already a very difficult deck for beginners and you MUST know the match ups and choke points of your opponents deck to succeed and this version is no different. Especially since this is a more control orriented deck (Which can be used very offensively if you so please but that requires a more specific board state) you will need to take note of when and what you want to be disrupting and also what you can do on the crack back. Wether you have the angle to kill with your monsters on field or if you can inflict damage to your opponent through cards like Borger or Snow devil.</p><p>Here is a combo guide created by this reddit user for vanquish souls in case you need an idea of what to do: <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/masterduel/comments/18rwc4k/basic_vanquish_soul_combo_guides_for_beginners/#lightbox</a></p><p>Also, here are some packages/ other extra deck monsters that could be helpful if you wanna go off the beaten path a little bit:</p><p><strong> Lancer package</strong> (Full armored dark knight lancer, Full armored crystalizedzero lancer (Optional), Xyz Armor fortress, Armored XYZ, and Full-armored xyz (Or any other Armored cards)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Extra deck monsters</strong> (These haven't been tested but in theory they could be fun additions: <em>Scareclaw Tri-heart </em>(For more control orriented play with his forcing other monsters into defense position), <em>Knightmare goblin</em> (For more extension when co-linked with ""Rock of the Vanquisher"" due to his even trade of discard 1, draw 1 which can discard a time thief card that can activate in the GY and draw into engine or non-engine and also an additonal normal summon which can get your rank 4's online.), and finally <em>Salamangreat almiraj</em> (Can send ""Time Thief Bezel Ship"" or ""Time Thief Temporwhal"" if they are your only normal summons since they have GY effects. Also, allows for an S:P play if you are very desperate.)</p>"

You can use Clockwork Knight's effect to summon 002 from GY by tributing the other monster you have, then you can use 002 to add one Deskbot card to your hand.</p><p>3- By summoning any pair of monster, you can summon Ancient Gear Ballista, then use its effect to add Ancient Gear Box to your hand, and use Ancient Gear Box to add one deskbot monster to your hand.

You could make the Ancient Gear Ballista combo instead, but if you have Clockwork Night in your hand Clockwork Knight its better.</p><p>- The goal of these combos its let you add two pendulum monsters (preferable 005 and 006, because if something happens and they are destroyed you could summon/add a Deskbot monster from your GY) and 009 (008 or 007 depending on the situation, they are a good option if you have some Deskbot monsters in your GY, or cant use 009. 007 its the better option when your opponent's monsters are all in defense position, or the ones in attack position have too high ATK). Then pendulum summon as many monsters as you can (remember let one zone free if you have 001 in GY). After that use 009 effect and 003 effect targeting 009 to make it the strongest as possible.</p><p>- If you already have the neccesary monsters, you can add Deskbot Base to increase your monsters ATK.</p>"

While that is the case, it is still easy enough to work with. The biggest issue that I currently am having with this Magnifistorm Prediction Princess Deck is that I wish there was an in-archetype Extra Deck pay-off for Magnifistorm, one that would further help facilitate their plays. I was really lost on how to combine these 2 archetypes for a while until I settled on Tribute Summoning their Level 9&rsquo;s as the most consistent way of getting them onto the field, at least in this Deck as opposed to an actual Magnifistorm Deck. I do really believe that this Deck will improve by a lot once we get some Magnifistorm support, not that it desperately needs it, but for the purposes of combining it with another archetype, one that does mind their WIND-lock on </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Magnifistorming Crothea</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, the archetype needs some other tools to access.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Magnifistorm has 2 Level 9 monsters: </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Magnifistorm Great Pyre Phonix</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> and </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Magnifistorm Vortex Beauty Valrune</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. Pyre Phonix is a Level 9 WIND Pyro monster that can Special Summon itself from your hand if a Quick-Play Spell Card is activated and if one is activated while it is on the field, it can target up to 2 cards your opponent controls and shuffle them into the Deck.

Vortex Beauty is a Level 9 WIND Aqua monster that can also Special Summon itself from your hand if a Quick-Play Spell Card is activated and if a Mystical Space Typhoon is activated while it is in the GY, it can Special Summon itself from the GY. While it is on field, when your opponent activates a monster effect while MST is in your GY, you can Quick Effect negate that effect, and then if there are 2 or more copies of MST in your GY, you can destroy that monster. Both of these cards are pretty good, but in the context of this Deck, I would say that Pyre Phonix is the better one as it can act as both interruption and removal.

Something to keep in mind about their effect to Special Summon themselves from hand if a Quick-Play Spell Card is activated is that if you have both in hand and you activate Phonix&rsquo;s effect to Special Summon itself, you cannot chain Valrune&rsquo;s effect to also Special Summon it, and vice versa. This has to do with the trigger effect conditions, so make sure you don&rsquo;t actually make an illegal play once this comes out in paper. 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Magnifistorming Suen</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> and 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Magnifistorming Erdam</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. Both are inherent Special Summons from the hand if your have MST in your GY or your opponent controls no Spell/Traps.

So why Assault Synchron of all Level 2 Tuner monsters? Well, for one, we are depending on Tribute Summoning out Level 9 monster to get it out onto the field.

You are going to need it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSMqb-FPncU"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) At one point, use Ravenous to discard two of these three monsters: Origami + Gaap + Barrel. Then, after you have Link Summoned Saryuja, place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop.</p><p>2) Use Saryuja to pull out one of these three monsters explained in #1 and revive the other two with ""Monster Reborn"". Activate Barrel to pop anything but combo pieces and ""Primal Seed"" loop. Setting cards on backrow helps and try hitting a lot of <strong>heads</strong> to boost your Origami.</p><p>3) Reset Barrel with Book, so that Gaap lets you go on with your setup. When you think it's enough, give Origami to the opponent with ""Shien's Spy"" and revive Accel with ""Monster Reborn"".</p><p>4) XYZ Summon Buzzking with Chaos + Accel as materials. Use Buzzking to pop Origami and your opponent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" can be earned for free by completing the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Summoner Monk"" can be found within ""True Awakening of the Oathbound Knights"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Upstart Goblin"" can be found within ""Bonkers Bikers' Wild Wheels"" Secret Pack to save 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Gaap the Divine Soldier"" + ""Number 1: Infection Buzzking"" + ""Origami Goddess"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 120 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" + ""Accel Synchro Stardust Dragon"" can be found within ""Evoked Dragon of Miracles"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 660 SR and 330 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Start by activating this and adding Allure Palace. (If Allure Palace is already in your hand, add either Allure Queen Lv3 or Lv7 for future combo steps.) Activate your Allure Palace and use its effect to discard a card to take an Allure Queen monster and either add it to your hand, or summon it to your opponent's field. 1st activation of effect: send 1 card to the GY to add Allure Queen Lv7 from your deck to your hand. 2nd activation: send Allure Queen Lv7 to GY to special summon Allure Queen Lv3 from your deck to your opponent's field. 3rd activation: send 1 more card to GY to add Allure Queen Lv3 from your deck to your hand. (Some of these steps can be skipped depending on your hand. You basically want to reach a point where you have Allure Queen Lv7 in your GY, one Allure Queen Lv3 on your opponent's field, and another in your hand, with both Allure Dance and Allure Palace on your field.)</p><p>Next, normal summon your Allure Queen Lv3, and activate its effect to equip the Allure Queen Lv3 on your opponent's field to it. Then, Allure Palace gives your Allure Queen monsters the ability to send themselves to the GY if they are equipped with equip cards, to special summon an Allure Queen monster from your deck. Send Allure Queen Lv3 to the GY to special summon Chaos Allure Queen from your deck. Use Chaos Allure Queen's effect to equip Allure Queen Lv3 from your GY to it, then special summon Allure Queen Lv5 from your deck. Link summon Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman, using Chaos Allure Queen and Allure Queen Lv5 as material, and use its effect to send Dragon Buster Destruction Sword from your deck to your GY.</p><p>Now, use the effect of Allure Dance, sending Allure Palace to the GY, to special summon as many Allure Queen monsters with different names from your GY. This will be Allure Queen Lv3, Allure Queen Lv5, Allure Queen Lv7, and Chaos Allure Queen. Make sure to keep at least one of Protectoir Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman's link zones free, as you'll now Link summon Golden Allure Queen, using Allure Queen Lv3, Allure Queen Lv5, and Allure Queen Lv7 as material. On summon, use Golden Allure Queen's effect to special summon any one of your Allure Queen monsters from your GY. It doesn't matter which, as you'll be using it and Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman to Link summon Moon of the Closed Heaven.</p><p>From here, you'll use Moon of the Closed Heaven to Link summon Fiendsmith's Requiem, and so on, and so on into whatever Fiendsmith combo you like.</p><p>What the Allure Queen bits will do for you is that during your opponent's standby phase, Golden Allure Queen allows you to use any Allure Queen monster effect to equip a monster as a (Quick Effect), so you activate Chaos Allure Queen's effect to equip a monster from your GY, targeting Dragon Buster Destruction Sword, which stops your opponent from summoning from their Extra Deck. Because Dragon Buster Destruction Sword is a DARK monster, you'll benefit from the second part of Chaos Allure Queen's effect to special summon an Allure Queen monster from your GY, where you'll choose Allure Queen Lv3. Thanks to Golden Allure Queen, you will be able to use Lv3's effect as a (Quick Effect) too, so if your opponent brings out a level 3 monster that you don't want them to have, you can equip it to your Allure Queen Lv3.</p><p>The benefit to using the Fiendsmith engine with the Allure Queen engine,is that lots of Fiendsmith cards like to be in the GY, and Allure Palace needs to discard cards for its effect. so even if you open with Fiendsmith in Paradise (which is normally a brick), as long as you have Allure Dance or Allure Palace, you can still make use of its GY effect.</p><p>Enjoy!</p>"

It make a lot of sense and it's much cheaper than the Horus package.</p><p>Your best starter is Sengenjin since it's a one-card full combo, but none of the Millennium cards are bricks.<br />Starting with Sengenjin makes Photon Lord / Zombie Vapire as 4th summon (if you can't start your crystron engine make Zombie Vampire and mill), also leaving a body (Golem).<br />If you start with Unicorn and Sengenjin you special summon Unicorn first and search for the spell, then you go into Millennium combo and you'll have your rank 8 zyx, Golem and Unicorn on field. Link 2 into S:P and then revive the Unicorn.<br />It's pretty solid, also considering that you do not go under Bystials and you still have your Crystrons!<br /><br /><br /></p><h3>Extra</h3><p>Not much to say here, Mechaba could be considered as a side tech for Nova, since not 100% of the players fear (or read...) Nova.<br />Dawn Dragster is stupid easy to make and Chambara is for OTKs, but sometimes it doubles in utilities by just being a lv 5. Samurai Destroyer doesn't come up very often, but keep in mind that Eleskeletus give -500 ATK/DEF to monsters on the other side of the field, this small but crucial detail is forgotten by a lot of players.<br /><br /><br /></p><h3>Side</h3><p>This is what I'm working with right now, I'm thinking about removing Ultimate Slayer and Mereologic for something like TTT and Mechaba, but I still believe in US (probably copium).<br />Side pattern is preatty easy, Droplet and Ash are often replaceable.<br /><br /></p><h3>Possible changes</h3><p>If you have the Charmy(s) play them instead of Ash or instead of the Kashtira package. You could also consider Nibiru instead of Ash or in side, but if you are playing very budget I think this is the best HT lineup: Droll is a must, Ash stops Charmy(s) and Imperma is generally strong.</p><p>I'll try 1 Crossout with 2 Droplets, just to have slightly more chance to survive a Droll.<br /><br /></p><hr /><p>I don't think I have to point out how this is a deck for locals, not for big events.<br />You could theoretically strip out every other engine and make it super-duper budget, but I think this is a good compromise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Open to suggestions, thank you for reading this far!</p>"

Fun and strong lmao.,"<p>Dragon Tail will come to the TCG when DBJH is imported from the OCG (presumably JUHU in TCG). This is a very fun and reliably powerful deck to play. The deck's play style revolves around controlling your hand's resources through Fusion Summons, by recycling handtraps and names with Altharion, disrupting the opponent with your plentiful handtraps and the deck's two powerful trap cards. Should Secreterion Dragon come in DUAD, this deck is promised with potential, as the card filtered out the types Mysterion is bad against.<br />This is my build of the deck, tested with many duels in various platforms. Hope you find my decklist helpful.&nbsp;</p>"

Test this deck into the 3 main decks coming into JUHU and you see how insane the deck can be on a power spell-like approach. Striker MD monsters work as normals, and lightning storm clears and or forces out interactions. Either way, helps you clear the backrow so you can ss MST names.<br /><br /><br />If made to go first, just get into feather storm, and it can be used from hand with the harpie or crothea, but you can also make a board as well. Evenly matched is a meta call for these decks, because aside from yummy, VS K9 and DT have no reponse to it; vs k9 can run therion king but often do not. Yummy can be hit and killed with evenly if you get past the arc light. These decks dont have the greatest time trying to rebuild their board into the MST cards after dismantled, and you have an easier time just ending the game a lot sooner than you usually would with this deck.</p>"

Alas, the chests are locked, and they do not have the key.","<p>Mimighoul Ghostrick's goal is to give your oppenent as many Mimighouls as possible and keep them face down with the use of Ghostrick Night. With the support of Mimighoul Room and Book of Moon, you can clog up your oppnents field till they run out of space to play. Then swaping out Mimighoul Dungeon with Ghostrick Mansion, you can beat over them with Ghostrick Angel of Mischief and burn for game with Giant Mimighoul.</p><p><strong>Starting End</strong> <strong>Board</strong></p><p>Ideally, you want to end with Mimighoul Dungeon onboard, with a Mimighoul Master and Mimighoul Throne, as well as at least one Ghostrick monster, usually a Ghostrick Angel of Mischief and Ghostrick Festival, and a Ghostrick Night set, with at least one set card on your oppenents field. The set card will keep your oppenent from normal summoning so long as Mimighoul Dungeon is in play, and Ghostrick Night will keep your oppenent from flipping it up to break the lock. Anything they special summon also wont be able to attack this turn due to Dungeon. Ghostrick Angel of Mischief, which you will get to by overlaying Dullahan, will get you Ghostrick Shot, which will get you Dullahan for another Angel of Mischief for Ghostrick Night. Then the empty Angel of Mischief is linked into Festival, mostly for the follow up the following turn.</p><p>Once your oppnenets turn ends, you can use Ghostrick Shot to get Dullahan back for your 3rd Angel, search for Ghostrick Mansion, and attack directly with your two Angels, and other Mimighouls if you can get Giant Mimighoul out. This usually wont kill, but if your oppnent has 3-4 set monsters on field, Giant Mimighoul can burn for game. Just be sure to blow up Ghostrick Manison with its effect to get the full damage.</p><p>If you get interupted too much, you can try ending on a board of Mimighoul Dungeon, with a set Mimighoul Fairy on your oppenents field, and may a search of a Mimighoul Room with Giant Mimighoul. It's not the ideal endboard, but it can interupt the flow of your oppenents play enough for the clap back on the next turn.</p><p><strong>Combo Starters</strong></p><p><em>Mimighoul Dragon</em></p><p>Dragon will get you Dungeon or Maker, two of your other playmakers for this deck. Depending on your hand, you might want to search one or the other, but resolving this uninterupted will usually get you to your ideal end board so long as you pilot the deck right.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mimighoul Dungeon</em></p><p>Your field spell that floodgates your oppnenets normal summon, and protects you from battle with special summoned monsters the turn they come out. Also gives a boost to your Mimighoul monsters the following turn, which is nice to try and protect them from getting beat over, but if all goes right, you wont have to worry about that.</p><p><em>Mimighoul Maker</em></p><p>A bit of a random searcher, if it is the only card you are starting with, you will most likely be searching Dragon and Archfiend, as regardless of the result, you will be able to combo off of them. If you have Dragon in hand or if you are just feeling lucky, Archfiend and Slime will be your go to, with a 50-50 chance your oppenent gets Slime, giving you a bunch of gas when you special summon Archfiend. Even if you get Slim in hand, you still special summon and can combo from there.</p><p><strong>Generic Searchers</strong></p><p><em>One for One</em></p><p>You will most likely be using this to get a Dragon or an Archfiend if you give your oppenent a Mimighoul so you can combo. Very handy card.</p><p><em>Jack-In-The-Hand</em></p><p>This one is very unreliable, but can be used in a pinch. Usually I select Dragon/Archfiend/Slime and so long as I have another&nbsp;Mimighoul Ghostrick's goal is to give your opponent as many Mimighouls as possible and keep them face down with the use of Ghostrick Night. With the support of Mimighoul Room and Book of Moon, you can clog up your opponents field till they run out of space to play. Then swapping out Mimighoul Dungeon with Ghostrick Mansion, you can beat over them with Ghostrick Angel of Mischief and burn for game with Giant Mimighoul.</p><p><strong>Starting End</strong> <strong>Board</strong></p><p>Ideally, you want to end with Mimighoul Dungeon onboard, with a Mimighoul Master and Mimighoul Throne, as well as at least one Ghostrick monster, usually a Ghostrick Angel of Mischief and Ghostrick Festival, and a Ghostrick Night set, with at least one set card on your opponents field. The set card will keep your opponent from normal summoning so long as Mimighoul Dungeon is in play, and Ghostrick Night will keep your opponent from flipping it up to break the lock. Anything they special summon also wont be able to attack this turn due to Dungeon. Ghostrick Angel of Mischief, which you will get to by overlaying Dullahan, will get you Ghostrick Shot, which will get you Dullahan for another Angel of Mischief for Ghostrick Night. Then the empty Angel of Mischief is linked into Festival, mostly for the follow up the following turn.</p><p>Once your opponents turn ends, you can use Ghostrick Shot to get Dullahan back for your 3rd Angel, search for Ghostrick Mansion, and attack directly with your two Angels, and other Mimighouls if you can get Giant Mimighoul out. This usually wont kill, but if your opponent has 3-4 set monsters on field, Giant Mimighoul can burn for game. Just be sure to blow up Ghostrick Mansion with its effect to get the full damage.</p><p>If you get interrupted too much, you can try ending on a board of Mimighoul Dungeon, with a set Mimighoul Fairy on your opponents field, and may a search of a Mimighoul Room with Giant Mimighoul. It's not the ideal end board, but it can interrupt the flow of your opponents play enough for the clap back on the next turn.</p><p><strong>Combo Starters</strong></p><p><em>Mimighoul Dragon</em></p><p>Dragon will get you Dungeon or Maker, two of your other play-makers for this deck. Depending on your hand, you might want to search one or the other, but resolving this uninterrupted will usually get you to your ideal end board so long as you pilot the deck right.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mimighoul Dungeon</em></p><p>Your field spell that floodgates your opponents normal summon, and protects you from battle with special summoned monsters the turn they come out. Also gives a boost to your Mimighoul monsters the following turn, which is nice to try and protect them from getting beat over, but if all goes right, you wont have to worry about that.</p><p><em>Mimighoul Maker</em></p><p>A bit of a random searcher, if it is the only card you are starting with, you will most likely be searching Dragon and Archfiend, as regardless of the result, you will be able to combo off of them. If you have Dragon in hand or if you are just feeling lucky, Archfiend and Slime will be your go to, with a 50-50 chance your opponent gets Slime, giving you a bunch of gas when you special summon Archfiend. Even if you get Slim in hand, you still special summon and can combo from there.</p><p><strong>Generic Searchers</strong></p><p><em>One for One</em></p><p>You will most likely be using this to get a Dragon or an Archfiend if you give your opponent a Mimighoul so you can combo. Very handy card.</p><p><em>Jack-In-The-Hand</em></p><p>This one is very unreliable, but can be used in a pinch. Usually I select Dragon/Archfiend/Slime and so long as I have another Mimighoul in hand, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what my opponent picks. It's a very bad card if you open with 0 Mimighouls in hand other than Master though, which can happen. Better hope your opponent thinks your playing a mind game and lets you have Dragon if that is the case.</p><p><em>Triple Tactics Thrust</em></p><p>A little harder to pull off just on its own, Thrust is great for fetching Maker, One for One, or Tactics. If you can get Archfiend down while your opponent has a Mimighoul on their board, when that Mimighoul activates, it counts are their effect, meaning Tactics is now live. Or if they hand trap you with a monster, give them a Mimighoul and now you can add any Spell to your hand since they control a monster.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Extenders</strong></p><p><em>Mimighoul Armor</em></p><p>Can special summon to your side of the field if your opponent has a monster, which they should if you give them a Mimighoul with Maker or just raw summoning to their side. Run at one because it can be a brick.</p><p><em>Mimighoul Fairy</em></p><p>Your main archetypal extender. So long as you have any Mimighoul on field, she can special summon herself to your side. If you normal summon Dragon for Dungeon, this will most likely be your primary search target so you can combo.</p><p><em>Mimighoul Slime</em></p><p>This card can special summon itself to your side of the field if your opponent controls&nbsp;<em>more</em> monsters than you, which usually isn&rsquo;t going to be the case, but the true beauty of this card is when you pair it with Maker. If you already have this in hand and you have a way to find Archfiend, send him out first before playing Maker. Even if you don&rsquo;t have Archfiend in hand, send out Slime and then play Maker, and you have a 50-50 chance of bringing out Archfiend to your side of the field to flip Slime over, letting you search possibly a Dragon or Master.</p><p><em>Where Arf Thou?</em></p><p>You need to control a level one for this, but getting one on board with Maker or just normal summoning a Mimighoul is great to get you going. Searching Mimighoul Fairy is usually a safe bet, but any Mimighoul can be fine. More than likely you will be taking the 2000 damage at the end of the turn but this shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue for a control deck like this.</p><p><em>Optional: Mimighoul Fork</em></p><p>Usually a sub-par choice, as it gives your oppenent the choice on what happens, but drawing two means you can find a proper starter potentially, or if they flip the card face up, it can potentially start your combo. Run at your own risk.</p><p><strong>Interruption</strong></p><p><em>Book of Moon</em></p><p>Great for setting going first, ensuring your Dungeon's protection from attacks stays active. Great for going second and flipping a problematic monster face down.</p><p><em>Mimighoul</em> <em>Room</em></p><p>Your in archetype Book of Moon. It's a trap so its slower, but the fact it can get you a Master while flipping your opponent&rsquo;s monster face down, or if you have a Master you can give your opponent a Dragon so you can use Master to nuke their monsters, is great. The bounce is hand on the following turn if you need to reset your Dragon so you can combo again, or for protection from your opponents nukes.</p><p><strong>Tech</strong></p><p><em>Ghostrick Fairy</em></p><p>The only main deck Ghostrick, and one that can be hard to use. If you have Mimighoul Master and Ghostrick Festival on board, and your opponent manages to attack, Ghostrick Fairy can be brought out from deck. Master can flip her up on Main Phase 2, and you then can possibly flip your opponents monster face down and recycle a Ghostrick card. Or if you have her in hand, instead of going into Festival, you can Ghostrick Shot her onto the board, and the same idea applies. Very situational, but another Book of Moon isn't going to hurt.</p><p><em>Relinquished Anima</em></p><p>Since you are already playing a bunch of level ones, Relinquished is a solid choice for a monster. You can even force your opponent to play into it by playing your Mimighouls into the edges and center of the board when you special summon them. It can be hard to get rid of once you have it on board, but you can drop a Festival for an S:P Little Knight if that concerns you.</p><p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p><p><em>Back </em><em>R</em><em>ow Hate</em></p><p>Harpies Feather Duster, Lightning Storm, and anything that breaks Dungeon and Night will be your bane.</p><p><em>Tribute Fodder</em></p><p>Your opponent using your monsters as tributes for their monsters is a concern. It is not as bad if you have Dungeon out, as they will need to set their tribute, but ultimately it is dangerous. The worst is Forbidden Droplet, as that card basically becomes free with Mimighouls on board.</p><p><em>Fusion Summoning</em></p><p>Cards flipped face down cannot be used for Links, Syncho, or XYZ plays, but Fusion summons are fair game. If you Book of Moon or Mimighoul Room your opponent, be careful they can't be used as Fusion material. Yubel, Thunder Dragons, and Branded will be tougher to deal with because of this.</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><ul><li><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Mimighoul Master is immune to destruction if you control a Mimighoul or your opponent has a face down card. If you try to burn for game with Giant Mimighoul, do not select Master</p></li><li><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Ghostrick Mansion will half your effect damage, so make sure Giant Mimighoul blows it up if you are going to burn for game.</p></li><li><p>Cards like Dominus Impulse lock your opponent out from activating Earth Monster effects. Meaning if you try to Flip a monster after they have activated it, nothing will happen.</p></li></ul>"

I've found that backrow can be a little difficult going second, hence the feather duster idk.&nbsp;</p><p>All of the link monsters are basically just there if yr fusion gets negated, and i've never actually used them in the like 20+ games i've played, except for one little knight summon. It's still fun to play, and I think a skilled player can have a good time with it since it's basically just the artmage engine which from what i've experienced is quite versatile just on it's own.

But in the past, things were different. Now? I decided to give it a revisit. My take on fiendsmith voiceless voice.<br /><br />The deck has its consistancies issues with dealing with certain handtraps, but you play around those with the other engine in the deck. The thought of using the bystials to get an extra body on board to continue combos and have the additional end phase add from Bystial Magnahamut was very tempting. But I then remembered that since Fiendsmith and Voiceless Voice archtypes are both lights, with the occansional D/D/D Wave High King ceaser (Being water). I figured that instead of using the bystial package, just discard it completely and use 3 copies of dominus purge. The chances of you needing to summon Wave High King are usually high against decks that summon alot of crap in a turn, but in a scenario where you only have purge in hand, alongside a copy of imperm? Its actually optimal.&nbsp;<br /><br />You make them unable to play the 1 of Triple Tactics talent and force them to play around the effectively Ash blossom and Effect Veiler without them being regarded as monster effects.<br /><br />My final thoughts? I believe the deck has very good consistancy with both engines smashed in there together.

Upon its Summon, it Special Summons a monster ""Fur Hire"" from the Deck with a different Type from the Link Materials used, replenishing some of the advantage used to Summon it, and its other effect draws cards if an opponent's card is destroyed, depending on how many monsters ""Fur Hire"" the player controls.

This is especially important with ""Donpa"" or ""Recon"" on the field, to interrupt the opponent's plays and draw more cards with ""Folgo"".

I've taken this to diamond, so it's vaguely playable? I essentially tried shoving as many engines as possible to facilitate the summon of the man himself, Big Gabonga. Materiactor is very much the best of these, Exagard being made first should always allow another rank 3, sometimes grabbing the counter trap in the process. Also, Exareptor (and Foxy Tune) are good for putting the annoying cards to draw into the grave while extending. Essentially the game plan is to push through whatever your opponent has through sheer amount of gas. Ideally by using Terrortop and Emergency Teleport, you can get through your opponent's interruptions before you use your normal summon.</p><p>I used to run Bamboozling Gossip Shadow to insulate against nib, but most hands are not so fortunate to be able to do that so I cut it. Ideally, you just play through the nib. Droll hurts the deck really bad and ofc maxx C will just end your turn if it goes through. The Materiactor counter trap IS the only spell/trap negate you have, so it's usually worth it to go for that over the Exaraptor bounce- this also means making Exapgard without any Materiactor material is fine. I've added the utopic future cards more recently, and to be honest, I'm still learning how to incoporate them fully.&nbsp;</p>"

Using a mix of old and new Ninja support, this build capitalizes on the strength of Meizen Hayabusa (I know he's not a Hayabusa) to grant your monsters direct attacks and disrupt enemy strategies by flipping threats face-down mid-turn.&nbsp;</p><p>The deck thrives on setting the pace early with Hanzo or Tobari, transitioning into Saizo setups that tutor key Ninjitsu Art cards like Dancing Leaves or Notebook of Mystery. Hand traps like Ash Blossom and Veiler help keep opposing combo decks in check, while your trap lineup provides ongoing field control.</p><p>Meizen, backed by cards like Geo and Baku a, provides both offensive pressure and defensive options. The Extra Deck offers tech tools like Bagooska, Abyss Dweller, and Apollousa to match various threats, while the Side Deck is tuned for going second and handling backrow-heavy or graveyard-reliant matchups. I used to run Apollousa and Abyss Dweller but they are currently on the list.</p>"

If anything, the archetype literally just needs a Spell that says &lsquo;Add 1 &ldquo;Prediction Princess&rdquo; monster or 1 &ldquo;Prediction&rdquo; Ritual Spell from your Deck to your hand&rsquo; and it will be much more capable of accessing its plays a whole lot more often.

Miracle Raven is a Level 1 Ritual Pendulum Monster whose Pendulum Effect allows you to Ritual Summon it (from your Pendulum Zone) by Tributing monsters from hand/field whose total Levels equal or exceed 1. Its monster effect allows it to fulfill an entire Ritual requirement for a Ritual Summon that uses monsters while you control it. Also, if it is Tributed for a Ritual Summon, you can add a Ritual Monster from your Deck to your hand.

For a pure Prediction Princess Deck, this is much much much better than what pure Prediction Princess looked post DABL when its support came out. The cards that I have chosen to play do their absolute best to produce hands that end on some semblance of the Prediction Princess endboard.

Best case, you can end on Infinity + Tristaros + Cluster + Dragster + Booster/Dock/Arm, but that's a ~3 card combo. It's also not awful to open RB, fire a Rocket as a boardbreaker/interaction bait, and then still get full Crystron after (eg: Special Limb &gt; Normal Smiger &gt; Link Booster add Dock &gt; Dock add Rocket &gt; Rocket inherent summon &gt; Rocket effect &gt; Dock summon &gt; Banish Smiger to add Inclusion &gt; Play normally).</p><p>The basic endboard combo to add RB requires summoning Prasiortle somehow, and having any Crystron monster in hand (added by Eleskeletus, Thystvern):</p><p>Summon Prasiortle &gt; link Clockwork Knight &gt; Prasiortle summon from hand &gt; Link 2 Booster w/ Clockwork + Crystron &gt; add Dock &gt; Dock, add Driller/Cutter &gt; Booster effect, summon from hand.</p><p>----</p><p>Unfortunately, they haven't printed Machinesmith's Requiem yet, so none of the RB parts are starters on their own, but Driller and Rocket are viable for 2-card combos into full Crystron, whereas Cutter can only 2-card into Booster/Brute unless you run Hi-Speedroid Kendama or something (Powered Inzektron doesn't work, Tristaros can't pop it).</p><p>R.B. Stage Landing is 0-1 in this deck because the lock makes it a brick in most hands, but it's still worth considering as a 1-of because on its own it's a 1-card RB combo, and also turns Dock into a 1-card combo. I've also tried fitting 1 more copy of Rocket (it's a better 2-card than Driller) but haven't managed to justify it yet.</p>"

Time to test out the strategy vs. TCG meta!,"<p>Sky Striker lore episodes are done, and it's Albaz's turn to get anime lore episodes! It is time for fusion enthusiasts everywhere to celebrate by continuing to play Branded! As it turns out in my testing (and personal experience at Locals), Branded is still very viable vs. the current TCG meta! Mainstream meta decks like Mitsurugi, Ryzeal and Maliss interrupt with destruction or banishes, something that Albaz and friends easily shrug off! That means that Branded can out-resource in an extended grindgame, power through established boards and make a ton of interruptions going first! Common meta staples like Droll are ignored by the strategy, and opening hands often have enough gas to keep on playing.&nbsp;<br /><br />This build of Branded uses 60 cards since it is incredibly consistent and has multiple 1-card and 2+ card combos. Relevant Mulcharmies are maindecked since they offer more draw power and stop the opponent from playing too much, but if they're dead in the hand they can be discarded as part of your combos. Making a deck around Grass is incredible. If you resolve the card, you basically win the game!<br /><br />Shoutout to MetaGamesGX for his excellent guide on Branded and for being the main inspiration behind this particular build! <a>Feel free to watch his video guide on Branded by clicking here!&nbsp;</a><br /><br /><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/fifth-anniversary-guide-to-branded-despia-january-2025-557371"">Also, if you want to read my article and combo guide on Branded, click here!</a><br /><br />GLHF Duelists!<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">Want to see the deck in action?

Let His Spirit give you the Victory!</p><p><strong>These Christian tips should help explain the</strong> <strong>rules</strong>:</p><p>Basic Yu-Gi-Oh <strong>strategy</strong> is revealing what your chosen characters are doing as they interact with the space around them. For instance, the strategy of Zefras is encouraging others to trust in the salvation of God's Word due to the angels God sends through the power of His Word and His Spirit. So you would add cards that would support that notion of trust like Grand Horn of Heaven, or Recall, or Solemn Warning. You could also add cards that are trusting in the angels of the Lord to do what they do; like Symphonic Warrior Rockks, or Seraphnite, or Proxy F Magician, or Zefra Metaltron.</p><p>On the other hand, Gravekeepers' strategy is about including others in the participation of anticipating the promise of our eternal lives in Heaven. So you would add cards that would support that notion of including others. Cards like, Book of Eclipse, the Selection, Cup of Ace, Present Card. You could also include cards that support trusting in God's promise of eternal life through Heaven like Desert Sunlight, Blessings of the Nile, Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley, Necrovalley, Stelle, Grand Horn of Heaven, Kahyo-rai-getsu, Flash Fusion, Kuribohrn, and Master Peace, or Metaltron 12.</p><p>On the contrary, the strategy of something like Archfiends would be trying to get others to believe in their gained abilities by trusting in what they earned for themselves by relying on satan. So cards that focus on selfishness or what satan can give would probably be ideal. Cards like Solemn Strike, Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring, or Sakuretsu Armor.</p><p>A card's <strong>Attack or Defense</strong> is the willingness of the card to share what God has given to it. Either its' willingness to give to others (attack) or its' willingness to accept what others share (defense). Sometimes these stats can be increased or decreased as they trust in other things instead of what is just given to them personally. Either by trusting in what God is doing in others or believing in other things that God has done. Or by trusting in what satan does or what it can do to others.</p><p><strong>Cost</strong> is simply acknowledging that players cannot abuse their cards thus accepting how the cards are interacting with each other since the cards wouldn't take back believing in what a card does or trusting in what a fellow teammate could accomplish.</p><p><strong>Star/Star Level</strong> is how the card is connected to the Word (Christ). This allows other cards to trust in how others are connected to the Word. For instance, with <strong>Synchro summoning</strong> cards who are connected to the Word differently (having different levels) can trust in the abilities of someone else who is connected to the Word in a different way than them. When <strong>Xyz summoning</strong>, cards can trust in the abilities of someone who is connected to the Word in the same way as them. When <strong>fusion summoning,</strong> cards trust in the abilities of someone else based on how they are connected to that other individual. This is independent of their level or how they're connected to the Word or Christ. Because <strong>Link monsters</strong> are supposed to be trusting in the connection to the Word via their Spirit, they don't have levels. When <strong>Pendulum Summoning</strong>, cards can also trust in other cards' connection to Christ by having faith in God. <strong>Tribute summoning</strong> is simply when the cards have faith in what another card can do and isn't really dependant on their connection the Word.</p>"
