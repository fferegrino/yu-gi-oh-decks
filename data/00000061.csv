This format is compatible for 2-4 players.<br /><br />This deck built from the Atlantean and Mermail archetypes is a starting point to understand the format and should not be considered competitive-focused. It primarily focuses on bringing out your XYZ monsters and swarming the field with monsters while also recycling them to your deck and hand, often with high risk, high reward tactics. Worldsea Dragon Zealantis is the avacard.<br /><br />More information, including a link to the rulebook for the format, is forthcoming.</p>"

These water attribute robots get a consistency powerboost in the form of 5 cards - Inclusion, Cluster, Suldafor, Tristaros and Eleskeletus Crystron surprisingly goes toe to toe with top decks like Blue-Eyes, Branded and Fiendsmith variants and can grind them out in an extended duel. The deck is now consistent enough to jam in about 20 staples, it has a ton of inherent gas, and by nature of how Crystrons combo many common handtraps don't effect them much. They can weave and make plays through powerful lingering handtraps like Shifter, Mulcharmies Droll and Nibiru - and of course, minor handtraps like Veiler, Ash Blossom and Imperm get shrugged off.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The Horus engine also grants Crystron extra plays, protection and beatsticks as well, giving them a significant buff!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Crystron is a difficult deck to play because of all the combo lines for each sort of gamestate, so it rewards a highly skilled pilot. If you're looking for a powerful midrange deck that catches duelists off-guard on ladder with weird combo lines, I highly recommend playing Crystron!<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong data-olk-copy-source=""MailCompose"">ARCHETYPES AND DECKBUILDING</strong></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>CRYSTRON</strong>&nbsp;cards form the foundation of this deck, and it is a strategy that turbos out tuners that enable it to make quick-synchro plays during your opponent's turn. The Crystron deck core is fairly compact, consisting of 17 cards.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The 3-ofs in the deck are Inclusion (searches any Crystron card) and Smiger (searches spell/trap, basically Inclusion) since they are both 1-card combos that get you your full board and GY set-up. Sulfefnir is a 3-of as well since it is a important combo piece that replaces itself (just like Kashtira Fenrir)!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">2-of Tristaros are used since it is the key piece of the deck which allows synchro summoning during your opponent's turn, and can summon 2 Crystrons at once from your deck. It is this deck's best normal summon, since if your opponent does something, it can react to it to immediately and synchro summon. This number can be bumped up to 3 if you like extra consistency. Sulfador is used at 2 as well since it's a double foolish burial! It's a highly searchable combo piece, but two is needed for an extended grind game.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">1-of of Prasiortle (extender that summons from hand) and Thystvern (searches monster) are used since they are highly searchable combo pieces, each with a certain specific use in different situations. 1 Cluster is used as this deck's ace trap card interruption, able to destroy an opponent's card by shuffling back Crystron cards from the GY or Banishment - giving the strategy potentially infinite grindgame!&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">A tiny <strong>HORUS </strong>package of 5 cards. It makes the deck more powerful because it boosts consistency (The Zombie Vampire), provides protection (Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord). The Horus monsters are fairly powerful themselves, bulldozing most threats off the board during the battlephase, especially with King Sarcophagus' removal.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">This Crystron decklist has 17<strong>&nbsp;STAPLE </strong>cards! The standard ""Maxx C"" package is included as well as Crossout and it's targets. 1 Foolish Burial is added for consistency.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">In terms of interruption, the board that Crystron sets up is relatively straightforward. It ends on 1 targeted pop with Cluster, 1-2 spell/trap negates with F.A. Dawn Dragster and potentially triple monster banish from field/GY with Quariongandrax. Some hands can pivot into Cyber Dragon Infinity's omni-negate.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Regarding execution of the Crystron strategy, it's fairly difficult&nbsp;to sequence interruption properly, especially if your opponent doesn't play into it. Crystron's gimmick is all about quick-synchroing during your opponent's turn, and those actions are only available during your opponent's Main Phase or Battle Phase. If you don't have proper synchro materials on-board or in GY, the quick synchros won't work, especially Quariongandrax which specifically requires two tuners.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">That being said, if you get handtrapped, you can generally still end on Cluster's targeted destruction and sit on your handtraps. Next turn, you can attempt to combo again with your set-up GY/Banishment.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Here a regular 1 card opening for Crystron:&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Inclusion = Double F.A Dawn Dragster (x2 S/T negate), Crystron Quariongandrax (triple monster banish in-field/GY), Crystron Cluster (targeted pop), + follow-up for next turn.&nbsp;</div><ol style=""text-align: left; flex-direction: column; display: flex;"" start=""1"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_1997""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Inclusion to search for Sulfador.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Sulfador targeting Inclusion to destroy it.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">On-summon, Sulfador sends to the GY Cluster and Thystvern.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Banish Thystvern in the GY to search for Tristallos.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Normal Summon Tristaros.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Synchro summon Eleskeletus using Tristaros + Sulfador.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">On-summon, Eleskeletus recovers Cluster from the GY.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Banish Tristaros from the GY to destroy Eleskeletus and summon Sulfefnir and Rosenix.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Eleskeletus' trigger effect when destroyed to summon Tristaros from Banishment.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Rosenix's effect to targeting Sulfefnir to destroy it and summon Citree from deck.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Sulfefnir's effect to summon another Sulfefnir from deck.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Synchro summon F.A Dawn Dragster using Citree + Sulfefnir.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Banish Inclusion from the GY to summon Citree from the GY.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">During your opponent's Main/Battle Phase, activate Citree to summon Sulfefnir from the GY to synchro summon a second F.A Dawn Dragster using Citree + Sulfefnir.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">During your opponent's Main/Battle Phase, activate Cluster to target destroy 1 card your opponent controls by shuffling back Citree from Banishment.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">During your opponent Main/Battle Phase, activate Tristaros summoning Citree from deck to synchro summon Quariongandrax using Tristaros + Citree + level 5 F.A.

Learning to properly sequence your interruptions, especially in the heat of the moment is difficult, so practice a lot!

The strength of Crystron comes from resilience through interruption and a robust grindgame. If you can force out a grindgame from your opponent with full Crystron set-up you have a high chance of winning.&nbsp;</div></li></ul><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

All of the other threats that the deck suffers from are still present in some way. The deck is still quite susceptible to interruptions like Ash, Imperm, Veiler, Belle, Impulse, Purge, the list goes on. That's why our non-engine cards are meant to help break boards (Super Poly &amp; Fenrir) OR stop those hand traps. You might think that we could just run 12 hand traps/staples, but Ursarctic's inconsistency and neediness for other cards (there's no 1 card combos) makes this kind of weird non-engine, in my opinion, kind of necessary.</p><h2 id=""mcetoc_1itbrko4r9l"">Tips</h2><ul><li>Use your Ursarctic cards&nbsp;<em>first&nbsp;</em>if you have any of the necessary pieces to start the basic Mitsurugi combo. The Mitsurugi engine is much stronger, and baiting out common hand traps with the Ursarctic engine can allow you to give you some sort of board to work with.</li><li>Activate Mitsurugi Prayers during your Draw Phase in order to play around Droll - just a little, anyway.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have a Habakiri, Mitsurugi Ritual, and an Ursarctic in hand, you can Tribute the Habakiri to add Murakumo - this can allow you to access Futsu.</li><li>Use Habakiri's effect to Special Summon (ideally Saji or Aramasa) BEFORE you Tribute it with an Ursarctic monster.</li><li>If you have nothing good to add to your hand off of your Mitsurugi cards, add Habakiri. It's a great tribute and can be used as discard fodder for some of your other cards if need be.</li><li>If you have a Level 4 Mitsurugi monster, a Level 7 Ursarctic, and also a Level 8 Ursarctic Tuner, Synchro Summon Crimson Dragon first, add Synchro Rumble, then revive your Ursarctic Tuner. If you control Crimson Dragon, avoid going into your Ursarctic Synchros unless absolutely necessary. Opt for a Synchro 9 so you can Special Summon Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss.&nbsp;</li><li>Shenshen is TERRIBLE unless you're playing against Mitsurugi or pretty much almost any other deck. Don't risk a bad Maliss matchup and opt for Wolfrayet (if you know what they're playing and it isn't Maliss then just opt for Shenshen)</li><li>Special Summon Fenrir before you do anything else. He's the best bait and utility card we have in the deck.</li><li>Avoid using Droll while your Mitsurugi cards are still live. If you don't want them to access certain cards, you have tools to stop that.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Tech Options</h2><ul><li>Azamina Engine - A 6-card engine I&nbsp;<em>heavily</em> considered and tried out.

When you have two monsters on the field, Link Summon Azalea with these two as materials and pop anything but Azalea. If you have more, use materials and pop in a way that Taotie would point to empty spaces.</p><p>2) When you have destroyed something with Azalea, you can trigger Chronograph, which lets you bring forth itself and Director. There, you can Synchro Summon Z-ARC with Chronograph + Director.</p><p>3) Replace Z-ARC with Arcray and Link Summon Taotie with Azalea + Arcray.</p><p>4) With Chronograph + Z-ARC + Arcray remaining steady at Extra Deck, set Smile + Simochi and end your turn. When it's your opponent's turn, activate Smile and chain into Simochi. By Special Summoning Chronograph + Z-ARC + Arcray with Smile, your opponent would gain LP. However, Simochi converts it into 2000 + 4000 + 4000 = 10000 damage and kills the opponent on the spot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Magicians' Souls"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Trade-In"" can be collected by purchasing ""Origin of the Galaxy"" deck. 90 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Summoner Monk"" can be found within ""True Awakening of the Oathbound Knights"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Chicken Game"" can be found within ""The Most Dangerous Race of the Cosmos!"" Secret Pack to save 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Upstart Goblin"" can be found within ""Bonkers Bikers' Wild Wheels"" Secret Pack to save 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Pseudo Space"" can be found within ""Cyber City Guardians"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Performapal Monkeyboard"" can be found within ""The Bizarre Playing Board"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Taotie Dragon"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Sky Striker Ace - Azalea"" can be found within ""Sky Striker Awakening"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Chronograph Sorcerer"" + ""Supreme King Z-ARC - Synchro Universe"" + ""Odd-Eyes Arcray Dragon"" can be found within ""Counterswing Mages"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 360 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

If it either was a Level 1 monster, or it was a searcher for Mimighoul Spell/Trap cards as well, it would be an amazing card for the archetype, but the fact that it is neither of those makes it harder to use, hence why everyone runs it at 1 copy (imagine a monster that searches on summon being a soft garnet lol). I even wonder if there is a world where you could play Mimighoul without Master. Also, be aware that <a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=40366667"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/40366667.jpg"" data-card=""40366667"" data-name=""Dominus Impulse"">Dominus Impulse</span></a> completely shuts down the Mimighoul effects for the entire duel, I got lucky and didn't have to deal with it though.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the deck. I also attached a video where you can see some nice duels I had, even though it doesn't really showcase the standard Mimighoul combos (you can probably find other videos that explain those though).
