After hitting platinum I swapped to Sky Striker so not sure how it fairs beyond that.

It's a modification of my 2020 OCG deck with minor differences, read it up to understand its combos there.

Some key differences:
<ul>
 	<li>Dragoon is banned, so verte is usually used to fuse Magicians' Souls and Magician Rod together to get Dark Magician/Dark Magician girl on the field (depending which one you already have in GY, go for the other) through fusion deployment, instead of Red Eyes Fusion.</li>
 	<li>Current environment is thriving with decks like Drytron so Nibiru is really great for that, though if you run into too much Eldritch you may take 1 out, or both.</li>
 	<li>Palladium Oracle Mana isn't in so it kind of hurts a bit. Otherwise, if you can get number 42 out, you could summon Ip, vertes, and union train equip mana, and summon Mekkknight Crusadia next turn, dumping all 4 Soul Servant cards in the GY for insane draw. Moreover Mana just helps giving you a sticky board and some protection which is always nice, especially since you should not rely on eterneral soul too much.</li>
 	<li>Currently Illusion of Chaos is also not available yet, but highly recommend going all three, really helps with bricking problem.</li>
</ul>"

Though OTKs are what most Cyber Dragon decks are known for the purpose of this Cyber Dragon deck build deck is to be a control beatdown deck using Cybernetic Overflow to help control, Cyber Dragon Infinity to help stun, and Cyberload Fusion to help push for OTK. There are various ways to go into Cyber Dragon Nova and Cyber Dragon Infinity YET timing their summons is crucial. Several times going into Cyber Dragon Nova and Cyber Dragon Infinity is not necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck build runs 3 copies of Cybernetic Overflow to help control and 2 copies of Cyberload Fusion to take full advantage of Cybernetic Overflow's banishing costs (Keep in mind that if Cybernetic Overflow is destroyed while on field it becomes an extender by helping add 1 ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap from deck to hand). Machine Duplication is a VERY powerful card and is ran at 2, 3 can become bricks. (Helps go into Cyber Dragon Nova which can then go into Cyber Dragon Infinity very quickly). Cyber Repair Plant is ran at 3 to further help deck search especially when needing to search for Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju. (Can easily be ran at 2 or 1 depending on preference). Foolish Burial is primarily used to trigger Cyber Dragon Herz (Can also be used to set up a Cyber Dragon in GY if Cyber Dragon Nachster is in hand for Cyber Dragon Nachster to be normal or special summoned to then target Cyber Dragon in GY and special summon it OR to have more Cyber Dragon variety in GY for Cybernetic Overflow's banishing costs). One for One is primarily used to help set up a board for Machine Duplication though One for One can be used in many different ways depending on resources on field, hand and grave (Can be used to send Cyber Dragon Herz from hand to GY to trigger Herz effect, Can be used to special summon Herz to trigger Herz special summon effect, Can be used to special summon Cyber Dragon Nachster to trigger Cyber Dragon Nachster's effect, Can be used to help set the board for a Cyber Dragon Drei normal summon effect, Can be used to have variance for Cybernetic Overflow). Running 2 Cyber Dragon Sieger, 2 Chimeratech Fortress Dragon and 2 Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon makes this build a bit more competitive and can easily be done by taking out the 3 Cyberdark fusion monsters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Key Takeaways:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragon Core - Literally the core of this deck. Normal summon to add 1 ""Cyber"" Spell/trap from deck to hand. Can literally search all ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap cards including Cyberdark spells and traps. Cyber Dragon Core can be targeted by Machine Duplication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Emergency - Literally the extender of this deck. Adds 1 ""Cyber Dragon"" monster from deck to hand or 1 Light machine monster that cannot be normal summoned/Set (Cyber Eltanin)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragon Herz - When Special summoned its level becomes 5. When sent to graveyard it allows to to add 1 ""Cyber Dragon"" from Deck or GY to hand. (Keep in mind all monsters in this deck build are considered ""Cyber Dragon"" when on field or graveyard, allowing Cyber Dragon Herz to add any Cyber Dragon monsters from graveyard back to hand). Cyber Dragon Herz can be targeted by Machine Duplication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragon Nachster - When normal or special summoned you can target 1 machine monster with 2100 ATK or DEF in your GY, special summon it. (Ideal combo is to special summon Cyber Dragon Nachster from hand by sending an original Cyber Dragon from hand to GY then targeting that sent Cyber Dragon in GY and special summoning it. Targets that Cyber Dragon Nachster can special summon from graveyard are Cyber Dragon, Cyber Dragon Nova,Cyber Dragon Infinity, Cyberdark Chimera. Cyber Twin Dragon, and Chimeratech Rampage Dragon) Cyber Dragon Nachster can be targeted by Machine Duplication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragon Drei - When normal summoned you can make all ""Cyber Dragon"" you currently control become level 5. (Ideal combo for Cyber Dragon Drei is activating Cyber Dragon Nachster effect in hand to special summon Cyber Dragon Nachster then following up with normal summoning Cyber Dragon Drei to convert all Cyber Dragon monsters on field to LVL 5 then to go into Cyber Dragon Nova and Cyber Dragon Infinity). Another way to make Cyber Dragon Nova is by having Cyber Dragon Vier in hand when normal summoning Cyber Dragon Drei. (When normal summoned Cyber Dragon Drei's effect can be activated AND Cyber Dragon Vier's special summon effect can be chained to Cyber Dragon Drei's effect to make both Cyber Dragon Drei and Cyber Dragon Vier level 5).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragon Vier - Can be Special summoned from hand in DEF position if you normal or special summon ""Cyber Dragon"". Gives each ""Cyber Dragon: you control a 500 ATK and DEF boost. (This is a special summon after summoning any Cyber Dragon monster. Helps have resources for going into Cyber Dragon Sieger AND can be chained to Cyber Dragon Drei's normal summon effect to help make resources for Cyber Dragon Nova).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Eltanin - helps clear the board; when summoned, sends all monsters on the field to the GY. Can be searched with Cyber Emergency and Cyber Repair Plant. Cyber Eltanin's special summon requirements also helps push all Cyber Dragon variants from fiedl and GY to the banish pile setting up resources for a Cyberload Fusion OTK.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jizukiru, Kaiju - helps get rid of an opponent's OMNI negate and can be contact fused with any ""Cyber Dragon"" on the field to make Chimeratech Fortress Dragon. Can also be used to make Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon if opponent has a monster in an extra monster zone. Can only be searched with Cyber Repair Plant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyberdark Side Deck&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyberdark cards can easily be swapped in by cutting down on ""3 ofs"" and ""2 ofs"".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When swapping in Cyberdark cards please keep in mind that this dilutes the Cyber Dragon&nbsp;</p><p>deck build consistency. Having familiarity with how how Cyber Dragon and Cyberdark work individually vastly helps. When familiarized and when playing a hybrid deck more than not Cyber Dragon and Cyberdark build on top of another. Both Cyber Dragon Core and Cybernetic Overflow strongly support both archetypes due to how both are capable of searching any Cyber spell/trap.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally these are the cards that are removed from the main deck and the whole side deck is then swapped in to make a Cyber Dragon/Cyberdark deck:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragon Herz (-1)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Drago Nachster (-1)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragon Drei (-1)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragon Vier (-1)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju (-1)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Eltanin (-1)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Emergency (-1)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Repair Plant (-1)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Revsystem (-1)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyberload Fusion (-1)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Machine Duplication (-1)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Red Reboot (-1)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Infinite Impermanence (-3)</p>"

No, Yu-Gi-Oh! and My Hero Academia aren't doing a collab. I just couldn't think of any good My Hero Academia references to name this deck. Anyways, in late January 2022, the first TCG banlist for that year was announced. Fusion Destiny and A Hero Lives both got put to 2, which means HERO decks weren't affected too badly.

&nbsp;

Anyways, this HERO deck uses 2 copies of D - Force instead of Evil HERO Adusted Gold and Dark Calling, to both search Destiny HERO - Plasma and screw over your opponent while you've got Plasma out! Fret not! Adusted Gold and Dark Calling are both in the Side Deck, alongside more competitve cards! You can either go first with this deck, or go second."

Also, Lava Golem + Gozen Match/Rivalry of Warlords, is pretty strong and annoying locking your opponent to Fire or Fiend. Against Swordsoul and PK its strong.

&nbsp;

<span>Rivalry won't be as strong next meta because PK and Swordsoul will dominate as DIS (Dogmatika, Invoker, Shadoll) won't be as played as much with the recent small nerf. But with the new brave Engine it will actually mess up a lot of decks that use Brave engine, due to the token being a fairy, as a lot of rouge decks that use brave engine will start to pop up and may become meta like ABC's. </span>

&nbsp;

<span>Side deck is probably weird, but this is for the next <strong>Meta. </strong></span>

<span>Dark bribe in General is a trash card and you're wondering why not just run the 3rd judgment? After play testing you are using a shit ton of life points from solemn judgement, solemn strike, and the 3 skill drains. you will always be on the edge of life points, and I've had dead cards like strike and skill drain because I've used so much life points especially solemn judgment due to force negate like lightning storm and twin twisters of course I could always use Eldlich to just dump dead cards. In a floodgate/stun deck, it's not a bad card letting your opponent draw one card while skill drained, gozen matched, etc, it isn't going to do much. Letting your opponent Draw one card unless they draw another spell/trap removal it's not a bad card. If I had 5 back row and had some floodgate cards like summon limit or solemn strike, they lightning storm me I would rather dark bribe than solemn judgment. Also, you won't get psy-gamma and can stop cosmic cyclone.</span>

<span>Why Summon limit? A strong going first turn card, shuts down every combo decks. but it's just my personal preference. </span>

Reason why I run 3 twin twisters instead of 3 lightning storm is because after play testing <b>a lot </b>of people have been siding royal degrees. The issue with lighting storm is when u flip a floodgate card like gozen match you can't activate lightning storm of course u have ways like using Eldlich but twin twisters just way more reliable removing royal degree and back row because it's a quick spell.

Artifact lancea &gt; Iron wall, Lancea is strong against evenly match and cosmic cyclone.  The imperial iron wall is extremely strong against in mirror match or decks that banishes a lot more than you but use it wisely as it hurts you as well, but you have the power to pop your own iron wall.

You're going 2nd cards lava, golem, super poly, and Lancea.

&nbsp;

<span>your super poly targets and when to side super poly in.</span>

<span>1.Eldlich the Mad Golden Lord (Eldlich"" monster + 1 Level 5 or higher Zombie monster) Good for Mirror match or for some reason zombie decks.</span>

<span>2. Predaplant Triphyoverutum (3 DARK monsters on the field) This game can win you games it has a really good effect and u can target 3 dark monsters very powerful against Phantom knights </span>

3. Starving Venom Fusion Dragon (2 DARK monsters on the field, except Tokens) Good against Phantom Knights or combine it with Verte and Dragoon

4. Mudragon of the Swamp (2 monsters with the same Attribute but different Types) Another good backup fusion.

5. Prank-Kids Weather Washer - (2 ""Prank-Kids"" monsters) Prank kids. Becoming meta this format.

Hi there,

so the strat of this deck is... well... make cool looking boss monsters, of whom my favorite is Avramax without a doubt. :D

There are little engines to acomplishe that goal. Also there are a lot of broken draw cards as in any good anime character deck from the DM era in this deck.

The strategy is simple-beat over your opponent by dancing their butts off (Leo Dancer+a link boss monster or another copy of itself. Preferably with Chick banished for no battle phase shenanigans.)

<strong>Core Ratios:</strong>

<span>Main Deck </span>

3)

<em>Tiger</em> because soft One Per Turn clauses are easily subverted by bouncing. Also a<em> Daruma Doll</em> target for backrow popping/revivial

<em>Marten</em> because you can bounce <em>Tiger</em> and get more fusion/link material through its revival(or go into <em>Tiger King</em>)

<em>Kaldeo Chick</em> because 1)dumping for cost means negates don't affect the dumping, 2)you can cheat our your fusions with the name change, 3)battle protection means no 3500 damage to you via <em>Magic Cylinder</em>, and 4)<em>Polymerization</em> recycling. Also level 4 for <em>Tiger King</em>.

<em>Lunalight Fusion</em>, despite being a Hard Once Per Turn, means you can get <em>Leo Dancer</em> out with two Lunalight Monsters in hand and an Extra Deck on the opp's field. Also searchable by <em>Marten</em>.

<em>Luna Light Perfume</em> (which, do note, is NOT searchable by <em>Marten</em> because of that extra space in ""Luna Light"") is archetypal Revival and Deck searching, not Once Per Turn. Need I say more?

2)

<em>White Rabbit</em> is nice revival and backrow bouncing, but having the revival on normal summon is rough due to Chick usually being a better call.

<em>Emerald Bird</em> is nice recovery, helps un-brick hands and get other Lunalights into grave and yet another Tiger King material...but <em>Chick</em> is still a better normal summon, and the discard can be a bit awkward.

<em>Black Sheep</em>...honestly could be at 3, since it pays for itself through both of its effects, but I find that it being in your opening hand with no other lunalights in hand can be rough.

<em>Allure of Darkness</em> because you run a lot of Darks, but you do have the occasional Light monster. I can see this at 3 if you can take the risk.

1)

<em>Tenki</em> honestly could also be at 3 since it is an amazing searcher, but usually 1 does the job enough for me. More room for handtraps.

<em>Foolish Burial Goods</em> could also be at three since it gets <em>Perfume</em> and <em>Serenade Dance</em> into grave, but as one who doesn't run Pots, hand space can be tight.

<em>Purple Butterfly</em> is nice attack boosting and gets Lunalights out of  your hand, but I would rather see it more in grave than in hand.

<em>Blue Cat</em> because you only need one for the atk boost and sadly Mystic Tomato strats in this day and age aren't nearly as viable with all the negates and banishing.

<em>Crimson Fox</em> is nice targeting protection and atk dropping which is good for early setup or baiting, but your Big Boss Fusions all have some protection and you have other ways of boosting attack.

<em>Polymerization/Fusion Substitute</em> since you can recover both via <em>Chick</em>...but you also have<em> Lunalight Fusion</em>.

<em>Serenade Dance</em> is something you want to see in grave far more than in hand for the revival effect, but at least is a target for <em>Martin</em> in a pinch and an extra card for <em>White Rabbit</em> bouncing (remember, Lunalight <strong><em>cards</em></strong>, not just Monsters).

<em>Revolt</em> because it is a nice way to recover your banished monsters...but you probably have your other <em>Tri-Brigade</em> links in the grave barring <em>Shuraig</em>, so having more than one can be dead draws.

&nbsp;

<span>Extra Deck</span>

2)

All fusions but <em>Cat Dancer</em>-Two <em>Leo Dancers</em> are more than enough to OTK, Two <em>Saber Dancers</em> to have one on field and one for the attack boost, Two <em>Panther Dancers</em> in case they banish your first from the grave.

1)

<em>Cat Dancer</em> mostly because you'll be dumping <em>Panther Dancer</em> through <em>Chick</em> instead. Is a nice first turn option if you can't get to <em>Leo Dancer</em>, though.

<em>Tri-Brigade</em> links are pretty much to get a banish off the field or to link climb into your other archetypal boss monsters.

<em>Daruma Doll</em> is nice backrow removal and helps link climb.

&nbsp;

<strong>Optional Staples</strong>

<span>Main Deck</span>

<em>Maxx C</em> gives you a free turn to OTK or helps unbrick a hand.

<em>Called by The Grave</em> makes sure no Ashes ruin your Perfume searches.

<em>Forbidden Droplet</em> since it gets things into grave as well as negates your opp's boss monster

<em>Twin Twisters</em> and <em>Harpies' Feather Duster</em> because, since this is Best of 1, backrow removal is a good bit more important if you don't want <em>Eldlich/Sky Striker</em> to ruin your day.

<em>Raigeki/Lightning Storm</em> because nothing is more funny than blowing up a field that your opponent played Solitaire to get.

<em>Monster Reborn</em> because being a lesser <em>Luna Light Perfume</em> is still pretty nice.

<span>Extra Deck</span>

<em>Accesscode</em> OTK's with a Link 3 material and <em>Leo Dancer</em>, though I can see <em>Borrelsword </em>being here as well.

<em>Masquerena</em> gives your Link-4 Boss monsters some protection

<em>Avramax </em>is more of a first turn option, since it is an annoyance to get off the field with <em>Masquerena</em> protection and can't be beaten over unless they force a negate.

&nbsp;

This is probably not the most optimized build, so modify this at your leisure, but I feel this is a decent skeleton for the Lunalight deck in Master Duel. Have fun dancing your way to OTKs!

&nbsp;

the card in side deck are tech you could used in the deck (in TCG I run the third hope and top share instead of 2x maxx ""c"", top share is fantastic since boost deck speed a lot but it isn't available in master duel yet, so you might want to run card like sales pitch or triple tactics instead if you don't like maxx ""c""), also for extra deck I find using 2x each numeron rank 1, 2x saryuja and the rest run boss monsters give better results but as is i don't have enough UR frags for it nor want to commit that much so it's 13 numeron + saryuja + 1 boss for now"

The Dogma cards are mainly there to give you some control if you open a bad hand but with this list with a semi decent hand you should be able to end on Shuraig, Dragoon and maybe 1 melffy xyz if you have the extra materials.

If you have any suggestions either for a different Dogma package or want to show me a better decklist pls feel free I love learning more and seeing how other decks play.

Enjoy this list and if you use it a do well let me know.

Well not anymore! 
(The Deck Description is the size of a Steven King novel, so make sure","One of the first things you might notice, this deck has 45 cards. Feel free to remove 5, but I feel like it's better to have 5 extra cards. Utopia is a great deck. While it used to be an OTK tool with Utopia Double and Double or Nothing, it's now able to produce actual negates and good interactions. So lets do the card by card for the deck.

Main Deck.

The Onomat Trio: Utopic Onomatopoeia x2, Zubababancho Gagagacoat, and Dodododwarf Gogogoglove. These 3 cards are the main cards of the deck. If you can get 2 of these on board, you get a rank 4. If you get 2 of these on board and any other lvl 4, you can get 2 rank 4s. Zubababancho Gagagacoat can revive any Gogogo or Dododo in your graveyard, and Dodododwarf Gogogoglove can revive itself if you have another Gogogo/Dododo on your field. This means that you can cycle these level 4s every turn, mid combo, and when trying to rebuild a broken board.

The ZS's: ZS - Ascended Sage x2, ZS Armed Sage x2. These 2 ZS's allow for you to get free special summons and free cards. Ascended sage allows you to summon itself when you have no cards on field, and Armed sage when you have only 1 monster. But be very careful. If you activate a card like Onomatopickup, a continuous spell (I'll get to it in a minute,) You can't special summon Ascended Sage. But you can still normal it. And now take that same situation, you activate Pickup, then summon a lvl 4. Armed sage says ""The only monster you control is a lvl 4 or lower"" So even if you have a spell/trap on the field, it can be summoned.

Astral Cards: Astral Kuriboh x2 and Astraltopia x2 These 2 monsters are also free special summons, but with a few more restrictions. Astral Kuriboh allows you to reveal any Number in the extra deck, and summon it. Then its level is equal to it's rank. But guess what? It can be any level. While in Utopic, the only level you want to have it be is level 4, if you splash it into any other deck that plays numbers, you have a free summon of any level you need. When it is summoned, be careful. Because it Locks you into numbers while it's on the field. As soon it's used for an Xyz though, that lock goes away. In addition to being a free summon of any level, the monster you summon with Astral Kuriboh can't be destroyed by battle or card effect. So you can wall up with this card in a pinch. And Astraltopia, the better card. ""If an Xyz monsters(s) is on the field: You can special summon this card from your hand."" Notice how this is the Field, not your side of the field. In addition of that effect, it can send 1 card from the hand or field (which you have numerus targets to send, and yes, pun intended) to add one Xyz, Onomat, Zexal, or Number S/t from the deck to the hand. This means that if you go 2nd, you can summon this if the opponent has an xyz, possibly bait out a negate, and keep your normal summon. If not, you can still search MANY cards. As I go through the list, I'll point out the cards to search.

Onomat Spells: Onomatopaira x3, Onomatopickup x3. Onomatopaira allows you to discard 1, add any 2 cards from the Dododo/Gogogo/Gagaga/Zubaba archetype to the hand. This is probably one of the best searchers in all of yugioh. Most of the time, if you have a card from the Onomat trio in your hand, you search the other 2 cards in it and go full combo. If you don't you search Utopic Onomatopoeia (since it's treated as all of those cards) and Zubababancho Gagagacoat. You then normal summon the Utopic Onomat, and summon Bancho. If it's negated with a veiler or impermanence, you can use Bancho's effect in hand to summon it. If it's destroyed by a ghost ogre and snow rabbit, then you still summon Bancho, then revive Utopic Onomat. If it's negated AND destroyed, tough luck. And remember what I said about Paira being the best searcher? Onomatopickup is even better. In your starting hand, if you draw Zubababancho Gagagacoat and Dodododward Gogogoglove, but no Utopic Onomat, then you can use Pickup to search just that. No Discards. Side Note: These two cards are great search targets off of Astraltopia if you haven't normal summoned.

Reinforcement of the Army: Add any lvl 4 or lower warrior. It's a great searcher, and the only 2 targets we can't add are Dodododwarf Gogogoglove and Astral Kuriboh.

Zexal Construction x3: This card is amazing as well. (I've said that about 4 cards now I think.) It allows you to shuffle one of your garnets into the deck, or a useless card. Then you can add one of 5 archetypes, even though we aren't playing any Rank-Down-Magic cards. I'll also show you the garnets that you'll want to shuffle back with this.

Zexal Entrust x1: This card is mostly a search target for niche things. It's a great extender allowing you to summon a ZS from the gy, or a ZW if you want to buff your Xyz a little more. Summon a Utopia is only useful for one situation, which can only happen if you misplay in a BIG way. It also has a gy effect! If you're 2000 lp lower than your opponent, you can add another Zexal card from the gy to the hand. Our only target is Construction, but it is really good. Side Note: Great target to search with Construction &amp; Astraltopia.

Hyper Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce x1: Yes, that's the name. This card is searchable off of Construction and ZS Ascended Sage. This allows you to go into a 4 material Dragonar (Which I'll get to in a minute.) And when you summon an Xyz with a Utopia/Utopics effect, you get to attach this card to it as material. One of the best Rank-Up-Magic cards out there.

Numbers Protect x1: It's an Omni negate that is also a counter trap. It's searchable off of Astraltopia, and it has a gy effect to bring itself back. Need I say more?

Xyz Change Tactics x2: Pay 500 every Xyz summon of a Utopia, draw 1. No Once per turn. This card can be searched off of Astraltopia, and is a great way to set up for next turn.

Double or nothing x2: This is only useful for Utopia Double into Utopia for 10k damage, but otherwise, just a search target so Utopia Double can rank itself up.

The ZW's: Tornado Bringer, Lightning Blade, Pegasus Twin Saber x1. These can be searched by Construction, and by Armed Sage.  Tornado bringer allows you to equip it to a Utopia, and it gets 1300 atk with the ability to not be targeted. Lightning Blade gives it 1200 attack, and ZW's can't be destroyed. Pegasus Twin Saber can equip from the Field (keep that in mind) and give it 1000 attack. Pegasus has the additional effect to negate any monster effect that activates on the field. This can ignore chain blocking, and they can't respond to it since it doesn't activate. The only problem with this is that you have to either equip it from deck, or summon it. And it's a level 5 monster. It does have a way to summon itself though! If you're lp are 2000 lower than your opponents, you can summon it for free. This can be done with Xyz Change tactics, summon 4 Utopics. Which is actually really easy with the right hand.

Tech Cards: Called By the grave x1, Feather Duster x1, Monster Reborn x1: Called by the grave is a way to protect yourself from HT, since an ash blossom on a Paira will devastate you, essentially ending the turn. It's also a negate for GY decks. Feather duster for backrow, since the only other card we have is Tornado Dragon, meaning that a mystic mine when you don't have tornado is an FTK. it's also good for generic Backrow decks, like Eldlich (With 3 Skill Drain might I add) and Guru. Lastly, Reborn. The most common level in the game is level 4, and any level 4 and a reborn means you can go off from there. You can reborn one of your cards, one of your opponents, it's great.

Forbidden Droplet x2: This is a tech card, but it needs its own category. Utopia decks have a lot of cards that get used once and that's it. For example, you go full combo with an Xyz Change Tactics, you have Droplet. After going for a full combo, you'll only have a few Utopias left to summon, making Tactics a great target to send. Then you have the ZWs, good cards, but a Tornado Bringer isn't good against a deck that doesn't target. And you still have Onomatopickup, which has an on field effect only good for Tag Duels and if you summon a ZW. And the last card, Double Or Nothing, is useless after full combo. Since we're only playing 1 Number 39: Utopia, and full combo uses it for Dragonar, you can't use the Double or nothing in hand anymore.

HT: Ash Blossom x3, Infinite Impermanence x3: Ash is great, Impermanence is great. You can replace these with the HT of your choice, but my personal choice are these.

&nbsp;

Extra Deck: Number 99: Utopia Dragonar x2. This is insane. Not just for Utopia, but for all number decks. When you do your combo, this has 4 materials. And it can use 2 materials to summon any 1 number that has a number between 1 and 100 in the text (So no, you can't make a iC1000 FTK deck.) as a quick effect. This means you can summon a card during your turn, then on the opponents. Targets for this include: Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon, Number 38 hope Harbinger, Number 23, Lancelot, Dark Knight of the Underworld, Number 100; Numeron Dragon. I'll go over these cards seperately.

Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon. For the millionth time, this card is insane. During the ep, detatch one, banish all cards your opponent controls that have been summoned or set this turn. Including s/t cards. If the opponent can't go through 3 negates, you can use this to kick them while they're down, and banish their floodgates, their traps, their Droplets. And if your opponent has a monster with high attack, and they have low lp, you can crash this into that monster and they take the damage. And on top of that, if it's destroyed by a card effect while it has xyz Material, which will almost never happen, it gets 1000 attack for every card that is banished. And if you're against a Swordsoul deck, or a Gren Maju deck that banished 3x Gren Maju, then you'll have just a few attack points to attack for lethal over the opponents 30k attack Gren Maju.

Number 38: Hope Harbinger. It's a spell negate, it's can attach a spell as Material. Great against Sky Striker decks, or any deck that use a lot of spells. And in a Mirror, you can attach an opponents Hyper Rank up Magic.

Number 23: Lancelot. This is a weird card. The first two effects it has are useless, so forget about those. This card is an omni negate. Nothing else to say about that. But it's a mandatory negate. If you  activate a card while it still has materials, you will be negating yourself. So be extra careful.

Numeron Dragon. This card needs no introduction. Detach one, gain a million atk. When summoning off of a Dragonar, this will have a minimum of 13000 attack. Compare that to Draglubion, making it 9k. Still a lot, but it almost never will OTK when the opponent is at 8k.

Leo Utopia Ray. It can detatch one, equip a ZW from the deck to itself. This allows it to become two negates. The first, by its own effect, being able to target a card on the field and negate and half its attack permanently. The 2nd negate is Pegasus Twin Saber, which we talked about earlier. You will only be getting the Pegasus twin saber, since you'll only have 1 material for it. If you drew the Pegasus twin saber, or are worried about targeted removal, get Tornado bringer.

Utopia Double x2; This card allows us to rank up into any Utopic monster in the extra deck. If we only have 2 level 4s, Utopia double into Leo will be good. For an OTK strategy, you can either go for Utopia Double into a Utopia for the classic 10k, or after the main combo, or if Hyper Rank up Magic is in the gy, you can Utopia double into a Dragonar, summoning a Numeron Dragon for 13k.

Number 39: Utopia. It allows us to go for a Dragonar, and OTK with a 10k beater.

Number S39: Utopia Prime. The Effect miiiggght be used, but almost never. The only other use is Dragonar, giving it another material. You can replace this with C39: Utopia Ray.

Tornado Dragon. This allows us to get 1. a Non-number rank 4 onto the field (you'll see why) and some free s/t removal.

ZS - Utopic Sage. This allows us to summon a ZS to the field, and in extension, add any Rank up magic or ZW to hand It's also the 2nd non number rank 4. Why would we need non number rank 4s?

Utopic Future &amp; Utopic Future Draco. These cards can be built into the main combo. Utopic Future allows us to steal a monster the opponent controls for the battle phase, and Future Draco is a monster negate and it's able to take control of a negated monster effect if it's on the field.

Side Deck: You can do anything for it, but my personal choice is to have a Number 89 in there, along with ht and Mystic Mine hate.

Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker. Its good for decks that rely on one card in their extra deck that they only have one of. Also FTK decks, but that's a niche use.

Nibiru: Going 2nd tool against ss decks.

Gameciel: Good against tower decks, could possibly replace this with Evenly.

Lancea: Good for banish decks like Swordsoul.

Token Collector: Good against Swordsoul and Brave Token decks.

Droll &amp; Lock Birb: Good for decks that search the entire deck.

The Mystic Mine hate: This deck is mostly for casual, but is still good for meta play. And before you ask, Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell is a card I chose to put in there on purpose.

The Combos.

Ascended Sage Combo: End board = Leo Utopia Ray, Pegasus twin saber, Dragonar, Lancelot, and a Hear-eartH/Number 38 on the opponents turn.

Starting hand must include: A way to get to any of the 2 Onomat trio + ZS Ascended sage.

Summon Ascended Sage.

Summon the 2 Onomat Trio.

If the two cards are:

Utopic Onomatopoeia &amp; Dodododwarf: Use Dodododwarf + ZS Ascended Sage for a Utopia Double. Use double, add Rank Up Magic Utopiforce, use Double again, detach Dodododwarf, go into a Leo. Use Dwarf effect in the GY, summon it back.

Utopic Onomatopoeia &amp; Zubababancho: Use Onomatopoeia + ZS Ascended Sage for a Utopia Double. Use double, add Rank Up Magic Utopiforce, use Double again,  detach Onomatopoeia, go into a Leo. Use Coat effect, summon the Onomatopoeia back.

Dodododwarf &amp; Zubababancho: Use Dodododwarf + ZS Ascended Sage for a Utopia Double. Use double, add Rank Up Magic Utopiforce, use Double again,  detach Dodododwarf, go into a Leo. Use Coat effect, summon the Dwarf back.

Use the 2 level 4s to go into a Utopia, use Utopia to go into Utopia Prime, then use Utopiforce to go into Dragonar. Before using Dragonar, use Leos effect to equip Pegasus twin saber to it as material. Now use Dragonar, summon the Number 23, Lancelot. Use Utopiforce in gy to attach itself as material. During the opponents turn, wait until they activate something and Lancelot negates to use Dragonar. Summon Number 38, or Heart-eartH dragon during the ep, depending on what deck you think they have.

Main Combo: This one's a doozy. End board: Leo Utopia Ray, Pegasus Twin Saber, Dragonar with 2 materials, and Utopic Draco Future.

Starting hand: A way to get to all 3 of the Onomat Trio.

Summon Utopic Onomat, use the effect, summon Dwarf and coat from your hand.

Use Utopic Onomat &amp; Dwarf to go into ZS - Utopic Sage.

Use Sage effect, summon ZS - Ascended Sage.

Use Coat effect, summon Utopic Onomat.

Use Dwarf effect in gy, ss itself.

Use any of the onomat cards and Ascended Sage, go into Number 39: Utopia.

Use Effect, add Utopiforce.

Go into Utopia Prime.

Use Utopiforce, summon Dragonar.

Use Dragonar, summon Leo.

Use Utopiforce in gy: Attach to Leo.

Use the other 2 level 4s on the field, go into Tornado Dragon.

Use tornado dragon + Utopic Sage. Go into F0 Utopic Future. Then go into F0 Utopic Future Draco.

Use Leo, equip Pegasus Twin Saber.

This gets you 3 monster negates, and then either an Omni Negate, a Spell negate that you can do multiple times during the duel, and then a Heart-eartH dragon at the end phase.

Small Side note for main combo: If you have a way to get all 3 of the Onomat trio + Astraltopia, you can go even further beyond.

You do the main combo, but when you get to the part where you summon Utopic Sage, instead summon Utopia Double.

Then use Double to go into leo, use leo to make sure you still have the two Onomats in the grave.

Then summon them back with Coat and the gy effect of Dwarf, then summon Utopic Sage now.

Use sage, summon Ascended sage, then do the Dragonar line with Utopia, Utopia Prime, and Utopiforce.

Before activating Dragonar though, summon the Astraltopia, and use the effect sending the Double or nothing searched by utopia Double to add Zexal Entrust.

Now use Dragonar, and make sure to detatch ZS - Ascended Sage, and go for a number 38. Activate Entrust, bring back the Ascended Sage, and go for Tornado, and then Utopic Future into Utopic Draco Future.

If you discard a ZS when getting to the 3 Onomat cards, by means of Onomatopaira, you wait to use dragonar, then use entrust to summon the discarded ZS, and  you make Future Draco. Then summon Lancelot off of Dragonar.

Thank you for going through the guide and dedicating a good 2-3 hours into reading, and good luck, have fun!

(Last side note, I swear. This deck is completely legal in Master Duel, so consider using this if you're willing to spend a few hundred more!)

<strong>How does this deck work?</strong>

Here, we want to control the field.

Zombie World is a powerful field that changes every monster(s) on the field and the GY into zombies. Some decks face huge problems with this (eg. Tri-brigade).

You need that field ON as soon as possible. This is the heart of the deck.

Now, let's talk about our boss monster: Balerdroch. Very easy to summon, once it's on the field it can negate zombies monsters' effects and banish one monster from play or graveyard. That makes him a difficult monster to deal with. That's why we need Zombie World: as opponent's monsters become zombies you can chain their effects with Balerdroch.

Then, if you manage to draw ""Rivalry of the Warlords"" your victory is getting closer. What does Rivalry? Once on the field each player can control only 1 monster type. So, if Zombie World is ON, your opponent cannot summon from his hand/deck/extra-deck as long as he has a monster on his field that is zombie. A very powerful tool that locks completely your opponent.

<strong>Key cards</strong>

- Uni-Zombie: it's our combo starter. You can foolish a zombie monster from the deck and discard from the hand. Both effect once per turn.
Targets: Banshee Necroworld, Mezuki, Gozuki, Glow-Up Bloom, Balerdroch...

- Banshee Necroworld: By banishing it from the graveyard or field you can activate a ""Zombie World"" from your deck or hand.

- Mezuki: by banishing it from the graveyard you can target one of your zombie monsters in the GY and special summon it. The good news here is that effect is not once per turn!

- Solitaire Shiranui: Its role is to increase our chances to get Uni-Zombie in our first hand. By tributing a zombie monster (you can tribute that card) you can special summon a tuner/zombie monster from your deck. Target will usually be Uni-Zombie but you can search Glow-up Bloom as well if you need it.

- Gozuki: Another combo starter but less powerful than Uni-Zombie. It can foolish from the deck too + if sent to the GY you can banish another monster in it and special summon a zombie monster from your hand.

- Glow-Up Bloom: a tuner monster which role is to be sent to the graveyard in order to special summon a level 5 or more zombie monster on your field (if Zombie World is ON - otherwise you only get the card in your hand). Target : Balerdroch.

<strong>Danger ! cards role</strong>

The Danger archetype is here to make the deck more consistent. To make some 8 rank XYZ. To special summon some big monsters. To destroy some of your opponent's cards. To draw cards.

<strong>Why 3 copies of Crossout?</strong>

The deck is very sensitive to handtraps. Especially the most used one: Ash. If your opponent Ashes Uni-Zombie it will become difficult to start your combos. So, Crossout is here to protect you from Ash.
Crossout can also prevent your opponent from using ""Called by"". That card is also a strong threat to the deck as it can banish and negate Balerdroch trying to return on the field.

Another possibility is to negate for one turn Rivalry if you need to summon a non-zombie monster from your extradeck.

<strong>What is the main combo of the deck?
</strong>
The Halqifibrax one.

To make this combo we only need to activate Zombie World and have Uni-Zombie and another monster. Special summon Halqifibrax by sending Uni-Zombie and the second monster to the GY. Once Halqi is on the field activate its effect that allows you to special summon a tuner monster from your deck or hand. The target is: Glow-up bloom.
At that point, depending on what you have in your hand, two scenarios:

- If you still have Danger ! monster to play, extradeck monsters to summon that are not zombies, do not send Glow-up bloom to the GY until you didn't finish your other combos. Because Glow-up bloom will not allow you to special summon non-zombie monster for the rest of the turn if you used its effect.

- If you don't have anything to do let's special summon Linkuriboh by using Glow-Up bloom. Once Glow-up Bloom is sent to the GY you can activate its effect and special summon Balerdroch.

Use Balerdroch and your Linkuriboh to make Vampire Sucker. Then, end your turn.

At the opponent's standbyphase you will revive your Balerdroch. That will trigger Vampire Sucker's effect: you draw 1 card.

When your opponent summon a monster, activate Halqifibrax's effect: it will banish itself in order to summon a tuner synchro monster from your extradeck. Target: Formula Synchron. Once Formula Synchron hits the field you can activate its effect and draw 1 card.

Formula Synchron has a second effect that allows you to perform a synchro summon during your opponent's turn. The target is Shiranui Sunsaga. Before doing this, be sure you used the effects of Balerdroch. Once Sunsaga is on the field you can at any moment return synchro zombie monster(s) that are in the GY or banished to your extradeck and destroy the same amount of cards your opponent controls.

This combo if not interrupted by your opponent can lead you to an easy win.

Have fun with this deck!"

This deck was built during the","!WARNING! This deck runs 3 Pot of Desires but because Master Duel runs on this weird banlist I had to replace it with another pot of card. So if you're making it in Master Duel, 3 pot, if you're doing this in Omega or the real OCG, you might have to run another draw card. !WARNING!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FTK aspect of this deck can be simplified to this.

You need either 2 dark room of nightmare or dark room and 1 light stage mixed with a continue, in the case of 2 desires that would be a live stage, in the case of light stage, festival and magical lauriel would be the most optimal thing to add to hand, but this option is a bit rough as you have to focus even more on placement of tokens as to optimally squeeze all the effect damage out of holly angel.

Ok, if you have either of these set ups the combo is simple
<ol>
 	<li>Try to bait out Ash with canadina or one of your other special summons. If you can do this, you can set up the rest of your plays without the fear of interruption in 90% of cases. (If you often get screwed by nibiru you can switch out droll and called by for nibiru and crossout designator.)</li>
 	<li>If you make it out alive, you can use your whatever extender you have, whether its Festival, or live stage, or another trick star to start setting up for the combo. Go into Bloom (Link 1) and then into Holly Angel if you know you will be safe. This way if you pull Magical Lauriel you will have a target that can assist you into another link monster.</li>
 	<li>Heres where the magic happens. Link summon into everything you possibly can. But if you have a dead trickstar in your hand and feel like gambling, link into crimson heart and see what the luck of the draw gives you. You could get a good card like an extender, or you can get a dead card, like a nibiru or droll and lock.</li>
 	<li>When you come to the point where you can make the link 4 you have 1 job. place Bella Madonna ANYWHERE that doesn't point to a monster. By this point Bella will do 1000-1600 damage on her own, which will probably be the FTK, and if not, they'll be really close.</li>
</ol>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now know this deck can work through Ash blossom and does not only work as an FTK deck, Festival can protect Trickstars from destruction, Holly Angel gains attack everytime burn damage is inflicted, and you have some good turn 1 effects like Divaridis who if you go up against a heavy special summon deck its like playing with Maxx C but instead of maximum draw power, it's how much health will your enemy have at the end of your combo while Holly Angel is getting 200 attack every summon. So this is a decent Rogue deck with a really fun FTK to try out when the stars align."

Master Duel Platinum 1","<p>Hello this is my Master Duel @Ignister deck profile. I reached plat 1 with it. I'll go over the basic combo + end board. The basic endboard is basically, a 4k Arrival Cyberse + an unaffected Cyberse Quantum Dragon. How to get there through a 1 card combo: Normal summon Achichi --&gt; add Pikari Link achichi for Infant --&gt; Infant adds AI Land Activate AI Land --&gt; summon pikari through AI land Pikari adds AI meet you --&gt; activate ai meet you AI meet you adds Doyon --&gt; Link Pikari and Infant for Cyberse Wicckid Activate AI Land to summon Doyon to a zone Wicckid points to --&gt; CL1 Doyon, CL2 Wicckid. Doyon adds back the monster you've normal summoned, which in our case is Achichi. Wicckid banishes Infant and adds us Bururu. --&gt; Link of Doyon + Wicckid for Transcode Talker --&gt; activate AI land and summon Bururu, you must avoid the zone Transcode Talker points to, since we're using Transcode Talker's effect --&gt; Bururu sends Gatchiri to the GY --&gt; Transcode Talker activates its effect to summon back Wicckid --&gt; Link the 3 units away for Dark Templar --&gt; Activate AI land yet again to summon Achichi --&gt;link away Achichi for Infant, Infant must be summoned to the left most zone of Templar --&gt; activate Templar's effect, CL1 Templar, CL2 Infant --&gt; Change Infant's attribute to Divine and summon three units through Templar's effect --&gt; The three units you will be summoning are: Achichi, Bururu, Pikari, --&gt; Synchro summon, Pikari + Bururu for Cyberse Quantum Dragon --&gt; Activate Bururu's effect to summon back Pikari --&gt; Link Achichi + Pikari for Splash Mage --&gt; Activate Splash mage's effect to summon Gatchiri --&gt; Make Arrival Cyberse with every unit except for Cyberse Quantum Dragon --&gt; Activate Gatchiri effect targetting Cyberse Quantum Dragon to make him unaffected by your opponent's card effects till the end of their turn So, now we have 2 unaffected units, one of them protecting the other. If your opponent attacks Cyberse Quantum Dragon (which they must in order to out Arrival Cyberse) you can activate it's effect to bounce back that monster. This is basically not outable in Master Duel, since the only popular counter are Kaiju's and nobody runs Kaiju's in a 1 game format. I run 1 Crossout Designator as well as 2 Called by the Graves to out possible hadntraps. The limitation on Crossout in Master Duel is super annoying. I've considered running Sauravis as a replacement for atleast Veiler/Imperm, but I do not think it's worth it. </p><p><strong>Pros and Cons</strong> Pros deck: -Very easy to OTK -Good end board -Unexpected, not many people know what @Ignisters do. I had tons of people try and out the unaffected Cyberse Quantum Dragon through stuff like Raigeki, which obviously does not work, but since people don't know what @ignisters do and don't read cards, it's basically a free win. -Genuinely fun to play Cons: -Susceptible to handtraps especially Nibiru, that's why the Crossout's + Called by's are so important. &nbsp;</p>"

The whole point of the Extra Deck is to be a recourse for Dogmatika Punishment.

The deck bricks from time to time, mainly when you don't get the Field Spell or Terraforming, since the Field Spell gets you free tokens and protections when coupled with Sea Stealth Attack, and allows you to use your Phantasm Traps more efficiently as Spells basically"

I present to you a my first variant of this mix, it is still hard around the edges! so lots of room for improvement! also, play 3 teleport, i used 2 just to test it out on edo pro in rooms that would let me.... i didnt want to upload this with out playing with strangers!.

How good is it? its pretty consistent i do say so! it has bricks.... YES! but its fun it can play againtst backrow, and the combo with punks is enabled with:

Ze amin, search Fox lady, foxy tune discard + other send to grave; summon Sharakusai, if you have P U N K in hand fusion in a way you only leave Sharakusai on field (you need him to later synchro 11 on oponents turn with a level 8 myutant). Fusion tributes itsef and you summon form deck Madame spider + (insert any punk lvl3 ot Sharakusai if you used him). Search trap with Madem spider.

Halquifibrax for deskbot, Link 3 Aurorodon and later, 3 tokens, deskbot revives, go into cupid pitch, lower level to form 4 to 3, coral dragon, tribute coral + token with link 3 effect to summon Coltwing, your field should be 4 cards in hand, 2 tokens, Sharakusai, level 10 coltwing + Deskbot 01. (CUPID SEARCH PSYCHIC TRACKER)

with the deskbot you can go into a FA. Dawn dragster, or go for a shooting riser dragon (7*) with the 2 tokens (3+3+1). with shooting star send from deck to grave a level 1 and go to baroness. (for now this part sending a level 1 with nothing to use for it i still dont know what so i would love some help)

if this play started by special summoning Ze Amin with foxy first turn, or teleport, go on to your myutant plays, if you had to normal summon it, hopefully you drew the myutant field spell + a myutant. for now its been very consistent for me to put a the fullboard including a level 8 myutant + fleur + Sharakusai + link 3 and 1-2 facedowns, if you started with normal summon Ze amin but havent used your teleport, use teleport for myutatn combo.

MYUTANT COMBO IS ALWAYS LAST.

Summon either Sangan or Witch Of The Black Forest, use Dark Hole then search for one of the pieces.

Activate Allure Of Darkness at all costs, then banish either Sangan or Witch (you need Battle Fader for stalling).

Use Magical Mallet to get rid of cards you find unnecessary at any specific time during the duel.

Gold Sarcophagus can be used to either slim down the deck so you draw the pieces faster (in this case you banish any other monster that's not an Exodia piece) OR you can banish a piece of Exodia, use Burial From A Different Dimension to send it to your GY (another piece must be face up on the field at this given time), then use Dark Hole or Torrential Tribute to send the face up Exodia piece to the GY. Once this step is complete, you can activate Dark Factory Of Mass Production and retrieve both pieces. ONLY go for second route if you wanna retrieve the piece banished by the Sarcophagus the SAME turn it is banished. I'd do this if only one piece is remaining."

I again found some cards that would make it better, and here it is! The deck contains:

Main:

3 Luster Dragon- Here only as a material for ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon""

3 Nexus- Banish 4 opponent's monsters from GY to be special summoned, destroys all ATK position extra deck monsters, AND inflicts 800 damage for each destroyed. Ideal if your opponent plays Invoked.

3 Fleurdelis- Very easy to special summon, negates effects of an extra deck monster and makes all Dogmatikas gain 500 ATK.

3 Ashyan- Easy to summon, adds a monster from the GY to the hand, and makes all Dogmatikas gain 500 ATK.

3 Theo- Easy to summon, cannot be destroyed by battle and transfers 600 ATK from an opponent's monster to itself.

3 Ecclesia- Literally does 70% of support to a whole deck.

3 Adin- Easy to summon, special summons a Dogmatika monster from the deck.

3 Shaddoll Beast- Requires 1 tribute to be set, +1 if flips, and +1 more if destroyed by effect.

3 White Knight- You cannot summon extra deck monsters, but you can destroy an extra deck monster directly from each extra deck.

1 Cyber-Stein- Limited, so only one we get.

3 Dogmatikalamity- Used just to summon White Knight.

1 Nation- Only one because you can add it with ""Terraforming"". All dogmatikas are immune to the extra deck monsters' effects and destroy a battling monster instead of  themself.

1 Terraforming- Limited, so only one we can have.

1 Monster Reborn- Limited, so only one we can have.

3 Encounter- Not the best, but useful.

3 Infinite Impermanence- A cheap version of ""Ash Blossom"".

3 Genesis- Returns your banished Extra deck monster and negates opponent's.

3 Mirror force- if you go first and get this card, just set it and end turn. Then, your opponent will regret when he attacks you.

Extra:

1 Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon- Super broken and surely the best ever fusion monster.

1 Number 39: Utopia- Not really the best, but very easy to summon.

1 Divine Arsenal AA ZEUS- Sky Thunder- Easy to summon, has at least 2 Xyz materials when summoned, and does a ""Black Hole"" effect, saves itself  from it, and all of that with a price of just 2 Xyz materials.

1 Decode Talker- Super generic and very easy to summon, it is one of the cards that can level up every weak deck.

1 Decode Talker Extended- The same as the normal ""Decode Talker"", but stronger.

1 Accesscode Talker- Very generic, and also very strong. The upgraded version of previous two Talkers.

1 Predaplant Verte Anaconda- A very good fusion support for ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"".

Side:

3 Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring- one of the best hand traps ever, screws pretty much everything.

3 Effect Veiler- Simply negates the effects of one monster.

3 Ghost Ogre- Say goodbye to that monster."

Powerful pure deck build synergy featuring Eda the Sun Magician and versatile extra deck tool,"This deck was built to take full advantage of the whole Charmer / Familiar-Possessed archetype including spells and traps introduced in the Structure Deck: Spirit Charmers. After playing with different deck builds for several months it's become clear that the field spell Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin plays a HUGE role to being able to stun and slightly slow down opponents just enough for Charmers/Familiar Possessed to slightly build a board. This Deck is not at all meta nor the next tier 1 YET it becomes really fun after a learning curve. Spells and Traps are the backbone of this deck and Awakening of the Possessed forms are kept in the deck to help search ""Possessed"" Spell/Traps on top of being able to be special summoned from the Deck with their unique effects.

&nbsp;

The purpose of the deck is to be a stun/control deck revolving around Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin and Eda the Sun Magician. Having Grand Spiritual Art -Ichirin up on the field is VERY important to begin stunning and board building because [1] Grand Spiritual Art -Ichirin negates your opponent's first monster effect as long as a Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF is up on the field and [2] Grand Spiritual Art -Ichirin allows you to push back any Charmer / Familiar-Possessed from hand into the deck to help search for a smaller form of the Awakening of the Possessed monsters (This is a HUGE deal because if you control a Spellcaster monster you can special summon any of the smaller forms from the hand). Eda the Sun Magician's role in this build is VERY important because not only does Eda the Sun Magician fulfill Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin's requirement to be able to negates your opponent's first monster effect, when normal summoned or flipped-up, Eda the Sun Magician grants a special summon of 1 Spellcaster from hand or Deck in face-down defense position AND Eda the Sun Magician's quick effect allows for a disruption of opponents board building by being able change 1 face-down Spellcaster from defense to face-up Attack OR Defense Position. This essentially puts 2 negates up on the board if the proper Charmer is flipped face-up to steal an opponent's monster.

&nbsp;

Spirit Charmers is the important to be able to search any of the ""Charmer"" monsters. ""Familiar-Possessed"" monsters, and/or ""Possessed"" Spells/Traps including Unpossessed. 3 copies of this card is without a doubt necessary for any Charmer/Familiar-Possessed pure deck build. Ideally, Spirit Charmers should be used to help set up backrow to synergy the whole board. A synergized Charmer/Familiar-Possessed board of this pure build should have Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin, Awakening of the Possessed, and Unpossessed all active at once with at least 1 Charmer monster face up in defense position.

&nbsp;

Awakening of the Possessed is the main draw engine and helps beef up all monsters you control by 300 ATK for each different attribute you control. This help clear the board with Familiar-Possessed monsters often times having enough ATK to get through most monsters AND Awakening of the Possessed also helps protect Charmers / Familiar-Possessed monsters from being destroyed by card effects.

&nbsp;

Unpossessed is the main protection for Charmers. When Unpossessed is up Charmer monsters you control can not be destroyed by battle. Not only that but Unpossessed helps boost Familiar-Possessed monsters by giving them an additional 800 ATK when attacking an opponent's monster. On top of all of that whenever a monster you control is destroyed by battle or card effect; Unpossessed lets you special summon a 1 Spellcaster with 1500 DEF from your deck in Attack Position or face-down Defense position.

&nbsp;

Possessed Partnerships for this build is a 3 and here is why. Possessed Partnerships allows you to special summon 1 Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF from your hand or GY in attack position or face-down position, then, if you control monsters with 2 or more different attributes you can destroy 1 face-up card on the field. Depending on how the board looks often times this card is used to destroy 1 face-up card on the field primarily backrow or field spell YET the purpose of this card as well is to help keep a Spellcaster with 1500 DEF up on the field to reap full effects of Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin. BUT the main purpose of having Unpossessed at 3 is due to its graveyard effect allowing it to be banished to target a ""Possessed""/""Unpossessed"" continuous Spell/Trap in your GY to then place it face-up on your field. Essentially having Possessed Partnerships in the graveyard helps set up your board

&nbsp;

Magician's Right Hand is here to make opponent spend resources. (This card usually helps force opponent to deal with it)  This card can easily be swapped out depending on opponent's deck build. Solemn Judgment and Magician's Left Hand serve a similar purpose and are usually swapped in when facing Eldlich decks.

&nbsp;

Pinpoint Guard is just there to help bring back a Charmer / Familiar-Possessed. Primarily Charmers to help re-establish board lock on next turn. Fairy Tail - Luna can be swapped in to help bounce opponent's monsters on the field and help synergize with Awakening of the Possessed draw engine. Fairy Tail - Luna also synergizes with Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin's deck searching effect.

&nbsp;

Night's End Sorcerer is new to the build. Night's End Sorcerer was added to gain access to Synchro toolbox of Levels 5, 6, and 7 due to main deck staples running 4 level 3, 4 level 4, and 4 level 5 monsters, not counting Eda the Sun Magician. Nights End Sorcerer is very neat to the build and can really help stun if used to bring out Clear Wing Synchro Dragon (Pretty much a mini Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon).

Destroy cards, get out every zoodiac on top of each other, special summon from the gy, manipulate xyz materials, and use Zeus if needed.

Tenki being unlimited and Drident being limited to 1 makes this deck kind of insane. Not to mention the stupid amounts of card draw with Maxx-c and pot of desires and pot of avarice.

Their field spell is underrated to an unfair amount. It grants them protection, destruction, and an attack/defense boost that actually makes a difference a lot of the time.

Pot of Avarice is super useful to get Drident back into the deck. It is also active a lot of the time due to the number of monsters being sent to the gy by the XYZ monsters. The same thing applies to Zoodiac Combo but it is a trap and only draws 1 but has an additional effect so you only run 1 Zoodiac Combo and 2 copies of Pot of Avarice.

you of course have the staple hand traps and destruction which is useful in every game and is just necessary for obvious reasons. you have Red Reboot to stop the solemn cards and some other disruption that can screw with this deck.

You can replace the 2 Called by the Grave for 2 twin twisters, mst, or cosmic cyclone but I wouldn't recommend it since they are useful for stoping handtraps."

<span> </span>

<span>Aleister possess unique properties that makes it a good target for cool strategies:</span>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Dark.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Spellcaster.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>LV4.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>ATK 1000/DEF 1800.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Normal Summon effect.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Hand discard effect.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>No restrictions in any capacity.</span></li>
</ul>
<span>These conditions come into play when thinking how to properly optimize Aleister as a body on the field to send it to the GY for it’s fusion summon using Invocation.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>The deck is very explosive. You can pot 8000+ of damage on your first turn.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>This toolbox is trying to abuse the Invoked engine, it’s lack of restrictions and the free body aleister leaves in the field with some strong little engines and strategies to create a very varied toolbox with great success. However, this toolbox is, at times, inconsistent, there is enough one card combos, hand traps, super poly targets and troublesome cards your opponent will have to get rid of, and a lot of the times that task is out of his reach.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>The latest release of Small World made this deck incredibly consistent. Small world functions like this:</span>

<span>There are 3 monsters involved. Monsters A, B and C.</span>

<span>You banish monster A from your hand, then from your deck you banish Monster B, then you take Monster C to your hand.</span>

<span>And Monster A must have one common characteristic with Monster B, and B with C.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Small World uses the Hand traps in your hand and turns them into Aleisters.</span>

<span>Here’s what’s the characteristic they share with him:</span>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Ash Blossom (And any sister except Ghost reaper) <strong>DEF1800</strong></span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Effect Veiler and Droll &amp; Lock Bird </span> <strong>SPELLCASTER</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span><strong>THIS DECK IS GOING 2ND</strong>. As many cards go to full power when your opponent has a built board for the Mekk Knights to be special summoned and build board presence and card advantage, making them Link-2 material for the subsequent fusions, or making a rank 8 to get rid of a problematic card.</span>

<span>The </span><b>Shaddoll </b><span>engine works the best with your opponent having an extra deck monster on board, making the Shaddoll Construct, giving you a +1 from Beast or Spell/trap removal from Dragon. Making Construct can Mill the other Shaddoll used for it’s fusion, making both available. Also making Winda can be useful to send both monsters to the GY triggering them and giving you an incredible floodgate.</span>

<b>Super Polymerization</b><span> is another Going 2nd card wipe, giving you either an Invoked after normal summoning the aleister or a Starving Vemon basically for free using monsters from your opponent, taking care of the threats before you start going wild.</span>

<span>You can also play Dark Ruler No More for easy board building, but this deck tries to go for the kill ASAP.</span>

<b>Cosmic Cyclone</b><span> is preferred over Twisters, since a lot of cards like Zombie World can be retrieved, but once they are banished they’re gone.</span>

<b>Salamangreat Almiraj</b><span> is to make a free Purgatrio, a free body and gives you some options.</span>

<b>Borreload Dragon</b><span> is the answer to the excess of bodies you sometimes generate, he can get rid of annoying threats. Can steal a monster, non target, can reduce ATK and no one can stop it, can OTk and cannot be targeted.</span>

<b>Number 23: Lancelot</b><span>. Almost never came up, since Dingirsu if more useful most of the time, but can be useful to annoy your opponent.</span>

<b>Dingirsu </b><span>is excellent, gets rid of almost anything and can be made after attacking with both LV8 mekk knights to protect your stuff.</span>

<b>Masked HERO Dark Law</b><span> is a niche but VERY bad ass monster that abuses Aleister’s DARK attribute, sending him to the GY before Invokating the party.</span>

<b>Ultra Polymerization</b><span> is very useful to create a free body. By paying 2000 LP you’ll summon a Mekk Knight, an Aleister to make Mechaba, then summon them back to create the Link 2 and use Invocation to start the combo. In all, it gives you a </span><b>free Mechaba</b><span>.</span>

<b>Aleister The Invoker Of Madness</b><span> is a great extender, it gives you Invocations from your deck or Book Of The Law (not once per turn) AND triggers Shaddolls.</span>

<b>Book Of The Law</b><span> is very fun to use, but when you open it, it hurts so bad. Nothing like Mask Changing your fusions, most of the times into the big bad rock</span>

<b>Neos Fusion</b><span> is a very powerful card to end your board, is a free Rainbow Neos to eliminate your opponent’s GY, Spell/Trap Zone or Monster Zone in one shot, as it is also a 4500 ATK beast that can get almost anything you’ll encounter done.</span>

<b>Destrudo </b><span>is the newest addition to the mix, as he is also one of the strongest cards ever. To get rid of Aleister you have multiple options and he might be one of the coolest and more exploitable of them all. Getting for free an Arcanite Magician to destroy up to 2 cards your opponent controls or giving yourself a free car that negates spell/trap card or effect per turn, or a Cyberse Quantum Dragon to bounce some problematic card up.</span>

<b>All the hand traps</b><span> in this deck can stop your opponent’s growth on his turn, stopping him if possible in a Link 1 or 2 for you to use his column, Shaddoll Fusion or Super Poly, etc. All of these hand traps can search for Aleister the Invoker with Small World, making them useful even after turn 1.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>… All of that without having even started with the Invoked monsters.</span>

<b>Mechaba </b><span>is the main beast, the easier to summon since Effect Veiler, Neos, Rainbow Dragon and all the Mekk Knights are LIGHT attribute. Once he comes you can protect yourself (except from traps) from almost anything with a 2500 ATK he will go for the game.</span>

<b>Augoeides </b><span>is an incredible Control/OTK monster, being able to fuse it using more commonly than not, a Raidjin from the GY you bringed up with Instant Fusion, and can pop stuff passively and when it’s summoned. Neat.</span>

<b>Raidjin </b><span>is free using the soup. It’s capable of coming with the Drolls and quick effect to get rid of something, can be used to bring the Link-2, to attack, to stall, it’s very versatile.</span>

<b>Invoked Purgatrio</b><span> it’s an underrated train. Against the right deck can OTK himself using aleisters to boost him up even more and do crazy damage. Wiping your entire opponent’s board with him it’s a thing of beauty.</span>

<b>Invoked Magellanica</b><span> is an Earth 3K beater that can be useful at times. It's EARTH attribute which can be found in a lot of decks to get rid of your opponent GY. It’s 3K, sometimes using aleister to boost him up a little it’s all you need.</span>

<b>Elysium </b><span>is the most underrated. His potential is very threatening and your opponent WILL respect it. First of all, it’s a Super poly target using a monster from your opponent’s Extra Deck, it’s 4K Defense, 3200 ATK. It’s a Wall. His quick effect is a nuke that could banish all monsters on your opponent board by banishing itself, as he is considered as LIGHT, DARK, EARTH, WATER, FIRE AND WIND. Or you can use your GY to shoot that cannon using dead invoked monsters from that attribute. If it comes, it will make your opponent very uncomfortable.</span>

<span><strong>Invoked Caliga</strong> is a good floodgate, but most of the time you’ll not need it.</span>

<span><strong>Invoked Cocytus</strong> is a WATER attribute, that’s it.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>There are a lot of cool things you can do with it:</span>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Control</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>OTK</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Long games</span></li>

 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Board protection</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Bricks provide material for Invocation</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span>WEAKNESSES:</span>

<span>One of the main weaknesses of this deck are the floodgates, especially spells and traps since this deck has no consistent ways to deal with them. Mystic Mine, Skill Drain, unless you hard draw the Cosmic Cyclone you're a dead man.</span>

<span>Other than that, this deck is calle Toolbox because that’s basically it, a toolbox to deal with most meta threats, break boards and go for game in a turn. It’s incredibly explosive and can be further expanded, since Aleister the Invoker will once again, find new ways to abuse more and more cards to come.</span>"

Also this one of my favorite Drytron variations already.

&nbsp;

The end board: <a data-name=""Red-eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-eyes Dark Dragoon</a> - <a data-name=""Masquerena"">Masquerena</a> - <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> - <a data-name=""Verte Anaconda"">Verte Anaconda</a> + D <a data-name="".D. Crow"">.D. Crow</a> and <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> in hand

&nbsp;

First of all, we have the Nibiru searcher: <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a><a data-name=""Gallant Granite""> you will xyz summon him with any 2 level 4 monsters.</a>

And the D .D. Crow Searcher: <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Recital Starling"">Lyrilusc - Recital Starling</a> xyz summoned using any 2 Drytron.

The rest is just Standard Drytron Megalith, i guess.

Drytron without Orange Light is easily disrupted and will lose easily to nibiru or droll. This is the only thing impeding Drytron from being Competitively viable.

Trading Card Game Known as the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game (遊☆戯☆王オフィシャルカードゲーム, Yū-Gi-Ō Ofisharu Kādo Gēmu) in Asia, is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami. It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series.

""Drytron"" (ドライトロン Doraitoron) is an archetype of LIGHT Machine Special Summon Monsters which debuted in Deck Build Pack: Genesis Impactors. The Main Deck monster's names are based on stars in the constellation of Draco. In addition to that, they feature their corresponding star and the part of the constellation in which it is located in their artwork's background. The full constellation can be seen in ""Meteonis Drytron"". Most of the Spell/Trap card names are based on stellar phenomenon.

""Invoked"", known as ""Invoked Beast"" (召しょう喚かん獣じゅう Shōkanjū) (aside from ""Augoeides"" and ""Elysium"") represents a different Attribute, with their Fusion Materials being ""Aleister the Invoker"" plus one monster of their specific Attribute, and are named after historical or mythological elements related to said Attribute. They also contain the staff of ""Aleister"" somewhere in their artworks, but much brighter than the original.
