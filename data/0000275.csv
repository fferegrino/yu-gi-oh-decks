All of the Dinomorphia monsters have reviving effects on destruction via battle or card effect, the 2 old Fusions can special summon a Level 4 or lower Dinomorphia, the 2 Main Deck Dinomorphia monsters can special summon a Level 4 or lower Dinomorphia monster with a different name(essentially the other Dinomorphia, as of right now). and Rexsturm can special summon a Level 6 or lower Dinomorphia monster, allowing it to special summon the other Fusion monsters as well."

First, you have to have the Synchro monster already on your field. Second, you have to draw the Assault Mode spell/trap. Third, you have to not have the Assault Mode card in your hand, as the original Assault Mode Activate, the searchable one, only summons from the deck.  These inherent flaws in the deck's strategy led to its immediate DoA(Dead on Arrival) status, but Legacy support for this archetype has made it a decent engine in some decks to cut down on minimum cards in deck, but I intend to use it for its original purpose, to actually summon an Assault Mode monster. And I will summon the best, and basically the only good, Assault Mode monster, Stardust Dragon(T.G. Halberd Cannon/Assault Mode isn't bad either).  To supplement the weaknesses of the Assault Mode archetype, I added the Brave/Adventurer Engine, giving the deck a stronger board presence, including an omni-negate, in addition to Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode, and a consistent way to recur your cards."

This is a going second deck, you want to let your opponent set up and then clear their board with sphere mode/soul crossing.  Soul Crossing is the reason this deck works. It turns every god card into a sphere mode, except the monster starts out on your field immediately. Incidentally you can use it to summon Sphere Mode to your side of the field immediately and go straight into a 4000 Winged Dragon of Ra.  Pot of Extravagance and Prosperity are maxed out because other than Egyptian God Slime this deck doesn't use the extra deck at all, and we want to get to our combo pieces right away.  Ra's Disciple and Reactor Slime are the main way you can get 3 tribute fodder on the board. Reactor Slime also allows you to tribute it to set a Metal Reflect Slime directly from your deck.  Guardian slime and Metal Reflect Slime are the 2 cards used to bring out Egyptian God Slime, which can act as 3 tributes for the summon of a Divine monster, as well as being a respectable monster in its own right with 3000 atk/def and a redirection effect.  Ancient Chant and Thunderspeed Summon are how you're going to summon the god cards the same turn you get the materials on the field (other than Soul Crossing). Thunderspeed Summon also allows you to tribute summon on your opponents turn or during your battle phase. Ancient Chant lets you search for The Winged Dragon of Ra and gives you an extra tribute summon (you can summon a monster other than Ra if you want to). it also gives Ra an attack boost on summon, which is nice because you're normally bringing it out at 7900 making you just shy of an OTK.  Forbidden Droplet and Solemn Judgment are quality staples and I don't think I need to explain why they're good. Technically Judgment has negative synergy with Ra, but I think the negation is important. It's also the only Solemn that can be used after Ra resolves its effect."

It will definitely be more satisfying. If you're like me who hates playing meta decks and love playing rogue lists and drawing a ton of cards you will like this deck. It is very expensive though but if you have all of the staple hand traps it should be too bad to build. I hope you all enjoyed the video!

Another Dogmatika Deck? Yeah. Nothing too fancy too be honest.  The decks normal summons are incredibly important so be sure you are actually able to get those off. Spellbook is an amazing deck thinner and has access to a searchable Reborn and Fate. Dogmatika are the only monsters in the main board that can special summon themselves so try to set them up. The Invoked cards allows for another spellcaster source on top of being excellent support for fusion engines such as Shaddoll.  My hand for this deck is pretty consistent and as long as you don't get Ash'd or Droll'd you will be fine. As long as you start with either Spellbook Magician or Spellbook of Secrets you can start thinning out your deck and setting up Fate.  Typical turns for me are pretty much Spellbook Magician + Search Secret + Use Secret search for Spellbook of the Master (to copy Secret) if you have another Book in hand otherwise go for Knowledge. Next you have Magician Link into Artemis and use Knowledge to sac her for 2 cards. This will set up your gy for Maximus or Mechaba.

Master Duel: Chaos Spirit Charmer  Check out my YOUTUBE CHANNELS  The âCharmerâ, or known as the âSpirit Charmerâ is a standalone archetype of Spellcaster monster themed on controlling monsters with the same Attribute as them which is unfortunately not playable in any way without an exceptional support from another card. Surprisingly the new Archetype called âMagistusâ came out soon after the âSpirit Charmerâ was released in 2021. The âMagistusâ archetype had a perfect synergy for the âCharmersâ especially since they only rely on base from Attribute and Types. This deck is strong enough to be used in high Tier level on Master Duel or Tournaments(hopefully).... This build is very easy to obtain/play it and can be used for any newcomer duelist because most of the cards are actually straightforward for the combos which I already listed the key cards for anyone interested to play Charmer Deck.  &nbsp;  Start with only using 3 simple Key Cards which is the only best I ever come out with for the Full Charmer's combos.  &nbsp;  Just following the recommendation cards that are listed below.  ___________________________________________  &nbsp;  [Key Cards]: 3 Main Engine  - <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>  - <a data-name=""Performage Damage Juggler"">Performage Damage Juggler</a>  - <a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>  &nbsp;  [Recommend]Â to Search/Use  - <a data-name=""Lyna the Light Charmer"">Lyna the Light Charmer</a> (Hand) &amp; <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> (Spell/Trap Zone)  - <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a> (Hand)  - <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon MaidenÂ "">Artemis, the Magistus Moon MaidenÂ </a>(Spell/Trap Zone) = <a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a> (Hand)  &nbsp;  ___________________________________________  &nbsp;  Once you finally set up your cards. You will proceed with the next step by activating â<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoiresâ"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoiresâ</a> effect to send out â<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>â from your hand to the GY. Then use ""<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>"" effect to become Earth Attribute that allowed you to Summon â<a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend"">Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend</a>'' card from either hand or Deck by sending both â<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>â and â<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>â from the field to the GY, which make them to trigger of their effects by Chain Link 2 and bringing it back â<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>â from the GY to the field along with â<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>â by it own effect. Now you have finally had a chance to Summon â<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>â from either hand or Deck by its own effect. After that use â<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>â effect to search out â<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>â from your Deck then add it to your hand which is the only best Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF/Level 4/Light Attribute monster that can be able to search out by ""<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed - Dharc"">Familiar-Possessed - Dharc</a>"" effect when it Summoned by it own effect.  &nbsp;  Reminder:Â Do not activate ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" effect during your turn when it Summoned to your field, it will disable you for summoning from the Exta Deck unless if you have too. (This is an Optional)  &nbsp;  ___________________________________________  &nbsp;  Tips: You might not actually get them from the opening hand with exactly cards. So I prefer you to try something else with different cards in your hand if one of the Key Cards are missing. You should better rely on your additional cards in your hand that might help you to set up your cards. Keep it in your mind that ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" is just an additional card to use <a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed - Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed - Lyna</a>'s Effect to search out ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" from your deck to the hand.  &nbsp;  ___________________________________________  &nbsp;  [Additional]Â for moreÂ Consistency  You can use ""<a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>"" as additional for ""<a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>"" or any Level 4 monster from your Deck like ""<a data-name=""Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre"">Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</a>"" or any Performage monster depending what card you need.  Requirement: 1 any Spell card, except ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" card, if not, you can use it as well if you have too. I include â<a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>â from my Deck Profile since It actually works very well for any Level 4 monster.  &nbsp;  ___________________________________________  &nbsp;  The End Board got changed frequently due to lack of cards since I actually used <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> lately in the actual game which is not my original plan for this deck. So I came up with the new play style by giving you more options to play either ""<a data-name=""Number 106: Giant Hand"">Number 106: Giant Hand</a>"" or summon any link 2 like ""<a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>"" depending on any situation if you have more additional cards on your play to expand it.  &nbsp;  I want to try something new in Master Duel with different cards that I have so it got changed especially from the Extra Deck.

A lot of the cards double up in utility, such as the jurracs being useable for both synchro and XYZ materials, with the extra deck functioning as a tool kit to deal with problems as they arise. Plenty of support-type monsters means the draw and summoning power is there (and hopefully consistent enough), with cards like Magical Mallet and the elemental dinosaurs fixing themselves so that there are (hopefully) no dead draws. The sideboard is designed to deal with any troublesome card archetypes that either get around destroy effects (such as hyper hammerhead) or monsters to come in handy in long games (such as Overtex Qoatlus). Feedback is appreciated, as I'm still pretty new to the game."

Though their Main Deck monsters are primarily lackluster in power and effects, the true power of this archetype lies in the Extra Deck. The Main Deck Ki-sikil and Lil-la, respectively, can special summon the other if you control no other monsters, making them excellent starters, and the deck has a lot of ways to search them out in their archetypal Spells and Traps.  On your 1st turn, your goal is to summon E*T Ki-sikil first, special summon a Lil-la from your GY, then make E*T Lil-la, special summon E*T Ki-sikil from your GY to draw a card, you can then make either Trouble Sunny or Unchained Abomination depending on your preference or whether you go 1st or 2nd, or if you have Evil*Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la, the Main Deck Boss Monster, in your hand or GY, you could make that as well.  The Main Deck Ki-sikil and Lil-la are Cyberse Type, their alternate cards, Frost and Treat are Aqua and Zombie, respectively, and their Extra Deck monsters and E*T Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la are Fiend Type, and most of them lock you into Fiend monsters from the Extra Deck. So thankfully, Unchained Abomination, the Boss Monster of the Unchained archetype, happens to work very well with the Live/Evil*Twins as it is also a Fiend."

Sign me up! ,"Konami has made a lot of female-based archetypes, but this is one of the only good ones.  The main mechanic of these draconic housekeepers is that the low-level maids tag out for their high-level counterparts(you can tell which is which by the element or their names, the big dragons are all anagrams of their small versions).  The Boss Monster of this archetype is Dragonmaid Sheou, a walking Omni-negate with 3500 ATK and the ability to special summon any other Dragonmaid from your hand or GY. It's omni-negate effect allows it to tag out to House Dragonmaid, its maid counterpart. House Dragonmaid can special summon a Dragonmaid from your hand or GY that is 1 level higher or lower than a Dragonmaid you control.  Cards like Dragon Ravine and Chaos Ruler, that dump cards to the GY, are very helpful for this deck, as their cards both have good GY effects and use the GY as a second hand."

Prohibit Snake is an excellent addition to any Codetalker deck; from your own hand, it sends your opponent's attacking monster back to <em>their</em> hand if it attacks any of your Codetalkers. Also: if Prohibit Snake is in your graveyard and you destroy an opponent's monster, you can banish a GY card and send another card back to your hand. This integrates nicely with chained effects, of which there are many in this deck.  An ideal set-up would be to end with an Accesscode Talker and another linked Codetalker on the field, and a Prohibit Snake in your hand. That protects your CTs from attacks (which Accesscode is otherwise <em>not</em> protected from), and gives you the opportunity to act on the offensive with Accesscode's effects.  &nbsp;  <strong>Your First Turn (Turn 1 or Turn 2)</strong>  - Summon Code Talker with Micro Coder in hand + field card, then search for Cynet Codec (if already in hand, instead search for Cynet Optimization or Conflict)  - Next: summon Transcode Talker with Code Talker + another card, preferably an in-hand summon card (e.g., Code Exporter). Special summon Eater of Millions if available.  - Next: revive Code Talker with Transcode Talker, and continue to link summon so long as you have in-hand summon cards. If Turn 1, end phase and wait until next turn to summon Accesscode Talker. If Turn 2, summon Accesscode Talker with Transcode Talker + field or in-hand card. Use Accesscode Talker effects to destroy opponent's cards and then attack.  &nbsp;  <strong>Your Second Turn (only if you started the game, Turn 3)</strong>  - Summon Accesscode Talker and see above.  &nbsp;"

The impcantation engine is used to support your gishki monsters. This is a hard going second deck because using the effect of Gishki Zielgigas to draw on turn one is risky since the effect is mandatory. If you do have to go first be careful drawing with this effect as you can accidently bounce back your own monsters. If you use dark ruler no more make sure to keep a healthy amount of cards in hand to kill your opponent on your next turn. Don't use all of your fuel immediately. Ultimately this is probably not the best ritual archetype, but it makes big squids and it has really fun combos. :)"

Branded combo: (keep in mind that if you activate Glow Up Bloom's effect, that you get locked into Zombies)  Activate Branded Fusion--&gt;Send Fallen of Albaz and Glow-up to make Lubellion (even if it gets negated, it discards for cost) -Otherwise, if you don't really need glow-up bloom, you can always send Mezuki/Gozuki or Banshee as a contingency plan (especially if you suspect they have a way of getting rid of your Zombie World).  Activate Glowup's effect in grave FIRST! <em>thenÂ </em>Lubellion (free discard btw ;) ) -- doing so will bypass the zombie requirement, allowing you to fusion summon Mirrorjade after you get Balerdroch.  Verte Anaconda is also a good way to get Branded fusion, but make sure to fusion summon Mirrorjade using Verte and Albaz because you get only one more special summon for the turn (DON'T SEND GLOW UP--YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ADD BALERDROCH TO HAND!)  &nbsp;  I also added in Jackalope and Tsuchinoko for added consistency so I can discard Glowup/Banshee/Mezuki etc. if I brick. Otherwise, you might be able to get into Halq if you get to special summon.  Here's what I banish for Prosperity: 1x Dragonecro, 1x Mirrorjade, both Phoenix link monsters, 1x Avendread, 1x Vampire Sucker. I usually am able to find branded fusion off of this when I don't draw into it.  &nbsp;  Your normal summon is gonna be Uni-zombie 70% of the time, but don't cry if it gets negated (which it WILL), really in a bo3 you can side in cards if you are struggling to make a good endboard. Otherwise, you can normal Gozuki to get 1 discard from the grave, which will be usually Banshee or glow-up.  VAMPIRE SUCKER BTW!!!  Vampire Sucker has an effect where you can tribute one of your opponent's monsters to tribute summon, so if you draw Balerdroch and don't have a normal summon/want to get Balderdroch for monster removal, you should probably go for it. I hadn't really considered this until recently, and it can catch your opponent offguard. (Disclaimer: DON'T GET GREEDY! Unless you REALLY think they don't have anything, don't special from their GY just for a free card draw. This really could just give them free link material if you don't get rid of it.)  I took Jackobolan out of my deck because I REALLY don't think it's that good considering I have Super Poly and Branded Fusion.  PS. I usually try to bait out negates with Foolish burial or even really Unizombie. Honestly, as long as you have Branded Fusion and a way to get Zombie World out on the field, you're probably good."

Though if you're in a pinch, Shuraig will be there to bail you out. ","Melffy cards a little ways away from displaying their true full decklist glory in Master Duel, but they'll still give you a run for your money. Bring along a menagerie of other funny fluffy and feathery friends to make a pretty funny deck. This isn't the end all be all to Melffy decks, and certainly not my only Melffy deck, but I wanted to put it out there.  An opening turn with 'Melffy of the Forest' with any mix of regular Melffys on the field is always a good start for this deck turn 1. Turn 2 starting, if they come out with a monster big on attack points, I like to introduce them to Sandayu (Ronin Racoon). If you have 'Missus Radiant' on the field or 'Solidarity' in play, most of the time you'll take their biggest monster and pop out a token with equal to their attack points <em>and then some</em>.  It's a fun deck to run with a lot of flexibility. Stall if you want to, summon the cards you want to, or shut down a card with the classic 'Melffy Puppy' into summoning Kalantosa. Pop! Unless they have something that protects their card, it's usually the end of the line for a lot of starting combos. Negate spell or monster effects with the Naturias if you know they'll be a problem. Have a free beast monster with Hasty Horse as long as there's no cards in the column. Pull out 3 fluffy friends on turn 1 with 'Obedience Schooled', and mix and match those into any number of Melffys or Racoons of your choice (You can use Sandayu more than once per turn; turn their 3000 attack monster into a 3800 attack token, then do it again for a 4600 attack token!)  If you need a card off the field, Alpha MoB can help you out with that, or he can be a potential fodder into Shuraig if you need him. (I will warn you though, read your card effects, you can't summon Shuraig the same turn you use 'Obedience Schooled')  You can easily mess with opponents on their turn. Pop their monster with the bread and butter. Or just stop them from attacking one of your Melffy's by bringing them to your hand. 'Melffy Fenny' into summoning Alpha is also always funny to do. After they summon a monster, use 'Melffy Catty' to add Hop Ear to your hand if you can't handle a monster or card effect. As long as it's their main phase, you can syncro summon right into 'Herald of the Arc Light'. Though, once the new Melffys get here, I may end up giving a thank-you to 'Hop Ear Squadron' and switching it out for the seal. Or when in doubt, 'Ayers Rock Sunrise' and 'Melffy Tag' will bring you enough monsters back from the graveyard to Xyz summon to your heart's content.  There's a lot more I could say about the Deck, like the flexibility of Alpha MoB with itself or returning a Melffy to the hand to proc the effect of 'Melffy of the Forest', or how well Melffys and Sandayu use the playhouse trap card. But I think it's best to let the gameplay speak for itself.  Mix and match more beast monsters if you'd like or even add other card archetypes to it. As long as there are Melffys there, any deck sure to keep your opponents guessing.  I'm Mezamizu, this is my Melffy, and thanks for reading!"

This deck focuses around pendulum summoning to play high attack monsters and summon the signature card, Apoqliphort Towers, which has great utility and wonderful defense with its immunity to most monster effects, spells and traps. Pendulum abilities offer effective searching tools and a attack buff to your monsters.  The other main strategy of this deck is utilizing cards that negate monster effects. Most Qliphort monsters allow you to summon them without tribute summoning but with a lowered attack rating (usually to ~1800 atk). With the use of monster effect negation, this loss is reversed and you can easily summon monsters with 2000+ attack for free, especially with pendulum summoning. This will also negate the effect that states Qliphort monsters can only be used to special summon other Qliphort monsters if you plan to utilize an extra deck."

Card and Hand Destruction are used to make the mill easier to perform. Bone Tower can be brought out with the effect of Mezuki (and both can be sent to the graveyard using Yuki-Musume, Foolish Burial, Card/Hand Destruction, Gozuki, and Reasoning) while the Mayakashi setup can be brought out by searching for Hajun with Mayakashi Return or One for One.

With that in mind, the Main Deck ""Chronomaly"" cards that were playable (from many hours of play testing): 'Chronomaly Maoi, Chronomaly Maoi Carrier, Chronomaly Tuspa Rocket, and Chronomaly Esperanza Glyph'. 'Chronomaly Moai Carrier' has a watered down Cyber Dragon effect to Special Summon its self, while 'Chronomaly Maoi' can Summon its self when you control a ""Chronomaly"" monster. 'Chronomaly Tuspa Rocket' may not have a way to Special Summon its self or other ""Chronomaly"" cards; but, it does has a built-in 'Exrta-Foolish Burial' and 'Foolish Burial' on Normal or Special Summon, that can reduce the ATK of 1 targeted monster on the field. Finally 'Chronomaly Esperanza Glyph' may not be a monster, but it can take ""Chronomaly"" monsters from your hand, deck /or GY to Xyz Summon any ""Chronomaly"" monster with the corresponding Levels. The best part is that all 3 of the Main Deck ""Chronomaly"" monsters are EARTH Rock Monsters so any Supporting Rock arctypes, like ""Adamancipator"" and ""Fossil"", can be used to re-cycle any of the Main Deck monsters."

Or trying to ""hold"" going second with the hand traps, or if everything goes wrong with the droplet to ""break"" the field.  Undoubtedly the best starter on the deck is the regulator, as it offers you the best combo. If Tribute, bring two team thiefs from the main deck (usually the winder and adjuster), what you add with the winder depends a lot on the situation. Going, because if you don't have any move extender in hand, you can bring the chronocorder, because with the bunjinki effect you can make the redoer using it material. With the adjuster most of the time you will send the bezel ship to the cemetery. With this move you can end the turn with two xyz on the field, because with the effect of the bezel you can Special Summon it from the Graveyard by discarding a material and with that you can activate the effect of the redoer when banishing, detaching a monster from the effect. of the chrnoocorder is activated in the graveyard and it also enters by special summon. I recommend that it be with the redoer and it perpetuates it in the first game.  I put allure as a purchase option, because all time thief monsters are darkness, I also put Danger! As another option both to banish with allure, and the move extender itself. The skull meister is a good hand trap option because it is level 4 darkness (often it will be the ban target) it can also be used as material for the xyz. To protect the regulator I put the gamma, because you don't want to take an ash on it. XD In the extradeck I put some different level 4 options, you can change some things if you have any other preference.  I've used infinitrack on a few occasions, it's a really nice addition to the deck. If you have any questions, you can leave them in the comments.  Have fun with this good deck!"

The deck uses a Kaiju engine to generate elements on your opponent's side of the field and in your graveyard to special summon your extra deck monsters from Plunder Patroll. Effect Veiler and Skull Meister were chosen as the hand traps of choice due to their price and elements, as well as their ease of use so you can dump elements into your graveyard for Emblem of the Plunder Patroll to use for summoning monsters.  Ideally, if more money gets put into this deck, it would really appreciate a side deck and options such as Nibiru, Artifact Lancea, and Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring to generate more hand-traps and give more options for Emblem of the Plunder Patroll."

The center piece of the deck, and the primary Normal Summon, is Junk Synchron. Use this card for a free Junk Speeder, the ultimate target for an Ash Blossom and must be protected because of this, to gain immense advantage, summoning up to 5 different Synchron Tuner monsters(this deck only has 4 potential targets, but if Speeder is put in the Extra Monster Zone and you still have 5 targets able to be summoned in the Main Deck, you can summon all 5). After summoning Junk Speeder, your next priority is to make T.G. Hyper Librarian, as due to it not being once per turn, you can draw upwards of 5 cards during your 1st turn, to gain even more advantage.  This deck can also play the Majestic Stardust cards, but those make the deck worse in my opinion, though is does strengthen the end board potential."

The Boss Monster of the Deck is Red Supernova Dragon, which isn't too hard to bring out in this archetype, and has an immensely powerful effect to banish itself and ALL cards your opponent controls when your opponent attacks or activates a monster effect, and returns to the field during your next End Phase. Though it can't be destroyed by card effects, it is vulnerable to negation, such as Forbidden Droplet or Infinite Impermanence, or Tributing/Sending, such as Kaiju or Shaddoll Schism.  Sadly, the archetype isn't very good, as it is extremely weak to Handtraps, and has been powercrept in recent times, as other decks have a higher ceiling and a stronger board presence than Resonators can make, leaving it in the dust of Yusei Fudo and his Synchrons"

Previously, the deck did not have a lot of access to good Light Type monsters, until the Dogmatika archetype arrived. The Dogmatika monsters are a group of Light Spellcaster monsters that have abilities based on countering monsters summoned from the Extra Deck. Unfortunately, a lot of their cards lock you out of using the Extra Deck for a turn or two, so you have to be careful when you use them.  This deck is able to very easily run the engine for Destiny HERO-Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer(known as DPE for short), as it is an extremely powerful fusion monster, that gives any deck with the necessary space access to a strong monster that has a non-targeting destruction effect and can recur itself from the Graveyard each Standby Phase if it was destroyed, in addition to debuffing your opponents monsters."

It has Various cards to make XYZ summon of Rank 4 monsters. But the best it's Suships. Why? 'Cause SUSH,"<span>So you stumbled in this decklist? Well as the title says it was built for N/R Format that's why some good stuff was left out (Time Thief Redoer, Zeus, Utopia); this idea was created mainly 'cause I'm a Yataloked fan and I liked the Idea behind the Suship archetype being a XYZ SPAM deck, well when I was copying a Suship Deck for Ranked in Master Duel I noticed that the whole Suship Archetype it's R and N rarity (Well atleast the cards we have in Master Duel), so I decided to theorycraft making the deck. Sadly using the maximun amount of copies of the Main deck cards it only makes 30% of the main deck (12 cards) so to complete the deck I needed more engines to support the Suships. So turned to another archetype I like Time Thiefs being a good Engine to spam Rank 4 XYZ Monsters so they are good with Suships, I put 3 copies of the playable cards, but if you wish you can remove the Spell card is just for a little bit of swarming but if you don't have a Time Thief in hand it's a Brick (Like a hand full of Monarchs), I didn't put the traps because they're unplayable 'cause they all work in the Time Thief XYZ Monsters which all are SR and UR rarity so I can't use them for this format so althought you can use them they will be just bricks. With that we have 37.5% of main deck taken by Time Thiefs (15 cards), but we have another 13 cards left to fill the deck (32.5%). In N/R Format Handtraps are practically nonexisting, well at least good ones. So we have the following ones: Sphere Kuriboh, Battlin' Boxer Veil, Speedroid Menko, Battle Fader, Ghostrick Jack Frost, and Construction Train Signal Red, so the Deck it's a Rank 4 XYZ Spam Deck so Sphere Kuriboh isn't very good amking the attacking monster go to defense position (Which links are inmune to) and only useful in Ritual decks by being a Ritual Raven on steroids, Battle Fader has the better effect of the five but it's a level 1 so unless you want to use it for Link plays isn't very useful, oh and Ghostrick Jack Frost it's like Sphere Kuriboh which makes a enemy monster go to defense position and like Battle Fader he special summons himself so well isn't very useful in this deck, so we have left Battlin' Boxer Veil and Speedroid Menko which both are Level 4 that special summon themselves, Veil when you're receive damage which makes you recover it and Menko that will trigger when you're attacked directly and makes all your opponents monsters go to defense position (Except Link monsters 'cause they can't). I put 2 of Veil and Menko, and if you ask why not 3? Mainly 'cause in the last N/R Format Banlist they semi-limited both cards, well I think they semi-limited all of the Battle Handtraps available except Sphere Kuriboh 'cause it's so bad nobody used it.Â  So with Veil and Menko in the Deck (being 10% of the Deck) we have 9 spaces left for more cards. Looking for ideas I stumbled in the N/R Channel where they post possible engines, I found 2 engines for XYZ Decks and with that I could fill the deck. First engine it's Astraltopia and Numbers protection, Astraltopia it's a level 4 monster that can be special summoned from your hand when you have a XYZ monster in the field and when it's on the field you can send to the grave 1 card in your hand and add to your hand a Spell/Trap which says Zexal, ZW, Onomat, and/or Number in it's description, the other card it's Numbers protection which it's a Solemn Judgment but you don't pay LP but to activate it you need to have a XYZ Number Monster in the field to activate. I put 3 Astraltopia and 2 Numbers Protection. The other engine it's my old friends Sharks most of the engine it's low rarity you could play it (Expect a future Shark Deck for N/R Format) ok so I put two cards Right hand Shark and Left hand Shark. Right hand when it's Normal summoned you can add 1 Left hand Shark to the hand, and if you have Right hand Shark in the GY and you can Special summon it to the field for free if you don't have monsters in the field but it will get banish when it leaves the field (This lingering effect can be unable by using it for XYZ summon as material) it has another effect but it will never trigger in this deck, and now Left hand Shark this card can be Special summoned when you have Right hand on the field but it will get banished when it leaves the field and the other effect it's this card will become a Level 4 if it's Special summoned form the GY. So yeah this combo it's a Link 2 at best 'cause Left hand it's a Level 3. We have 2 Right hands and 1 Left hand. If you're doing math correctly you'll notice there's a free space 'cause right now we have 39 cards. Well I put a copy of Shard of Greed just in case it comes useful later. So there's the 40 Card List.</span>  <span>And now the Extradeck we have to put the XYZ Suship named </span><span>Gunkan Suship Ikura-class Dreadnought 'cause we are playing Suships it gets two different effects if it's summoned using the Main deck Suship monsters. If you use Shari (The Normal one) you draw 1 card, and if you use Ikura (The effect one) the XYZ can Attack 2 times this battle phase, which it's relevant to this XYZ 'cause when a Suship Extra Deck monster deals damage you can destroy one monster in your opponents field. We put 2 copies of this card, we could put 3, but for Space we put 2 mainly 'cause it's better when it's summoned by the Suship cards which we only have 6 in a 40 card deck. Due to the lack of good Rank 4 XYZ monster we could use the King of all of them Number 70: Malevolent Sin, well the king in N/R Format I know Time Thief Redoer exists, well why do I call him the king? 'Cause he's a really good monster to go into, there 3 options you could use in N/R Format, one it's Digital Bug Corebage which return to the deck one monster in you opponent's field which it's in defense position you could inmediatly go into this card when you summon Malevolent Sin, and sadly after you attacked with Malevolent you can't go into Corebage, the other two can only be used after Malevolent Sin has made it's second attack and they're Number 84 Paingainer and Number 77 Seven Sins. Paingainer has 0 ATK and DEF but it's gains DEF equal to the amount of Ranks of XYZ monsters in your field (It counts itself) X 200, so when you summon it, it has 2200 DEF, and when your opponent activates activates a Spell/Trap it inflicts 600 LP of Damage, once per turn you can detach 1 material and destroy all of your opponent's monsters with ATK lower/equal the amount of Defense that Pain Gainer has. Seven Sins it's a 4000 ATK and 3000 ATK Rank 12 XYZ monster, which's effect it's once per turn you can detach 2 materials and banish all of you opponents monsters that were special summoned, then you can atach to this card one of the monsters banished by this effect. And when this card would be destroyed by battle or card effect you can detach 1 material instead. So we put 3 copies of Malevolent sin and 1 of each of the monster I talked earlier (Corebage, Seven Sins and Pain Gainer), oh and if you ask how on earth i'm planning to put and enemy monster in defense position if we don't have any way to do that in the Main Deck, don't worry 'cause we have a solution for that, it's named Evilswarn Nightmare, it's a Rank 4 XYZ monster which requires 2 Level 4 Dark monsters which all our Time Thiefs are. He's effect it's when your opponent summons monster(s) you can detach one material and make them all go face down, which will make possible to special summon Corebage next turn and return one card to the deck, believe me it's a good combo well at least in this format. And 'cause we only use 1 copy of Corebage we only need to put 1 copy of Nightmare. So that's 9 cards we have 6 spaces left. 'Cause most of our cards are level 4 machines we can summon Heavy Armor Train Ironwolf which requires 2 level 4 machine monsters. He can detach 1 material and make 1 machine monster attack directly this turn (Which Ironwolf is) but he it's the only monster that could attack this turn, and when he's destroyed by your opponent you can add to your hand 1 level 4 Machine monster (Menko, Regulator, Bezel Ship, or Chronocorder. But to be honest if your field it's going to get wipe the best options are Regulator to make a comeback by making a XYZ Rank 4 monster or Menko for surviving another turn). Next, we have Number 57 Tri-head dust dragon, at first it seems like a bad card mainly 'cause to summon it you need 3 Level 4 cards which is rare in this deck but it could happen, so what this card does it's when it's summoned you can increase it's attack to the current attack of a opponent's monster on the field and by having 100 ATK it can get past the strongest card your opponent controls, it's other effect is detach 1 material and select an S/T zone in your opponent's zone which doesn't have a card in it, and while this card it's on the field face-up this zone can't be used, it's not the best effect but it can stop in it's tracks Pendulum and Giant Ballpark Decks. And now our last XYZ monster Number 50 Blackship of Corn, it's a Rank 4 XYZ monster which needs 2 level 4 monsters, it's effect it's to send to the GY 1 monster in your opponent's field which has ATK equal/less than Blackship (2100 ATK) and deals 1000 LP to your opponent, but this turn Blackship can't attack. And now our Link monsters and if you ask why are we using Link monsters in a XYZ deck it's mainly due to a certain card being avaliable in the format, don't sorry I'll say which card it is. The link monsters are Geonator Transverser, Codebreaker Virus Swordsman, and Doublebyte Dragon. Geonator it's used due to her effect to exchange two monsters in the field to the zones this card points to, so basically a Creature swap, it's due to this card you shouldn't put your most precious monsters in the left corner of the field or in the center. Virus it's used 'cause of his possibility to revive itself and being a Link 2 monster with 2300 ATK being the Link 2 with the biggest ATK stat in the game. And Doublebyte which can only be summoned by using 2 Link monsters, it gains 300 ATK for each level of Ranking that the cards used to summon it in this case if you summon it in this deck he will have 2700 ATK which yeah isn't much BUT he compensates by having a great effect which makes it inmune to monster effects and battle unless the effects or battle are from another Link monster. So yeah this little package it's a case of using fire to deal with fire.</span>  <span>Before I leave I want to suggest some options if you feel some cards aren't good to keep. In the Main deck deparment you can use cards like Photon Thrasher or Kagetokage which are special summons from the hand, XYZ Reborn to make a monster reborn of a XYZ monster in your graveyard, ZS Armed Sage ZS Ascended Sage which can be useful for more Level 4 monsters to make more XYZ monsters. You could replace the Time thief engine for Raidraptors or sharks that can be great engines for XYZ Rank 4 Decks, but Sharks are mainly used in pure water decks and Raidraptor can be good but most of them have to end in a Raidraptor XYZ and the available cards in the N/R Format don't make the deck justice. Some Dangers and Darkworlds could help the deck but it's a bit risky,. In the Extra Deck department you could use Firewall eXceed Dragon (Specially if you plan to use more Link monsters),Â  Super Quantal Mech Beast Aeroboros for a Book of moon (Sadly the Quick effect it's only active if it has a Super Quantal card attached), Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk and Number 58: Burner Visor, to equip them to other XYZ monsters Berserk gives 1200 ATK and can use it's materials before equiping himself to another XYZ monster to banish 1 card of your opponent's GY (This effect it's not once per turn), and Visor gives the monster the possibility to do Direct attacks, Number 85: Crazy Box if you want to spice the game a bit and in the hypothetical case your opponent doesn't read Crazy box and Negates it's effect it's actually very good 'cause it turns this card into a 3000 ATK Beatstick, Gem-Knight Pearl just to have a 2600 ATK beatstick, Number 52: Diamond Crab King to have a 3000 ATK Beatstick of two uses and later a 3000 DEF wall if it manages to survive, Evilswarm Thanatos if you want a little towers monster, Gagaga Samurai to have a 1900 ATK monster that can attack two times. And for the Links well you have an abundance of monsters you could use.</span>  <span>Well I hope you like this deck. Maybe in the future I can edit this Deck and put in the Description a video in which I showcase this deck.Â </span>"

A lot of the deck locks you into Dark monsters from the Extra Deck, so I would recommend making Romulus quickly, as Dragon Ravine is a great card for any Dragon-based deck since it was first printed, or if you need to make a Halqifibrax combo to get started you should to it early in your turn.  Borrelend Dragon is a very strong card that just got printed in the TCG, as it cannot be destroyed by battle or card effect, nor can it be targeted, meaning that the only outs to it are a Kaiju monster or a non-targeting absorption effect, such as Underworld Goddess of the Closed Word, and by negating an Effect Monster, permanently, can simultaneously Special Summon a Rokket from the Graveyard.  Chaos Ruler is a very important card for this deck, and is fortunately a Dragon, as loading up the Graveyard is nothing but an advantage for this deck.  Overall, the deck is very strong, very consistent, and shows that it deserves to be considered a meta deck in this format."

Virtual World is a very recursive deck, able to gain advantage by sending cards to the Graveyard, Banishing cards from the Graveyard, and is even able to recycle Banished cards. Chuche is an amazing card that helps the deck immensely, it is one of the only good removal cards that functions under both IO(Imperial Order) and Skill Drain, and is your main source of bringing back your Banished cards, alongside Shenshen. All of the Virtual World Gate Spells and Traps have good Graveyard effects which allow them to special summon(Xuanwu), add a Virtual World monster to hand(Qinglong), or change the Level/Rank of a Virtual World monster you control(Chuche)."

While decking out is technically how you end games, games are decided by how often and how much cards you can draw with Spring of the Mysterune.  One popular variants of Mysterune is Magical Musket. From my playtest, I found them to be rather bricky, and draws with Muskets means no fuel for Spring of Mysterune. Additonally, lack of draws in Magical Musket means finding Mysterune spells to restart Spring of the Mysterune difficult. Live Twins, on the other hands, need far less garnets in deck to function, and the card draws from Ki-Sikil provide valuable chances to kickstart Spring of the Mysterune. In trading off the S/T negate from Magical Musket, Live Twin also provide non-targeting and non destruction removal, which out monsters that would otherwise need to be destroyed in battle, which the deck cannot do.  &nbsp;  <a data-name=""Spring of the Mysterune"">Spring of the Mysterune</a>  The heart and soul of the deck. search it out with Point of the Mysterune, or Huginn, Wings of Mysterune and make sure it always triggers. Drawing 1 is crazy good, drawing 2 is horrid.  &nbsp;  Point of the Mysterune  ROTA of the deck. Use it to fill up the grave with extra spells, or use it after Spring of the Mysterune to round out your hands.  &nbsp;  Mysterune of Freezing Curse/ Mysterune of the Brilliant Flame/ Mysterune of Destruction  All Mysterune cards are OPT, so use these turn 1 to summon the fusion, since they are generally dead. But these are the cards you should hold on if possible for disruptions, but feel free to burn them during opponent's end phase to cycle cards and mill their decks.  &nbsp;  Mysterune of Slumber  You run 3 because this card is ALWAYS playable, so Spring of Mysterune can trigger.  &nbsp;  Mysterune of Disruption / Mysterune of the Golden Droplets / Mysterune of the Raging Storm  Additional names to summon Extra Deck monsters, Golden Droplets -&gt; Disruption mills 7 cards from the deck.  Raging storm can hit pretty high numbers too, but its value mostly derive from being a easy trigger for Spring of Mysterune, and being a finisher to mill the remaining 2-3 cards from the deck.  &nbsp;  Live Twin Lil-la/ Live Twin Ki-sikil / Live Twin Ki-sikil Frost  With Secret Password and Sunny's Snitch, there are 6 starters to find Trouble Sunny. Ki-Sikil Frost is not only a ext or ender, but the extra card draw she can provide goes a long way in accelerating your game plan. With Gigantic Splight, negating any Live Twin doesn't stop the play completely, as you can choose whether to get a draw or a pop next turn. Do keep in mind those lines of plays will open you up to Feather Duster or Lightning Storm, with Trouble Sunny, you can activate Trouble Sunny and summon Huginn, Wings of the Mysterune to protect your field spell instead.  &nbsp;  Secret Password / Sunny Snitch  Because of the heavy card draws in the deck, and the importance of keeping Spring of Mysterune engine running, running more copies of the Live Twin and their searchers can brick draws from Spring of the Mysterune.  &nbsp;  Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la / Forbidden Droplet  Cards that can out annoying cards that cannot be targeted or destroyed.  &nbsp;  Metalfoes Fusion  Good discard target for Huginn, pop it with Lil-La to get a draw. Generally a good card that soften the impacts of disruptions.  &nbsp;  Called By the Grave / Ash Blossom / Ghost Belle/ Upstart Goblin / Talents  Free slots in the deck. Talents is a second copy of Called By The Grave.  &nbsp;  Deceit of the Mysterune  It is a dead card going first and second. You only search this if you already have a field spell, or want to end the game quicker. In both of those cases, we are already winning, winning harder is whatever. However, drawing this when you are low on cards or going second is terrible.  &nbsp;  <img class="""" src=""Spring of Mysterune"" alt="""" />"
