I basically took cards from both decks to make this one. No way in Hell is this a competitive deck just, something to get me back into the flow of things. For those who are completely familiar with the Legendary decks by all means please, I'm open to suggestions on what cards are keepers and which cards to swap out to make it most effective."

(Train/Railway Deck June 2020)","

One of my first video games as a kid was Jet Set Radio Future, and I would just absolutely LOVE playing it! I'd be glued to my XBOX for hours, grinding and spraying graffiti everywhere. And one of my favorite songs from the official soundtrack was ""The Concept of Love."" <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V4IEV8l-gA</a>

&nbsp;

Plus, I've heard that Japan has some really bizarre trains. That is what inspired me to make this deck: My nostalgia and my love of Japan. This honestly functions like your typical Train deck, blindly going second and trying to OTK your opponent. To prevent your opponent from making plays, this deck uses a total of 12 hand traps, although cards that help you OTK are also in the Side Deck."

If you follow the TCG ban list, upstart goblin is limited and allure of darkness is unlimited but in the OCG ban list, upstart goblin is unlimited and allure of darkness semi-limited.

the only problem with this deck is that a single ash blossom or Called by the grave can stop your whole strategy if your opponent use it correctly.

-pros:
<ul>
 	<li>lots of heavy hitters: FGDs, ten thousand dragon, diabolos, bastard ashen dragon</li>
 	<li>control the board and hand with: virus, albus's,, darkest diabolos,  cataclysm, hieratic seal of heavenly spheres (non targeting removal)</li>
 	<li>lots of disruption in the battle phase: chobham, larvalaur, checksum, noctovision, phantazmay</li>
 	<li>kinda easy to swarm the board and/ or fill the graveyard, mainly with larvalaur, noctovision, galactic spiral dragon, red-eyes darkness metal</li>
 	<li>rokket synchron instant allowing for lv 8 synchro</li>
</ul>
-cons:
<ul>
 	<li>not really that consistent, maybe you'll get stuck with a lot of high level monsters in your hand and nothing to do
<ul>
 	<li>that can be turned around with allure of darkness/trade-in if you are lucky enough</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>again , it's a fun deck , so don't expect to do much against a meta deck with a lot of negations or something like that</li>

Aroma jar will funnel you life while also staying on the field and having battle protection, and Effect Veiler, Star Pendulumgraoh and Time Pendulumgraph will give you protection from almost anything if you set it up right. Secret Village also gives you spell protection, and the two Magician's Hands give you S/T protection. Now I know the new cards have come out, but I didn't add those. So yeah, that's it.

Mystic Mine may seem counterintuitive at first but aids tremendously in stalling the opponent during situations where Toon Kingdom has been removed off the field and in circumstances where activating this card may genuinely help replenish the hand and circumvent the duel. Toon World is used during situations where the opponent has already swarmed several monsters and is used in conjunction with Mystic Mine to achieve plays (particularly with Toon Black Luster Soldier whose banishing properties help cripple the opponent's field slowly.) Pot of Extravagance and Reckless Greed aids in providing the deck the necessary draw power.  On the other hand, Waking The Dragon helps in surprising the opponent and stunning them (such as with Bagooska) or simply making it more difficult for the opponent to deal with the field (such as with Raidraptor-Ultimate Falcon). All the other cards are pretty standard. The real player, however, in the deck, isn't really Mystic Mine or even Toon Kingdom though, as There Can Be Only One pretty much fuels the deck's control power strangely enough (being one of the few decks that can make genuine use of it actually helps it a lot.) If Mystic Mine ever gets banned lol there's still a lot of interesting options to choose from.

Possibly my most generic build.,"While I like the grind game of the Turbo Control build, I also like comboing off, so I'm back on Synchros for a second. I still plan to play the control variant, which has a lot of advantages, such as space to run 9 card draw, the advantage of running 3 each of Golden Land Traps, and generally puts more interactions on the board with its spell and trap line-up than the Synchro version, which can often be dead in the water if your Needlefibre gets hand trapped. On the other hand, some percentage of the time you can win just by comboing off of 1 card, and the deck is uniquely suited to take advantage of the Jet Synchron engine, and in my opinion, the Synchro deck is better in most matchups for that reason alone."

They all have an effect that tributes a monster to be a D.D. Crow or Monster or Spell and Trap negation. This is a going-second version of the deck.

The idea is to play as little normal summons as possible to maximize the amount of mills on Monster Gate. Lair of Darkness is a great support card, allowing you to once per turn tribute your opponent's monsters to activate your effects. You can take out Dark Ruler No More for any going-second card you'd like, such as Evenly Matched, Lightning Storm, Infinite Impermanence, etc."

This deck is based around the field spell ""Generaider Boss Stage"" to create resources and provide disruptions such as Spell Speed 2 banish removal, effect negation, and summon negation during your opponent's turn.

In this build, I decided to run 10 field searchers and 3 Boss Stage, which are about 88% to open with them in the starting hand.

Basically the field is 1 card Spell Speed 2 banish removal, effect negation, and summon negation during your opponent's turn, but it loses to any kind of Spell Speed 2 spell/trap removal. So I decided to run the Jet Synchron Auroradon package to provide some protection for the field and provide some more disruption.

P.S. English isn't my first language. Sorry for bad grammar.

Fire king and True King make the deck very fluid

Dinosaur give the brutal attacks

The secret for using this deck is too destroy cards in your hand or field to allow the summon of every monster you desire from the deck.

One combo could be:
<ul>
 	<li>Summon <strong>Oviraptor</strong>, you can get it with cards like "" <strong>Fossil Dig </strong>"" or another effects of some monsters that you have.</li>
 	<li>After that send <strong>Overtex Qoatlus </strong>to the GY and active its effect</li>
 	<li>Take the <strong>Evolution Pill</strong></li>
 	<li>You are able to summon the Tyranno with the Pill</li>
</ul>

(...and their new friends, I:P and Zeroboros...)","<span><strong><em>♪ Let's play hide-and-seek with the friendly Märfaes! ♪</em></strong></span>

Merfaes (or <em>Märfaes</em>, depending on your translation), are a new archetype in Rise of the Duelist.
Right now they serve well as a beast advantage engine, but still need a few more cards to have a chance of being meta-viable.

That isn't going to stop us.
I'll level with you in advance; <strong>this is not a meta deck.</strong> It can't beat full-power Adamancipator or Eldlich.
However, I've done my best to test and refine it and compare it to other Märfae deck variants, so <strong>this might just be the <em>most</em> meta-ready Märfae deck build</strong> you'll find on here, at least at the present moment. So let's get into the choices!

<span><em>- Playing Around With Märfaes: A Basic Primer -</em></span>

<strong>The essential idea of this deck</strong> is being able to make plays on both your own and your opponent's turn to keep a hold of the game. You'll be using effects like <em>Obedience Schooled</em> and <em>Ties of the Brethren</em> early game to establish a board, then using the recursion of your Märfae children to keep the advantage and disruption up later. You can go first or second; you'd rather go first, but you can adjust based on whether your opponent's playing OTKs or not.

The core gameplay options of this deck revolve around a triple threat of Extra Deck summoning mechanisms: using <strong>Naturia Beast</strong> as your premier Synchro, <strong>Märfaes of the Forest </strong>as your main Xyz play, and <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> as the core Link of the deck. These let you stun spells, disrupt monsters while obtaining advantage, and go into powerful game-ending plays respectively.

Each of the main Märfae monsters summons themselves from your hand during your End Phase, and can bounce themselves back to the hand when attacked or when your opponent summons, in order to activate a unique effect; <strong>Puppie</strong> summons a lv2 Beast from deck, <strong>Cathy</strong> gets any decked Beast to hand (notably, it can get Rescue Cat(!)), <strong>Fennie</strong> summons a Beast from your hand, and <strong>Ponie</strong> recycles a Beast from the Graveyard. We play an assortment of all of these - I originally ran only 1 each of Fennie and Ponie as their effects are mediocre, but quickly found that having multiple Märfae names accessible is useful as their effects are all hard once per turn.

Your main disruption options during the opponent's turn are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Märfaes of the Forest</strong> Fiendish Chains an opponent whenever a Märfae returns to your hand, letting you freeze your opponent at critical moments as long as the foe's effect isn't an on-summon one.</li>
 	<li><strong>Naturia Beast </strong>locks any deck that relies on Spells out of the game altogether, and lets you get monsters in your grave for later.</li>
 	<li><strong>Kalantosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest </strong>will often be your Puppie/Fennie target of choice, popping any card the moment it hits the field.</li>
 	<li><strong>Hop-Ear Squadron</strong> is a powerful Cathy target, as you can instantly Synchro Summon into a Herald or Hastorr the moment you add it.</li>
 	<li><strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> is the ultimate culmination of your ""play on the foe's turn"" stratagem; it lets you utilise those Märfae self-bounce resource getters and their summon-at-end-phase to toolbox into <strong>Zeroboros, Borrelsword,</strong> or whatever other Link helps you solve the present problems.</li>
 	<li>...and you've got plenty more convenient backrow support, such as old staples <strong>Called by the Grave and Ash Blossom</strong>, <strong>Märfae Tag</strong> for summoning, <strong>Super Rush Recklessly</strong> to yeet opposing threats right back to the deck, and even odd picks like <strong>Peropero Cerperus!</strong></li>
</ul>
<span><em>- Disowned by Märfae Mommie herself! -</em></span>

I'll address the elephant in the room while I can. <strong>This deck does not run <em>Märfae Mommie</em>, the second Xyz. It also does not run<em> Märfae Time</em>, the Trap.</strong> Why?
<strong>First of all, I'm sorry, but Mommie is... not good.</strong> You have to expend 5 material to make her the best she can be, and that best is... a weaker Yubel with no effect protection. If I were playing Heroic Champion I could have solved world hunger by making a five material Xyz, so needless to say Mommie is not worth the investment.

<strong>This also means that Märfae Time isn't worth it</strong> - at best you're getting 1-2 bounces by expending materials from your Märfaes of the Forest, which isn't much advantage for a slow trap. Märfaes simply have better ways to interact on their opponent's turn, as the above proves!

Cutting both of these has given us much more room to focus on cards that do matter, as this deck is pretty short on both main and extra deck room. Pragmatism never hurt anybody!

<span><em>- Interactions and choices to keep in mind -</em></span>

First of all: <strong>Search stoppers like Ash Blossom are a pretty big threat to this deck.</strong> Most of your ways to go off on your own turn such as Ties/Rescue/Obedience are blocked out by it, and though it's not uncommon that you'll draw into two or more of those, it's still something to keep in mind. You've got three Called to help cover yourself on that regard, but if that ever feels like it's not enough for a particular matchup, feel free to splurge on those Three Tactical Talents in the side deck!

Related to that; you don't have too many cards that lock you into specific conditions, but <strong>Obedience and Ties lock you</strong> into <em>only Beasts and no more Special Summoning respectively.</em> Obedience, therefore, is best when you don't want to go for I:P, and instead want to make an opening board of something like Forest + Puppie + Natbeast with a bunch of backrow and card advantage ready. Ties's limitation is less of a problem; you're not doing it to gain material, you're using it to get two more Märfaes from deck to field so you can proceed to pop off with Masqs and Kalantosas and Hopears and the like on your foe's turn! Use them wisely and you can't go wrong!

On another note, <strong>what you should search with Märfaes of the Forest depends on the situation.</strong> <em>Hide-And-Seek</em> is a powerful one; giving a single effect protection per turn is surprisingly useful and lets you do amusing actions like keep the material you got from Rescue Cat, while it also lets you constantly recycling all the monsters you're going to be getting time and time again to get free hand advantage. I can't count the number of times in practice I shuffled back the exact three cards of Mine Mole, Valerifawn, and Naturia Beast, or thereabouts, to proc it... <em>Märfae Tag</em> is also a powerful option that lets you do stuff like surprise proc'ing an I:P-made Zeroboros to clear your opponent's field, but if you don't need any of them, <em>Puppie</em> (or whatever best Märfae you don't have on hand at the time) is always a safe bet.

Finally, just remember that <strong>the Extra Deck and Side Deck for this deck are by no means locked in stone.</strong> There's a lot of different picks you can take, from different rank 2 Xyz, different Link toolboxing, et cetera. The side deck right now just reflects a few tools that might be useful - Barkion helps a lot in trap-centric matchups but is hard to make, Cerburrel works well with cards like Valerifawn and Twin Twisters <em>(if you feel lucky, you can even run a Danger! variant of the deck with Bigfoot and Jackalope) </em>and lets you make Unicore for a very unique stun option, and so forth. Definitely experiment to make the deck suit your own tastes!

<span><em>- Final Thoughts -</em></span>

Ultimately, the Märfae archetype is a very unique and thematic deck lineup that has a surprising amount of depth and flexibility to their play and has potential to become all the more powerful if more support is released from them in the future. From churning out advantage to going for unexpected kills with link 4s, there's a lot they can show off, and I hope this has convinced you to take a stroll in the forest yourself and try them out!"

I wanted to take advantage of the space in the deck to run 9 hand traps. 9 helps really ensure that we'll see a hand trap most of the time, and there just weren't other cards I considered essential enough. Nibiru is really good right now with all the combo running around, and Imperm and Crow are also really good against Eldlich and Adamancipator going first or second, so this split seems good. I'm not maining Dark Ruler, because IMO it's not good enough against Eldlich Synchron or against any deck with space for Jet Synchron combos/literally any 1 card Needlefibre. They're in the side deck for when a hand trap isn't as good or better.

We have 3 Deep Sea Diva and 3 Neptabyss with 3 Dragoons, 3 Minstrel, Lappis, and Moulinglacia. This means Diva ends on Moulinglacia + VFD having drawn 2 cards and hand looped our opponent for 3, with Neptabyss also making VFD + Draw 2. I cut the Formula Synchron combo to make space for some backup/followup plays in Bujinki Ahashima, Apollousa, and Bahamut Shark into Toad (running 3 cards just to draw a single card seemed excessive). 3 Heavy Infantry makes sense, since we go into Coral Drgon and Crocodragon as part of our main combo, and the potential to seriously break boards while comboing off is super clutch.

1 001 and 2 O-Lion are pretty key. 2 O-Lion is about always having an O-Lion to combo off with even if you brick, since the whole deck is pretty dedicated to comboing off one route.

3 Deep Sea Aria help find us any low-level sea Serpent, usually Diva, to start combos. The deck doesn't excel at putting monsters in the GY, but this card gives you 3 more situational copies of Diva, which is clutch. Pot of Avarice is at 3 which is insane, and I genuinely think more decks can play it. It contributes greatly to the grind game while also giving card advantage. While it might seem like a bit of a ""win more"" card, the truth is any deck that can easily put 5-10 monsters in the GY off of 1-2 cards should probably be running this. The card also isn't once per turn, which decks like this can take sometimes take advantage of (though not as well as Salamangreats, just sayin').

(Just remember to do your Zoodiac combo before activating the effects of Ashuna and Shaman so you don't screw yourself over.)

Side note: Realistically you'll be better running 2 Mapura and 1 Nahata insted of 2 Nahata and 0 Mapura like in here, but i just don't like the artwork of Mapura (lol) and most of the time you'll only use the non Light/Dark/Earth Tenyi monsters as fodder for your summons, specially for Archnemeses Protos (which despite being short of 1 attribute, i still can summon it pretty consistently).

The extra deck is more of a ""Recommended cards"" section so you could try other combinations that you may find more useful to your playstyle."

I liked the Popperup engine enough I dedicated a deck to it.,"Pretty simple deck, pure control Eldlich. We have 6 hand traps, 24 cards that combo with our card draw techs, and 9 of said techs, which are cards which can gain simply absurd advantage by pitching cards which we want in the GY to draw cards.

The card draw is the most important part. Magicians' Souls is the key engine piece of the deck, its ability to send cards from the hand or the GY makes it even better with Cursed Eldland than the other options. You're seeing things right, I'm normal summoning the sumbitch. Why not, the deck has no other normal summons anyways. Popperup is just an absurd card, a potential +6 if you ""combo"". Hand Destruction is a high risk - high reward option, since it greatly improves our own consistency since our deck is built around it, while it might actually disrupt an opponent relying on small combos and hand traps. Definitely pull these out in the mirror, though game 1 our deck is far better suited to take advantage of it than the average Eldlich build. With 9 of these the odds of seeing 1 in your opening hand is reasonably high.

24 cards are part of recursive grind engines. The only reason for 1 red Eldlixir is speculating on it being limited in the near future. Run 3 for sure while they're legal. All the Eldlich cards are here in full force, alongside Lost Wind, Titanocider, and the card advantage engine which is Metalfoes Fusion. You can use it as fodder for Golden Lord or the draw engine, all while drawing extra cards. 24 cards means nearly 2 of 3 cards will be cards the deck wants in the gy, alongside the 1 of 5 which can pitch it there (Golden Lord not included). You want all the Eldlich cards possible, since you'll often be throwing away copy 1.

6 hand traps means we will see them in just under 2/3 of all games, giving us a chance when going second game 1. The game plan going first is good enough we should only need them going second, but the deck could be punished for that. Imperm is particularly synergistic with Souls, and good right now, while Crow is too good to pass up even with 3 Huaquero.

Edit* Changed the numbers. Reduced recursion to fit in hand trap 7, running 3 red splatter while this is legal. Also running Pot of Extravagence. While it does lock you out of other draw for the turn, you aren't using your extra deck, and the card can be held on to in order to significantly improve your grind game, or be filtered through with your other draw engines."

Now is a bad time for this deck. With Needlefibre combos dominating the format, it's way too risky to run a deck with little room for handtraps that wants to go second. On the other hand, I think the deck's fundamentals are actually really solid. Citadel synergizes with Train cards, the deck takes total advantage of broken Earth Machine support, you have great utility link and Xyz plays including True King of All Calamities of your own.

2x Machina Citadel are the main reason to play the Machina engine. Having one of these in the GY essentially gives your Super Dora a floating effect that wipes your opponent's board at spell speed 2 at a time of your choosing, and you want the second copy so you can loop 2 of them out of your gy. This guy is a good backup boss monster, and the center of Urgent Schedule otks.

2x Machina Metalcruncher give you some normal summons. These help make Calamities, which is easier than you'd think with Urgent Switchyard, Flying Pegasus, and Machina Redeployment alongside Machina Megaform and Machina Irradiator. They also search a train to your hand, which helps make rank 10s. These are just better than Night Express, but you need 1 Night Express to tutor with Switchyard, so I'm only running 2. Both of these could be 3, but space is tight.

1 each of Fortress, Irradiator, and Megaform. Fortress is actually kind of broken, the thing inherent summons itself multiple times a turn if you pitch it with Scrap Recycler. Because we have so many ways to search it, one is all you need, since you don't want multiples in your hand. It's also a good beatstick, which can float into Megaform if it's in your GY, and is hard to remove with monsters without taking a penalty. Irradiator and Megaform are a free Citadel, or really any Machina card you want (Citadel). This combo also helps to make your Xyz plays, and is easy with Redeployment.

For Trains we have 1 Night Express, and 2 Flying Pegasus, to grab with Switchyard. Flying Pegasus can be a good normal summon in its own right, and helps make those Xyz plays seem easy. There are also 3 each of Bullet Train and Freight Train, not much to say about these, they're the bread and butter of the train deck. You want 3 of each to find them with Metalcruncher, but I could see cutting a Freight Train for a Citadel.

3 Scrap Recycler are run, alongside engine requirements Scrap Golem, O-Lion, and Gizmek Orochi. Please don't ban O-Lion because Needlefibre and Auroradon are too good. Just ban Auroradon and Needlefibre, scraps did nothing wrong. You could run a huge Needlefibre combo out of here with Jet Synchron, but in testing I had trouble making a good Needlefibre combo that didn't use up space needed for Trains. It seems better to have more utility rather than focus on a single game plan everyone is preparing for anyways. The Scrap engine is still incredibly good, even going first it's a 1.5 card Apollousa with 4 negates, and Scrap Recycler sends all kinds of targets in this deck. These are also insane alongside Urgent Schedule and Machina Citadel going second. Orochi also helps make Dingirsu, and fun fact, with Megaform your can even put 3 materials on him some of the time.

I'm running 8 interactive cards, plus effectively 3 mystic mine, but none of them are handtraps. The goal is to go second and OTK, so we have cards that will help to break board in mind.

3 Jizikiru the Star Destroyer Kaiju are run. You could run Gamecial for Water Barrier Statue, or wind Kaijus even for Wind Barrier Statue, but you get the most synergy running Kaijus that are (sort of) trains. I've also got 3 Lightning Storm to help break boards and deal with Backrow, and 2 Dark Ruler No More so I don't autolose all the time going second. Not Otking is actually ok in this deck IMO, its grind game is still pretty good despite being a big dumb otk deck.

We've effectively got 3 Switchyard and 3 Mystic Mine thanks to 1 of each and 1 Terraforming and 1 Set Rotation. 3 of each while only using 4 deck spaces is the reason for this split - it uses as little deckspace as possible while still letting me run the numbers I want anyways. Mystic Mine can lock games down and facilitate Liebe or Borrelsword OTKs. Switchyard is an insane combo piece that virtually ensures you make a Rank 10.

There's not much to say about Urgent Schedule and Machina Redeployment. Urgent Schedule is an insane card in Machina AND trains, especially going second, and is just broken with Citadel and Recycler. Redeployment fixes your hand while pitching something to the GY, and finds combo pieces or way to Citadel in the process. In my opinion you must run 3 of each of these cards in the deck."

Dragun + Absolute Zero – Acid combo + Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax (or e.g apollousa) in 1 round. Best Hero deck .

Blackwings are OP. Over the years, they have had countless numbers incarnations. And here is the newest of them. Deck contains 2 OP combos.

Gouki and Dragun it seems strange, and what this deck really is ? I think it’s strong aggressive speed duel OTK deck which can surprise you and opponent.

Perfect form and proportion of this Noble Knight deck appeals to me.

The newest Chaos Space can search both Photon Thrasher and Butterspy. Endboard is Masq'd Avramax + Apollousa with","Regular Dark Warrior deck with its Gouki replaced with Chaos lineup because Codebreaker engine is similar to Gouki Rematch without having to run bunch of Gouki bricks (Gouki only has a handful of special summon being Suprex and Headbatt), also Accesscode replaces Giant Ogre in terms of big beater, is more generic, and built-in spell speed 4 multiple destruction. Chaos Space boosts this deck consistency by searching Photon Thrasher or Blue Mountain Butterspy and Chaos Creator easily benefits from Phantom Knights because they banish themselves making Chaos Creator second effect online. 1 O-Lion and 2 Grappler Angler are just combo pieces, the combo is very long  and need zone management (make sure to <strong>put O-Lion token outside of Tenyi zones</strong>). Download the replay file <a>here</a>.

Going 2nd, we can use Tenyi link to pop 2 (non-targeting) by leaving O-Lion token and Linkross token on field and make Link Spider using O-Lion token then continue to link climb to Codebreaker then Accescode for more pops.

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/51ZxOXQ.png"" alt=""image"" />

Pros: Super consistent, multiple negations, big monster with immunity, has follow-up play, the new Chaos lineup is more recursive means plus for days, big slot for staples, and the combo can adapt going 1st or 2nd.

Cons: Weak board and only has monster negation"
