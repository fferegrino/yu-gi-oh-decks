He who likes the summoning of monsters through Fusion. Back with another Eldlich deck profile but this time, it's not necessarily budget but a more concentrated one. Extra Deck Eldlich, to be more specific.  Before anything else, I wanna make it clear that this is NOT the stun variant of Eldlich that runs three copies of <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, but instead a more reactive and interactive Extra Deck variant so if you're looking for the latter, this is not that type of deck.  The non-standard stuff:  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> - Despite what the category states, three of this one is absolutely mandatory, including your one copy of <a data-name=""Golden Land Forever!"">Golden Land Forever!</a>. I can never stress this enough, you NEED protection against <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>. <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> is just, whatever.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> - Not only do you need protection against it, you also need it in case your opponent decides to make you go second. Arguably the best board wipe in the game, even better than the overrated <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> that's a UR, btw.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a> - You need interaction against back row, in addition to your <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>. You can't rely on just one form of removal. This can also save your Golden Land and Eldlixir traps from <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> by chaining it and destroying those.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> - The second best form of removal in the game. It does not target, it does not destroy, and it's banishing is optional.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> - This card, alongside <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> is just pure cheat code. It's basically a <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, but better. You can use it as a discard fodder for your <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a>, and it'll just reset itself on to the field as soon as your opponent Special Summons an Extra Deck monster.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a> - Better than <a data-name=""Raigeki Break"">Raigeki Break</a> or even <a data-name=""Karma Cut"">Karma Cut</a>. It does not discard for cost, it's a generic face-up banishing removal, it can also be a body on board. It's wonderful. Also a body on board for purposes that we'll address later.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> - The second boss monster of the deck. This deck is the reason why you'll never run out of <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> and <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a> because during your opponent's Standby Phases, you can return a banished copy of them back to the graveyard. That's insane. You can also just pitch this card to the graveyard for your <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> and it can recycle back one of the cards in the graveyard, including itself, and this is not a once per turn effect.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Shiranui Shogunsaga"">Shiranui Shogunsaga</a> - Just a beat stick in case you locked yourself out of attacking with the <a data-name=""Cursed Eldland"">Cursed Eldland</a>. And he's free.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a> - An even bigger beat stick that can interrupt your opponent by not necessarily negating the effects of your opponent's monsters, but banishes them.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Colossal Fighter&lt;/span&gt;"">Colossal Fighter</a> - This spot is absolutely free. I only chose this because it's a monster that keeps coming back and isn't a once per turn.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Armades, Keeper of Boundaries"">Armades, Keeper of Boundaries</a>, <a data-name=""Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon"">Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon</a>, and <a data-name=""Ally of Justice Catastor"">Ally of Justice Catastor</a> - Armades makes landing game ending attacks easier, Catastor gets rid of problematic non-DARK monsters without targeting, and Adreus is a generic spot removal and holds your Golden Land monsters as well to slow down the tempo of the game. You don't want Eldlich to speed through your in-archetype Traps. Any of their slots can be flex spots.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Crimson Knight Vampire Bram"">Crimson Knight Vampire Bram</a> - This card is funny. He's a Zombie type monster, which means <a data-name=""Cursed Eldland"">Cursed Eldland</a> won't lock you out of attacking with him, he has 2500 ATK which is pretty sizeable. He can steal monsters from your opponent's graveyard, and if your opponent for some reason happens to have some <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</a> or any boss monster just chillin' in there like <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a> for example, you can just yoink it. He also brings himself back during the next Standby Phases after the turn he was destroyed, and all it takes to make him is your Conquistador and Huaquero, which shouldn't be difficult.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition"">Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition</a> - He's technically a floodgate, and is a pretty sizeable beat stick at 2200 ATK (can crash with <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>, pog), and most importantly, he's a Zombie type monster.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Sky Cavalry Centaurea"">Sky Cavalry Centaurea</a> - If this card is good enough to out <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> or <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>, it's good enough for decks that can make it that does not have those incredible boss monsters. This monster is the main reason why I'm running <a data-name=""Paleozoic Olenoides"">Paleozoic Olenoides</a> and <a data-name=""Paleozoic Canadia"">Paleozoic Canadia</a>.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Paleozoic Marella"">Paleozoic Marella</a> - This card is just free Eldlich set up. It dumps a trap card from your deck to the GY. ANY trap card. Also a free body for your Synchro and Xyz plays.</span>  Everything else should be pretty obvious. I mean, it's Eldlich. You can cut cards that you don't like or don't have access to yet. Nothing much else to say about it. Enjoy climbing."

By no means do I believe Eldlich is a dead deck despite potentially losing a power 1-of, I think for a returning player or someone wanting to go from being ""casual"" to having a ""locals"" or potentially higher in certain metas level deck, this is an extremely safe deck to play, learn and get used to the game.  While not being Extra Deck reliant, you still definitely have the opportunity to access some real haymakers such as Zeus or Ningirsu and the sheer advantage engine granted by the natural progression of the game through using stuff like your Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine and Conquistador's graveyard effects really keep you going strong without a great deal of worry. However, one must take time with all decks like this to learn when to use their resources and maintain that advantage engine to avoid burning themselves out at the crucial moments of the game.  Edit: It appears Eldlich got even better than before."

Currently Plat II with 52 wins and 10 losses.,"I've tried to adapt my TCG list into Master Duels. By only playing this deck, I've reached Plat II with 52 wins and 10 losses.  One thing that I really dislike is the fact that it seems like you have to play Maxx C in this format. Without it you will have a rough time playing against all the combo decks. I think its also mandatory to play 3x Ash and 2x Called By because of the fact that your opponent could have his own Maxx C in his hand.  My thought process building this deck was to make the deck as consistent as it can be in the BO1 format with a ban list that has Nadir Servant at 1 and Magical Meltdown at 2. This is why I use 3x Pot of Prosperity with only 5 Shaddoll Monsters. You really dont want them to brick you because it can be a really hard game if you start with 2-3 Shaddols in your hand. Also I've cut out the one copy of Ariel because it hasn't seen much use besides being a normal summon to go into Almiraj to get your Maximus going.  The extra deck has some choices that I'm still testing. <ol>  	<li>First things first. I would never cut the 2nd Mechaba or Winda. You will need 2 Mechabas in a lot of duels while having 2 Windas helps you to combo with your 1st Winda to go into your 2nd one on the next turn using Shaddoll Schism.</li>  	<li>Yes I am playing the one copy of Magellanica as a huge Beatstick can be enough to ruin your enemys day in Master Duels. Also it's a good target for Super Polymerization against decks like Tri Brigade. It can also be used with the enemys Maxx C from the grave so you can make this guy really often.</li>  	<li>Starvin Venom Fusion Dragon can come in clutch but wont come out in the most duels.</li>  	<li>Cards that you could cut from the extra deck in my opinion: Pugatrio, Raidjin, Starvin Venom Fusion Dragon, Magellanica</li>  	<li>Cards that you could add to the extra deck in my opinion: 2nd Apkallone, 2nd N'tss, Mudragon of the Swamp</li> </ol> There are still a lot of possibilitys on how you can adapt the deck. <ol>  	<li>Play 2x Dogmatika Maximus becuase Nadir Servant is at 1</li>  	<li>Cut out one Shaddoll Fusion because the Shaddoll package is really small und play a lot vs stuff like Eldlich</li>  	<li>Put in something like Harpyies Feather Duster or LS to have an easier time vs Eldlich, etc. (I think the deck still perfoms really good against Eldlich without those but it will help in the matchup)</li>  	<li>Use Nibiru instead of Maxx C for another Light monster to go into Mechaba or Construct</li> </ol>"

An incredible anti-meta rogue deck, Generaider Windwitch slow","I achieved Platinum 1 rank with Generaider Windwitch 01/24/2022 with a 70%-ish winrate, consistently taking down decks like Shadoll-Invoked, Sky Striker, Tribrigade and Adamancipators!  If you want a detailed explanation how to use this deck, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/generaider-windwitch-july-2021/"">click here.</a>  This deck features incredibly potent anti-meta cards like Dimension Shifter, Macro Cosmos, Imperial Order and True King of Calamities. Generaider Windwitch plays comfortably under these floodgates, while the opponent keels over and dies. If you have access to any of these cards, they generally insta-win you the game since they shut off almost every route of play.  While preferring to go first, this deck can still comfortably go second if forced to, since it features 12 hand traps. It can also play past interruption, since it has multiple methods to start off its gameplay.  I found it funny that almost nobody knows what the heck Generaiders and Windwitches do, and they end up underestimating the deck until it's too late. Before long, your opponent may find themself facing down Harr's omni-negate, Crystal Wing's monster negate, Dimension Shifter's banish, and lethal backrow like Judgment and Imperial Order!  Another bonus about this deck is that it functions nicely under Maxx ""C,"" the undisputed king of Master Duel. This deck doesn't summon much, so the opponent doesn't have much incentive to use Maxx ""C."" This deck can even function under Summon Limit or Winda!  The only major problem about this deck is that it bricks HARD, since there are 6 ""hard"" bricks in the deck (5 Generaider bosses + Ice Bell) and 1 ""soft"" brick (Glass Bell). This weakness is avoided with Pot of Prosperity and Maxx ""C"" functioning as cards that will get you starters for the deck.  If you ever use this deck in Master Duel, I hope you enjoy piloting it as much as I do!"

Main strategy revolves around utilizing Soulpiercer to draw the cards you need to summon Benkei (Flutist if Benkei is in hand, Peacemaker if not). Also using battleball to tribute opponent's monster for your synchros, especially any of their level 10's to summon Steamtrain.</span>  <span>Brute force your way to a win with big damage by utilizing Horns and/or Soulshield on Benkei or any high level synchro. This can be particularly effective with Stealth Ninja's direct attack.</span>  <span>Never be quick to surrender with this deck, if i've learned anything using it in 100's of duels, it's the amount of surprising comeback victories it can achieve, don't be afraid to grind things out, one card can make all the difference.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Key points:</span></strong>  <span>. Gigagloves, Brawler and Swordsman make for great stall tactics.</span>  <span>. Get your Gigagloves, Flutists and Soulpiercers into the GY ASAP for their effects.</span>  <span>. Waraji and Transporter can always be special summoned at any time during main phases, combine this with Trumpeter's special summon or Fist's GY effect for quick synchro summons. Magnet can be also be useful here as your normal summon, depending on your hand.</span>  <span>. Use Peacemaker tribute effect on Gigagloves, Flutist or Soulpiercer preferably.</span>  <span>. Save your equip cards for Benkei or synchros.</span>  <span>. Shutendoji is essential for going second and wiping out your opponent's backrow or field spells.</span>  <span>. Stealth Ninja can direct attack, make use of this to divert flip effects or effects that occur when opponent's monster is battled.</span>  <span>. Sarutobi and Thief can be used in a pinch to destroy opponent's spells/traps, should Shutendoji fail.</span>  <span>. Thief and Susanowo can steal opponent's spells/traps from field/graveyard for your own use, or simply to prevent the opponent from using them or activating their effects in the GY.</span>  <span>. Musashi is generally used only in a combo to retrieve the quick special summon cards from your graveyard (Waraji, Trumpeter etc)  to summon higher level synchros, don't use him for battle unless you need to.</span>  <span>. Flutist can summon Benkei directly from your hand. Peacemaker can summon Benkei from your deck by attaching to and tributing any of your monsters. Waraji can be used as '2 tributes' to summon Benkei.</span>  <span>. Whenever you have a chance to summon Steamtrain, do so.</span>  <span>. Protect your high level monsters from battle or card effect destruction with Soulbeads and Soulfire Suit.</span>  <span>. Remember that Stealth Ninja revives itself from the GY at the start of your turn if it was destroyed by card effect, save cards in your hand for a comeback if you expect this.</span>  <span>. Drum can be used as an offbeat tuner, or to revive a fallen boss monster.</span>  <span>. Scarecrow can be used for an emergency revival of a boss monster, as well as potentially get a Flutist or Gigagloves in your GY simultaneously. </span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Key weaknesses:</span></strong>  <span>. Skill Drain, Forbidden Chalice, or any effect negation</span>  <span>. Effects which alter battle position and/or prevent position from being altered (Enemy Controller, etc)</span>  <span>. Effects that target defense position monsters (Dark Mirror Force, Ehren Lightsworn Monk, Red Dragon Archfiend, Number 21 etc)</span>  <span>. Mystic Mine can shut this deck down completely.</span>  &nbsp;"

It's very hard for opponent to deal with 1 or 2 Borrelswords that dont get destroyed by effects or battle. Hence, Immortal FurHire!  We dont counter Ash Blossom or Effect Veiler there's ways to do that but it's not worth putting in deck to counter Ash Blossom or Veiler. Less consistent if we add cards to counter it.  Added 3 copies of I:P Masquerena so you can protect all 3 copies of your Borrelsword Dragon (You need that for clever opponents) from Effects so it won't be destroyed by both Card Effects and Battle. Masquerena also allows you to point a link so you can use World Legacy Succession to SS Borrelsword from GY in case it does get wiped somehow. Added protection.  Added 3 copies of Maxx 'C' because every deck in rank is SS turn 1 or 2. This draws you lots of cards if its in your opening hand.  Updated - Now has a ton more GY recursion + More Summons up to 26 for consistency. There's too much control decks floating around with tons of Board Wipes you need to be able to recover your Borrelsword from GY if this happens or you loose 4 summons.  100% Consistent. That's the idea of the wins you'll get. Ez GG's. Since every card in your deck SS to board +1 plus GY recursion."

This and other things have became a passionate hobby to me so in this context the  Paleozoic Frog deck appears to me the most.</span>  <span>The Paleozoic cards are almost an ideal representation of  animals that once lived on Earth( in the  Cambrian Period), so well detailed  which got me in love. So enough about boring stuff and let's get into the deck.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>One to rules them All</span>  <span>The paleozoic  Frog  is a strategy  based in a control type of deck using traps ( and occasionally handtraps) as the main resource of such action. The majority of Paleozoic archetype are trap </span><span>cards</span><span>  with a variety of effects, while having a gimmick to summon themself as a monster (AQUA levEl 2 , 1200 ATK/ 0 DEF) in a CL1 with a trap. Frogs are level 2 AQUA monster which have the ability to swarm the field fast as they can, while aiming to go for the big guy of their archetype Toadally Awesome (what a goof name), a Rank 2 aqua monster with a totally awesome omni negate effect.</span>  <span>Both engines were born to be together, they are so complementary for each other that makes a fearsome rogue strategy.</span>  <span>Who is who on Cruj (a silly brazilian joke)</span>  <span>Frogs everywhere</span>  <span>3x</span> <b>Swap Frog</b><span>: Our silly boy , swap frog is the heart and soul for the frog engine. First of all , the first effect ( a frog's  Foolish burial when it's summoned) is not  once per turn, so you can bounce itself for an additional Gy set up,  like  a </span><b>Ronintoadin</b><span> and a  </span><b>Dupe frog</b><span>. You can even use the </span><b>Toadally</b><b> Awesome</b><span> effect to summon Swap frog from the deck  to extend your play to go in a second Toadally Awesome.</span>  <span>3x </span><b>Dupe frog</b><span>: A control's  graduated, this cute little frog is our food for </span><b>Swap frog</b><span> and</span><span>  </span><b>Ronintoadin</b><span>  to work well. It has a second major effect  to add a frog monster to your hand from deck which is good also because you can use it to go in a link monster  (</span><b>Marincess Coral Anemone</b><b> or </b><b>Mista boy</b><span>)</span>  <span>2x </span><b>Ronintoadin</b><span> : This wanna-be samurai can be summoned from your  Gy banning  a  frog card and that's not a once per turn effect. The swarm ability  of this card is incredible.</span>  <span>3x </span><b>Toadally Awesome</b><span>: A XYZ monster with so much power. These little bastards can detach  a material to summon a frog from the deck , tribute an Aqua monster to negate ANY effect and  if  they go to Gy , can recover a  water monster( itself or another frog). The scariest part is that none of these effects are ""hard"" once per turn ( in other word, if you have more than one on field you can use  this effect again), making this card a fearsome entity. If  you have(as I have)</span> <b>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</b><span>, this card becomes  even scarier.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>Honorary Frogs</span>  <span>2x </span><span>Marincess Coral Anemone</span><span>: An Idol makes an appearance in this deck.

We just got a few of those off of the banlist that just came out (although I'm not a fan of the list overall). Destrudo allows for some synchro 7 plays like dawn dragster going first and black rose going second, and snow is really strong sense you should have a full graveyard at almost all times. Hydralander is one of the centerpieces of the deck, it's a big body that has a quick effect mill 3 and pop, the drawback being that you can't have any monsters with the same name in the graveyard, another reason snow is so good is that it can help manipulate the grave to get out duplicates of those cards. Over the past few banlists BA has also gotten some major unhits in the forms of three tour guide, cir, and graff. Sekka is a crazy draw spell that is pot of greed and upstart goblin in the same card, but with the major drawback of it being the only piece of backrow you can play for the game, it's at one right now so you won't find it always, but it's still very powerful. the dangers provide extra draw power and extension. Also remember that beatrice can mill destrudo or snow to get them into rotation quickly."

The Skill Drain buyout is crazy with it being $36 here in Australia last night and now close to $200 a copy. It's honestly deplorable but hey, this deck is good so if you like to play this game and like this deck I suppose that is the barrier we all must climb over. This list should be pretty optimal for this meta going forward."

Like a whole lot. But its hard and just isn't getting any easier so far, so to make things more fluid for me i added a Halqifibrax combo that end with 2 negates and 1 floodgate.  &nbsp;  2 card combo: <a data-name=""Black Metal Dragon"">Black Metal Dragon</a> + any dragon extender.  Normal summon Black Metal ~Link summon <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> using Black Metal ~Chain link 1 Black Metal and link 2 Striker, adding in sequence <a data-name=""Boot Sector launch"">Boot Sector launch</a> and <a data-name=""Red-eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a> (if you have <a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a> in hand special summon it now) ~(if you didn't special summoned Noctovision but have <a data-name=""Quick Launch"">Quick Launch</a> in hand use it now[Boot sector can also be used as a extender]) Link summon <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Romulus"">Dragunity Knight - Romulus</a> using Striker and the dragon extender, Romulus add <a data-name=""Dragon Ravine"">Dragon Ravine</a> (if you used Noctovision for the link summon you can chainblock) ~activate Dragon Ravine, trigger it effect to discard a card and send <a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a> to the GY ~Romulus already did his job so special summon Darkness Metal by banishing him ~activate Darkness Metal effect to special a Dragon <strong>tuner </strong>from your graveyard ~take a breath ~link Summon <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> using Darkness Metal and the tuner ~Halqifibrax special summon <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> from your deck or hand ~Link summon <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a> using you know what ~Auroradon will summon 3 tokens and after that summon 001 from your Graveyard ~synchro summon <a data-name=""Cupid Pitch"">Cupid Pitch</a> Using a token and 001 ~Activate Auroradon and tribute 2 tokens to special summon <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing"">Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing</a> from your deck ~Coltwing will summon 2 tokens and after that summon 001 by the last time ~Synchro summon <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> using Cupid Pitch and a token ~Chain Savage and Cupid effects. Add <a data-name=""Creation Resonator"">Creation Resonator</a> from your deck to your hand ~special summon said Resonator ~Synchro summon <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> using the Resonator and Coltwing* (Coltwing is now level 7 because there's only one token in the board) ~activate Destrudo in the Graveyard and Target <strong>Deskbot 001* </strong>(if you target the token you won't get Shenshen but <a data-name=""Dawn Dragster"">Dawn Dragster</a>) ~Synchro summon Shenshen using Destrudo and the token.  The result isn't as impressive as it's long, but, to me, is easier to remember than pure dragon link ever-adapting combos. Although that you can play like a normal dragon link deck to some extent if you need to play around something like nibiru or if you draw Coltwing (Coltwing is the only Brick in this deck).  I tested other extenders like Ready Fusion but i decided to preserve the extra deck as it is now.  !Update: added a new line for the combo. Now instead of targeting <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> with <a data-name=""Destrudo"">Destrudo</a> you can target the Auroradon token and make <a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a> that will send <a data-name=""Fairy Tail - Snow to the GY"">Fairy Tail - Snow to the GY</a>.  &nbsp;  Sorry for any grammar mistakes.  Any suggestions are welcome.  GLHF"

Just stop after summoning Gactos, they'll get a draw but you're likely to have Bashelios or a few S/T for protections.</li>  	<li>Make your opponent think they should worry about a card like Meteoragon, so they'll focus on outing it by battle only for you to buff more with Wento</li>  	<li>Another bait is to get your opponent to negate the wrong monster. Fortia and Orpis are the biggest offenders. Everyone knows that Fortia searches, but Orpis' effect to send Bashelios to the GY and then summon can win you a game by ATKing directly for 2900+</li>  	<li>Activate Mountain first when you plan on crashing Fortia/Orpis for a search. If your opponent has an Ash, then they'll use it on Mountain because that the ""Money Card"" and if they don't then that means you get a free Meteoragon in the Battle Phase</li>  	<li>Everyone expects Imperm to be in the middle, place it right of the middle</li>  	<li>If you have 2 traps + Imperm, don't set Imperm. You don't want to risk Harpie'</li> </ul> Turn 2: UNGA BUNGA <ul>  	<li>When ATKing, remember to use your level 4/5's first THEN activate Skylar. She prevents you from ATKing with lv5 or lower monsters once activated</li>  	<li>Yes. Meteoragon is not a hard OPT.</li>  	<li>Yes. Meteoragon does negate a monster's ATK bonus like Accesscode</li>  	<li>Yes. Meteoragon does negate ""Cannot be destroyed by battle or Card effects""</li>  	<li>2x Magnum Shield + Bashelios = 8700 direct ATK</li>  	<li>Save Bashelios to ATK last just in case</li> </ul> Final Remarks: <ul>  	<li>I'd play 3x Solemn Judgement but I just don't for 0 reason. You could replace the Magnum shield if you need to.</li>  	<li>You can pop off heavily but there's a lot of times that you can just brick and stall</li>  	<li>Keep track of your effects and read your opponents.</li> </ul>"

But playing it, the deck offers a lot of variety. There are plenty of ways to either chainblock or dodge a handtrap. The order in which you summon your birds can be changed up to bait negates. All of that may not sound like the plays differ much from one another and they don't, but you do get a kick out of every first turn hand since the way you'll handle your turn and the decisions you make differ every time.  Journey Preparations (Advent of Adventure) gave this deck both a searcher and a way to play through interaction in one, banishing one to chainblock or chaining it to an Imperm to dogde it.  In current build people usually play 3 Book of Moon and Gold Sarcophagus but Advent achieves both while also boosting consistency.  Dimension Shifter is one heck of a handtrap and Floowandereeze can activate it multiple times as they usually keep their GY empty. Even if they don't, Stri can banish whatever's in there.  Also their design is fantastic. Not only the monsters themselves but the way the entire background is utilizes to create awesome card design is great.

Here's the list of my going second Invoked Dogmatika Shaddolls, Master Duel legal. Your going first choices will be in the main and your going second options will be at the side deck. I wanna keep it as concise as possible so, let's get to it. (Edit: There might've been a small rant somewhere in there so, yeah... oops.)  • ""Where Maximus? modcheck"" - <span>Yeah, we're not playing <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a> because Drytrons are annoying as fuck and should get hit whenever a ban list comes in Master Duel. Why you wouldn't wanna do this? They play <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> and <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>. Also, Lyrilusc Tri-Brigades, they also have <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Bearbrumm the Rampant Rampager"">Tri-Brigade Bearbrumm the Rampant Rampager</a> which can search upon getting sent to the GY and <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom"">Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</a> which draws, and both triggers off of Maximus' effect. That's absolutely terrible for you. That's also why I prefer <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a> in this build instead of the usual <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> + <a data-name=""Secure Gardna"">Secure Gardna</a>. Not only is it cheaper to build this way and leaves you one Extra Deck slot to work with, but it's one less summon for <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>. He would be better in a format where Drytrons and Tri-Brigades are dead, which is why I haven't played Master Duel for a while and went back to the TCG for some breath of fresh air, because his main purpose is to kill your opponent's Extra Deck. This is also why we're not running <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> and <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</a>, because sending it off <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> would be too slow, and you'd much rather send either an <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a> or a <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a>.</span>  <span><span>• ""Double Resh?"" -</span> Yes. That's standard for my builds. I disagree with playing just one of this card, and in a format where <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> is only semi-limited, there's really no reason not to run an extra copy for insurance.</span>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell"">Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell</a> -</span> One of the most underrated Counter Traps in the game, like holy shit. You can effectively disable three different Spells for the rest of the DUEL, in a best of one format. If you're playing against Drytrons and you chain this in response to their <a data-name=""Meteonis Drytron"">Meteonis Drytron</a>, that means they cannot Ritual Summon AT ALL for the rest of that duel. That's <strong>STUPID </strong>and I love it. We're playing 12 Spells to fodder this Trap, and this can also act as a Trap fodder for <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> for coverage. BUT if you have access to triple <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>s or <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a>s, you can do it. I'll just leave this up to your preference.</span>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> -</span> This is a staple for my builds so long as it's still a best of one format, especially on going second decks. This is harder to play around than <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, which is a UR btw. This, <a data-name=""Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell"">Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell</a>, and <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>/<a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> can all share slots, so it really depends on you on how many ratios of them you can or want to play.</span>  <span><span>• <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> -</span> Thunder Dragons are (usually) a Fusion strategy, and I LOVE and respect Fusion strategies due to them being innately -1 or 2 but still keeping up with the meta game from time to time, but I too can make exceptions. Pardon my language, but I FUCKING HATE <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a> with a fervent passion comparable to that of Payne96' desire for a Pyro/Volcanic support coming into the TCG/OCG. I am not sorry for these Thunder Dragon players but Colossus should never come back to the TCG and should be banned in Master Duel as well, I'd even say that that card should have never been printed alongside <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> and I will literally fight you for it. You can argue the same thing for <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> all you want, but she does not have protection like Colossus does and is frail in comparison. Also Prank-Kids, you might've noticed by now how I hate decks that gain so much advantage off of so little resources.</span>  <span><span>• <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a> -</span> For Drytrons and Tri-Brigades. They both usually have cards that fits <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a>'s requirements. Also, there have been some EARTH Machines and rogue strategies with EARTH and WATER attributes lurking around lately, that's also why I'm playing <a data-name=""Nehshaddoll Genius"">Nehshaddoll Genius</a>. She's an additional negate for the turn, and if you too decide to run her, you have the freedom to either choose x2 Apkallone or one of each Apkallone and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a>. Also, both it and Shekhinaga gets better if you decided to use <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> instead, I only chose <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> instead of it or <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> because one, Drytrons would rather be Ashed than Drolled because the latter would mean they would have to use all of the resources they have currently to make a play if they don't have an immediate answer to it, unlike <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> which can be both countered by Ash, <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>, and <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a> and two, not a lot of FIRE Attributed decks are around like Infernoble Knights or Salamangreats and three, I've been hunting these Lyrilusc Tri-Brigades in the ladder like Kite Tenjo hunting Number cards. I would run three <a data-name=""Reeshaddoll Wend"">Reeshaddoll Wendi</a> if <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> were at three as well.</span>  Some additional notes:  • <strong>Match your Extra Deck with your hand traps</strong> - <span>If you do decide to play <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> would be nice to have for additional firepower since this deck has already more than enough control to it. That's also why I don't play <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a>, because there are times where I've dragged games way too long with locking my opponent down with it, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>, and <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> on board, but I too find myself having trouble of dealing damage. I have considered several times to play <a data-name=""Invoked Cocytus"">Invoked Cocytus</a>, but he's just not worth it as of now, if you want a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> target for WATER Attributes, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a> would be better because not only does she cut off Drytron from their gimmick, but she also stops the second part of <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Bird Call"">Lyrilusc - Bird Call</a> and in mirror matches, this turns off Resh Shaddoll Incarnation, so whoever has the more established boards usually would win.</span>  <span>• Most decks in the ladder do not have an out to a <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> as Link Material, with the exception of <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen"">Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen</a>, and some rogue strategies like Mekk-Knights because they play <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> and some that run Kaijus but in my opinion, this is the best defensive Link 4 you can have, but if you want more firepower then look for either <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> or <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>. You can also choose to run <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> or <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> instead for more disruption.</span>  Overall, it's a pretty standard Invoked Dogmatika Shaddoll deck list with some personal techs. A third copy of <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> would definitely be nice but, it is what it is. It's not exactly a cheap deck to build due to Konami deciding to make the three main Shaddoll Fusion monsters all URs for some reason, but I do hope you enjoy playing this deck if you ever decide to do so."

You can use Foolish Burial, One for One, Tuning (Send the top card of you deck the GY), Quickdraw Synchron, or Mathematician to send a Doppelwarrior to the GY for Junk Synchron to special summon.  From there you synchro summon Junk Speeder, into Martial Metal Marcher and Armory Arm.  Then, you can summon Cosmic Blazar Dragon.  If you have non-tuner monsters left or monster reborn I like to go for Stardust Dragon or Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon.  There are still some cards I am on the fence about having in the deck and I hope to find more impactful cards as I continue to play and experiment.  That being said here are a few cards I would switch for something else;  -Turbo Booster and Boost Warrior (I like these cards in case you are unable to get a Doppelwarrior to the GY)  -Necroid Synchro (not a great card for opener, but I find it useful to get Shooting Star Dragon out)  -Shard of Greed (two turns is too slow in today's Yu-Gi-Oh I'm learning)  -Martial Metal Marcher (Tatsunoko seems to the popular 3 star synchro tuner, I will test out to see which I prefer),  -Armory Arm ( probably better 4 star synchro monsters out there, my nostalgia for the card  keeps it in the deck for me.  Also, the extra attack it gives helps deal with decks like Blue-Eyes that have high attack monsters)  -Beelzeus of the Diabolic Dragons (I wanted a 10 star synchro in my extra deck and this seemed like the best one.  I have haven't summoned as many times as I'd like to though)  Thanks again for viewing/reading and I would appreciate it if everyone would leave there thoughts or recommendations for this deck.  I am still learning about the cards that have come out since I last play Yu-Gi-Oh and am having a lot of fun duelling again.  I hope you enjoy this deck or are able to get some ideas for your decks from it."

It's basically classic dragon link, taking advantage of the unlimited striker dragon and whit","Due to the best of one format in Master duel you have to play hand traps main.  In order to not loose to much of the insane extending potential of dragon link i feel like only dark/light hand traps can be used. By choosing mostly light ones the deck actually gets quite close to a normal chaos light/dark ratio which makes it consistent in terms of using chaos space, chaos ruler and the black/white dragon.  That's the reason even tho max C is insane I chose to not play it due to it being earth typing.  The one ash main could be replaced with any other handtrap you feel worth playing and nib could be replaced with psyframe"

Once mastered it will flow like a river in to victory. Keep gy as full of machina as possible ready to summon ruinforce! Build your board with the following combos: <ul>  	<li>Gearframe-unclaspare (super useful for xyz summons, summon gear gigant x and draw what u need. I usually draw resavenger ( the only archetype's handtrap) after setting my board to activate it during the opponent's battlephase.);</li>  	<li>irradiator-megaform (one of the most important combos! sp summon the first discarding the second thx to his effect, use the first's effect to summon the second from gy, tribute the second thx to its effects to sp summon what u need. Careful this cambos has unlimited possibilities use ur immagination to win the game with it!!! You can summon citadel, unclasper to activate his effect sand to gy ruinforce and sp summon it from gy banishing irradiator and megaforce or anything else and more. Tip: only if u can, try not to use megaform for ruinforce's sp summon couse it could be useful to keep it in the gy because of its secondary effect if u have a fortress on your field.);</li>  	<li>Citadel is a too useful card not to smmon it immediately: use magnet reversce so speed up the process!</li> </ul> Everithing else is up to your imagination, there is always a way to set a decent board!"

Most of them have 1850ATK or 1500DEF which is specific for being able to search for them in decks and in GYs. Majority of Victories come from swinging wildly with the spellcasters or having your opponent surrender because you hindered them enough.  <strong>STAPLES: -</strong>Raigeki/Lightning Storm/Veiler/AshBlossom/Terraforming/MST/Dimensional Barrier - Pretty self explanatory, feel free to add/remove as you see fit.  <strong>LUNA: </strong>-A simple way of getting spellcaster cards into your hand from your deck with 1850ATK; which is all the Familiar Possessed creatures. Can also be used to disrupt your opponent by forcing them to trash a card or have cards sent back to their hands/ExtraDeck  <strong>DOGMATIKA:</strong> -Ecclesia and Fluerdelis are easy summons in reaction to your opponents summoning from the extra deck, they are also Spellcasters and they are annoying to deal with.  <strong>EDA:</strong> -Helpful for special summoning cards from your Deck; they come in in Facedown defense position, but during your opponents main phase you can flip them to attack.  <strong>NEFARIOUS </strong>-This is a combo piece; if you have a spellcaster in the field, you can special summon this, which then you special summon <strong>Awakened Nefarious </strong>from your deck by sending both the small nefarious and spellcaster card to the GY. Once <strong>Awakened Nefarious</strong> enters the battlefield you can bring back a spellcaster monster from your GY to your field. I run only one because you do not want this in your opening hand.  <strong>ICHIRIN </strong>-I use this field spell if I'm playing against another spellcaster deck, otherwise I prioritize <strong>Secret Village.</strong>  <strong>AWAKENING OF THE POSSESSED </strong>-This is IMO the most important card in the deck which is why I run three. It draws you a card when you play a spellcaster. it powers up all you cards based on the different attributes in play (why I run one copy of every Familiar Possessed). With this in play, your creatures will hit like trucks and since there are many ways to get creatures in play, you can overwhelm your opponent on power alone.  <strong>SPIRIT CHARMER </strong>-I always add a spellcaster to my hand and I always set an <strong>Awakening of the possessed.</strong>  <strong>POSSESSED PARTNERSHIPS </strong>-This card is loaded: Summon a spellcaster from hand or GY, destroy a face-up card, and banish it to recycle a previous spell or trap and play them in face-up position.  <strong>UNPOSSESSED </strong>-Protects your familiar possessed creatures, powers them up on attack, if a creature is destroyed you can special summon a new one. Very useful in this deck.  <strong>THE EXTRA DECK</strong> -Pretty straight forward, used them to get a nice creature from your opponents GY that matches the attribute (there is no dark version yet)  I made this deck cuz I like the archetype, but it has shocked me how well it's doing; to the point where I'm in Platinum in MasterDuel."

While that's still far away the new cards have been announced for quite a while now, giving us plenty of time to deckbuild, test ratios and optimize the new era of Marincess decks</span>.  <span>Marincess</span>  <span>Marincesses are a link climbing deck that aims to create an unaffected boss monster. Like every link archetype it has a Link-1 that searches the Field Spell. The Field Spell -</span> <span><a data-name=""Marincess Battle Ocean"">Marincess Battle Ocean</a></span><span> - gives the boss monster a huge ATK boost (up to 2000) and makes it unaffected if summoned with</span> <span><a data-name=""Marincess Crystal Heart"">Marincess Crystal Heart</a></span><span>. Since Marincess end in a high ATK monster that's equiped with even more monsters players can be caught off guard and don't realise all they have to do is out the field spell to remove the monsters protection and ATK buff.</span> <span><a data-name=""Marincess Wave"">Marincess Wave</a></span> <span>is another means to protect your monsters. It both negates an opponent's monster and makes all your monster unaffected by your opponent's card effects. If you control a Link-3 or higher Marincess it turns into a handtrap. Keep in mind Wave has to actually negate the targeted monster in order for your monster to become unaffected. They have high recursion from the GY and a very good grind game. They are weak to backrow removal and (used to) lack almost any non-generic interaction besides the (used to be) unsearchable Wave. Anemone triggers if it leaves the field so always equip it with Battle Ocean. If your monster gets removed during your opponent's turn Anemone will trigger for extra recursion.</span>  <span>New Support</span>  <span>I'll quickly go over some of the new, relevant cards.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Marincess Sleepy Maiden"">Marincess Sleepy Maiden</a></span>: Specials Summons herself by protecting a Marincess card. Equips a Marincess Link monster from your GY to a Marincess Link monster you control. <strong>--&gt; Extender, niche protection and helps with OTK'ing.</strong></span>  <span><a data-name=""Marincess Springirl"">Marincess Springirl</a></span><span>: Banishes a ""Marincess"" monster from GY; Special Summons itself. Mills cards equal to the number of ""Marincess"" monsters if it's linked off for a WATER Link monster and has a little burn effect. <strong>--&gt; Extender and may fill up GY with ressources.</strong></span>  <span><a data-name=""Marincess Dive"">Marincess Dive</a></span><span>: Special Summons non-Link ""Marincess"" monster from GY or if you control Battle Ocean Special Summons one ""Marincess"" monster from deck. <strong>--&gt; Extender.</strong></span>  <span><a data-name=""Marincess Coral Triangle"">Marincess Coral Triangle</a></span><span>: Link-3 that discards a WATER; searches a ""Marincess"" Trap Wave. Very strong extender past your first turn. <strong>--&gt; Archetypal Trap Searcher and Extender past first turn.</strong></span>  <span><a data-name=""Marincess Aqua Argonaut"">Marincess Aqua Argonaut</a></span><span>: Link-4 that targets a WATER you control and a card your opponent controls; returns them to hand (Ignition Effect).

Good if you have enough in hand already and don't need Tang's mill.</span>  <span>You have many extenders so there's a r4nk engine in here. With one more extender you may be able to use two level 4s to go into Bahamut Shark, summon Toadally Awesome and then use Shark as the extender for the Link-4 while also searching Wave.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Marincess Crystal Heart"">Marincess Crystal Heart</a></span> is not as important anymore but should not be disregarded since it makes your monster unaffected during your turn, too. <span><a data-name=""Marincess Marbled Rock"">Marincess Marbled Rock</a></span> gives extra recursion which is good to have past turn 1 to play through more interaction. <span><a data-name=""Marincess Wonder Heart"">Marincess Wonder Heart</a></span> is a terrible card turn 1 but enables an OTK without having to use Accesscode, which would disable a lot of effect that would otherwise lock you into WATER.</span>  <span>The Side deck is additional handtraps and Crossout targets. Since Battle Ocean is no longer a brick (you can then search Dive instead with Angel) I recommend playing 2. Before I played 1 Battle Ocean - 3 Dive but there's virtually no reason to play that over 2 -2 since opening one of them means searching the other. You could always play 2 Battle Ocean - 3 Dive.</span>  <span>There's plenty of Level 4 extenders. Tenyi Spirit -Shthana, Silent Angler and Abyss Shark (with 1 Silent Angler). Depending on how many you play making r4nks becomes even easier.</span>  <span>Changes to the decklist</span>  <span>Since I last uploaded this list I added a copy of Sleepy Maiden. Now I don't think she's mandatory to include in every decklist. Her biggest downside is her level but what she does she does pretty well. Ideally you end with Aqua Argonaut in your EMZ so once you're going for the OTK you would have to waste a lot of resources setting up a Marincess Wonder Heart in your EMZ to have her equipped with Mariness Link monsters. Milling Maiden off of Blue Tang allows your Wonder Heart in the MMZ to be equipped with a Marincess Link monster, making it easier to OTK through monsters. Her extension is also pretty great, considering the protection persists (or should, haven't checked out any rulings yet) even if she leaves the field. Since she can protect any Marincess <strong>card</strong> she can permanently protect your Field Spell from destruction, which is absolutely insane. Outing the Field Spell is how you out this deck, once the Field Spell gains protection you're in a fantastic spot. All you gotta do now is negate non-destructive effects that could out your Field Spell and you're good to go.</span>  <span>I also updated some handtraps but obviously handtraps will adapt to the meta so at the end of the day they can be whatever.</span>  <span>If you're not on Crossout you could get away with running less handtraps and either play more extenders or some backrow removal if you want. </span>"

This will let you search a Sky Striker Spell at the end of the turn.  Going Second - Open with Hayate and attack directly, then send whatever Sky Striker card you want to your GY (Recommend Widow Anchor, but situations vary). Then Link away into Kagari to retrieve the Sky Striker Spell you need from your GY. Finish with Linking into Shizuku for that extra Search.  Monster Destroyed - Get back Raye and Quick Effect her into Kaina to prevent you opponent's most dangerous Monster from attacking.  Finisher - When you have your opponent at 5300 LP or less, start the Talker Combo with Halqifibrax and Selene. You should have enough different Attribute Link Monsters in your GY to wipe your opponent's whole field of Monsters"

An archetype that does not use a Normal Summon, and is consisted of LIGHT Attributed monsters???","Hey wassup, it’s me, Grayewick the Fusion strategy enjoyer back with uh… another smokescreen strategy. I mean, it still features Invoked so it’s technically still half a Fusion strategy but anyway, presenting Invoked Galaxy-Eyes.  <strong> “So, why play this jank?”</strong>  <span>Galaxy-Eyes, apart from <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> and <a data-name=""Galaxy Wizard"">Galaxy Wizard</a>, does not play any relevant Normal Summon so, you know… I mean, at this point Konami should really consider giving every strategy a dedicated Normal Summon at this point else, people like me are just gonna keep splashing Invoked into it. I mean, that won't stop us but, you know what I mean.</span>  <strong>“What makes this playable or “good” enough?”</strong>  <span>Depending on how good your hand is, this deck can bring out any combinations of either <a data-name=""Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord"">Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord</a>, <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>, <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>, and/or <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>, all before 5 summons, playing around <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a>.</span>  <strong>“How do you win?”</strong>  <span>Controlling your opponent’s Monster and Spell effects, and Mechaba being technically an omni-negator. Also as per usual, we’re running traps which are three copies of <a data-name=""Tachyon Transmigration"">Tachyon Transmigration</a>. This card is funky and is one of the nuttiest Counter Trap cards I've read in my whole life and I love it. If your opponent becomes way too greedy at their chain links, just flip this up while you control any “Galaxy-Eyes” monster, and it negates all cards activated in that chain prior to it and shuffles them all away into the Deck, and this being a Counter Trap means that the only way your opponent could stop this is specifically with another Counter Trap, mainly <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>. Your main source of firepower will be from your Galaxy-Eyes monsters, being <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon</a>, and <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a>. We’re not running <a data-name=""Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"">Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</a> in the deck because the space is too tight for one more room, but due to the prevalence of Zoodiacs, Lyrilusc, <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus – Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus – Sky Thunder</a>, and <a data-name=""Number F0: Utopic Draco Future"">Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</a>, I’m heavily considering it. Overall, despite having control tools, this deck doesn’t have a problem OTK-ing and getting over big boss monsters with strong protection effects like Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon because of <a data-name=""Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon"">Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon</a>.

It's almost like they didn't balance for a best of ones format in the least.,"This is an infinite negate tri-brigade lunalight build for master duel. If you don't know how this works, basically if you can summon the simorgh link and union carrier, you can equip simorgh with mist valley thunderbird and summon apex avian off of simorgh. avian is a non OPT omni negate that requires you to bounce a card and thunderbird summons itself when bound back to the hand (no hard OPT) so basically your opponent can't do anything. The board also ends on CDI for good measure as a backup in case your opponent has something to chain to the combo.  But most of you already knew all that, time for what I'm really here for... to complain about the banlist decisions that made this deck possible.  First off, why in the fresh hell in union carrier legal, this card is so unbelievably broken because not only is this bullshit legal, but so is the buster lock. WHO THE HELL THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA IN A FORMAT OF BEST OF ONES!  Secondly, the simorgh link was just recently banned in the TCG, this card is so broken be it fetching an omni negate or a barrier statue and this is without union carrier.  Thirdly is that Maxx ""c"" is legal in this format... I don't think this card is healthy for a best of one format, activating it wins you the game, and if your opponent doesn't have games 2 and 3 to try to make a comeback it is incredibly unfair.  last is that there are quite a few floodgates that should never be legal that are in this format, not playing them here because I respect my dignity and opponents, but again triple skill drain alongside emptiness being legal is yet again... not okay for a format of best of ones."

As a result, The herald variant is now unplayable due to consistency issues following the Eva ban. Most Drytron pro players will return to this Drytron strategy that I will be showing you today.  Big thank to Youtuber Tatsym for uploading the decklist in March 2021 as it inspired me a lot to build this deck and play it competitively.  Strengths: <ul>  	<li>Nibiru-proof by means of Vendread Battlelord, a card that allows you to prohibit a card type( monster, spell or trap from activating)Be mindful that this card should. be prioritized to summon before the 5th summon by using the Vendread ritual spell Revendread Evolution.</li>  	<li>Great consistency, due to multiple search cards and much more drytron than other variants, this deck is pretty consistent</li>  	<li>Huge endboard: The endboard is really absurd if you can full combo. For example, with drytron Nova+any card that leads to Battlelord is Phul( quick ritual. summon to go into Bethor for a pop 4 or 5 potentially), I:P for apollousa or Underworld Goddess according to your matchup, Abyss Dweller and Lancea with followup from typically 3 to 4 drytrons in your GY.                                                                                                                                                                                                            Weakness:</li>  	<li>Lose to Droll: Not too different from the Herald variant, thís deck loses to Droll really hard. However, I chose to play 3 Gamma for this issue and as people don't usually main deck droll anymore for the fallen of the old Drytron and Bird-ups. If they side Droll against you, you can have crossout designator instead of the appointer of the Red Lotus in the side deck to cover more handtraps and shut down going second cards such as Droplet and Dark ruler no more.</li>  	<li>Hard time going second: If you don't open with great going second cards, you better be ready to go for Zeus. One typical play that i usually use is to Xyz summon Mu-beta Fafnir with no eff and then Downerd straight to Zeus.                                                                                                                                                                                          Combos There are many hands that you can combo with but the main goal is to get Battlelord out ASAP and get to curious. I would say 90% of the hands that lead to Curious can help you full combo.</li> </ul>"

Basically you Normal Summon a Tuner that can revive itself (<span>Jet Synchron</span>, <span>Glow-up Bulb</span>, <span>Plaguespreader Zombie</span>, etc), or a monster that can Special Summon a Tuner from the Deck, and you end with 3 counters <span>Borreload Savage Dragon</span>  + <span>Herald of the Arc Light</span> without a single Extender (if not interrupted)  The Combo is as follows: <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon <span>Jet Synchron</span>/<span>Plaguespreader</span></li>  	<li>Link into <span>Almiraj</span> -&gt; <span>Revive Jet Synchron</span>/<span>Plaguespreader</span></li>  	<li>Link into <span>Crystron Halqifibrax</span> -&gt; Summon <span>Deskbot 001</span></li>  	<li>Link into <span>Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</span> -&gt; Summon 3 Lvl 3 Tokens -&gt; Trigger <span>Deskbot 001</span> to revive from GY</li>  	<li>Synchro 1 Token + <span>Deskbot 001</span> into <span>Herald of the Arc Light</span></li>  	<li><span>Auroradon</span> Tribute itself and 1 Token to Summon <span>Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion</span> from the Deck</li>  	<li>Synchro <span>O-Lion</span> + 1 Token into a <span>Lvl 5 Synchro Tuner</span> -&gt; <span>Trigger O-Lion</span> to Summon a Lvl 3 Token</li>  	<li>Synchro those 2 into <span>Borreload Savage Dragon</span> -&gt; Equip <span>Auroradon</span></li>  	<li>Enjoy your free 2 Omni-Negates</li> </ol> <strong><span>Extra Combos</span></strong>  Just by putting a single Synchro and a single Garnet in your Deck, you can get an extra Omni-Negate Counter Trap with the exact same resources. What is that Synchro? <span>Denglong, the First of the Yang Zing</span>, a currently banned card in the TCG  The Extra Combo is as follows: <ol>  	<li>Same Combo as 1-5, <span>the lvl 5 Synchro Tuner</span> is <span>Denglong</span> -&gt; <span>Denglong</span> add <span>Nine Pillars of the Yang Zing</span></li>  	<li>Synchro into <span>Borreload Savage Dragon</span> -&gt; Equip <span>Auroradon</span> -&gt; <span>Denglong</span> Trigger to Summon a Yang Zing (preferably <span>Chi Wen</span>) from the Deck</li>  	<li>Enjoy your <strong>FREE</strong> Omni-Negate that can negate <span>Dark Ruler</span>, and potentially <span>Droplet</span></li> </ol> <span><strong>Extenders</strong></span>  Does the Combo ends there? NOPE, that's just 1 card combo. What if you have an extra Extender in your hand? The best Extender I could think of is <span>Quick-Lauch</span>. Why <span>Quick Launch</span>? Because <span>Quick Launch</span> can Special Summon <span>Rokket Tracer</span>, and guess what Tracer can do? Pop a Yang Zing to Summon a Lvl 4 Rokket from the Deck. In this case, the Yang Zing doesn't miss timing because <span>Tracer</span> says <strong>and if you do</strong>. This will allow you to make another <span>Lvl 8 Synchro</span> without losing advantage. But keep in mind that <span>Tracer</span> locks you into DARK Extra Deck monsters only, which mean you can't make <span>Dragite</span> from this. If you want to make <span>Dragite</span>, you have to make it early in place of <span>Borreload</span>. Then you can make <span>Borreload</span> later with Tracer  The other good Extender is <span>Nemesis Corridor</span>. Since <span>Jet Synchron</span>/<span>Plaguespreader</span> is inevitably going to get banished by its own effect. <span>Corridor</span> is pretty much a free <span>Thunder Dragon Colossus</span>  The last Extenders are <span>Destrudo</span> and <span>Instant Fusion</span>. These 2 doesn't extend the Combo itself (Same Combo as having no Extender), instead they support the Combo consistency. If your <span>Jet Synchron</span>/<span>Plaguespreader</span> Searcher got negated, just use <span>Destrudo</span>/<span>Instant Fusion</span> and you will still Full Combo (if they have no more interruptions)  <span><strong>Things You Should Know</strong></span> <ul>  	<li>You can Summon <span>Jet Synchron</span>/<span>Plaguespreader</span> off <span>Halqifibrax</span> to go into <span>Unicorn</span> into <span>Accesscode</span> instead (Going second)</li>  	<li>Most of the Link Monsters are used for Turn 2 or higher</li>  	<li><span>FA Dawn Dragster</span> and <span>Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing</span> can easily be Summoned from <span>Destrudo</span></li>  	<li>You can make 3 Materials <span>Apollousa</span> with 2 Extenders if your <span>Halqifibrax</span> got Negated</li>  	<li>If your <span>Halqifibrax</span> got Negated, you can still end with <span>Borreload</span> via Quick Launch (<span>Tracer</span> pop <span>Halqifibrax</span> -&gt; Synchro into <span>Borreload</span>)</li>  	<li>If you open up <span>Destrudo</span>, Prioritize Normal Summoning your Searcher over the Tuners themself to bait out handtraps</li>  	<li>If <span>Halqifibrax</span> got negated, you can banish it during your opponent's turn to go into <span>Denglong</span> to <em>maybe</em> survive the turn, then you can shuffle back <span>Halqifibrax</span> with Corridor</li>  	<li><span>Pot of Avarice</span> is used to reset your Extra Deck and Combo Pieces so that you can do the <span>Halqifibrax</span> Combo again next turn</li>  	<li><span>Yazi</span> can pop 1 card and itself, which then float into <span>Mare Mare</span>; generating 3 free tokens that can be used for Link plays (<span>Phoenix</span> -&gt; <span>Unicorn</span> -&gt; <span>Halqifibrax</span>/<span>Accesscode</span>)</li> </ul> <span><strong>Summary</strong></span>  Is the Deck good? The main problem with the Deck is the little amount of Extender it has, which mean it usually lose to handtraps. A single <span>Ash Blossom</span> can cost you the game. However, if you successfully do the Combo, you pretty much win the game (most of the time). Without Side Deck, you don't have to worry about things like <span>Kaiju</span> or <span>Sphere Mode</span> as much. This board can easily be broken by a single <span>Droplet</span> (sending monsters and Traps), but you still have <span>Nine</span> <span>Pillars</span>  The other Weakness that the Deck has is Garnets. If you draw <span>Tracer</span>, your <span>Quick Launch</span> is less effective. If you draw <span>O-Lion</span>, can't make <span>Borreload</span>. This issue could be solved by <span>Plaguespreader</span> returning a card back into the Deck  How about consistency? I decided to play a 48 cards Deck because I need some board breaker going 2nd. You may think that it's not consistent because of it, but remember that you have 20 Starters (6 is <span>Destrudo</span>, 1 is <span>Instant Fusion</span>) that leads you into the Combo. That literally means you have more than 90% chance to open at least 1 Starter (80% if you don't count <span>Destrudo</span> and <span>Instant Fusion</span>). So I would say it's pretty consistent (I tried using 5 sample draws and I got at least 1 Starter 10x in a row). Also more Cards mean less chance to draw Garnets  Is the Deck Expensive? Well... It's very Expensive actually. 9N, 7R, 24 SR, 23 UR (Remember that one of the SR is easily replaceable, check Note). But don't worry, the Staples are replaceable, Extra Deck cards that aren't mentioned in the Combo are replaceable... Good Luck getting those SR/UR CPs!!!  <span><strong>Update</strong></span>  <span>Added Cards: <span>1x Mare Mare</span>, <span>3x Forbidden Droplets</span>, <span>3x Dragon Shrine</span></span>  Replaced Cards: <span>2x Ash Blossoms</span> -&gt; <span>3x Infinite Impermanence</span> (Trading <span>Maxx ""C""</span> counter for better board breaker + better synergy with <span>Droplet</span>)  Updated text about consistency and added list on ""Things You Should Know"""

Yes, I blind second. Yes, this isn't a cheap deck to build. Yes, I do not play <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> because everyone's playing <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>. Yes, I literally do not care about getting <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a>-ed because your opponent won't have another turn to play as soon as either Avramax or Final Sigma hits the board. As per usual, cards on the main are the cards that I would personally play and the tech options will be placed in the side.  <strong>""So, how does this deck exactly work?""</strong>  In summation: One Punch.  <span>First of all, let me address this one thing: If not for literally <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> and even with <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> honestly, this deck would be slow as fuck. I'd be running <a data-name=""Double Summon"">Double Summon</a>s like I'm playing a slower version of Powerload Ogre turbo and yes, it does brick, that's why we blind second to get that extra card, and you'll never know if your opponent is playing a blind second strategy as well, and if they do, they probably run Kaijus, which kills all your boss monsters. So deck strategy, it's pretty straightforward. Make either <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a>, <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>, or the archetypal boss monster <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> and one shot your opponent with big number. That's why we also run <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> and <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, because we want to end games as soon as possible, and it would be stupid for your opponent to leave a back row without a monster on the field, unless it's an Eldlich player that hard drew <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>.</span>  So yeah, if you want to be extra annoying, use <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> as well after summoning <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> and trigger your opponent's PTSD from <a data-name=""Apoqliphort Towers"">Apoqliphort Towers</a> turbo because fuck it, it's basically the same thing, except Towers messes up with your opponent's resources and makes them feel violated while Final Sigma messes up with your opponent's LP and pride after getting one shot by a deck that's not even rogue. Have fun in the ladder."

Lesgo? ","Now Drytron don't have a way to make ""unbreakable"" boards ;-;  So since we can't win in one combo now, i made this deck aimed for a better grind game and this board: <a data-name=""Drytron Meteonis Draconids"">Drytron Meteonis Draconids</a> - <a data-name=""Red-eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-eyes Dark Dragoon</a> - <a data-name=""Masquerena"">Masquerena</a> - <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda."">Predaplant Verte Anaconda.</a>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Explaining the engines:</li> </ul> <ol>  	<li>From my short experience using this megalith engine (1x<a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a>, 1x<a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> and a second <a data-name=""Meteonis Drytron"">Meteonis Drytron</a>) i don't like it, but it's not like it is bad. Is Difficult to explain how im feeling. Anyway it adds another tool for the deck and can be replaced if you found something better.</li>  	<li>The Cyber Angel engine is strong as always and can be used to search <a data-name=""Vanity's Ruler"">Vanity's Ruler</a> that is a insta win against many decks and helps playing against nibiru.</li>  	<li>Dragoon: Dragoon: Sussy.</li> </ol> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Some ideas:</li> </ul> At OCG there's some drytron decks using this Scythe-lock strategy with <a data-name=""Halqifibrax"">Halqifibrax</a> and <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a>: you search <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> either with <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> or Dagda then link summon Halqifibrax, at the opponent turn you summon T <a data-name="".G. &lt;a data-name=&quot;. Wonder Magician&quot;&gt;Wonder Magician&lt;/a&gt;"">.G. </a><a data-name="". Wonder Magician"">Wonder Magician</a> with Halqifibrax effect and destroy Scythe, Scythe will trigger, special summoning itself while locking your opponent extra deck and then you activate Wonder Magician Quick effect and synchro summon <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a>. Its a good combo but since i am already using Vanity's Ruler i think it isn't necessary in this deck.  Other thing that i want to note is that <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> will destroy Drytron like a Meteor now that is difficult to make a early negate or use Herald of Orange Light (tbh you can use Orange Light but it isn't good without eva, maybe 1 copie at maximum since you can search it). Droll is also problematic for the same reason. I might start using 2-3 Crossout Designator and one Orange Light for that reason.  &nbsp;  I hope you have a good day my fellow Drytron enjoyner.  And please correct me if did said something wrong, im still learning after all.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  GLHF"

This is basically just Final Sigma turbo.  The slots for <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, and <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> can pretty much be any staple cards you want, but if you do have <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a> or <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>, use them for consistency. I only use <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> instead of <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a> or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> because this is a F2P build and I can use it in either Battle or Damage Step to pitch my Mathmechs from my hand to the GY and it's the easiest UR to farm. Your usual combo line would be:  • <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, or <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a>, pitching Multiplication to add Diameter • Normal Summon Diameter to Special Summon said Multiplication • Either Special Summon Addition or Subtraction from the hand • Make Final Sigma and trigger Multiplication in the graveyard, targeting Final Sigma, then attack.  Just make sure not to summon Final Sigma while Skill Drain was up, instead activate Skill Drain when Final Sigma is already face-up on the field. So yeah, actual short guide this time. This is not a competitive form by any means, instead just a cheap yet playable version of it."
