I love the Legendary Dragons of Critias. Since you run <a data-name=""Crush Card Virus"">Crush Card Virus</a> in this deck, it's quite obvious that you also run the <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a><a data-name=""Lair of Darkness""> package.</a>  <strong>Important Notes on the Deck and the Decklist: </strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>It's a strict casual deck. No chance here against the meta. But since it's a fun casual deck, it can pull some fun duels and wins off.</strong></li>  	<li><strong>The sidedeck in this decklist are rather ""honorable mentions"" cards and not an actual side deck! It's just to keep some different strategies in mind if I'm going to work on this deck again.</strong></li> </ul> Some explanation for certain cards:  <strong><a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a></strong>  Since you run a lot of traps, your opponent is going to try to pop as many backrow cards as he can. So it's perfect to play Waking the Dragon in this deck.  I've the following targets in my extra deck: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""The Last Warrior from another Planet"">The Last Warrior from another Planet</a> If your opponent pops Waking the dragon before he controls any monsters, the last warrior will completely shut down your opponent until he has a spell / trap removal.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Naturia Exterio"">Naturia Exterio</a> If you play against a backrow-heavy deck, this is the ideal target. It can negate any spell / trap, and <strong>it's not once per turn!</strong> And since this deck doesn't use the graveyard at all, you can banish anything you like, except <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> The counterpart to Naturia Exterio. Great beater with monster-effect negations.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon"">Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon</a> The main beater target. Unaffected by card effects and 3500 ATK.</li> </ul> The possibility that <a data-name=""Waking the dragon"">Waking the dragon</a> gets popped more than once is there, so it's good to have multiple targets in your extra deck.  <strong><a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a></strong>  I simply love this card. You're able to search out any material for your Legendary Dragon of Critias (except for <a data-name=""Tyrant Burst Dragon"">Tyrant Burst Dragon</a>. But he's not that good and I only have him in the deck is because I like to play all of the dragons...). Another neat combo is, when you have a set <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>, and your opponent activates <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>, you can activate it and set a <a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a>, which immediatly get's destroyed.  <strong><a data-name=""Spirit Reaper"">Spirit Reaper</a></strong>  Staller (the deck is quite slow) and target for the classic <a data-name=""Card Crush Virus"">Card Crush Virus</a>.  The rest should be self explanatory.  I really like this deck, but I know it's not that strong. So if you have any recommendations on how to improve this deck <strong>without losing on it's main focus, the dragons</strong>, feel free to comment. Oh, and I value fun to play over strength."

Handtraps and kaijus for general matchups, usually blind second. Ideally use Raidjin to flip Sifr face-down, then flip summon it next turn to get its effects back. Terraforming for Megaroid and Meltdown. Megaroid searches Necroid (yes, really). Usually either use Gadarla with Debris Dragon or Thunder King with Ash Blossom/Ghost Ogre for Necroid Synchro's cost. If Instant Fusion gets unlimited, replace Keeper of Dragon Magic with more copies of it, as they exist to search it out. Gadarla over Gameciel because he's wind attribute and you can use Super Polymerization with Aleister to go into Raidjin, who you really want on the board."

Every time i see an archetype with beautiful artworks i try for a long time ways to make it playable (failing miserably most of the time). And that’s exactly what happened when i saw the cards from the new structure deck ""Spirit Charmers"".  This list is the best i could do so far.  I'm enjoying the ""Performage"" package. Hat Tricker is just perfect:  He is EARTH, He is spellcaster, and he is a good extender for rank 4 plays or for ""Awakening of the Possessed - Archfiend Reaper of Nefariousness"". Speaking of which, we want to summon it from the deck as soon as possible to make a Charmer link monster and search a ""possessed"" spell/trap. Trick Clown and Damage Juggler can be discarder in different ways (Danger cards, Dark World Dealings, Masters of the Spiritual Arts) and let us to extend our plays.  Let’s focus now on some specific cards: <ol>  	<li>Awakening of the Possessed. We want to have multiple copies on the field. This card let you draw 1 card (hard once per turn unfortunately) but most important makes your monsters BIG (big big).</li>  	<li>Bagooska. Best rank 4 monster we have, he let us to do a decent board going first and he doesn't affect our ""Charmer"" link monsters.</li>  	<li>Fairy Tail - Luna. My MVP for this deck with Awakening of the Possessed. She is just so versatile (i'm thinking on building a going second-based deck with kaijus and rainbow neos package, we'll see).</li> </ol> I'm going to try different ways to play this archetype since i still have a couple of months before the release of the structure deck.

HAT was a deck made of three different self sufficient engines, which meant dead hands were rare. HAT won't work today, but I think the idea could still work well.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>ENGINES</strong></span>  I chose to work with Evil Eye, Windwitch, Invoked, Dragun, and a small Artifact and Spellbook engine as well. Every single one of these engines can get started with just one card, so even in a 60 card deck you won't dead draw. Running 60 cards also lowers your chances of drawing cards you wouldn't want to normally, such as the normal monsters, scythe, or snow bell. It also gives us plentiful room for hand traps.  Evil Eye - IMO this is an underrated engine right now. Drawing either the field spell or Serziel will give you a normal summonable sticky boss monster that has a quick effect removal. It also allows you to search Basillius, which is a free link 2, which opens up Verte Anaconda for Dragun plays. There are 7 cards you could draw (including terraforming) to get this engine going, and drawing any of the other cards isn't a big deal.  Invoked - The other main engine of the deck, invoked is a bit less good since you aren't guaranteed to draw a light for Mechaba, but it does give you access to Caliga which is another underrated card IMO. Invoked works much the same as evil eye, as drawing either the field spell or Aleister will get the engine going. Once Aleister is summoned once, the fusion spell with recycle him every turn, making sure you always have a play.  Both of these engines rely on the field spell to get started, but neither one particularly cares if it stays on the field, making them easily replaceable with one another.  Windwitch - Another 1 card boss monster, Ice bell is a Crystal Wing by itself. Drawing a glass bell can search you the Ice bell for the next turn as well. As a good half of these engines rely on the normal summon, Windwitch is a great addition since it doesn't ever need to normal.  Spellbook - This also relies on its normal, but both Blue boy and Secrets gives you a draw 2. If you happen to draw Knowledge on its own, you also run spellcasters in Windwitch, Invoked, and in a pinch Dragun is also a spellcaster.  Dragun - Free link 2s means free Red-eyes Fusions. Dragun is a ridiculous boss monster, with the only cost being having to run a few normal monsters. In a 60 card deck, this is less of a problem, and since you can fuse from the deck it's only an upside. Using the spell on its own stops you from summoning for the turn, but if you use Verte Anaconda you can get around this effect.  Artifact - Scythe is a crazy card right now. Locking you out of the extra deck is insane. Ideally you never draw scythe and only draw the sanctums, which again is more likely in a 60 card deck.  Hand Traps - I'm choosing to run Ash because its Ash, Omega for Numeron, and Ghost Ogre and Nibiru for the light attribute which can also be used to make Mechaba. I did try Infinite Impermanence as well, but I was really missing that light attribute.  &nbsp;  Your win condition for this deck can change every game. It's also difficult to side against, since you can do so many different things. I'm not gonna tell you this deck is top tier or even good, but it is fun to pilot and is more consistent than you'd think"

Normal summon ragged gloves and then you can use silent boots' effect to special summon him and you can then xyz summon the phantom knights of break sword, then you'll use break sword and the danger to link summon Union Carrier. From there you banish ragged gloves from grave to send Phantom Knights' Wing to grave and banish silent boots to search rank up magic. then you banish phantom knights wing to summon break sword from grave and use rank up magic to get to ophion, then use union carrier to equip buster dragon destruction sword to it.

This deck seeks to control the board with Raptite and Koa'ki Meiru until it can get Fossil monsters out for an OTK. This deck features 17 starters out of 45 cards, so this deck is relatively consistent. <ul>  	<li><strong>Koa'ki Meiru</strong> for field control and resources. Destroys themselves to fill graveyard with rock monsters allowing for fossil fusions. Ties of the Brethren allows for summons of 3 Koa'ki Meiru to provide negates and rank 4 plays.</li>  	<li><strong>Adamancipator</strong> increases consistency amongst rock monsters with excavations and provide sychro access to Raptite and more importantly, Dragite.</li>  	<li><strong>Fossil</strong> with their fusion card allows access to powerful fossil fusion monsters by fusing rock monsters in your graveyard along with a monster in your opponents graveyard, kind of like Invocation. Fossil monsters have powerful piercing attacks making OTKs easier to achieve.</li>  	<li><strong>Neos</strong> Fusion to summon Brave Neos to the field sends directly from the deck a level 4 monster as part of it's material, allowing you to send Weathering Soldier to graveyard to search Fossil Fusion.</li> </ul> This deck is meant to be as budget as possible, so expensive cards like Adamancipator Researcher ($50+ USD right now) are taken out. Block Dragon is for free summon and rock monster searches. Nemeses Keystone is for recycling banished rock monsters.  Notable cards that can be added to this deck are: Magnet Reverse, Mathmatician, Keeper of Dragon Magic, Rock Bombardment, Gigantes and Tackle Crusader."

Trying to get <strong>Dracoverlord</strong> out ASAP will net you wins easily, and is very easy to continually ritual summon turn after turn once you get set up.  Getting <strong>Phul</strong> out will start the Megalith combo, and it's pretty easy to get <strong>Phul</strong> out most of the time. You can use <em>Draitron Nova</em> and summon <strong>Al-Zeta</strong> for <em>Meteornis Draitron</em> and recycle it while still being able to use it for <strong>Phul</strong> with the left over 1,000 ATK Draitron. Megaliths quick-play spell <em>Megalith Unformed</em> will let you use a level 8 monster to get to <strong>Ophiel</strong> which can search and summon <strong>Phul</strong>.  The <strong>Cyber Angel Benten</strong> engine works amazingly within both archetypes, Megaliths for using tributes to ritual summon and Draitrons for their special summon cost being a tribute. After getting all 3 copies you can then search out <strong>Natasha</strong> and after ritual summoning her, which is as easy to do with Draitrons as <strong>Phul</strong> since <strong>Natasha</strong> only has 1,000 ATK, you can then continually steal monsters while also setting up Link or Xyz monsters.  After a while there will be plenty of ritual monsters in the GY to get a nice boost off of <strong>Phaleg</strong> to beat down anything. If you have the ritual spell <em>Meteornis Draitron</em> but no Draitron monsters out you can use the extra deck Machine monsters, and since they don't have a level they won't count towards the 2 star level requirement on both of the Draitron Ritual monsters. This works especially well if you can get <strong>Natasha</strong> out and steal a lot of monsters to link out for more ritual fodder.  The sidedeck has handtraps if you need them and some tech ritual monsters you can throw in for preference."

Your main goal should be to protect your field spell. As long as you can do that, you should be fine. One of the coolest things about Pacifis is the versatility of the deck. Don't be afraid to try different builds.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>  Spiral Dragon: 3 is too bricky, 1-2 should be enough. I've seen several decklists that just don't use him at all, but I think he is necessary to close up games a bit quicker.  Megalomasher X &amp; Mystery Shell Dragon: The goal here is to have 3-6 normal monsters, of course, other builds would have different rations of monsters. I went with Megalomasher b/c he is a dino (fossil dig), and he can summon Bahamut. Mystery Shell Dragon is a wyrm, meaning we can use him and spiral dragon for tenyi link plays. Plus, both of them have 2000 attack, which is the highest a normal monster can have.  Dimension Shifter: A few months ago this was ash blossom. I am not fully sure what the best hand trap would be here, as there are others I want to try, but these slots can go to whatever meta staple fits in your current format.  <span><strong>Spells</strong></span>  Heat Wave: Can shut down almost every deck, without hurting us one bit. Must have at 3.  Fossil Dig: See Megalomasher X  Terraforming: We need this because, despite all of the support Umi has, it does not have a searcher.  Phantasm Equip Spells: 2 of each except for wave, as we need to wait until the end of the battle phase to special summon a spiral dragon. Thankfully, it can make your opponent discard a card, so it isn't all bad.  Pacifis: Your key card, the thing that makes the deck viable. Must have at 3.  <span><strong>Traps</strong></span>  Metaverse: Since terraforming is limited, we have to run this as well.  Phantasm spiral battle &amp; power: Become hand traps when Umi is on the field. Battle is spell speed 2 destruction, while power is an in-archetype infinite impermanence. They also have their second effects, which come up, but are not essential to victory. We don't use trap trick because their appeal is in the fact that you can play them from your hand, and trap trick puts them onto the field. 3 battle and 1 power, but I am considering changing their ratios.  Sea Stealth Attack: Can recycle our Pacifis, protect it and our floodgates, while making our spiral dragon and token undefeatable in battle. 3-of.  Summon Limit: A floodgate that does nearly nothing to us while ruining our opponent's career. Sure, we cant make as big extra deck plays, but its not like we needed it to win.  Gozen Match: Another floodgate, as one can never have too many floodgates. Spiral dragon, ur phantasm tokens and megalomasher X are all water attribute monsters, so this card shouldn't hurt u much. Cant say the same about ur opponent. I am considering bringing it up to 3, but for now its at 2.  Skill Drain: The boss of all floodgates, this card can win you the duel on its own.  &nbsp;  For the extra deck, you can do whatever you want, or not run an extra deck at all. It's your choice. Note that other builds, the Extra Deck may have a lot more importance in the duel. In general, the only deck that shouldn't be running an extra deck at all is Monarchs.  The side deck right now is a mess, filled w/ ideas and speculation. As I perfect the build, the side deck will become clearer. For now though, I would recommend at the very least nibiru, droll, and dark ruler no more. If u have better cards in mind, go for what u thought of, I'm not the best deck-builder in the world.  Overall, pretty fun deck to play, maybe not so much for your opponent. But at least it's not mystic mine. All suggestions are welcome and appreciated."

The easiest way is to get the spell card Cubic Karma into the graveyard. This can be done in a few ways, but Summoner Monk, Duza the Meteor Cubic Vessel, and Foolish Burial Goods will be the main ways. I prefer going second with this deck, so that you can draw that first card and optimize your chance of being able to summon Crimson Nova.  Every Cubic spell and trap has a graveyard effect, so using cards like Twin Twisters, Karma Cut, and Darkword Dealings to send any spell/trap cards you have in your hand to the grave is usually the best move. <ul>  	<li>Normal summon Summoner Monk, activate his effect, discard any other spell from your hand (if you can discard Cubic Karma even better), to Special Summon Duza, the Meteor Cubic Vessel from your deck, then use Duza's  ability to send Cubic Karma from your deck to your graveyard. Banish Cubic Karma from your graveyard to add a cubic monster from your deck to your hand - Crimson Nova. Cubic Karma is not once per turn, so if you get multiple in the grave, even better, start stacking your hand.</li>  	<li>Crimson Nova can be special summoned by revealing any 3 cubic cards from your hand, as long as they have different names.</li>  	<li>Once Crimson Nova's on the field, you should be able to OTK pretty easily. If Crimson Nova destroys a monster, he's allowed to make a second attack, and you can double his attack with Cubic Wave (as long as your opponent has a face up monster). This ATK increase is permanent too, if you don't OTK. You only need to hit your opponent with 5000 damage too, from there, Crimson Nova's ability with cause the OTK.</li>  	<li>If you get the the End Phase, Crimson Nova's ability triggers, and each player loses 3000 LP. Performapal Rain Goat protects you from taking damage if you have him in your hand though (just watch for hand traps like Called by the Grave).</li> </ul> Vijam is a great wall in a pinch, too, since he can't be destroyed by battle, if you need an extra turn to set up your hand.  I know Dark Garnex, Blade Garoodia, and Buster Gundil are bricks and aren't ideal, but from my play testing, I have never really had an issue with them. You can always swap in any three other cards; but I would still pick Cubic cards if you do, because you really want as many Cubic cards as possible for the best chance to summon Crimson Nova. This deck is obviously not meta in any way, and sometimes it's fun to play it different ways. It's not optimal, but getting out Buster Gundil once and while and having him attack 3 times with 3000 ATK is fun.  Not my best or most efficient deck, but it's one of my favorites to play. You can use combinations of Cubic Karma and Cubic Wave to get Crimson Nova's ATK to crazy numbers. Cubic Waves can stack too, so you can double his ATK multiple times. I've even gotten Crimson Nova's ATK over 21,000 ATK once or twice.  &nbsp;  Other Options: I've also seen some builds with Monster Gate and Magical Hats to get as many spells/traps into the grave as well; there's lot of room to explore."

This is a 3 cards combo but we're running 7 Instant Fusion + 13 ","Oh boy I never expected Syrus Truesdale deck can be taken seriously. This deck is so consistent to spit out Mobile Base protected with Connection Zone. As long as you have the 3 cards mentioned, <strong>Instant Fusion + 1 roid + fusion spell</strong>, you're good to go. Combo: <a>https://bit.ly/2E8HmUX</a>. I'll explain card by card and their role in deck.  The roid (Speedroid): Double Yoyo (for Halq/Accesscode OTK), Terrortop (best roid, free/searcher), 2 Den-Den Daiko Duke (extender for Halq OTK), Taketomborg (extender), 3 Tri-Eyed Dice (best fusion fodder, negates atk from GY).  3 Keeper of Dragon Magic: Instant Fusion/other fusion spell searcher while being Megaroid City fodder.  Predap package: 1 Ophrys Scorpio (Instant Fusion/other fusion spell searcher while being Megaroid City fodder), 2 Lonefire, 2 Darlingtonia Cobra (2 just in case its drawn).  Fusion spell: Instant Fusion (summons Pair Cycroid for Mobile Base material), 3 Vehicroid Connection Zone (protection and make Mobile Base cant be negated), 1 Poly (Keeper/Ophrys/Verte other target) and 1 Fusion Gate (Set Rotation target).  3 Megaroid City, Set Rotation, and Terraforming: Best card, searches Connection Zone or roid (Speedroid) monster.  1 Emegeroid Call: Negation, also Megaroid City target.  The rest is just staple cards.  Extra deck: 2 Mobile Base (it can summon its copy from extra deck), Pair Cycroid (combo piece). Jumbo Drill (piercing, for pushing damage), Kitedrake (beater and floats), and Chanbara (4.6k damage output) are all just Mobile Base target. Halq/Selene/Accesscode (OTK), Masq (small resource disruption), Cherubini (sends Daiko Duke for link climb/Halq play), Verte (plan B for fusion spell). Knightmares and Borreload as generic good link monster.  <img src=""https://www.pngitem.com/pimgs/m/76-767269_syrus-truesdale-obelisk-blue-yu-gi-oh-gx.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Consistent 5k protected tower that generates plus every turn, can OTK, and big staple slot.  Cons: 3 cards combo, Megaroid City locks to fusion for the entire turn.  Cards to think of: Fusion Recycling Plant (great field but needs discard, we already have too many discard effect and we dont even need the recovered material, Tri-Eyed Dice is better in GY), Halq combo (summons roid from deck but clashes with Megaroid City, so its preferred to use Halq as OTK instead of going first)."

In some ways it is extremely boring - the main goal is Needlefibre into True King of All Calamities. However, it's also a little bold, in that I've shaken up the True King dino formula a little bit to try and increase consistency, at the cost of interactivity. This is a real cost, and it does lead to the usual problems with super heavy combo decks, especially in a combo format. So, why are you playing Dinos as a going first deck instead of Adamancipator?  One reason is flexibility. Your deck is intrinsically good going second and has easy OTKs (as well as a Borrelsword combo just in case), and the ability to break boards. You also have easy recovery plays in Double Evolution Pill, and while your combos are smaller, that leaves room for more follow-up plays. You won't extend as far as rocks, and you don't get the advantage of Koa'Ki Meiru Guardian, but rocks can also generally be stopped on the Needlefibre, whereas your opponent might not always be able to stop you from using Dinosaur effects at all with Miscellaneousaurus, and that makes it hard to stop Calamities and the Pill at the same time.  I tried to build it with this in mind, so that while you blind going first you're prepared to win going second.  The numbers on Dinosaurs are pretty standard, but there are some meaningful inclusions and exclusions. Lost World is cut - the deck needs a face-lift and Lost World, while an easy consistency boost, doesn't make a whole lot of sense going first. A meaningful inclusion is Carboneddon and Guarddragon Justicia. This can make Coral Dragon of off 6 1 card starters, but more importantly, is also the whole Calamities combo. You don't really care if you see the bricks, since you like having tuners anyways, and Carboneddon is still a Dinosaur monster you can use to activate effects, then get some free value off of.  The extra deck is just layers of combos. The most important is making True King of All Calamities off of Needlefibre, but the extra deck can also make Borrelsword Dragon off of Needlefibre (with the small downside of running Jet Synchron over Deskbot 001, which in turn gives the deck an extra 1 card starter). Since sometimes you have a couple of extra monsters on the field and can't do the combo, we have I:P, with Unicorn and Apollousa being the most notable targets.  Almiraj and Secure Gardna seem weird, but they make Baby dinos with Pill into UTC, and give him fodder. It's just more ways to start plays, so that most combinations of cards will get you onto the field.  I wanted more room for hand traps, but even without Lost World, the Diagram ""engine"" is still really good in the deck. It doesn't hurt to leave Ravenous Croc or Vermillion Mech on the field when you make Calamities, especially with I:P around, and you just need more ways to pop cards. Gamma seems essential - I need high impact hand traps that are flexible and generic. There's just a lot of stuff only Gamma will answer, and Gamma is generally a better option than other hand traps going second. I don't really care about having bricks in the hand going second, I need the highest impact hardest to interrupt stuff possible. Imperm makes the cut on the other 3 spaces. You could run 7 hand traps, and I think statistically that would be a more correct ratio, but I feel like it's worth seeing hand traps less often to hand them be high impact.  Back on Ash, making space for Deskbot 001. This makes Borrelsword a reliable follow-up and makes Jet Synchron a better starter.  Made space for Gamma. Unsure on the True King Engine, in practice it gives another way to pop cards and opens up value, but it's not strictly necessary most of the time, and you don't see those cards most games. On the other hand, sniping extra decks is cool... But is it as cool as Hand Traps? I think I'll start testing a version without the True King Engine...  Cut Jet Synchron, back to 2 UTC. This freed up space for Carboneddon. Having a back-up way to start combos and a free dino extender is actually pretty useful, you get a lot of value off of Carboneddon. I could just run Jurrac Aeolo #2 and save deck space, but Carboneddon gives me an extra extender, and replaces Jet Synchron as another 1 card Calamities.  Trying a more budget-friendly split of One For One, 1 Animadorned Archosaur, and 1 Jet Synchron. This gives the deck 2 more 1.5 card starters, puts back in the Borrelsword follow-up, saves money, and gives us ways to pitch Carboneddon alongside other fringe benefits (like One For One being a Special Summon, and Archosaur actually being better when special summoned usually.)"

The plan with this Deck is very simple, as always: Get your Field Spell up and prevent the Opponent from doing anything about it.  Some of the ""one of"" cards in this deck might seem off, but both Wave and Power are searchable and in this particular match-up not the cards you really need, but still have their value. Powers effects are both situationally useful, getting a copy of an Equip Spell back is huge and lowering Attack/Defense can sometimes be make or break in this particular match-up. Usually you want more than 1 Power in the Deck, but Blue Eyes sadly doesnt really too heavily on Effect Monsters so ultimately its best at 1. Wave on the other Hand is usually not good enough to be ran, but since Phantasm Spiral likes long Duels more than most other Decks this card can help you get there by summoning a Dragon of your own no matter what while discarding one of your opponents Hand cards.  I'm personally running Beast-Warrios over Megalo here, only because the 100 extra Attack from Tenki is useful vs Blue Eyes and because Blue Eyes banishes our Field Spell so Sea Stealth Attack isnt as good sadly :(  &nbsp;  Enough of that. A few words to every card in this Deck (including Extra Deck, which are cards that are good in general for this Deck)  <strong>Phantasm Spiral Dragon</strong>: Our ""Boss"" Monster, biggest Hitter, we can summon them from Deck/GY/Hand with the equip Spells, never run 3, maybe run 2, most of the time 1 will be enough. A lot of decks don't run him, I like him though.  <strong>Gene-Warped Warwolf</strong>: 4 Star Normal with 2000 ATK, thats all we want. Beast-Warrior so he works with Tenki  <strong>Dragoons of Draconia</strong>: 4 Star Normal. Very rarely useful for its Pendulum Spell Effect, mostly there to not run out of Steam, also Beast-Warrior for Tenki  <strong>Ash-Blossom</strong>: Probably the best Handtrap  <strong>Fire Formation - Tenki</strong>: Searches a Beast-Warrior and gives 100 ATK. be careful as it can eat up precious Spell/Trap Slots.  <em><strong>Phantasm Spiral Crash</strong>:</em> Probably the best equip Spell, works when attacking them Directly and can potentially neutralize threats by shifting them to Defense Position.  <em><strong>Phantasm Spiral Grip</strong>:</em> Gives 500 ATK, really useful to make our Boss Monster actually be able to kill other Boss Monsters head on.  <strong>Phantasm Spiral Wave</strong>: Highly Situational, thats why only 1 copy. Summons Dragon after Battle Phase sadly, but atleast discards 1 card from opponents Hand.  <em><strong>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</strong></em>: The best card in the Deck. The entire reason we're playing this. Get this out, if you can protect it you're probably winning.  <strong>Card of Demise</strong>: Really Powerful in the right situations, useless in the wrong ones. Not a must have card, but definitely a strong one.  <strong>Dark Hole</strong>: Board Clears are good for us, we like slow Games because we can get value out of Pacifis. Can destroy our Token in our turn to make room for a new one to trigger Pacifis in their Turn again.  <em><strong>Heat Wave</strong></em>: Best card for going first aside from the Field Spell. Stops most Decks from doing anything at all, doesnt annoy us in the slightest.  <strong>Raigeki</strong>: Better Dark Hole aside from clearing our own Token, just an overall good card, if you have it toss it in.  <em><strong>Terraforming</strong></em>: Sadly we can't have 3 anymore and that hurt the Deck plenty, always a must have card.  <strong><em>Skill Drain:</em></strong> Probably the single strongest card in here aside from Pacifis. If your opponent has no out vs this card they might lose the game on the spot. That's how strong it is.  <strong>Champion's Vigilance:</strong> Deny all when you have the Token or Dragon. 3 feels clunky, 1 feels like not running it at all. Experiment yourself, it's always a good card.  <strong>Solemn Warning:</strong> Just helps with our Gameplan  <em><strong>Metaverse:</strong></em> We have to run this  <em><strong>Phantasm Spiral Battle:</strong></em> This is the reason why Pacifis is as strong as it is. Searchable  destroy anything that you can play from Hand when Pacifis is on the Board, never run less than 3.  <em><strong>Phantasm Spiral Power:</strong></em> Negates Effects, match-up dependent but usually incredibly strong, since it can retrieve Equip Spells from GY you should always run at least 1.  <strong>Quaking Mirror Force:</strong> Most Mirror Forces are good, this one felt the best vs Blue Eyes. Experiment yourself but they're basically just Stun Cards that buy another Turn and potentially set-up your next Turn.  &nbsp;  <strong>Megalosmasher X:</strong> another 4 Star Normal 2000ATK card. We like these, this one is a little special, I'll explain in a bit.  <strong>Mystic Mine:</strong> If you can afford its a good card for going 2nd.  <strong>Advance Draw:</strong> Just a card to think about if you're really budget.  <strong>Fossil Dig:</strong> Only with Megalosmasher X, searches it.  <strong>Painful Decision:</strong> I'd only run if you run 2 sets of 3 copies of Normal Monsters  <em><strong>Pot of Extravagance:</strong></em> If you can afford it, use it.  <strong>Unexpected Dai:</strong> A lot of the time basically a Monster card, can sometimes help set-up Extra Deck (yes, you heard correctly)  <strong>Lose 1 Turn:</strong> Really strong stun card, if you can fit it you should probably run it.  <em><strong>Sea Stealth Attack:</strong></em> This card almost needs to be in the deck. It can retrieve Pacifis from the GY, protect our Spells/Traps (think Skill Drain) and turns Megalo and our Token into destroyer machines. Sadly doesnt help when Pacifis is banished :(  <em><strong>There can only be one:</strong> </em>Powerful card but be careful with it because both the Token and our Dragon are Wyrm-Type  <em><strong>Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi:</strong></em> Just a really strong card, experiment with it yourself.  <strong>Evenly Matched:</strong> If you can afford it, its good for 2nd.  <strong>Storming Mirror Force:</strong> Another good Mirror Force  Extra Deck:  You don't really need one, but there are situations where you're gonna wish that you did indeed get these  <em><strong>Utopia/Utopia the Lightning:</strong></em> You need Utopia for Lightning. Lightning gets rid of basically any Boss Monster, its insane. You might not need it vs every Deck, but sometimes it's your only out.  <em><strong>Bagooska:</strong></em> If your opponent can't deal with it ( a lot can't ) it buys precious Time for our Deck, really good, but rare to summon.  <strong>Gem-Knight Pearl:</strong> I'll be honest, in over 100 Duels vs Blue Eyes I've summoned this card once, and it almost would have won me the game. Never ever even thought about summoning it vs any other Deck, it might come in handy though. It's cheap so get it if you can, it might save your game one day.  &nbsp;  There are a lot more potential cards such as the Paleozoic cards and a few more Extra Deck options, but I personally only found these to be relevant.  That's a lot to digest but I hope this gave some overview over the Deck and that it helps you find your own Deck List of Phantasm Spiral. Due to the nature of having the core just be the Field Spell + Cards to search + probably some Normal Monsters the Deck has a decent amount of flexibility.

Finding a natural home alongside the Invoked engine, Invoked Dogmatika has quickly become a competitor in todays meta. However, there is some uncertainty surrounding this deck. While though the deck's potential is high, its consistency tends to be an issue in long tournament settings, and has a tendency to produce awkward hands and scenarios, that can leave it outpaced in a world filled with, ""Halqross,"" combo decks. That being said, in the hands of an experienced player, Invoked Dogmatika is, without a doubt, one of the best decks in the current meta. I would rate it as a Tier 2 deck."

Summon a Crusadia monster. Use it to link summon Magius. Special summon another Crusadia monster to Magius' zone by it's own effect. Activate Magius' effect to add another Crusadia to your hand. Link summon a LINK-2 monster. Summon the new Crusadia monster by it's own effect. You may now active activate additional effects if you chose Spatha or Regulex. Link summon again for either Equimax or Topologic Trisbeana. If you find yourself too vulnerable with only Equimax. Consider using I:P Masquerna as it's material to protect it from effects, or use Regulex to get Crusadia Power to protect it. You can also get Crusadia Revival to boost it's ATK, make it less vulnerable in battle. If you think you can win a battle, you can use Crusadia Testament instead to draw cards and hopefully get a Crusadia monster to boost Equimax's ATK.  Kaiju Monsters can be used to take advantage of Equmax's or Regulex's Up-pointing arrow.  If you're looking for a more defensive play, Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax is a great candidate. Your opponent can only attack it, and it gains ATK equal to that of a special summoned monster it's battling.

Ok.  The deck has many ways to get <a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Numeron Network</a>, but only one <a data-name=""Numeron Calling"">Numeron Calling</a>. This is because I've never had a duel where I could have one if I had another, it was either doomed from the get-go or win more. Add more if you feel you need them, the Extra deck is already cluttered as is.  Go for the likely to be banned ZEXAL or if the opponent will counter this, <a data-name=""Number C1: Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya"">Number C1: Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya</a> or Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops, I prefer it over Avramax, but he's in the extra deck if you need to swap.  If you don't get Numeron Network early on, aim for <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> or <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> as they can control games by themselves.  Eldlich, Dogmatika, and Invoked easily cycle themselves as long as you draw their recycler card (For Eldlich, just send a trap to the graveyard) Shaddoll are kind of the weak link sadly, as there's only so much space. You can search out <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a> with <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a> trough fusion, or sending to the graveyard with Dogmatika abilities, if you can get off a fusion with it, it's pretty effective against Light/Dark decks.  Finally use <a data-name=""Shapesnatch"">Shapesnatch </a>for a full board and hand wipe."
