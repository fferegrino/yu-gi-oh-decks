Les monstres sont très récursifs, permettant de remplir le terrain rapidement, et le terrain force l'adversaire à dépenser pas mal de ressource. Le deck possède en plus un boss puissant, capable d'annuler tous les effets de monstre sur le terrain quand il est retourné. Le deck joue en premier pour préparer ses monstres flips, puis reprend l'avantage en invoquant une masse d'insecte.  &nbsp; <h2>Cartes clés</h2> &nbsp;  <u>Les petits Krawler</u> : Ils ont chacun leur propre effet flip, de la destruction de carte, de l'invocation spéciale, de la pioche, .... Ils ont en plus de ça un effet commun : s'ils sont face recto et qu'il quitte le terrain par un effet adverse, vous pouvez invoquer 2 Krawler de plus depuis le deck face cachée, avec leurs propres effets flips, cet effet inclut <strong>Deus X-Krawler,</strong> le boss de l'archétype.  <u>World Legacy in Shadows</u> : Le terrain de l'archétype. Il possède de nombreux effets smpathiques, notamment invoquer un insecte de lvl 2 depuis la main, face recto ou verso (cet effet fonctionne aussi sur<strong> Insecte Mangeur d'Homme</strong>). Il est aussi très embêtant pour l'adversaire puisque quand un monstre Flip est détruit au combat, le monstre attaquant est aussi envoyé au cimetière. Ca entraîne une double pénalité pour l'adversaire puisque les attaques activent en plus les effets flips.  <u>Les pièges World Legacy</u>: <strong>Pawns</strong> et <strong>Mind Meld </strong> joue chacun sur un effet des Krawler. Pawns permet simplement d'activer leurs effets flips quand vous voulez, mais Mind Meld lui permet d'activer le deuxième effet des Krawlers, puisque c'est bien une carte de l'adversaire qui fait quitter le terrain au Krawler (les Krawlers ne précisent pas qu'ils doivent aller au cimetière). <h2>Tips/Limitations</h2> &nbsp;  Si vous avez <strong>Mind Meld</strong> en main de départ, il peut être utile de laisser dès le premier tour un un Krawler face visible (le terrain le permet par exemple). Dès que l'adversaire utilise un effet qui semble important, vous le transformez avec  <strong>Mind Meld</strong>, vous récupérez votre Krawler et en rajoutez deux autres sur le terrain (dont un petit <strong>Deus X-Crawler</strong> bien embêtant). Le top du cool est ensuite de pouvoir retourner <strong>Deus X-Crawler</strong>  avec un <strong>Pawns </strong>pour complètement bloqué l'adversaire.  <strong>Combo Lib, World Legacy Key :</strong> 2 monstres sur le terrain, <strong>World Armor</strong> dans le cimetière (Effet <strong>Krawler Dendrite</strong>) En invoquant Lib alors que vous avez World Armor au cimetière, vous pouvez allez chercher dans votre Deck <strong>World Legacy Succession</strong>, l'activer, invoquer World Armor, et par l'effet de World Armor récupérez une autre carte World Legacy."

No Diviners - but still consistently sets up multiple negate boards. ,"This is similar to the Megalith Drytron build which some people were playing following the March ban list, however, with Mu Beta it is way more consistent and you're able to set up much better boards. I do not play Diviner as this is my IRL deck and the card is just really expensive. If you wish to play diviner, swap out the cyber petit, manju and purple light. The combos for this deck are still fairly lengthy so I'll add video links to them below.  The most effective two card combo is <strong><span>Zeta</span> + <span>Nova</span> </strong>which ends with <strong><span>Perfection</span> + <span>Apollousa</span> </strong> (Perfection will have a minimum of 3 or 4 negates - 1 or 2 Fairies in hand, plus Beatrice for an additional 2 after dumping Eva, also 3800 DEF. Apollousa will have 4 negates, 3200ATK).

Recording should start at any time, considering the premiere, which is December 16, 2022. Jason Momoa returns in the title role as the sea's most hunky superhero, Amber Heard plays Mera and Patrick Wilson becomes Orm. We do not yet know anything about the plot, but Wan has previously indicated that the new film is more serious: <a>https://conjuring3korea.wildapricot.org/</a>  The first ""Aquaman"" was a huge success for DC, and their only movie to date (besides ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy) which recorded over $ 1 billion. Believe it or not, the movies about the ghost hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren are actually based on real people who claim that several of the events being painted have taken place. But what exactly is the truth behind the films? <a>https://fastandfuriouspoland.wildapricot.org/</a>  The so-called ""Conjuring verse"" is growing bigger and bigger, and recently the eighth film in the series, ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" was released. The films follow Ed and Lorraine Warren, two paranormal ghost hunters who help vulnerable families and save them from supernatural dangers. The plot is recognizable from several horror films based on the Christian belief in God and the devil, with ""The Exorcist"" at the forefront, with the difference that the films in Warren's universe are said to be based on real events. <a>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCltxMIFko6OYsQW7wXRmJAA/about</a>  But how much of the source material is actually true? Can a series of movies that feature obsessed dolls, evil spirits, and haunted houses really contain a measure of truth? It seems to depend on who you ask and what level of proof you think you need.  One thing we can say for sure is that the main characters who appear most frequently in the film series, Ed and Lorraine Warren, really exist. <a>https://ok.ru/group/53982664261697/topic/153459086087489</a> The Warren couple have been working to investigate supernatural events in the United States for decades. They founded the New England Society for Psychic Research in the 50's and have since investigated thousands of reported supernatural events, haunted houses, etc. Several films have also been based on cases they have investigated in the past, including two films about ""The Amityville Horror"" - the house that God forgot. <a>https://mobile.ok.ru/group/53982664261697/topic/153459068261697</a>  In addition to writing books about the events on which the films are based, Lorraine Warren in particular has also been involved in the creation of the films, in an advisory role. It undeniably gives the films a greater connection to the real events that the couple investigated. How many of these stories are true, however, has been debated extensively over the years. As Lorraine herself puts it in a featurette with Warner: ""There are many who do not believe."" <a>https://wrathofmanfilmovi.wildapricot.org/</a>  The movie that kick-started the universe, ""The Conjuring"", is about the Perron family who move into a haunted house in Rhode Island. The house turns out to be a haunt for several spirits, some more vicious than others and according to an interview with Lorraine, most scenes in the film are completely accurately portrayed. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/ganzerfilm/comments/nwf3es/der_mauretanier_trailer_german_deutsch_2021/</a> Now, you may not trust Lorraine Warren, but the fact is that several members of the Perron family have also officially confirmed the truth of several of the events depicted in the film. According to the book ""House of Darkness, House of Light"", where Andrea Perron tells about her experiences, the large mansion was inhabited by several different spirits. They should mostly have performed innocent acts, such as lifting their beds lightly and moving their things. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/ganzerfilm/comments/nwe0xn/hotel_transsilvanien_4_eine_monster_verwandlung/</a> Cynthia Perron, the youngest sister in the family, says in an interview with Historycollection: “When we first moved in, for the first two months, it was a woman who came in every night and kissed me on the forehead, who I thought was my mother ”.  However, it quickly got worse and after a while the spirits must have started to become more unpleasant and, among other things, whispered to the children that there were hidden corpses in the house. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/ganzerfilm/comments/nwdjlv/das_wunder_von_fatima_trailer_german_deutsch_2021/</a> According to the Perron family, several of the scenes in the film must also correspond perfectly with reality. Among them, the clap-and-hide game was played on the family estate, a game similar to hide-and-seek where the family members hide somewhere in the big house and clap their hands as a clue to the seeker. ""The Conjuring"" contains a hair-raising scene where the mother in the family looks for her children but quickly discovers that someone, or something else, is also participating in the game. According to Andrea Perron's book, this event must have happened just like in the movie.  However, the film does not end as the real case. In reality, the Perron family claimed that it continued to haunt the estate, until the day they moved from there. The myth of Ed and Lorraine thus seems to be somewhat more beautifully painted than reality."

Luego de eso, dependiendo de cuántos tengamos, nos decantaremos por una de las 2 posibles rutas (explicadas en el video).  <strong>Extenders para iniciar el combo:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Tour guide from the underworld:</strong> Vale x3. Trae al campo a Graff o al Edge imp (el otro lo envías al cementerio usando a Cherubini). En todo caso, es el mejor normal summon del deck.</li>  	<li><strong>Phantom knights of torn scales:</strong> Vale x4. Envía al cementerio a Cloak para traer a Boots e invocarlo gratis. Luego, destierras este último para traer a Brigandine y al mismo tiempo invocar a Scales por su efecto.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk forward:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial desde la mano si no controlas monstruos, por lo que si lo robas, debe ser el primero en invocarse.</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha knight:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial cuando invocas otro monstruo de nivel 3 de modo normal. Ojo que puede perder timing.</li>  	<li><strong>Psychic wheeleder:</strong> Se invoca si ya tienes otro monstruo de nivel 3, aunque sólo es una vez por turno.</li>  	<li><strong>Psychic tracker:</strong> Igual que el anterior.</li>  	<li><strong>Gilasaurus:</strong> Se invoca casi gratuitamente. Ojo que el rival puede invocar algo del cementerio, aunque usualmente eso no es un problema.</li>  	<li><strong>Fossil dig:</strong> Trae al Gilasaurus.</li>  	<li><b>Reinforcement of the army: </b>Trae a Torn scales, Junk forward o Kagemucha knight.</li>  	<li><strong>Emergency teleport:</strong> Trae a uno de los Psychic gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish burial:</strong> Puedes enviar a Cloak para robar a Boots o Brigandine, o en su defecto enviar uno de los targets de la Tour guide.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck extremadamente consistente, tiene muy pocos bricks y/o garnets.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Se adapta a los recursos que tengamos en mano.</li>  	<li>Protegido constantemente por Apollousa, por lo que es difícil de contrarrestarlo una vez toca el campo.</li>  	<li>No requiere demasiados recursos para realizar el combo.

I realized this could work due to how many draws Soul Servant can give you, how many cards can stack the deck for The True Name to activate, and how good Soul Crossing is.  Magicians' Souls has to be at 3 for this concept to work, sadly. It lets you clean up your hand and send the Palladium Oracles to the grave before they become dead draws. You can run less Secrets of Dark Magic, but it does let you use dead monsters (like Dark Magician Girl, extra Rods, and the Palladium Oracles) as fusion material.  It's expensive and won't beat meta, but it's cool how consistent a deck with a god card and Dark Magician can be."

I’m back again with a new profile this time around, dinomists!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Now there are people who don’t know this even exists! Don’t worry, you came to the right place. I originally was going to do amorphage for my 80th deck but then I figured that it would be more suited for my 100th deck</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Dinomist are water machine pendulum monsters that appear in the dracoslayer lore.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Dinomist are split into a couple categories. They are very similar overall but let’s explain the verity here. There are 2 levels of dinomist, level 4 and level 5, then there is 2 scales, 3 and 6, only fitting their respective levels when pendulum summoning. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Every dinomist share something in common no matter what category it is in. They can substitute themselves if a dinomist card is in danger, they bail your dinomists out of card effects (some negates a card targeting a dinomist card) and battle (some just prevents destruction in general). This helps you pull your plays through and is really helpful in the grind game as well.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I used the standard dinomist ratios with a couple of my own twists. Here’s the list:</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 spinos, spinos is a way to push for game, its also able to wipe 5000 for the price of two tributes which is really powerful.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 rex, Rex is the boss of the deck, this thing twin attacks with piercing damage but what’s scarier is it’s second effect, you can shuffle a card from your opponents hand or field back into the deck, this doesn’t target and doesn’t destroy so you can even just out dragoon with this. It’s removal and hand rip made it a 3 of alone.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 speedroid passenglider, two things, one it’s a level 5 machine self summon, two it’s a scale if necessary</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 ceratops, purely for its self summon as a machine</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 brachion, same as ceratops, self summon machine</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 dracoslayer, as generic pendulum support this card helps grinding and consistency of the deck as well as granting access to new bosses</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 petran, a built in search effect that this deck can use actually! Plesois stacks pretty quickly and it lets petran search stuff</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 plesois, a weakener, normally this effect is bad but it stacks like crazy and helps a lot in securing your position</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 ankylos, this bad boy banishes monsters destroyed by dinomists! It’s also there to provide another level 4 in case it’s needed</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 charge, a search on activation with a built in recycle is really helpful in this deck and makes it worth playing at 3</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 allience, searcher for your dracoslayer and treasure, so why not play it?</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 treasure, a pendulum pitch that’s absolutely worth playing at 3, no less.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 the seventh one, it’s for a custom combo that I’ll explain later.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 upstart goblin, draw one because I had the space, so why not?</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 reload, igknight reload helps a lot in unclogging your hand, just be hopeful that they don’t ash it!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 dinomist roar, this is the best dinomist card in the game without question, it gives you removal, and your both of your scales set</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 dinomist charge, it’s to set up a dinomist into your extra, you can also keep the summoned dinomist with a scale sacrifice</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 fusion dracoslayer, the dinomist dracoslayer, it’s summoned by contact fusion and provides a bulky beater</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 synchro dracoslayer, as an extender and removal I felt like it would be best if I had it.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 infinity, free negates and remover off of nova</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 silent honor dark, the seventh one summon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 nova, just to get out infinity</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 bahumat shark, one for toadally and another for f0</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 silent honor ark, seventh one target</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 full armored black ray lancer, combo enabler</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 number 71, place the seventh one on top of your deck with this.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 toadally awesome, bahamut summon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 future dragon, free cheese if you summon bahamut shark</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 utopic future, to summon dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 musicia, remember when I said dinomists come in scales of 3 and 6? Odd and even? Here’s a card to abuse that (rip eletrumite though)</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 qliphort genius, the card that searches for you.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So I mentioned repeatedly that you can cheese out utopic future dragon and the seventh one, here’s how</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Summon bahamut shark by any means</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Bahamut shark summons number 71</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Overlay 71 for full armored black ray lancer</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Overlay both lancer and bahamut shark for utopic future, the Matthew had are detached</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Number 71’s effect stacks the seventh one</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Overlay utopic future for utopic future dragon.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">And that’s how you set up a negate, other than that the combos in this deck aren’t linear but after it reaches a certain points the deck is really good with resources.</span></p>"

Dawn Dragster","Main goal is getitng banshee in the graveyard while getting a tuner and another monster on the board to go into halqifibrax, into blossom, into linkuriboh into Balerdroch into Vampire Sucker on the first turn.  Optimally your first turn board will be Halqifibrax, Eldlich with conquistador set, Dragoon, ,Zombie world, with Vampire Sucker and balerdroch in the graveyard.  You go into Desert Locusts with Halqifibrax during your opponents main phase to make them discard a card then, if you get a level one on the board like dotscaper or millennium eyes restrict you can go into a spell/trap effect negate with the level 7 or if you use a Golden land you can go into the level 11 synchro with Halqifibrax which is alright.  Sometimes its better to have more monsters on the field then go into the synchro for Saryuja combos which will help to return the Red-eyes black dragon or dark magician back to the deck.  Extra deck is really tight the synchro set-up is all you can ask for from Halqifibrax, into Formula synchron (can miss the timing) or desert locust into the level 7.  Notes are I made this to be consistent with the banshee uni-zombie  halqifibrax combo. Reasoning is particularly interesting in this deck because you run a lot of different level monsters with graveyard effects and the Eldlich traps get their searches causing you to potentially go plus 5 over all in card advantage.  Deck is very powerful and feels pretty good to play I've gotten 1157 Wins this Banlist with this deck and 415 losses.  &nbsp;"

Link to his deck: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/abyss-actors-4/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/abyss-actors-4/</a>  Abyss Actors are basically an OTK machine(I mean, if you don't brick). You can use that power to go second and try to otk, or go first and try to control. <ul>  	<li>Combo Starters: 1.  Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser + Any Pendulum: This is one of the best combo starters, since it's a free special summon. Use them to link summon into Abyss Actor - Hyper Director and start the combo. 2. Abyss Actor - Extras/ Abyss Actor - Mellow Madonna: Put them together since both will end up doing the same thing(Extras will need an extra step of putting him in Pend. Zone, activating effects and setting Mellow). Adding a monster from your deck to hand. That card can depend of how good/bad your hand is. It can be an Abyss Actor - Superstar if you already have a high pend. scale monster, or adding a high pendulum scale monster if you don't have one... It depends of your hand. 3. One for One: Not an Abyss Actor card, but you have Extras, which is a lv1, and a combo starter... So yea, same thing as No2. 4. Abyss Actor - Wild Hope: In case of a really, really bad hand, you can suicide him, to get an Curtain Raiser or Extras. This is very risky and bad, but it's a option to be considered.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Abyss Scripts/Playhouse: Abyss Scripts(I'll use AS to refer to Abyss Scripts) are the Abyss Actors Spells. They're mainly used to interact with your opponent, but there are some who are good for the player. Most of the AS are only used because of their pop effect, since they give advantage to you. The most common way to activate these effects is by playing the field, Abyss Playhouse - Fantastic Theater. The field is very good, since it can add an AS and make your opponent destroy your setted AS, activating their effects. Use them wisely, but don't make it too obvious.</li>  	<li>Going First: Being the first to play is an problem. Since Abyss Actor is ""made"" to be an OTK deck, being the first means no OTK. BUT, that doesn't mean you get to do nothing. Abyss Actor can setup their field, play set rotation(with necrovalley in your side, if you don't have setted cards), make xyzs(if you don't lock your extra), use another pendulum supports, and others... Going first is not as bad as other casual decks and not as good as meta decks, but it's decent enough for you to try to live for a turn and kill turn 3.</li>  	<li>Side Decking: Side Deck can be anything that works well with Abyss Actors. I've put some examples, but there are other cards that are good as well. At the end, the side deck is at your own.</li> </ul> Good Luck and have fun with the deck. Any suggestions you can put in the comments or submit a deck yourself, marking me/the original creator in the description.  Electrumite to 2, plz Konami... Pendulums are dead without it."

I've always been a fan of the GX series so I built this Deck. The problem I have with it right now is knowing what Handtraps I should add so if anyone has some advice for me I would love to hear it.  The Current Strategy aims to draw one of the multiple searchers for polymerization and use the Searchers for the specific fusion materials. Right now the current hand I aim to go for is Elemental HERO Solid Soldier, Any Level 4 or Lower E-HERO monster, Fusion Sage/Fusion Recycling Plant, Honest Neos, Favorite HERO, and Neos Fusion. This is the combo I normally go for with this hand, which makes this Deck want to go second. <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Solid Soldier</li>  	<li>Activate Solid Soldier to SS the Level 4 or lower E-HERO in your hand</li>  	<li>Link Summon Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer</li>  	<li>Activate Devicer's effect to add Fusion materials based on the current match-up.</li>  	<li>Activate Fusion Sage/Fusion Recycling Plant to add Polymerization</li>  	<li>Fusion Summon Sunrise with the Heros you added from Devicer's effect.</li>  	<li>Add miracle fusion with Sunrise.</li>  	<li>Fusion Summon the monster you revealed with Miracle Fusion.</li>  	<li>Activate the Spell Favorite HERO to equip Sunrise or the monster you fusion summoned with miracle fusion.</li> </ol>"

This is an actual thing I made. Basically one day I thought about how Neos is a meta defining deck in Duel Links because Neos Fusion is a slightly restrictive Foolish Burial, which makes it good for control in that format, and I went ""but what if I did that."" And so from a combination of that and a bit of inspiration from that Shark Paleo Frog deck that did well in Challislme Monthly, I made a control deck with Neos Fusion as the centerpiece. And you know what? It's been pretty good. Strategy is fairly self explanatory, go first, summon Brave Neos with Neos Fusion sending Neos and Supreme King Back Jack (or Phantom Knights of Shade Boots, but Back Jack is better for playing around Duster and Lightning Storm, so I don't recommend doing that on turn one unless you drew literally no other interaction) and blow out the opponent with good staple traps. The Neo-Spacians and Connector seem like easy cuts at a glance, but the Neo-Spacians are really good discards off of Keeper of Dragon Magic, since you can summon them right back, and their effects even come in handy some times (better to have 2500 more LP turn one than not have 2500 more LP turn one). And Connector's recovery effect has come in handy for me a few times now. If you're going to cut anything from the main deck, I recommend making it either Miracle Contact, or maaaaaaaaaaybe a copy of Ice Dragon's Prison? Cuz your opponent's got to have a card in the GY for it to be activated? The Extra Deck is a lot more flexible, the only cards that are unnegotiable are Almiraj, Rainbow Neos, three Brave Neos, and at least one Verte. I highly recommend the Neo-Spacian's respective fusion monsters, though, just so you can summon them back with Keeper. The side deck is just a Waking the Dragon package you can flex game 2 when you know your opponent's gonna fade into sweepers like Lightning Storm. Feel free to put whatever you want in there. I honestly think this deck has potential to be, if absolutely nothing else, a somewhat competent Rogue deck. I'd put it on par with that Paleo Shark Frog deck I mentioned earlier, at least. I've seen way more success with this deck than I expected to, and I highly recommend you try it out."

Endymion, the magistus of mastery is your combo starter most of the times (he's searchable with spell power mastery), you summon him then use his effect to equip artemis from your extra deck into him and then use artemis's effect to search for any majistus monster from your deck which is mostly crowley, the magistus of grimoires one of your best combo pieces since its basically a free level 4 monster.  Notes: use endymion's second effect to destroy your artemis or your scales which will trigger their effect and draws you a card and on top of that shuffles garnets back into the deck and use crowley to send dissolver or jackal or mighty master to the gy to summon them later with selene.  <em><strong>The pendulum magicians:</strong></em> they provide you with easy spell counters cuz duelist alliance is a one card 3 spell counters, its a consistent way of summoning versital level 4 monsters to your field and also give you your pendulum scales which have great pend effects and monster effects.  Harmonizing magician: its your main aim to search for with pendulum call along side with any other pendulum magician depending on the situation (if you want a scale or if you want another body). It dosent matter what you summon with its effect its kind of there just cuz its a one card xyz.  Performapal celestial magician: this card can do some nice tricks but your best way to use it is to special summon it while you control another pendulum on the field so you can get a free search during the end phase which is mostly mighty master or jackal, and then special summon the searched monster during your opponent's turn with selene's effect for a nice negate.  Double irs magician: time pendulumgraph is a bonkers card and you want to search it using this guy's effect, you can destroy it in your pend scales using tornado dragon or magistus of mastery to get the trap, and it also have a great scale.  Magical abducator: it basically searches half of your deck why wouldn't you use this thing, it can also search magicians' soul, it doesn't happen a lot but keep that in mind.  Performapal odd-eyes dissolver: you use it mainly to summon magicians' soul and then summon it using selen and then use its effect to fusion into vortex dragon, so a free omni-negate.

Timestar magician: searches like 70% of your deck but you mainly use it to search magicians' soul to continue your plays  Divine arsenal bla bla zeus bla bla: eh....this thing is unbalanced  Number 60 : unbalanced in a balanced way"

The shaddoll fusion is for the added spice that makes this deck unique (Read: Inconsistent)  In all honestly, I am not entirely sure of the ratios to use for the Dogmatika and Shaddoll cards. Currently, I am considering cutting Fleurdelis and Schism. I am considering adding Dogmatika Nexus as the summon conditions can easily be met, but it is never wise to willingly add bricks. Ideally, ratios should be adjusted to allow for space to include Ash Blossom or Infinite Impermanence.  Note: May be worth trying to slot in Hidden Village of the Spellcasters. All monsters present are spellcasters.  Please give constructive feedback, as I am aware that this deck is attempting to combine conflicting archetypes. I simply like to have fun with novel ideas."

What sorcery is this?!  &nbsp;  All jokes aside, I love Flundereeze design-wise. Their monsters are based on diverse species of birds, and the backrow are based on multiple locations. Even the Field Spell is a map! So, I made my first ever Flundereeze deck, named after the Tokyo Port Wild Bird Park! It's a 61-acre nature preserve where vou can find various wild birds and other animals. So if you wanna go birdwatching in Japan, I reccomend going to Tokyo and visiting the Tokyo Port Wild Bird Park!  &nbsp;  As for this deck, you pretty much wanna go first at all times. The deck is really slow thanks to all the Trap cards, and it doesn't have much of an answer to your opponent going first."
