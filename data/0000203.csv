These archetypes go hand in hand, as cards like Sezreil can destroy set Unchained cards for their cost.  This deck has multiple different paths to reach rather intimidating boards. Most notably, Sezreil searches any Evil Eye card, and Pareidolla searches any Evil Eye monster. Often leaving the pilot with Sezreil+Ammo at worst, and often an accompanying Unchained Soul, or even Zerrzeil instead.  Evil Eye of Seline is the bread and butter to this deck. Being untargetable by card effects, and indestructible turns any tower up to eleven. Not to mention the solid Attack boosts it provides. Coupled with Unchained cards, this deck card burn a path forward with reckless abandon."

Granted, it's seemingly difficult to drop all three of these cards on the same turn.  Salamangreat Almiraj along with the Smol Simorghs really make this deck shine. For example, Bird of Calamity can send another Smol Simorgh. Then after being turned into Almiraj, come back alongside the other Simorgh, and link off into Bird of Sovereignty."

Nothing special except for 3 copies of There Can Be Only One, and two Goddesses of the Closed World.  You wanna go first every time so you can set up a board of 1 Brave Token and Wandering Gryphon Rider to negate one of your opponent's cards--not to mention any hand traps or Trap Cards you draw. In other words, this is a control deck.  &nbsp;  As for the title, I named this deck ""Braveheart"" after the 1995 Mel Gibson film. It's not thematically appropriate, but it was the best I could do."

It reduces the games you see Tour Guide, but also makes the deck less relaint on the card. In testing I found a 49 card with 9-13 extenders saw Dark Magician and Red-Eyes a reasonably small amount of time, almost never minded seeing Red-Eyes Fusion, and comboed off very successfully in a majority of hands.  First the Phantom Knights package. My mentality for this was to run all the essentials in the smallest numbers feasible (my usual strategy). 3 Torn Scales are essential, this card is an amazing starter in its own right and an important combo piece. Ancient Cloak is a combo piece, we run 2 because when you see it in your hand sometimes you need to send the 2nd, but it rarely comes up so you could get away with 1. It's great to pitch to Torn Scales, so I like 2. 3 Silent Boots, this usually searches Rank-Up Magic towards the end of your combo but we run 3 because it is a reasonable extender in its own right. 1 Ragged Gloves is a combo piece, usually sending Phantom Knights Sword to extend your plays, but also a reasonable ""double"" of all of your Phantom Knights cards. Stained Greaves is weak as an extender, though you will use it that way occasionally. However, sometimes your combo wants to pitch it to summon Torn Scales from the hand, so we run 1. 3 Fog Blade as a searchable interaction that doubles as an extender in your combo. 1 Sword, a combo piece for that combo and an extra extender a lot of the time. And 1 Shade Brigandine, a searchable extender that is also a combo piece. Lastly 1 single Rank-Up Magic Force, so we can make the bomb that is Dark Requiem XYZ Dragon.  The ""fire"" part of the deck is pretty low. The plus side is these are all level 3 extenders that can help make Rusty and Cherubini, so they have that going for them. Cir and Graff are combo pieces and dope extenders in their own right in your combos. Farfa and Calcab are actually run primarily for their ability to double as interaction to help bait out negates, break boards, and shut down backrow.  Tour-Guide from the Underworld is your best starter. You see this card it might as well be over. In certain hands you might start Torn Scales in order to summon Silent Boots, since this is harder to Ash, but this plus an extender is full board, all of your Boss Monsters but Accesscode and Unicorn. 3 is obvious, and these usually summon Graff as part of your combo. But if Graff or Cir are in your hand we run a 1 of Sangan. We don't have a Crusadia card to search, but you can find a hand trap, and the card actually makes it a half-decent normal summon with extenders, since the combo wants cards in its hands. It's not a huge brick in this deck, since we want to discard cards for our combo and to Dragoon anyways, and it is a half-decent Normal Summon (here).  Dragoon Package is 2 Fusion, 1 of each brick. The bricks suck to see, especially when you see both. But 2 Fusion is pretty good IMO. It means when you see Fusion you can pitch one of them and still make Dragoon, but also they sometimes give lackluster hands the ability to start Dragoon. This decks back-up plan is basically to make Dragoon, and the emergency back-up plan is to cast Red-Eyes Fusion to do that.  1 Rota and 1 Foolish Burial are good enough, still. Rota is a copy of any of your powerful warriors, and Foolish Burial is an extender that doubles as interaction, it's just a generically good card.  For extenders I really want to run 9, but if you're counting the BA package which are situational extenders you're running 13. 3 Kagemucha Knight is obligatory, you want to chain-block Tour-Guide. 2 Junk Forward means you have a free extenders to start on, meaning sometimes you can make Cherubini without using up your Normal Summon, but also means you'll never see 3 in the same hand. Then we have the Psychic package, Psychic Wheelder, Psychic Tracker, and E-Teleport, which are basically just generic level 3s in the deck to make Cherubini as well as the Rank 3s that you run as combo pieces. Lastly, we run a since Sea Archiver, which unfortunately doesn't make Rusty Bardiche, but is a half-decent extender for making rank 3s and gives you an extra thing to pitch for those games when you see too many Phantom Knight cards.  For interruption we have 1 Called By the Grave, because we're a combo deck. Then we have Ghost Girls, level 3s with good generic negation effects, run primarily because they double as Normal summons in an emergency, and picked based on which of the Ghost Girls are likely to have an impact in this meta.  The extra deck is almost all combo pieces, then after that we run Unicorn, Accesscode, and a 2nd Break Sword to help break boards and give the deck a good follow-up plan."

Make sure to have Torn Scales Ancient Cloak and Gloves in grave and you got full combo. Your end board is going to be Dragoon, F0 Draco Future, Bardiche and 1 set Fogblade with one Fogblade in hand. You are making Cherubini, send Graff (it is for cost), Graff effect special summons Cir and with that you make Bardiche. When Cir hits the grave special summon back Cherubini. From there you gotta make sure Torn Scales and Ancient Cloak are in grave. Use ancient cloak effect to add boots to hand and special summon Torn Scales with his effect. Then send Gloves with Torn Scales effect and special summon Boots. Now you make The Sea Dragon and special summon Ancient Cloak. Than you activate Gloves to send sword and activate sword to special summon your detached Phantom Knight ( i usually detach Boots). Than make another sea dragon and use the effect to special Gloves from the banished zone. Than overlay the 2 Sea Dragons for F0 Draco Future and make Verte with Gloves and Cherubini. Make sure to activate Boots in grave to add a Fogblade and dont set it. Use it as a discard for Dragoon because it will extent your plays in the graveyard. Have fun with the deck and i hope to see my lovely Phantom Knights top !!!"

It has surprisingly a lot of good matchups against the top meta decks. Even against decks like VW or tri-brigade that mainly use earth or wind monsters.  The deck can gain so much advantage during your opponent's turn. Sometime even just passing on a ns whitebeard with a couple of handtraps in hand is enough to win against Dryton or Prankkid.  Beware you only have a limited number of interaction so you can be at the mercy of your opponent's extenders. Like all other good rogue decks, it's only good if you know you your opponent's deck as if it was your own.  Feel free to change the side deck or the handtrap lineup, the kaijus are a little wierd but tributing a herald, a dragoon or an apollousa to get a dark on the field feels always good."

While you do that try to have a scale bomber or sting in gv to bring back the following turn. Depending on the hand you can draw a card aswell with pico, your normal end board should be atlas, lancer, a sting in gv, fly and sting set, and contact ""c"" or retaliating ""c"".

Spiritual Forest and Melffy Hide-n-Seek together make for pretty annoying boards to deal with too.  <span>Cards you want to see in starting hand</span>: Obedience Schooled, Rescue Cat, Tri-Brigade Kerass/Tri-Brigade Kitt, Valerifawn, Mystical Beast of the Forest  Theres a ton of easy extenders such as Watch Cat, Crusadia Leonis who can summon pretty much for free, and Egotistical Ape helps unbrick hands while also kind of guaranteeing Naturia Beast. On the occasional hard draw of Earth Hex-Sealed Fusion, you can get your guaranteed Nat Beast into a free Exterio which can shut down a ton of decks.  <strong>Bambi (Valerifawn, Mystical Beast of the Forest)</strong>  -Bambi does what bambi does. Either summon Kalantosa to pop, discard Carpiponica to extend and search, or just summon any level 2 for whatever Link, Synchro, Xyz you need. Bambi is incredible.  <strong>Naturia's</strong>  -Nat Beast is the main, you will make this pretty much every single game. Barkion can be useful for decks that have important traps such as Eldlich or Dogmatika (altho u wont be having fun vs them anyways)  -In the case that opponent isnt playing something spell/trap heavy and you still hard draw Earth Hex-Seal, Gaiastro is not a bad option to summmon. Huge attack with decent negation and typically will be covered by either Hide-n-Seek or Spiritual Forest.  <strong>Quick Synchro</strong>  -Hop Ear Squadron is interesting cause you can make desert locusts on opponents turn, this deck can easily make Old Entity Hastorr and still leave a lvl 2 on the field to spare to allow this combo. If another lvl 2 is left over then going into Vahram, the Magistus Divinity Dragon is a good option.  <strong>XYZ's</strong>  -Rank 2 Xyz can be extremely useful for breaking boards, Sandayu to get over any large ATK monster, and Joyous Melffy's to bounce out to Kalantosa(s) and pop Monsters or Spells on the field.  <strong>Tri-Brigade + Link</strong>  -Tri-Brigade engine just autopilots into Ferrijit and with atleast 1 extender in hand to a 4 material Apollousa, recurrs alot too and I avoided Fraktall so that they can all be beasts in case you are under Obedience Schooled restriction. Unfortunately theres no good Beast Link 4 yet :(  <strong>Other</strong>  -Danger!? Jackalope? is great for draw power and getting free extensions while also summoning Danger! Bigfoot! for free, this sets up very easily for Leo, The Keeper of the Sacred Tree which not only is big in ATK, but if layered with Melffy Hide-n-Seek or Spiritual Forest becomes a nightmare to deal with.  -Alpha, the Master of Beasts (thank god this is an Earth Beast, my themeing OCD would have never allowed it) is ridiculous, breaks boards and can still summon after youve made a synchro or Xyz with Rescue Cat or Obedience Schooled since most deck nowadays leave 2+ monsters on the field on turn end.  -Ayers Rock Sunrise is ridiculous late game, getting an extender and dropping opponents attack by 2000+ is insane, considering low stat values of beasts there can be scenarios where you beat over with Tri-Brigades or even Bambi.  <strong>Closing Thoughts</strong>  Overall i think this deck could be much better by taking out a few fun cards, but I really wanted to keep the feel of a ""forest"" deck in this. Hopefully Mystical Beast of the Forest keeps getting support so that one day I can cut the Tri-Brigades but for now im really satisfied with this.  Enjoy!"

This is the deck I've been working on the most over that period of time (other than the stupid BA deck I went x-3 at a CSM with). I really like the deck and feel like it has a ton of potential, and I want to go over that today. This is my current list minus most of the side deck, feel free to build upon it as you please. <h2>Cards n' ratios:</h2> <h3>Main Deck:</h3> <h4>Infinitrack engine:</h4> 3x Harvester - It's a stratos that can be used for some rank 9 plays as well as some turn 1 zeus boards in niche circumstances.  3x Dozer - It summons a guy from deck for a free river stormer, this card would be so busted it it didn't lock into earth machines.  1x Trencher - It's a main combo piece that happens to be really searchable, so only one is needed.  1x Tunneler - It's a pot of avarice for the deck, really good for constantly cycling resources and draws.  1x Anchor Drill - This is really only for some situational dingirsu plays on turn 2, other than that it's not a bad extender.  3x Heavy forward - it's an in theme tenki that can also be an extra material for some cards. <h4>Machina engine:</h4> 3x Metalcruncher - This is another stratos type of card, but with an even broader search range than harvester.  1x  Citadel - Big boi who blows up boards.  1x Fortress - A really powerful extender for the deck that can be really good.  3x Redeployment - The best card in the deck, searching 2 machina cards leads to the most explosive combos  3x Overdrive - Can either get you a citadel for interruption or a metalcruncher for some more searching <h4>Trains:</h4> 2x Bullet train - very good extender with a scarm like effect that allows you to cycle resources from grave  3x Derricane - is good for chain blocking against things like ash as well as a pop under dora. <h4>Box:</h4> 1x Box - this is a very important card, however it's also one hell of a garnet, but you can still pop off without it. <h4>Handtraps:</h4> 3x Skull meister - Just a decently good option for right now.  3x Imperm - just a good generic card. <h4>Staples:</h4> 1x Called - really powerful card, wish it was at three.  2x E.M.R. - it's an Icarus attack for machines, it can be really good at times.  2x Torrential - It's a board wipe  2x Trap trick - This is extra copies of all the other trap cards. <h3>Extra Deck:</h3> 1x Zeus - Incredibly busted card, this deck can even make it turn one sometimes  1x Liebe - This basically ends the game when you summon it  1x Gustav - Burn for 2000 is strong, also can let you win in time.  1x Dora - Just immune to everything, really hard to out.  1x Earth Slicer - This card just blows shit up  1x Phantom fortress - handloop go brrrr  1x Hyperyton - good for negates and playing around nibiru  1x Dingirusu - powerful removal.  1x River stormer - Is yet another searcher for the deck it also can recur itself easily  1x Ballista - This is how you get box  2x Anger knuckle - This gets you a ton of recursion.  3x Goliath - It's a link 1 that has an ok effect. <h3>Side Deck:</h3> 3x Urgent - really powerful for when you have to go second, dead otherwise.  &nbsp; <h2>Combos:</h2> <h3>Basic One-card:</h3> (Harvester, Metalcruncher, heavy forward) <ol>  	<li>summon your main starter</li>  	<li>search dozer</li>  	<li>summon dozer</li>  	<li>dozer summon trencher</li>  	<li>overlay into stromer</li>  	<li>stormer search bullet train</li>  	<li>summon bullet train</li>  	<li>link stormer into goliath</li>  	<li>trencher summon back dozer</li>  	<li>link into another goliath</li>  	<li>link both goliaths into ballista</li>  	<li>ballista search box</li>  	<li>box search tunneler</li>  	<li>tribute ballista to summon tunneler</li>  	<li>link tunneler into goliath #3</li>  	<li>link goliath and bullet train into anger knuckle</li>  	<li>banish tunneler, shuffling back the three goliaths, ballista, and your one card starter to draw 2.</li>  	<li>end phase bullet get back dozer</li>  	<li>Do this every turn.</li> </ol> I'll keep working on this guide in a few more days, but this is what I have right now. feedback is cool."

Perfect for Ranked Duels on DuelingBook!,"  This deck isn't much different than your standard 40-card HERO deck. Well, actually it is. In addition to having the core of your average HERO deck, it has 17 hand traps, 3 Forbidden Droplets, 3 Crossout Designators, and 1 Called By The Grave. It also uses Predaplant Verte Anaconda so that you can make Destroy Phoenix Enforcer in a pinch. So you have a bunch of meta cards in here.  &nbsp;  Anyway, I named this deck ""My HERO Academia"" for...well, obvious reasons. Those reasons being that it's one of my favorite anime, and that it's perfectly thematically appropriate for this deck! If you're going first, try to set up as many disruptions as you can. If you're going second, summon a bunch of Fusion monsters to OTK your opponent.  &nbsp;  So whether you love anime about green-haired superheroes and their rivals' explosive personalities, or you just love popping your opponent's cards with Destroy Phoenix Enforcer every turn, make sure to download this deck, get into YGOPRO or DuelingBook, and go beyond...PLUS ULTRA!!"

It's still wip. Im also just using this mainly as a way to share my deck with my friends.</em>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>That being said, let me explain the deck to you:</strong></span>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span>1. What is the deck capeable of? / What is your goal?</span></li>  	<li><span>2. What are the possible combos?</span></li>  	<li><span>3. What should you use your searchers for?</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><strong>1. What is the deck capeable of? / What is your goal?</strong></span>  &nbsp;  Just like with a lot of other decks, your goal is to bring out your fusion or XYZ monsters as quickly as possible. Your best choices for that are <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>, <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a> into Infinity. Redoer to possibly lock your opponent out of certain combos. <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> to possibly OTK. And Nova/Infinity to use your opponents summons/combos against him.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>2. What are the possible combos?</strong></span>  &nbsp;  There are quite a few combos you can do with this deck, so it doesn't matter too much if your opponent disturbs one of them since you're most likely going to be able to cicle into another one right away. Depending on what you need at that certain moment those Combos can be:  <span><strong>OTK: </strong></span>  <em>Combo 1: </em>You'll need a <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Power Bond"">Power Bond</a> and <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a>/ <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Zwei"">Cyber Dragon Zwei</a>/ <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber              Dragon Drei</a>/ <a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon"">Proto Cyber Dragon</a> in your Hand. Normal Summon <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a>/ <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Zwei"">Cyber Dragon Zwei</a>/ <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a>/ <a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon"">Proto Cyber Dragon</a>. Then use <a data-name=""Power Bond"">Power Bond</a> to fusion summon <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a>. If your opponent has no defense set up whatsoever you can take game.  <em>Combo 2: </em>You'll need <a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a> and <a data-name=""C&lt;a data-name=&quot;yber Dragon Drei&quot;&gt;yber Dragon Drei&lt;/a&gt;"">C</a><a data-name=""yber Dragon Drei"">yber Dragon Drei</a> in your hand and atleast one Card with the name ""Cyber Dragon"" on the field. Normal summon <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a>, use it's effect and show <a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a> to your opponent. Now use your level 5 machine monsters to XYZ summon <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>. Discard <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a> as it's material. Summon it back from the graveyard with <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a> second part of it's effect. Now banish <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a> so that <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a> gains 2100 attack. Now that it has 4200 attack, use <a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a> to double it's atk and if your opponent has no defense set up, take game.  <span><strong>Combo Lockdown:</strong></span>  <em><span>Combo 1:</span></em><span> Normal Summon <a data-name=""Golden Gadget"">Golden Gadget</a>/ <a data-name=""Silver Gadget"">Silver Gadget</a>. That let's you summon a level 4 or lower machine    monster from your hand. Doesnt matter which one it is as long as it's level 4. Use those 2 to XYZ summon <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>. With that you can take your opponents top card on their deck, possibly locking him out some combos he planned. The second part of <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a> 's effect is also a quick effect. So whenever he's in danger. Discard a monster material and banish him until the endphase, effectively keeping him alive.</span>  <em>Combo 2:</em> You'll need <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon""> and </a><a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon""> in your hand. Normal summon </a><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon"">. Use </a><a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon""> to special summon 2 </a><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon"">s from your deck. Use those 2 to XYZ Summon into </a><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon""> and turn that into </a><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon"">. Now, you can take your opponents combo piece monsters and interrupt their Spell/Trap combos.</a>  &nbsp;  <em>(there are a couple more combos possible but i have to play a quite a bit more in order to figure out which ones are atleast 75% reliable)</em>  <span><strong>3. What should you use your searchers for?</strong></span>  <strong><a data-name=""Cyber Emergency"">Cyber Emergency</a>:</strong> <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>  <strong><a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a>: </strong>2 <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>  <strong><a data-name=""Cyber Repair Plant"">Cyber Repair Plant</a>: </strong>Any Machine Card  <strong><a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a>: </strong>Most of the times you want to put 2 <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>s from your deck into the GY in order to summon <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a>.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <em>(I'll keep adding more and more informations.

I decided to play Cocoon of Ultra Evolution so I could go into Scary Moth (a worse Shaddoll Winda, but a Shaddoll Winda nonetheless) during my opponent's turn thanks to Picofalena's equip effect or Living Fossil (you haven't lived until you resolved Resonance Insect's banish effect and special summoned Scary Moth at the same time.) Also decided to play Multiplication of Ants just so I could still go into Beetrooper Armor Horn even if any of my monster's effects get's negated while Insect Imitation is a way that I could still get to Resonance Insect by tributing any of the various level 3 insects in the deck. (You could cut these for 3x Pot of Prosperity and 1x Foolish Burial if you want, tho'.)  All in all, this is the most fun I've had with a deck in a long time and is everything I hoped Ogdoadic would've been but never did and I can't wait for more support in Burst of Destiny."

Years later, I used this exact deck to teach that same friend how to play Yu-Gi-Oh. This is a simple deck that has gone through many changes over the years, and now I believe it is finally completed. Originally, the deck was built in ""Legacy Of The Duelist"" and was based on Chumley Huffington's ""Sunrise Over Oz"" deck. The deck's approach was solely the <span>Fusion Summoning</span> of the powerful Beasts <span>Koalo-Koala</span> and <span>Master Of Oz</span>. After playing with it for a while, I eventually noticed that the deck lacked hand-advantage, graveyard support, and a variety of Extra Deck monsters, not to mention, it was a rather common occurrence to get bricked by drawing nothing but fusion-related Spells and no monsters to activate them with. Also, if the monsters were eventually taken down somehow, there wasn't much of a recovery plan. After multiple testing sessions, those flaws have been covered, and now the deck performs quite well. I've managed to take down my friends ""<span>Slifer The Sky Dragon</span>"" deck a few times with this one, as well as some high-tier LoTD opponents, if that says anything.</span>  <span>The aim of this deck is still based on <span>Fusion Summoning Koalo-Koala</span> and <span>Master Of Oz</span>, but contains other methods of Extra Deck summons, most revolving around the <span>Level 2</span> monsters <span>Tree Otter</span> and <span>Sea Koala</span>, just incase you can't perform a <span>Fusion Summon</span> at the moment.</span>  <span><span><em><span>Big Koala</span></em></span>: A powerful normal monster rocking a solid 2700 ATK. Exists in the deck as half of the <span>Fusion</span> requirements for <span>Master Of Oz</span>. Don't worry about Tribute Summoning this guy, you need your other monsters present on the field, and there are plenty of other Special Summoning methods that can get him out, which will be covered.</span> <span><span><em><span>Des Kangaroo</span></em></span>: The second half of <span>Fusion Materials</span> for <span>Master Of Oz</span>, with a decent defensive destruction effect for taking out weaker monsters.</span> <span><span><em><span>Desmanian Devil</span></em></span>: The decks main searcher. Destroying an opponents monster by battle lets you add 1 <span>Level 4</span> or lower Beast monster from your deck to your hand. All monsters in the deck can be retrieved via this effect, aside from <span>Big Koala</span> and <span>King Of The Swamp</span>.</span> <span><span><em>Fencing Fire Ferret</em></span>: Upon it's destruction, it's effect provides a way to destroy an opponent's monster that is causing problems. Sports 1700 ATK which isn't bad for a <span>Level 4</span> monster.</span> <span><span><em><span>King Of The Swamp</span></em></span>: Can be discarded to retrieve a <span>Polymerization</span> from the deck, or can be substituted as one of the <span>Fusion Materials</span> for a <span>Fusion Summon</span>, effectively increasing the rate of <span>Fusion Summoning</span> by 66%. This is the only monster in the entire deck that is not Beast-type. Included as a support card, there's not really any reason to ever Summon/Set this thing.</span> <span><span><em>Sea Koala</em></span>: <span>Tree Otter's</span> loyal companion and partner in crime, <span>Sea Koala</span> can drop an opponent's monster to 0 ATK as long as you control another Beast monster. One half of the <span>Fusion Materials</span> for <span>Koalo-Koala</span>.</span> <span><span><em>Tree Otter</em></span>: The Divine being within the deck, <span>Tree Otter</span> is the most powerful being in existence. Just kidding, but he does provide access to a lot of combo plays with his fantastic effect. As long as you control another Beast, <span>Tree Otter</span> can raise a single monsters ATK, including himself, by 1000. Works fantastically alongside <span>Sea Koala</span>, <span>Master Of Oz</span>, and <strong>Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu</strong>. Always try to have one of these guys in your hand or field at all times. The other half of the <span>Fusion Materials</span> for <span>Koalo-Koala</span>.</span> <span><span><em><span>Ayers Rock Sunrise</span></em></span>: Specials Summons a Beast from the Graveyard, while lowering the oppositions attack power based on the amount of your fallen Beasts. Best used to summon <span>Big Koala</span>, or restore <span>Koalo-Koala<span>/</span>Master Of Oz</span> if they are somehow destroyed.</span> <span><span><em><span>Fusion Conscription</span></em></span>: Beast-type searcher. By revealing a <span>Fusion Monster</span> from your Extra Deck, you can retrieve one of it's materials from your deck, however, you cannot summon the chosen monster or use/activate it's effects for the rest of the turn.</span> <span><span><em><span>Fusion Recovery</span></em></span>: Returns a <span>Polymerization</span> and a monster used for a <span>Fusion Summon</span> from the Graveyard to your hand.</span> <span><span><em><span>Fusion Sage</span></em></span>: Grabs a <span>Polymerization</span> from the deck.</span> <span><span><em><span>Polymerization</span></em></span>: Used to <span>Fusion Summon Koalo-Koala</span> and <span>Master Of Oz</span>.</span> <span><span><em>Spiritual Forest</em></span>: Prevents the first Beast that would be destroyed by battle from being destroyed by battle once.</span> <span><span><em><span>Dust Tornado</span></em></span>: Destroys 1 of your opponents Spell/Trap cards.</span> <span><span><em>Fusion Reserve</em></span>: Functions exactly the same as <span>Fusion Conscription</span>, but without the summoning restriction. Also allows you to take a <span>Polymerization</span> from the Graveyard if you have any in there.</span> <span><span><em>Mirror Force</em></span>: Destroys your opponents attack position monsters when one declares an attack.</span> <span><span><em><span>Roaring Earth</span></em></span>: Provides the ability to inflict piercing battle damage with your Beasts. If you manage to do so, you can lower the ATK and DEF of a face-up monster your opponent controls. <span>Master Of Oz</span> absolutely loves this card. </span> <span><span><em>Seven Tools Of The Bandit</em></span>: Negates an opponents Trap card activation.</span> <span><span><em><span>Koalo-Koala</span></em></span>: <span>Tree Otter</span> + <span>Sea Koala</span>. It's low DEF is made up for by it's amazing effect. By discarding a Beast monster, you can destroy 1 monster your opponent controls. Creates a brutal combo play when you have a <span>Big Koala</span> and an <span>Ayers Rock Sunrise</span> in your hand.</span> <span><span><em><span>Master Of Oz</span></em></span>: <span>Des Kangaroo</span> + <span>Big Koala</span>. 4200 ATK. Nuff Said (beware of <span>Magic Cylinder</span>).</span> <span><span><em><strong>Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu</strong></em></span>: ""Polymerization-is-missing alternate plan #1"": <span>Tree Otter</span> and <span>Sea Koala</span> (or 2 of the same) can <strong>XYZ Summon</strong> this monster. By discarding 1 material, you generate a <span>Level 1</span> Beast Token that copies the ATK of the strongest monster on the field. Furthermore, while you control another Beast, this monster cannot be destroyed. A very strong power play can be achieved by having a <span>Master Of Oz</span>, 1 or more <span>Tree Otter's</span>, and a <span>Missus Radiant</span> on the field. <span>Tree Otter</span> can be used to boost <span>Master Of Oz</span> to 5200 ATK, while <span>Missus Radiant</span> provides an additional 500. Generate a Token and it will have 5700 ATK. Gaspeth!. Once <strong>Sandayu</strong> has expended its materials, use it as <span>Link Summon</span> material.</span> <span><span><strong><em>Number 29: Mannequin Cat</em></strong></span>: ""Polymerization-is-missing alternate plan #2"". <span>Tree Otter</span> and <span>Sea Koala</span> (or 2 of the same) can <strong>XYZ Summon</strong> this monster. <strong>Mannequin Cat</strong> has a unique method of Special Summoning monsters. By detaching a material from her, you can Special Summon a monster from your opponent's Graveyard to their field. Then, you can Special Summon a monster that has either the same Type or Attribute as one of your opponent's monsters from the hand, deck, or Graveyard. Yet another means of Special Summoning <span>Big Koala</span>. Makes a devastating power play when <span>Master Of Oz</span> is in the Graveyard and <span>Roaring Earth</span> is active. Oof.</span> <span><span><em>Cross-Sheep</em></span>: This monster opens up some interesting combos provided you have a stocked hand. By <span>Fusion Summoning</span> a monster to a Zone <span>Cross-Sheep</span> points to, you can Special Summon a <span>Level 4</span> monster from your Graveyard. By placing an <strong>XYZ Monster</strong> in a zone, you reduce your opponents ATK power by 700. <span>Cross-Sheep</span> also provides effects for <span>Synchro</span> and <span>Ritual Monsters</span>, making it a decent <span>Link Monster</span> for many decks. </span> <span><span><em>Missus Radiant</em></span>: By existing, all EARTH monsters gain 500 ATK/DEF, and all WIND monsters lose 400 ATK/DEF. When <span>Missus Radiant</span> has met it's demise, you can add a <span>Level 4</span> or lower EARTH monster from the Graveyard to your hand. Effectively provides a boost for the entire deck, with the exception of <span>Des Kangaroo</span>, <span>Tree Otter</span>, <span>Fencing Fire Ferret</span>, and <strong>Number 29: Mannequin Cat</strong>.</span>  <span>This deck is quite fun to use.

I've stared at black card borders for so long that I've practically forgotten what it was like back at my usual stomping grounds.  Yes, I'm talking about my earliest days in the realms of the Yu-Gi-Oh Trading Card Game. Watching GX online, developing a probably odd affinity for one Mr. Jaden Yuki and his crazy costumed warriors, trading my Performapal/Odd-Eyes deck for a slightly modified HERO Strike Structure Deck and proceeding to tune it up into a well-oiled machine, and yelling at the top of my lungs with every Fusion and arrival of my favorite harbingers of justice.  &nbsp;  HEROes have had quite the romp over the years. Stratos had his sentence lifted, Miracle Fusion was one of the craziest and most surprisingly useful cards to make big bosses, Masked HEROes' transition from manga to physical game was second to none, Vision HEROes gave these guys the consistency and bodies on board to put them on the map, I could go on and on. But for the sake of the reader's patience and my burning desire to talk about the deck, onward I go.  &nbsp;  My affectionately named Chupi-Roe deck (which in no way involves Gunkan Suship, as much as I enjoy both sushi and roe upon it) combines multiple HEROes of origin and allegiance, as many modern HERO decks do, and gives them all home in a comfy package that aims to pop off, fuse and strike with the best of them, and just kick butt and look cool doing it. Or as one of my favorite Yugitubers TheCaliEffect [KingofGames] once said:  ""I don't care what kind of board you've got, I'm gonna break it.""  And that's precisely how I enjoy playing these bad boys. Plus a gal. Without further ado, let's break them all down. Going in order of sub-archetypes is the name of the game as always, so as to flesh out everyone's role and how they make a tiny part of a stylish and baddie-busting whole.  &nbsp; <h2>Elemental HERO</h2> Sometimes you just can't beat the originals. You won't find Flame Wingman in this list, as iconic and making me want to belt out Get Your Game On at the top of my lungs as he is. But hopefully the E's you'll find in this section will tickle your fancy nonetheless. Going from odd yet nifty Normal Monsters that produced gimmicky yet cool Fusion bosses to useful Effect Monster builders that produce... the same thing pretty much, no HERO deck can call itself complete without these darlings. <ul>  	<li>And of course, no Elemental HERO list can call itself complete without the tried and tested, lavished and loved, banned and unbanned, and stylish and soaring <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Elemental HERO Stratos</a>. He's an integral part of the team, and even though you might not want to run or see in your hand as many copies as back in the day, it's hard to imagine the deck without him. Summoning him in either fashion, no matter how many times a turn and so long as you don't miss the timing, he gives you the option of either adding a HERO of any kind from your deck to your hand to help start or support your plays, or for every HERO on your field barring himself, pop a backrow card on the field. His ATK's pretty alright for a Level 4 too, at least to me, so you might be able to pick off some lower grunts of your opponents with him. Feel free to play however much of him you prefer, but given recent times I feel two's plenty.</li>  	<li>Keeping up the trend of searching and supporting is the godsend of a manga card turned superstar in the TCG, E<a data-name=""lemental HERO Shadow Mist"">lemental HERO Shadow Mist</a>. If you send her to the GY in any fashion, she allows you to search any HERO from your deck much like our propeller-peddling friend above. But should you Special Summon her, she enables the search of something much more spicy and sure to beef up your field: the powerful and protective ""Change"" Quick-Play Spell. Though we're only playing one kind of that breed of Quickie, which we'll get to in a hot minute, this gives access to parts of your Extra Deck other archetypes DREAM of being as devastating as. Her effect is understandably a super-hard once per turn, however, so choose an effect and choose it wisely.</li>  	<li>He's not a drop in the bucket, he's Lake Superior. <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier"">Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier</a> was an unexpected addition in Legendary Duelists: Magical Hero, but one that certainly didn't get pelted with spoiled tomatoes either. Although he's a super-hard OPT like Shadow Mist, you'll still get plenty of use out of him. On rare occasions you'll Normal Summon him to revive a Level 4 or lower HERO from grave akin to a certain shining sentinel that'll be up next. But more often than that, you'll be fusing with him for his second effect, allowing you to draw two and pitch one. Never thought we'd see a halfway Graceful Charity in HERO, but there ya go. He's a very welcome recruit, and only needs to be at one to get the most out of him. Fingers crossed when and if Legendary Duelists: Season 3 becomes a thing, he won't set me back $60 like he currently is.</li>  	<li>This is more of a personal pick of mine, but you're free to run it as well. To think a silly tin with Jaden on the front granted me access to such a cool little Ultra Rare. <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Solid Soldier"">Elemental HERO Solid Soldier</a>'s a fun extender that can enable some pretty darn interesting plays. Normal Summon him, and a Level 4 or lower HERO in your grip will follow. This can be Shadow Mist to enable her spicier searching, or Stratos to get those plays started and have another body on board for fusing with. Speaking of fusing, you'll want to do that with Solid Soldier on the field for sure, because when he's sent from the field to the GY by a Spell, he revives any HERO from GY in Defense. So now any HERO can join the party! For the most viable targets, see the previous sentence, heh.</li>  	<li>We didn't get Dark Honest localized as ""Dishonest"", but we did get one awesome little method to stave off big baddies granted to these fine fighters. <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Honest Neos"">Elemental HERO Honest Neos</a> can come in major pinch when someone's looking to bear their claws against your buddies. As a Quickie at any point of the turn, discarding him inspires a HERO on the field with a lovely 2500 ATK, stopping those beasts dead in their tracks. Always helps to have one on standby if you can help it. You never know what big-number bearing blokes would be so brash as to bash your band of baddie busters, bucko. Ah, me and alliteration.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Rounding off the Fusion variety of Elemental HEROes is possibly my personal favorite, not just in HERO, but in possibly the entire game. I dunno why his appearance and effects speak to me. Maybe it's the idea that no matter what walk of life you're from, like these HEROes, he bands them together and shines down upon everyone to inspire and burn with radiant passion. That's right, I'm talking about <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Sunrise"">Elemental HERO Sunrise</a>. And let me tell you, he's a glue that holds all these HEROes together. Fusing him using two HEROes of differing Attributes shouldn't be too hard, you've got loads of Elementals to help with that. Once he is fused, he allows you to add the lovely Miracle Fusion to your hand to set up for a fun friend later. His second effect can be awesome, too. Once an attack's declared involving another HERO of yours, he lets you pop any card on the field. This can help with taking care of beefier foes and pesky backrow, but it also means that if your opponent DARES call a scrap with one of Sunrise's buddies, they're not getting out of it scot-free. Atop all that, he gives your monsters more power for every Attribute on your field, and when it comes to a certain Destiny HERO that'll hit the scene sometime, it can make all the difference.</li>  	<li>This is the big guy you'll be saving Miracle Fusion for. <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Absolute Zero"">Elemental HERO Absolute Zero</a> is absolutely astute. Being the only omni-HERO to not specify an Elemental HERO as its primary material has its perks, which opens the floodgates for potential material to create him with. Once he hits the field, he becomes a ticking time bomb your opponent's gotta handle with caution if they wanna get out unscathed... because should they make a wrong move or force your hand, having him leave the field unleashes an automatic Raigeki upon your opponent. Say hi to the snowman from the Campbell's commercial, friendo.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Vision HERO</h2> Initially being in the manga under the control of Jaden's antithesis Aster Phoenix, these optical ooh-aah-ers are responsible for a pricey yet reliable consistency and Foolish-ing engine and plenty of extra bodies on board for you to fuse with. Don't turn your nose up at the way they look, they can really come in handy when the situation calls. <ul>  	<li>Better yet, the situation almost always calls for this guy. <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Vision HERO Faris</a> definitely deserves another shot at pack-peddling along with the friend of his that's popping up next. Discarding a HERO lets you summon him to the field, which is great enough since it de-bricks your hand and sets up your later GY effects, but it gets better. Upon summon, Faris fetches a Vision HERO from deck to place into your backrow as a Continuous Trap. And I can already see you squiggling your eyebrows like California's seismic activity, but hear me out. The target for this effect is going to make all the difference...</li>  	<li>...so be sure to make that bullseye (or triple 20, since that gives the most points) with <a data-name=""Vision HERO Increase"">Vision HERO Increase</a>. In the backrow, he tributes a HERO of yours to take its place on field. And immediately after, he summons a Level 4 or lower Vision HERO from the deck instantly. This is starting to sound like a bit of an assembly line, funnily enough. Faris to Increase to the HERO that's been amazing for the strategy ever since initial printing---</li>  	<li>---<a data-name=""Vision HERO Vyon"">Vision HERO Vyon</a>! You'll be seeing a lot of this guy, and want to. Upon summon, he sends a HERO from your deck to the GY, enabling the aforementioned second hand thing that Faris can. But it doesn't stop there, because he also allows you to banish a HERO that's already done its job from the GY (more than likely Faris) to add the ever-iconic to GX Spell card Polymerization to your grip. By the way, which one's your favorite? The swirly blue vortex, or the two dragons going into the card?</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Apologies in advance if I bring up a certain pink-vested criminal pelter once or twice in this bullet point. But <a data-name=""Vision HERO Trinity"">Vision HERO Trinity</a> is the perfect example of extensive, brutal, and stylish beatdowns much like Mr. Pinkie's golden child. Requiring three HEROes of any kind with no further stipulations, he makes a great closer or another method to dispose of problematic monsters in a fight. On the turn you fuse him, his attack doubles to 5000, and if you feel perky and have Honest Neos give him a boost, it's a downright frightening 7500. If that doesn't make you run to your dresser to replace an article or two, this next point will: he gets three attacks every battle phase. Meaning even if your opponent's got a swarmed field of big bads or destruction-prevents one of their attacked monsters, they're still spices yet to be made and Trinity is the mortar and pestle. With all that considered, how can you not shout a certain ""M"" word verbatim as you sock your opponent's monsters like a sadistic doctor?</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Destiny HERO</h2> Normally I don't really buy into the idea of destiny and instead believe nothing's written and it's all up to those with drive and resolve to make the difference they want to see in the world (Thanks for that, Fire Emblem Awakening), but for Aster's dark and cool fellow Warriors, I'll make an exception. Besides, without them, we wouldn't get easily one of the best Spells HERO ever got, so by all means, Mr. Phoenix. Allow me to describe your darlings destined for decking doofuses deftly in daring detail. <ul>  	<li>The one you all know by heart thanks to a certain list full of certain cards under certain stipulations is <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a>. If you ask me, he didn't do nothin' to nobody, but thanks to a new friend it's not necessarily much of a problem anymore. You'll definitely be binning this card through the methods of Faris, Vyon, Poly, or that enviable Spell we'll get to in due time. Just let that suspense simmer with a bay leaf and some parsley in there, then serve it with parmesan or mozzarella for a delightful dinner of a deck your dame will devour. Overly long quips aside, once in the GY, Mali can be banished to summon a copy of himself from the deck, extending your plays and setting up for more summons of big bosses. A welcome addition to the team undeniably. And with the next guy on the list, you won't be pulling your hair out at Konami's restriction decisions much longer.</li>  	<li>Come to think of it, this guy accepts things despite what his name implies. <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Denier"">Destiny HERO - Denier</a> is primo GY fodder for sure. While he's chilling out there, so long as you have a Destiny HERO upon your field or grave, he can summon himself for free. This can only happen once per Duel, however, so once it's up make use of his next effect again with any number of your revival effects. Upon summon, he allows you to place any Destiny HERO from your GY or banished zone atop the deck. Remember the guy just above? Wouldn't it be nice if you could, say, not be locked to summoning him by his effect once per game without Pot of Acquisitiveness or similar effects? Then open your eyes, the wait is over!</li>  	<li>Just like our good tuxedo-clad friend above suggests, you'll surely end your opponent's destiny with the life force of all things. The unstoppable <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Plasma"">Destiny HERO - Plasma</a> is just as blood-curdling as the day he was first printed. Special Summoning him by tributing three monsters isn't too hard considering all the extra bodies you'll be able to pull up thanks to the Vision and Destiny HEROes you'll more than likely have left over, not to mention the fun extenders the deck has on offer. Your opponent's in trouble when this garish gorer rises up, now that they're officially under a one-sided Skill Drain. If that wasn't enough, prepare to ""Ooooooooooooh~!"" like a cartoon-craving curator we know all too well, because Plasma can also dig his claws into an opponent's monster to Relinquished them and sap half their ATK for himself. You might not summon him all the time, but when he is, you're golden. In fact, he's part of the reason getting Nibiru'd barely makes me sweat with this deck, and a brand new Spell makes him all the better.</li>  	<li>This next one's a flex slot, in terms of Destiny HEROes to run and use for this and that. You could run <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dynatag"">Destiny HERO - Dynatag</a>, for example, for an odd way of Kuriboh-ing your opponent and subsequently amping up a Destiny HERO by a full stack for two turns, especially if it's a certain swiping son of a gun. Alternatively, you could run <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Decider"">Destiny HERO - Decider</a> for potential burn protection and also to retrieve a HERO from grave at the end of your turn. And I bet most will run <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Drawhand"">Destiny HERO - Drawhand</a> since he's a freebie and he, well, draws you a card. But he also gives your opponent a card, and I'm a little iffy on that. I'd rather not contribute to my opponent's hand advantage if I can help it, but don't let that stop you from running him yourself.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Daring Destiny HEROes don't stop with orange card borders, though. Let's give them some thematically-fitting purple ones for good measure. And oh boy, in Burst of Destiny, they get a heck of a boss you're going to want to bring out as soon as possible. <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer</a> is an amazing ash-monger with plenty of boom and brashness to spare. Continuously, he drops the ATK of your opponent's monsters for every HERO card in the grave, but you're more than likely here for his Quickie. And boy howdy, what a Quickie it is. At any point of the turn, you can activate his effect to destroy a card you control and then another card on the field anywhere. So even if your opponent targets the winged mastermind for disruption, you can chain his effect to wreak some havoc. You're almost certain to target himself to be popped, as upon destruction, during the next Standby Phase, he revives a Destiny HERO of choice from the GY, more often than not himself because let's be honest: is an effect like that really worth only using once? I hear people are starting to run Destiny HERO - Dasher to make material for him, but ah... contrary to his name, making use of his effects is slower than molasses. So you're better off just using Malicious and Denier with Poly after searching/summoning them or with the prime card to create DPE with if you ask me. Promise, you won't notice the difference.</li>  	<li>You might not make him too much, but that's not to say he hasn't earned his place here. Reminding me of a big burly erasing doofus from a crazy noisy bizarre town (apologies again for the references), <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dystopia"">Destiny HERO - Dystopia</a> actually brings you a paradise when he pops up. Upon hitting the scene, he targets a Destiny HERO in grave and burns your opponent proportional to that monster's ATK. Prepare to hear that abbreviation a bit more, because his next effect deals with it as well. If Dystopia finds his own is different than usual for any reason, he reverts it back to normal and decides ""You know what? If my ATK can't be what it wants to, neither can you"", in reference to a card on the field he'll be targeting to render destroyed. His material's not as particular as DPE, so you won't be sweating over making him.</li>  	<li>Rarer than the average steak cooked during the taste-testing segment on Kitchen Nightmares is the sight of <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dangerous"">Destiny HERO - Dangerous</a> being summoned off a certain Spell. He's really only there for that, because if you thought Dystopia's materials were generic, this guy's a cakewalk. Any Destiny HERO monster and DARK Effect monster bring him out, so he's more or less here as a Foolish Burial for those two monsters. And since the latter one's the definition of generic, who's a DARK monster who provides instant benefit upon hitting the grave? That's right, Shadow Mist! So if your opening hand's not as fancy as you'd like it to be, you can use that silly spell I'm mercilessly teasing to bin her, get another body on the board to summon with, and get cracking on with your plays like nothing ever happened.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Masked HERO</h2> Those of you that have read the manga or gotten your hands on the HERO Strike Structure Deck ought to know these folks like the back of your hand. Some of you may be astonished at the idea of summoning a Fusion monster off only a single material. But hey, sometimes one body on the board's all you need to cause some ruckus. And that's especially true of these guys. <ul>  	<li>Possibly the best HERO monster ever conceived, drawn, printed, and made available in plentiful quantities due to HERO Strike, <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dark Law"">Masked HERO Dark Law</a>'s utility cannot be overstated. Despite the fact he's not as rich in ATK as your other Fusion monsters, he more than makes up for it in his effect. Wouldn't you know it? A one-sided Macro Cosmos is STILL amazing in this game, especially with the prevalence of decks that use the GY as a second hand. If that wasn't enough, as a soft OPT, should your opponent draw or search outside the Draw Phase or Damage Step, Dark Law takes notice and puts one card in that grip of theirs with the rest of their would-be GY tools. It's no wonder why we run two, especially if it means providing protection against targeted disruption for the DARK-Attribute HERO used to make him.</li>  	<li>Another DARK friend with a concealed identity is <a data-name=""Masked HERO Anki"">Masked HERO Anki</a>. He's definitely got some biceps to spare, 2800's a pretty good number. And he's proud to have it, as upon destroying a monster by battle and it hitting the GY, he searches another ""Change"" Quick-Play Spell you can immediately use to get another Masked HERO from the Extra Deck and another attack and powerful effect to unleash. You might see him pop up in Duel Links more often, but that's not to say he's not useful in the real deal either.</li>  	<li>If you use Absolute Zero to make this monster, you're either in a pinch, or weirdly sadistic. I won't judge, however. If a tool like that exists in a deck and is easily accessible, why would you not use it? Indeed, I'm referring to the trigger-happy harbinger of melting madness, <a data-name=""Masked HERO Acid"">Masked HERO Acid</a>. Immediately as he hits the field, he unleashes his built-in Harpie's Feather Duster (hard to believe it's legal again after so long) and drops the ATK of your opponent's field by 300 each. Definitely worth Quickie-ing Liquid Soldier or Absolute Zero away to make Swiss cheese of your opponent's backrow.</li>  	<li>Should your Stratos find itself under fire for disruption, one ""Change"" Quickie later, he's safe and in his place is the prime rocket-kicking scarf slinger, <a data-name=""Masked HERO Blast"">Masked HERO Blast</a>. Upon hitting the field, he halves the ATK of one of your opponent's monsters. But he can also, as a Quickie, have you pay 500 LP to return a pesky backrow card of your opponent's to the hand. Useful if you're looking to go into battle or if it's the end of the turn and the card's been set the same turn. You won't see him a whole lot, but I still go wild for his speedy antics.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Xtra HERO</h2> Links? In a Fusion deck? Well, it is post-2015. Hard to see an Extra Deck these days without at least a smidgen of blue in it. Surprisingly, these guys help HERO a lot, especially the first two. Whether you found them in the Legendary Hero Decks or Dark Neostorm, you're definitely thankful to have these on your side. <ul>  	<li>The shockingly common and useful <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Cross Crusader"">Xtra HERO Cross Crusader</a> makes headlines for good reason. Thanks to your binning and fusing business, you're more than likely to have a Destiny HERO in grave to revive for his primary effect. Secondarily, and building off the first, he tributes a Destiny HERO to add any HERO with a different name from your deck. Is that an unreal amount of searching, or what? It's impossible for me to imagine playing Pot of Prosperity in a deck like this, man.</li>  	<li>Never thought I'd see the day where this cost more than the other Xtra HEROes combined, but I won't really complain. I was years ahead the market and got a good bit of this stuff on the cheap because of my morbid curiosity anyways. Staff in hand and visor in view of victory, <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Wonder Driver"">Xtra HERO Wonder Driver</a> can do a whole lot for your deck. Upon summoning a HERO either way at link point, he grants you the amazing effect of targeting a Polymerization, Fusion Spell, or ""Change"" Quickie in your grave and setting it back to the field. It's amazing if you were to, say, make Sunrise at his link point, set the Poly you used for him, and then use it again for someone like DPE or Trinity. Or even bring out a Masked HERO to his link point and then set the Quickie you used for the summon back to be chained to something later. Yeah um... I think I can see why it's such a big deal now.</li>  	<li>If firepower's what you're looking for, here it is. <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Dread Decimator"">Xtra HERO Dread Decimator</a> shows up when you've already Cross Crusaded and you're ready to lay the damage on thicker than the wallets of those who own GameStop stock. For himself and the HEROes in any of his three link points, he provides 100 more ATK for each HERO in the grave, and he himself pierces. Yeah, he's got a bit of investment and really only exists to break through big walls, but I'd be lying if I said tearing down those walls his way wasn't cool as anything.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Spells</h2> Alright, enough dawdling! I've teased you about that one Spell long enough, as hard not to imagine its title it may be. HEROes make use of a good bit of super cool cards to get the job done, it's honestly astonishing how many of these you can use and still play through disruption so long as you've got one or two to spare in your hand. Least, way I've seen my hand on a good day. <ul>  	<li>Consistency's dripping from the ceiling at this point. <a data-name=""E - Emergency Call"">E - Emergency Call</a> (haha yes funny internet letter) give you a selection of any Elemental HERO of any walk of life and any level. Whether you need a Stratos to start your plays, a Shadow Mist to bin, a Solid Soldier to enable said Stratos or Shadow Mist, an Honest Neos to protect yourself, or a Liquid Soldier to Poly away for Sunrise and get to generating card advantage, this very lovely vowel is at your side.</li>  	<li>And if that's not enough for you, there's the ""If it's Limited it's definitely useful so why not"" alternative search tool, <a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>. Y'all know the drill if you've played HERO, Phantom Knights, or any number of other worthwhile Warrior decks in the past. Any Warrior at Level 4 or below will be saying ""Hi"" with this in your hand. But that's not the only way to get your important tools out.</li>  	<li>Another Limited and too good to pass up card is the freebie-allowing, advantage-netting, potentially Ash-baiting <a data-name=""A Hero Lives"">A Hero Lives</a>. You love to see it in your opener, don't lie. With a field barren of face-up monsters, you can exchange half your LP for the summon of a Level 4 Elemental HERO from the deck. More often than not, Stratos for the searching thing he's known for or Shadow Mist to get to masquerading. Do NOT pass up the opportunity to fire this off if it's between your fingers.</li>  	<li>What the heck, let's knock one more Limited Spell off the list. I'd prefer if <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> was at another copy or two, but I guess it being here now means more room for other useful cards. Anyways, you're more or less running this if your opponent gets to gumption to drop certain cards in their grave whenever you play certain cards. You know the ones. You can barely take a sip of water and they'll be around the corner waiting to siphon every last drop, mark my words.</li>  	<li>With those out of the way, onto the cards that make big bad boys with the purple borders. Y'all know <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a>, I'm sure. Tossed around in Duel Monsters, and even more in GX when Fusions became dedicated archetype bosses instead of slightly more powerful vanillas. Your go-to way of putting this classic into play is with Vyon, that monocular main man. What is it with the Level 4's in this deck being as good as they are?</li>  	<li>You're always glad to have this when your opponent's targeting one of your HEROes to disrupt or you're looking to make another HERO at Wonder Driver's link point during your opponent's turn to keep the chainable ball rolling. Searchable off Shadow Mist, <a data-name=""Mask Change"">Mask Change</a> is blessed by the little lightning symbol in the top left, meaning you can respond with it and even use it during the Battle Phase to tag out a monster that's already attacked for a stronger one that can give you an additional shot at getting a good hit in. Try and keep at least one on hand or set in your backrow if you can help it. Guarantee you won't regret it.</li>  	<li>Here we go, the other reason Dark Neostorm is so well-revered. <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a> and the favors it does for HERO are comparable to Time Thief Perpetua in Time Thief; there's just a world of difference and you'll never go back. For the simple fact it lets you fuse using cards in your deck, it both works to Foolish cards like Malicious, Denier, and Shadow Mist so you can make use of their effects and also makes a powerful body on the board. And if it means DPE can come of its activation, you bet your bottom dollar we're running three of these. Keep in mind that after you use it, you can only Special Summon DARK HEROes, so do your best to get Wonder Driver, Sunrise, and Absolute Zero out beforehand if you need.</li>  	<li>Transitioning into another signature fusion Spell for another sub-archetype, <a data-name=""Miracle Fusion"">Miracle Fusion</a> makes headlines for being one of the first cards to fuse using cards that weren't in the hand. It's here to allow Absolute Zero to make waves (or rather, deadly drafts) after Sunrise nets it for you, or for Sunrise himself if you need some extra leeway to make your plays and nothing else seems to be up and running at that time. So for situations like that, it's earned the name.</li>  	<li>Now here's a surprising twist of fate. A Plasma searcher that also grants protection when he's present? Odd. But we'll roll with it. <a data-name=""D - Force"">D - Force</a> is kinda interesting, methinks. With all the searching HERO does, to think there's a Continuous Spell that does it now akin to Live Twin Sunny's Snitch and Fire Formation - Tenki. I won't complain, Konami'll be Konami. Anyways, upon activation, this bizarre concoction of what was once anime-exclusive tomfoolery nets you a Plasma upon activation, and provides two perks and one drawback while he's up. Drawing during the Draw Phase becomes out of the question, cards you control can't be targeted by effects, and Plasma, hoo boy. Becomes 100 ATK stronger for every monster in the GY's, is non-destructible, and can attack twice. Good LORD this deck's got bosses out the wazoo, and Plasma is seriously crazy now because of it.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Traps</h2> Something I like about HERO is that they've got a good bit of flex spots for backrow. Though I guess you could say that for plenty of other decks these days. You can run pretty much whatever you like instead of these or what's in your price range, but these are what I feel work for me personally. <ul>  	<li>Feels blasphemous to start with a monster, but it may as well be a trap, you could say. <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> can be pitched during your opponent's Main Phase to target one of those monsties of theirs and shut them up for the remainder of the turn. I tend to use these on big scary setup pieces so there's only a calm and no storm when it's time for me to play, or when the dreaded Anaconda rears its head. Though, it's not his fault I get jumpy upon seeing him. No points for guessing whose it actually is, however.</li>  	<li>We don't wanna be on the receiving end of those kinds of cards. Your 'Gekis, your No Mores, your floodgates or omni-""no""'s, and you definitely don't wanna get sent to <strong>The Mine.</strong> So just in case those happen and those are a worry to you, get yourself a <a data-name=""Solemn Judgement"">Solemn Judgement</a> or <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> to help you sleep at night. They won't creep up on you no matter how nyctophobic you tend to be.</li>  	<li>Another card I wish wasn't Limited so I could still play the game despite ""those"" kinds of people is <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a>. It was basically designed for going second doofuses like me. Your opponent activates a trap, you show them this, trap goes back down, and although they can set another trap from their deck, no traps can activate on their side for the rest of the turn. Yeah, it's risky and plus's your opponent, but still being able to play the game's appealing to me. Plus, on the off chance they give you that trap on your turn, you can activate it from your hand at the cost of half your LP. I bet by now you probably think I have some sorta vendetta against my silly 8000, but I guess I'm just a ""Pay first, act defensively later"" kinda guy.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Side Deck</h2> If certain cards in this deck aren't quite to your taste, that's totally fine! I'm not here to tell you how to play this silly thing, but I guess that's kinda what I'm doing right now, heh. Regardless, here are some alternatives I think might be nifty. <ul>  	<li>If veiling effects isn't your thing, see how busting heads suits you. <a data-name=""Skull Meister"">Skull Meister</a>'s a card I didn't really expect to see play too much, but I guess part of a TCG is you never know what's gonna become good sought-after. If your opponent tries to activate an effect in their grave, pitch this guy and you won't see much of that effect anymore. There may be a cuter and more broad-area-covering version of this card in Duel Devastator and other such odd sets, but we all know about Konami and their waifu tax.</li>  	<li>As far as backrow cards, it's the same story more or less. You could run <a data-name=""Mask Charge"">Mask Charge</a> for Mask Change and HERO recovery, <a data-name=""Night Beam"">Night Beam</a> for backrow popping that's harder for your opponent to respond to, <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> to well, Reborn things, and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> if the thought of a field full of jerks ready to tear your cards a new one going second is a concern of yours.</li>  	<li>Now here's a way Solid Soldier can dodge disruption. <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dian"">Masked HERO Dian</a>'s surprisingly strong at 2800/3000. But I suppose you don't don diamond getup for nothing. When she pops a monster in battle (I think it's a she?) and has it GY-bound, she summons a Level 4 HERO from the deck. Gets you another body and has the muscle to back it up, not too bad all things considered.</li>  	<li>If Sunrise seems too restrictive to act as a double HERO bin with Polymerization, then turn your eyes to <a data-name=""Vision HERO Adoration"">Vision HERO Adoration</a>, like the way his name seems to imply lots of people do. His effect's kinda situational but alright, targeting an opponent's monster and one of your HEROes on field to drop the first's ATK by the second's for the turn. Personally if I'm gonna bin two HEROes for a body, I want that body to be smoking and strong, hence my run of Sunrise. But again, that's not to knock people who prefer other methods. It's just me nuzzling my cheek up to weird stuff I enjoy.</li>  	<li>Looks like Absolute Zero's not alone as far as omni-HEROes in this deck go. <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Escuridao"">Elemental HERO Escuridao</a> is someone you'd care to tango with should you want to do fun bashing stuff with an Elemental and any Destiny or Vision HERO you happen to have spare. He (or she) gets 100 ATK for every Elemental HERO in grave, which is alright for what it's worth. If you really wanna go extreme, put it up at link point with Dread Decimator while Sunrise is up with another non-LIGHT or DARK Attribute or two while DPE's also there chilling and you've got an Honest Neos waiting in case your opponent somehow surmounts all that. Eh, maybe that's a little overboard. Sunrise and DPE alone do it for me.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  So there's the deck once more. Whether heroes are born or made, I don't regret making this deck at all. Fingers crossed DPE and Denier aren't like, some crazy rarity like Faris or Increase and therefore require you to take out a mortgage to play the deck. Maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part, though. Anyways, before I close, treat your eyes just a little bit more to some handy play notes I typically keep at the bottom of these lists.  &nbsp; <h2>Handy Play Notes</h2> <ul>  	<li>When you're up to bat, try and play through or scout for any of your opponent's hand traps or disruptions if you can. Use cards like D - Force and A Hero Lives first just to be sure they're not saving anything for you, and when the hatches for that are down, go into your bread and butter stuff like Stratos, Faris, Solid Soldier and the like. When your plays in this deck can't get off the ground, it hurts. Or as Chumlee would describe, totally not-licious.</li>  	<li>Keep an eye on your super hard OTP's Shadow Mist and Liquid Soldier. For example, can you search a HERO with another card you have right now? If so, might be worth it to use Shadow Mist to fetch a Mask Change so Dark Law and the gang can be on the prowl later when your opponent least expects it. Do you wanna revive a HERO when you're in a pinch or use your own original card Blaceful Blarity? It can be a really weird feeling when you slip up on these things and realize too late, so just thought I'd add that little note here.</li>  	<li>If you're a Sunrise or Adoration up but a DPE and Fusion Destiny short, plan ahead by getting Malicious and Denier to hand or field early on, then Poly either of those two Fusion guys at the start to Wonder Driver's link point, re-set the Poly in grave, then use it again to fuse Mali and Denier away into DPE or Dystopia, then those orange-bordered little scamps can run free about the GY once more.</li>  	<li>Remember that once you plop Fusion Destiny down and it goes off, DARK HEROes are all you can Special for the rest of the turn. So I stress again that you should get your differently-Attributed boys on board ahead of time, like Sunrise and Wonder Driver, to get use out of them and still be able to make DPE or Dystopia with ease.</li>  	<li>If you find yourself taking damage, feel free to place an Increase in grave into your backrow with his effect. Sure, you may have already had the whole Faris line come and go, but if you've still got Vision HEROes in deck and maybe an extra Vyon, why not? At the very least, it's extra bodies for say, Plasma or any number of your Xtra or Masked HEROes.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  And there we go. Another HERO deck in the works. Feels good to touch the green, green grass of home once more. And if it stays like this, I doubt you'll find me too far from here in the future. Hope I helped inspire you towards HEROes and how they bravely stand up to whatever board their opposition happens to put before them! They're stylish, varied, and oddly priced, but I wouldn't trade them for the world. Or my affinity towards any other version of the anime, either.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be off chilling out with the crew in the schoolyard, causing trouble but never looking too hard."

Otherworld Hero and a Dragon Monk take an epic journey!","The converging journeys of an otherworldly hero and dragon monk join together to form a surprisingly competent deck! Brave Token and Tenyi are archetypes focused on supporting their respective normal monsters. Combined together, Brave Token provides 7 copies of Called by the Grave to ensure that Tenyis can actually play through interruption like Ash, Impermanence and Nibiru! Simultaneously, Brave Token gets the firepower and support it desperate lacks as it pumps out big beatsticks like Tenyi Spirit Sahasrara and Draco Berserker of the Tenyi. The Tenyi toolbox can also be used like a targeted bounce from Tenyi Spirit Vishuda and +2 draw/protection from Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi! As both archetypes are deployed to the field, these archetypes cover each other’s weaknesses and in turn strengthen each other forming one deck of beautiful synergy.  Tenyi’s arch nemesis are handtraps – they are generally unable to play through Nibiru (since they summon 10+ times during their main combo and cannot recover if field wiped) or when their chokepoint, Shaman of the Tenyi is negated.  With the introduction of the <strong><span>BRAVE TOKEN PACKAGE</span>,</strong> Tenyis are more resilient playing through handtraps since Brave Token functions as 7 extra copies of “Called by the Grave.” Wandering Gryphon Rider provides an omni-negate before the 5th summon, allowing the Tenyi player to play through Nibiru. This combo is accessible if you have Aquamancer of the Sanctuary, Foolish Burial (target is Aquamancer, banish it from the GY to get Rite of Aramesia), or Rite of Aramesia in hand, since they allow the summon of Wandering Gryphon Rider (the omni-negate). If you open Aquamancer/Aramesia, you only summon twice, including the Gryphon.  The <span><strong>MAIN COMBO</strong></span> of the deck requires Rite of Aramesia, Vessel for the Dragon Cycle and any Tenyi: <ol>  	<li>Activate Rite of Aramesia. SS Brave Token, place Journey of Destiny from deck to field. (This is good ash bait. If they ash it, then you can continue your Tenyi combo).</li>  	<li>Special summon any Tenyi, then link summon Monk of the Tenyi.</li>  	<li>Journey of Destiny adds Dracoback from deck to your hand when you summoned.</li>  	<li>Activate Vessel of Dragon Cycle, dump Mare Mare into the GY and search for Tenyi Spirit, Ashuna (this is the best Tenyi for comboing since it’s an extender).</li>  	<li>SS Ashuna.</li>  	<li>Activate Journey's effect, adding Gryphon to your hand while discarding the Dracoback equip.</li>  	<li>Activate Dracoback equip GY effect, equip it to Brave Token.</li>  	<li>SS Gryphon. This is the end of your Brave Token Combo. The rest is standard Tenyi combo. (This is the 5th If your opponent uses Nibiru, you can negate it).</li>  	<li>Link summon Shaman of the Tenyi using Monk + Ashuna.</li>  	<li>SS from GY Mare Mare with Shaman of the Tenyi, then discard any card (preferably a Tenyi card since they activate in the GY.) This is the most crucial chokepoint of the deck, now protected by the Brave Token Package!</li>  	<li>SS Mare Mare tokens thrice with it’s effect. Link summon Linkriboh with a token. Then link summon using Shaman +2 tokens to make Tenyi Spirit – Sahasrara.</li>  	<li>Banish Ashuna from the GY to summon any level 4 Tenyi from deck. Synchro summon Berserker of the Tenyi (Or Baxia if you want to clear the board) using Mare Mare + Level 4 Tenyi.</li> </ol> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/a/KtKh1CW"">With just three cards. your board should look like this:</a>  <img src=""https://imgur.com/a/KtKh1CW"" alt="""" />  This board can now play through negates, nibiru, handtraps. It is very consistent to make since any Tenyi could make this board, and there are 7 ways to access your Brave Token omni-negate (and the original Called By the Grave.)  Going first you have a formidable board. You have battle protection (Linkuriboh), a banish (Draco Berserker), Token Generator/Protection (Sahasrara) and an omni-negate (Wandering Gryphon Rider).  Going second you can OTK easily. You have a bounce (Dracoback the Dragon Steed), an omni-negate (Wandering Gryphon Rider), multiple targeted shuffles (Baxia) and several big bodies on board (Sahasrara). If Vishuda is in the GY, you can bounce a card on the field.  The strength of this board depend highly on drawing into Vessel of the Dragon Cycle or somehow putting milling Mare Mare into the GY (perhaps with Foolish Burial or discarding it from hand) since it’s the best revive target for Shaman of the Tenyi. Boards that are made without Mare Mare are considerably weaker, perhaps only ending on Brave Token, Wandering Gryphon Rider and the Tenyi Link-3s/or Sahasrara.  These two decks also <span><strong>SYNERGIZE</strong></span> quite well since both archetypes discard from the hand for cost for the activation of key cards like Journey of Destiny and Shaman of the Tenyi. Aquamancer of the Sanctuary and all Tenyi monsters activate by banishing from the GY. Brave Token is spashable in decks that don’t use their normal summon card effect and Tenyi doesn’t use it since all it does is special summon.  Other than the 9 card Brave Token package, the rest of this deck is fairly standard Tenyi. No explanation needed for the rest of the cards – I just wanted to showcase the power of the Brave Token package in a deck that desperately needed a way to play through hand traps.  <span><strong>General Tips</strong></span> – I’ve play tested this online quite a bit, and here is what I learned playing it. <ul>  	<li>Activating Rite of Aramesia is good ash bait. If they ash it, then you can continue your Tenyi combo. Just hope they don’t have Nibiru in hand!</li>  	<li>Don’t summon Gryphon before you have the material on board to summon Shaman of the Tenyi. Gryphon is an effect monster, which turns off all your Tenyi’s ability to SS from hand!</li>  	<li>When discarding cards, always try to discard a Aquamancer, any Tenyi monster, or Heavenly Dragon Circle since they have beneficial effects in GY.</li>  	<li>Foolish Burial goods target is Heavenly Dragon Circle, and once banished from the GY, search either for Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi or Fists of the Unrivalled Tenyi. Even though these are one-ofs, you basically have 7 copies of each card!</li>  	<li>The flex-spots in this deck are Pankratops, Feather Duster, Monster Reborn and Raigeki. You can even cut 1 Heavenly Dragon Circle and Tenyi Spirit Shthana. You can customize your deck however you like with these 6 flex-spots, whether you put in handtraps, solemns, or board breaking cards.</li>  	<li>The latter half of the Tenyi combo needs Mare Mare dumped in the GY to be summoned by Shaman of the Tenyi. If you don’t have Vessel of the Dragon Cycle in hand, you can dump it with Foolish Burial. If Mare Mare is already in your hand, then you can discard it with Shaman’s or Journey of Destiny’s effect.</li> </ul> <span><strong>Concluding Commentary</strong></span>  Inspired by the success of this package in the OCG, I thought I would experiment a little bit using Brave Token with a favourite budget deck of mine I’ve built a while ago to give it a little powerboost. The superior deck to combine with Tenyi is still Swordsoul, combining the Tenyi’s special summons and toolbox effects with Swordsoul’s offensive firepower. However, Tenyis hold a soft spot in my heart – and having them play through interruption with the power of an “isekai MC (which is basically me, the duelist)” is thematically suuuuper cool! Overall, Brave Token Tenyi is still a middling rogue deck, and it allows for Tenyi to play comfortably through the handtraps that plagued it’s combos. Don’t underestimate it’s power, it can OTK in an instant, generating 8k+ damage on board with several forms of non-destroying removal. It can also create a formidable first turn board with a combo protected by an omni-negate.  Mark my words – Brave Token is META DEFINING for combo decks. I look forward to splashing the Brave Token Package in other combo decks, not only because it’s an additional 7 copies of a better Called by the Grave – I love watching degen isekai anime trash and it’s cool I finally get to see it in Yugioh!  That’ll be it for now, GLHF Duelists!"

I originally planned on running a Cyber Angel Drytron decklist but after testing some hands I realized I bricked <b>a lot</b>. So I ditched the idea and went for Pure Cyber Angel. My reasons for the ratios of the cards is as follows:  1 ofs: Cyber Prima - A potential full-on destruction of all Spells on the field. Ritual Sanctuary - I just found that this card wasn't the greatest while being played at 2 or 3 but I do run 3 copies of a card that can search it, otherwise, I would've just removed it. Cyber Angel Benten - I would play more but Drytron got it limited, this card if ever brought back to 3 is certainly worth playing at 3.  2 ofs: Etoile Cyber - Just Playing it as tribute fodder. Cyber Angel Nashata - Let's me take control of a monster my opponent controls after it's been sent to the GY when it been properly Summoned.  3 ofs: Cyber Tutabon - Lets me grab a Ritual Spell when tributed so it's just there for the recycling.  Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - Average hand trap used in most decks.  Cyber Petit Angel - On Summon lets me grab a Machine Angel Ritual or Cyber Angel depending on what I need.  Cyber Egg Angel - Lets me add a Ritual Sanctuary or Machine Angel Spell from my Deck to my hand.  Cyber Angel Vrash - The major Wincon of the Deck, lets me pop all monsters opponent controls Special Summoned from the Extra Deck plus gains an extra Attack as well as having a pop negate.  Cyber Angel Dakini - On Summon forces your opponent to send a monster to their GY, has a recycling effect, and can make all Rituals inflict piercing battle damage.  Cyber Angel Izana - Forces your opponent to send a monster they control to the GY, lets me attack again when it destroys a monster by battle, Has a built-in pop when the opponent targets a Cyber Angel.  Cyber Angel Idaten - Lets me give all my Ritual monsters an extra 1000 in stats when tributed.  Incarnated Machine Angel - Makes all my Cyber Angels unable to be destroyed by battle, and lets me Ritual Summon whenever I take damage.  Machine Angel Ritual - My only Ritual Spell and helps protect my Cyber Angel from card effect destruction.  Merciful Machine Angel - Lets me draw 2 cards by tributing a Cyber Angel Ritual monster.  I've may make edits after doing some more testing but if you feel I did something differently feel free to comment below."

It means we cannot use Lonfire or Rescue Rabbit, but we still have 10 Loci anyway (3 Loci, 3 Unexpected Dai, 3 Painful Choice, 1 One for One). Brave Token engine also uses 2 main monster zones, so the combo is tailored to only use the remaining zones. Watch the combo in the video down below, all we need is <strong>Loci+discard</strong> and to make it Nibiru proof we need 1 Brave Token starters (3 Aramesia, 3 Aquamancer, 1 Foolish Burial).  PS: Rose Lover is there to make the combo keep flowing since Mardel is a garnet (garnet = can't combo if drawn)"

It’s pretty standard for the most part, so I'll explain some of my card choices. The reason i don't play miracle rupture and revival golem and all that is because my luck is bad, and i'll take a more consistent deck over a free level 4 every once in a while any day. You can, as always, play whatever hand traps and side deck that you want. 1x Re-cover - This is a level one tuner that can be summoned easily with Crystron Halqifibrax. Use it to summon Naturia Beast which is pretty broken. Its recurrence effect isn't bad, you can use it to link climb to Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess if you need to 3x Pot of Avarice - Pretty much lets you draw two mid combo, and I nearly always activate it when I draw it. You don't really need cards to stay in your graveyard with this deck, just keep Prank-Kids Dropsies there 3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - My favorite hand trap 3x Infinite Impermanence - My second favorite hand trap (better than effect veiler, fight me) 1x Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity - A zexal that you can summon on your opponent’s turn pretty easily. All you need to end on is Crystron Halqifibrax, a level 2 Adamancipator, and Borreload Savage Dragon. Just make sure it doesn’t miss timing 1x Formula Synchron - You can summon this with Crystron Halqifibrax on your opponent’s turn, and then synchro summon Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity. It also gives you a draw 1x Borrelsword Dragon - Good for otk’s, which this deck struggles a bit with. Pretty easy to summon, too 1x Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior - Dragoon removal, pretty much 1x Naturia Barkion - It's in the side deck, but this card destroys trap decks. You can summon it by using Naturia Beast and Re-cover, making use of its recurrence effect I hope you enjoy!"

This deck can also otk as well as blow up lots of your opponents pieces very quickly  This deck was inspired by a list that felt really weak but was still fun to play, this just adds some more combos and possibilities.  Main combo  Turn 1:link climb to link 4 with the twins, pass (if you used exceed make the elephant first). On opponents turn (preferably at their end step), use the link 4's effect to split into the twin links, getting a destroy and draw in the process. Move to your turn, play a monster (any hand trap will do), link into unicorn with 1 of the link 2s and the monster (preferably the one that draws), spin an opponents card if you want, use the other link's effect to special summon the one you linked off back. Use the Unicorn and the link who was not used to special summon yet into unchained, using the effect of the other link on the field to bring back the link 2 from the grave (if you chose the one that pops on enter, you will get an additional pop with unchained). use the 2 links to go into the link 4. Battle phase, attack with the 2 link 4s, use the quick effect to split into 2 link 2s, attack for game.  In the span of your opponents turn to yours, you get 3 pops, 2 draws, 1 spin, not counting any other plays you might do.  Dragoon is in here for support going first if you dont want to leave your board without a negate."

The main searcher is gazelle, he can send spinny, jaguar, mole, falco, foxy, etc... to the gy, and then you can trigger its effect on the gy, reviving it with will or monster reborn, or if it is a spell/trap you can add it with wolf. The searchers are lady debug, foxy, cynet mining, circle and sunlight wolf. The extra summon cards from the hand are salamangreat mole, bison, mathmech addition, fowl, gazelle and spinny, the summoner cards are monster reborn, will, miragestallio, and splash mage. The main distruptions are pyro phoenix, rage, ash and roar. If you watched closely you probably seen that splash mage is a WATER attribute so he can't be material for the other salamangreats BUT due to its revival effect you can easely got the violet chimera materials (and also you can use it for accesscode(and yeah, jammer is here for accesscode too)). Cuz this is a ""fun"" deck i tried to not use abusive strategies like putting also 3 copies of imper or mystic mine, apollousa or 3 roars, i just put ash blossom cause ""huh, it's a distruption card that is fire attribute"", if you are gonna go serious with salamangreat i don't sugest this deck. You can put any suggestions for the deck in the coments."

This time, however, the boss monster is <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Endless_Decay"">Endless Decay</a>. This guy takes half of your opponent's current life points as its ATK points, but even better, it can be Special and Normal Summoned with relative ease. For example, here's some plays you can do:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Discard Mezuki and Endless Decay from an opponent's Hand Destruction, then use Mezuki's effect to Special Summon Endless Decay, activating his ability</span></li>  	<li><span>Special Summon Endless Decay from the GY with Book of Life or Monster Reborn</span></li>  	<li><span>Special Summon from the Deck with Pyramid Turtle's ability </span></li>  	<li><span>Special Summon with Call of the Mummy</span></li>  	<li><span>Normal Summon with <strong>just one tribute</strong></span></li>  	<li><span>...and more!</span></li> </ul> <span>This deck includes some dead draw cards like Mage Power and Axe of Despair, but in all honesty I don't tend to brick with this deck. You consistently get Endless Decay out without much of a hitch. Even if you have an opponent with backrow destruction, it doesn't really matter. Mezuki and Pyramid Turtle do just fine. </span>  <span><strong>Get Endless Decay out as soon as possible, best if they have 8000 LP.</strong> Since it takes half of your opponent's LP as its ATK, you really need to rush Endless Decay. It isn't too much of a problem, but still- there have been times when I didn't have a solid win condition because I couldn't get it out fast enough.</span>  <span>I sideboarded Nobleman of Crossout because it was a decent enough card to keep but not always the best draw to have and Hand Destruction for the discard and draw 2. Twin Twisters would probably be better than MST, but for the sake of Zombie Madness I wanted to keep it as close to the original deck (and as close to the original <em>idea</em></span><span> of the deck- getting huge beatsticks for massive damage) as possible.</span>  <span>The Extra Deck could use some work, but for now it works.

(I got inspired by the brave tokken prank kids list which won an 52 player event and went 8-0.)</span>  <span>This version of d-link uses the ""Brave Tokken"" archetype which gets released in the Grand Creators as a 1 card omni negate engine. </span>  <span>You basically use the Aquamancer to get ""Rite of Aramesia"", which will give you an ""Brave Tokken"" and the countinous Spell ""Jpurney of Destiny"", this will search the ""Wandering Gryphon Rider"" and if you summon a monster you can add the ""Dracoback the Dragon Steed"" to your hand. </span>  <span>This are basically a free omni negate and a free discard which also can chain block. Gryphons summon is a quick effect, so you can actually activate something like chaos space and chain gryphon to it. And Dracoback has a gy effect which triggers if it gets discarded, let's say by a dragon ravine, so you can discard it for ravine and send absorouter and then you can chain block the absorouter. This allows d-link to play even better through handtraps and the only downsides are that you can't activate the on field effects of a normal summoned monster (Seyvert and Chamber) and you only have 3 monster zones you can play with, which sounds like a good pay off to me. And you can play around the first restriction by just using stuff like world legacy guardragon or pisty to get the normal summoned monsters back. </span>  <span>Oh and there is even more, you can actually use the tokken as synchro/link material, so if you need one you can just use the tokken (which is a level 4 btw).</span>"

This isn't even Zefra, it's just a bunch of crutches that can carry the rest of this useless deck to a win.  Your main opener is a Halqifibrax combo: Keep in mind that Zefraxi turns any 'Zefra' monster on board into a tuner if it's Pendulum Summoned. <ol>  	<li>Get a monster and a tuner on board, and only those 2 monsters. Resist the urge to pendulum summon everything out of hand. If you're desperate, the handtraps are tuners.</li>  	<li>Summon <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax</strong>, activate its trigger effect to summon <strong>Deskbot 001</strong> from deck.</li>  	<li>Link for <strong>Mecha-Phantom Beast Auroradon</strong>, summon 3 tokens, then summon 001 from GY.</li>  	<li>Using a token and 001, summon <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong>.</li>  	<li>Using Auroradon's 2nd effect, tribute 2 tokens to summon <strong>Mecha-Phantom Beast Coltwing</strong>. Coltwing effect for 2 tokens, and summon 001 from GY again.</li>  	<li>001 and token to summon <strong>Cupid Pitch</strong>, choose to <span><strong>increase</strong></span> level.</li>  	<li>Level 5 Cupid Pitch and token for <strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong>, equip Halq. Use Cupid Pitch's effect to search <strong>Hop Ear Squadron</strong>.</li> </ol> During your Opponent's turn, you can use Hop Ear in order to Synchro Summon for <strong>Metaphys Horus</strong> for an additional negate. Keep in mind that Metaphys Horus' negate is an on-summon trigger, <strong>so it will not go on the same chain.</strong>  In the case that 001 is negated by either Ghost Belle or Skull Meister after Auroradon summons 3 tokens, <strong>you can either</strong>: use Auroradon to tribute 2 tokens and summon Coltwing, and summon the 001. From here, you make Cupid Pitch and do the standard combo to make a Borrelsavage. Then, you can use the Hop Ear you searched to summon <strong>Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys</strong> at the start of your Opponent's MP1 using Hop Ear and Coltwing.  <strong>OR</strong>: Choose to reduce the level of Cupid Pitch, and then synchro summon Ravenous Crocodragon with 3 materials to draw 2 cards. Then use Hop Ear to make Horus during Opponent's turn.  The above combo described actually has absolutely <strong>NOTHING</strong> to do with Zefra. It is deadup a generic Halqifibrax combo. You can probably use it in anything you damn well please.  <span><strong>Some questionable decisions</strong>: </span>  <strong>Fusion Destiny</strong>: The new Destroy Phoenix Enforcer is one hell of a crutch. Alternatively, you can run the Dragoon + Verte package, which is still more potent than D.P.E., but people are more prone to immediately scoop upon Dragoon than Phoenix Enforcer.  <strong>Nekroz of Unicore</strong>: This card is literally a brick in 90% of situations. It is a free search off Herald of Arc Light if the Halq combo goes through, but in all honesty, it is best to remove it. Of all the games I have played where Unicore ended up in hand, it ended up as discard fodder every single time.  <strong>Crossout Designator</strong>: Halq combo immediately dies to handtraps. Less so to Ghost Belle and Meister, but definitely gets rolled by Ash, Imperm, Veiler, Nibiru and Gamma. The random mash of handtraps can come in handy going 2nd too, the ratios are yours to screw around with.  <strong>Zefra Metaltron</strong>: He is only here because he's the Zefra link and he looks cool. There is probably something better to run than this horrible thing.  <strong>Actual Zefra Stuff.</strong>  Your best card in the deck is <strong>Zefraniu, Secret of the Yang Zing</strong>. He quite literally searches your entire deck on Pendulum Summon or destruction while in a monster zone. If you can't go into any crazy combo, and can only summon a Zefrainu, the move is to search <strong>Nine Pillars of the Yang Zing </strong>off Zefraniu. This allows you to search another card during your Opponent's turn when Nine Pillars destroys Zefraniu. From there, you can set up for next turn, or search for <strong>Zefra War</strong>, which activates from hand if you have 2 Zefras on scale. If possible, destroy your Field Spell with Zefra War. If you have <strong>Zefra Providence</strong> in your GY, then feel free to target your own scale and protect it if you don't have the field spell. Or just straight up blow up your scale if you're that desperate.  <strong>Zefraath</strong> is exclusively a scale. His effect is <em><strong>dogshit useless</strong></em>. He tributes your ENTIRE BOARD from the E/D, so he summons himself into the Extra Monster Zone. If you haven't noticed yet, that renders his second effect to allow a second Pendulum Summon that turn entirely null and void. Yeah. Master Rule 4 has not been kind to Pendulums. If it's any consolation, Zefraath is probably your best scale, and you always want Zefraath on one of the scales.  Yeah, that's about it. If you have any advice, please do tell.
