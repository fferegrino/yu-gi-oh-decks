Making use of various engines, Orcusts just refuse to die even after Harp Horror's ban. With 3 Dark Armed Dragon, I've taken one of the most infamous decks of all time and modernized it with the Orcust Engine to revive Tele-DAD.

Magicians' Souls also is definitely the new Brilliant Fusion when combined with Apprentice Illusion Magician, except even less of a brick due to how safe it is to run multiples of Apprentice. Combining this Engine with Krebons &amp; Emergency Teleport allows the deck to have a lot of options and can power through several negates while having enough of their own to disrupt the opponent whether going first or second.

This is going off of the April 2020 banlist as well."

Starting with the big stuff. Eldlich the Golden Lord is central to the deck, a great combo starter in its own right, sometimes an extender in its own right. It's also decent interaction in its own right. Even though it's searchable it is an obvious 3 of that you want to see in your hand. This is also your main boss monster. His ability to summon other zombies from the hand is sometimes key to really extending your combos with Gozuki, and his ability to send your own cards to the graveyard is similarly useful. The protection can be useful with Balerdroch sometimes. With 2 of these you can go into Superdreadnought Railcannons for easy OTKs, and with Guardian of the Golden Land that's an easy OTK against a single attack position monster.

2 of Doomking Balerdroch. He's amazing and central to the deck, serving as your main lines of interaction and best boss monster, and you do want 2 copies, but since it is so very easy to get him onto the field in this deck 2 copies will serve you well. His downside is that he requires running a Zombie world package, but there's a whole lot of upside and Zombie world is easy enough to search in this deck. With Guardian of the Golden Land you can make Dingirsu with these.

3 Uni-Zombie are your main starter. Often your best hands are more spells and traps than monsters, but this card helps mitigate hands with high monster counts. Being a level 3 tuner that can easily turn into a level 4 tuner is also highly relevant. This is basically a better Dark Grepher for Zombies, so it seems worth all 3. This makes Rank 4s, Rank 5s, Level 8 Synchros, it is a very versatile card that helps you access your extra deck. It also helps make Needlefibre.

3 Shiranui Solitaire gives us extra copies of Uni-Zombie. That's basically it, sometimes you can also search Glow-Up Bloom, but generally you want Uni-Zombie.

1 Gozuki is a little weird. I see people trying Mezuki as an extender, and the nice part of that is that it is relatively easy to get Mezuki in the bin and get the value off of it. Gozuki is an extender you want to see in your hand, however, and combos nicely with Golden Lord to get an extra zombie in the GY in exchange for protection and stats.

1 Necroworld Banshee is essential, since we're running Zombie World. Space is tight, but I could be convinced 2 of these is correct for more security in the grind game. 3 was good, but I had too many cards I wanted.

1 Glow-Up Bloom is enough. The card helps facilitate both your beaters, and is good without Zombie World and insane with it. Sometimes its weirdly actually better without Zombie World for the Golden Lord. A zombie specific better Glow-Up Bulb? I can see the appeal of modern Zombies.

Then we have a couple of ""utility"" zombies we can search easily off of our main Eldlixirs. Vampire Fraulein is mediocre as a hand trap, but being able to use its effect on the field off of Eldlixirs seems good enough. Additionally, you need level 5 zombie monsters to make Level 7 Synchros with off of Needlefibre - this way any search for a Golden Land or Eldlixir spell should meet the requirement.

Jack-O-Bolan is theoretically a decent value engine, and could be pretty good if you put your opponent's beater in the bin with Zombie World out. It's actually here as a form of spell-speed 2 interaction, since if you have Zombie World you can resurrect your opponent's combo pieces from the GY to deny them access to them. Not an amazing card, but the deck needed another zombie that could form an extra line of interaction off of an Eldlixir, and this was the best bet.

We're a little light on creatures and devoid of hand traps. This is because a lot of the deck's interaction comes from Trap Monsters with effects when they activate. ) 0 Ash Blossom might strike some as wrong, given that the card is a zombie monster, but I'd rather run more Golden Land traps, which double as combo pieces and from lines of interaction, than run Ash, who while reliable and powerful, doesn't actually do much for the deck, despite being a Zombie Tuner. Could be wrong, it's hard to argue that it's a mistake to run Ash pretty much ever. We do have 3 Called By The Grave, just so that our Uni-Zombie goes off, as well as being a line of interaction and helping summon the Golden Lord (if under less than ideal situations).

The black Eldlixir is pretty good on the face of it. The deck needs its Eldich cards, and the card is searchable. But surprisingly, you often want to be using your Eldlixirs on your opponent's turn anyways, so you don't end up seeing this card too often. Still, it's a 1 card starter that summons from the deck on a spell, so I'm running 3 of them. The white Eldlixir, the quickplay one, is actually often more valuable, despite seeming more limited. This deck has good grind game. 2 of them still seems enough, especially since they're searchable.

3 Cursed El Dorlando are obvious. The card searches for Eldlich and gives you a good target to send to the GY with it, and can add 1 card to your hand per turn, which is crazy good. You can't search this card, and it might get cut in game 2 for SB tech because some of those cards might be more impactful when you do see them in a given matchup, but this is a crazy starter.

2 Zombie World is enough. The deck can put the searcher in the bin or on the field very easily, and 2 should cover you for a given game. Very essential to have 2 I think.

1 Super Poly goes with the Zombie World package. You can also use Verta Anaconda to pull this out of the deck, and discarding a card is often an upside in this deck. There are more in the side for where they are good.

The Traps are in some ways a part of the deck. The Red Eldlixir, the Philosopher's Stone, is the best of them all by far, and the added redundancy helps keep the deck's engine humming. Like the other Eldlixirs, you can banish this from the gy to set a Golden Land card.

Conquistador of the Golden Land is a clear 3 of. Searching for an Eldlixir card in the end phase by banishing it keeps the deck rolling in resources, and the ability to destroy monsters is key. This is simultaneously interaction and a combo piece. It's brother, Huaquero, is a D.D. Crow on a trap. Not quite as good as a Called by the Grave in terms of interaction, but it's also a trap monster and a combo pieces. The weakest of these is guardian, but it might be key to some OTKs and its searchable, so 1 of makes sense. The last Golden Land card is the Everglorious Golden Land, a counter-trap that Omni-negates but requires a tribute. It's a searchable countertrap that omni-negates so it has to make the cut as at least a 1 of. I could be persuaded 2 of these is correct, the card is just solid.

Side Deck is a bunch of options to bring in going second to break boards, as well as the Adelantado which seems good in grindier matchups, and a Mystic Mine package. Mystic Mine is cool here, since you can get rid of it by searching zombie world. This is just a pile of cards that will win you games going second against creatures/spellw and traps, and then Adelantado.

You could run Pot of Extravagence, and it is hard to argue that it would be wrong, but I just didn't like how Extravagence felt in the deck. I like running a bunch of situational 1 ofs in the extra deck rather than piling in multiples of the stuff I need to see. 2 cards is great, but you need access to a bunch of stuff for different situations. I guess you could consider Magicians' Souls, since there are synergies there. But I don't know, the card is good, but I feel overrated without those synergies. They're believable here, since your want your spells/traps in the GY, but personally I like running them alongside Spellcaster Synergies in decks that want cards in the GY rather than running them as just generic draw support. They meet 1 of those requirements, but not both.

EDIT* Testing Performapal Popperup. Synergies seem high in this deck, actually, like a Magicians' Souls without the bricks. Also trying a single Ghost Ogre, to get an extra interaction off of Needlefibre. Reasonable, since if you see it it's a valuable hand trap.

So far, Popperup ranges from hand neutral to a +5 depending on your hands, and provides reasonable fixing even in the low end. It is easy to lose 3000-4000 life points off of it, which might mean taking them out if you're worried about going to time. I love the +5 hands enough to take the hand neutral ones, but you could be excused for running Extravagance instead. I think Popperup is better than Magicians' Souls in the deck by far however. The more I test with it the better it feels. Ranging from being an Upstart Goblin to a +5 is a pretty sweet consistency boost.

Dropping Dingirsu for Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand. There are a few reasons - it gives me one more monster negate, it protects monsters from more kinds of effects, and most importantly, you can detach one material at any time to get your Doomking back in the graveyard.

Cut Jack-O-Bolan. He's good, but space is tight, and Fraulein is more essential to make Zombie Necro.

Added Instant Fusion with just Millennium-Eyes, as a 4th way to protect against Ash."

It relies on the several special summons that the variety of HERO monsters can engage into, the wide variety of fusion monsters the HERO archetype has to offer and all the necessary support in the correct ratio that allow the deck to perform the combos. The main floodgate this deck offers are Masked HERO Dark Law. Masked HERO Dark Law can keep the opponent from attempting GY plays, while Destiny HERO Plasma is the response to any on field monster effect, the ladder being sided due to being a brick sometimes. This deck can rely on many individual special summons, which makes the summoning of Destiny HERO Plasma a lot more easier. Once summoned, Destiny HERO Plasma can also absorb any 1 monster on the field, which by negating all monster effect on the field, it results in a guaranteed to get passed all in build protection that the monster may have and easily perform the steal. The link monster Xtra HERO Dread Decimator and the honest-like effect that Elemental HERO Honest Neos are used to give attack increase to flood gate monsters Destiny HERO Plasma and Masked HERO Dark Law and prevent that any monster can run over the low attack values that they individually have. Additionally, Elemental HERO Sunrise, which on summon gives you access to miracle fusion, can give 1 in-battle protection to any 1 HERO monster being attacked except itself, by destroying any 1 card on the field during battle phase, between battle step and before damage calculation. By using Miracle Fusion Elemental Hero Absolute can act as a Raigeki on your opponent's turn. I truly believe that this deck can perform well and achieve competitive results without going into big expenses, and now that mr5 in in play, it gains full potential in a fusion, syncro and xyz spamming metagame. Most importantly hope it brings fun to anyone who wants to try this out."

The best thing to do is to try and get Madonna in the pendulum zone ASAP through Hyper Director, Extras, or just drawing her. Try and save Madonna's pendulum effect until you're sure you need it because it locks you out of summoning any non-main deck Abyss Actor cards (Which means you can't even bring out Hyper Director). The Abyss Scripts all have quite the overpowered second effect but are difficult to get working, but there are two ways this deck can trigger them. First you must understand that to activate the second effects of all of the Abyss Scripts they must be destroyed, while set, by an opponents effect, while you have an Abyss Actor face-up in the extra deck. All of that sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through but there are two ways like I said.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>First the most obvious way is to use the field spell which changes the first monster effect during your opponents turn to: (Destroy one set spell or trap your opponent controls) so I recommend using Extras monster effect to tribute itself or go into Hyper Director and use his effect to fill the Extra quota, then use the Madonna that Extras or Hyper Director searched to build a high scale and summon one monster setting yourself up for at least 1 Abyss Script second effect trigger.</li>
 	<li>Second is a bit more....interesting, and it is also my preferred method. For this method you need your opponent to have 1 monster on board and have 2 Comic Relief available, one to summon and one to use its pendulum effect. Comic Relief has the unique monster effect of destroying 1 set Abyss Script when his control is shifted but if he is switched to the opponents side to activate this then it counts as an opponents card, fulfilling most of the requirements. For the last requirement to trigger the Spells (have a face-up Abyss Actor in the Extra) we must look to our second Comic Relief in the pendulum zone who has the effect of tributing himself (which sends him to the Extra deck) to switch control of one of your monsters and an opponents. Just like that, you took a preferably big monster from your opponent, gave him a 1000 attack monster, and if you had a set Abyss Script its effect was triggered.</li>

The new Dino deck after the April 2020 banlist is here. Although dino hasn't been touched at all, but it still need a little bit modification to fit the new format. Because mr5 allow us to ss synchro, xyz, fusion,...in the Main mons zone, so it's necessary to add some more xyz into the deck. But the combo doesn't change a lot. This deck can go either first or second. For the going second style, we have <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>. For the going first style, we have these combos.

Combo 1: <a data-name=""Babycerasaurus"">Babycerasaurus</a> + <a data-name=""Dragonic Diagram"">Dragonic Diagram</a>

Firstly, use Diagram to destroy Baby, add <a data-name=""True King Lithosagym, the Disaster"">True King Lithosagym, the Disaster</a>; Baby effect triggers, ss <a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a>, add Baby2, normal Baby2, use oviraptor to destroy Baby2 and ss Baby1 from the GY, Baby2 effect triggers, ss <a data-name=""Petiteranodon"">Petiteranodon</a> , use True King Disaster to destroy Baby and Petiter , ss itself and ban 3 cards from your opponent's extra deck, Baby and Petiter effects trigger, ss <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a> and <a data-name=""Giant Rex"">Giant Rex</a>, use 4 mons to link out Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess; use Miscellaneousaurus effect to ban 4 cards from the GY include Giant Rex and ss Miscellaneousaurus2, Giant Rex effect triggers, ss itself. Now u can summon 1 of the rank 4 xyz depent on what u see in your opponent extra deck, to do that correctly, u must know a lot of deck strategies. So this combo has at least 5 negates

Combo 2: <a data-name=""Lost World"">Lost World</a> + <a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a> + <a data-name=""True King Lithosagym, the Disaster"">True King Lithosagym, the Disaster</a>

Firstly, activate Lost world, normal Oviraptor, send miscellaneousaurus summon a token, use oviraptor to destroy the token and use Lost world to protect it by destroying Baby from the deck, Baby effect trigger, ss another Baby, use miscellan to ban itself and baby to ss the third baby, ss True King disaster by destroying 2 baby, ss giant rex and miscellan, use disaster and giant rex to ss I:P, now u can summon a xyz mons depent on what u see in your opponent extra deck. This combo has 2 negates

After that, in your next turn, u can use miscellan to ban 4 dino include Giant rex and ss another oviraptor, send <a data-name=""Overtex Qoatlus"">Overtex Qoatlus </a>to the GY, add <a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a>, ss <a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a>, Giant rex effect trigger and ss itself. U can easily OTK your opponent with this combo.

Dino is still a very strong deck in 2020 and its very easy to play. It can terminate many decks that only play 1 copy of a card in the extra deck with True King disaster, OTK easily with Ultimate Conductor Tyranno.

It ended up kinda cool. It's a fun deck not based on one big boring combo.,"<span>Hello! I'm Nightingale! I am but a simple bird getting back into Yu-Gi-Oh! And ever since I got back I've only had one thing in mind, making this deck work:</span>

&nbsp;

<span><strong>I. </strong>Purpose</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span>This deck doesn't follow normal combo conventions, at least that's not how i use it. Instead of having one big combo, you have multiple small combos. For example: if you have ""Red Resonator""+ ""Foolish Burial"" + Any other Level 2 tuner, you can consistently end on a board of ""Knightmare Unicorn""+ ""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane""</span></li>
 	<li><span>If your board has at least 1 HRDA Monster, you can pretty easily get another one, ""Return of the Dragon Lords"" works well for this if you used Scarlight to reach Bane. If not, I recommend Synchro-ing into ""Red Rising Dragon"" since he can summon another tuner. What all of this leads to is the effect of ""Galactic Spyral Dragon"" to summon himself and lead to either ""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"" or ""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"". Which you use is up to your better judgement regarding your situation.</span></li>
</ul>
<span>From what you can see, this deck is not really competitive, or at least not now. Having an empty hand with this card is death. However this is really fun to play and experiment, just don't expect many OTK's. The two examples above are just the most used of the many small combos. Currently I'll keep working on it until I reach a definitive Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Deck.</span>"

Think again. Consider your Main Deck nothing more than an engine, your Extra Deck is where it's at. <strong>Now get your game on!</strong></span>

&nbsp;

<span>For your Field Spells: If you're lacking Monsters on your opening hand go for Adamantia Raputite to ensure your Tuners summon the right Monster. Otherwise you want Starlight Junktion out to further interrupt your opponent during their turn.</span>

<span>Like a regular Adamantia Deck, during your turn you're trying to get your Rock-Type Monsters our on the field. Then go into Crystron Halqifibrax, get a Tuner out and go into your first Synchro. Ideally you start with Adamantia Rise - Raptite to Special Summon another Monster.</span>

<span>Then during their turn you Chain Halqifibrax when your opponent plays/sets a card. Synchros you want to bring out:</span>

<span>If you have Adamantia Rise - Raptite out on the field: Go into Crystron Quandax to Summon a Level 10 Synchro (Satellite Warrior for removal) or go into Formula Synchron to Summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon for interruption.</span>

<span>If you set an Artifact Monster in your S/T Zone: Go into T.G. Wonder Magician, pop your Artifact and then go into White Aura Bihamut to lock your opponent out of their Extra Deck.</span>

<span>If you have Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon and Adamantia Rise - Raptite out...well there ain't much more to do wrong from there, just point and click to your hearts content.</span>

<span>Obviously other combinations work out, too, depending on the game state. These are just the most basic.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Since Adamantia can Summon Monsters fairly easy you can go into combos again on your subsequent turns. Adjust Hand Traps, Disrupts and Artifacts as needed from your Side Deck.</span>

Usual Seyfert/Boot Sector Launch combo into Romulus and Guardragons but with a twist!

Use Dragon Shrine on Background Dragon to unbrick your hand, on Router to fix your hand, or on Spiral if you want to go into something else with Elpy.

At any point, make Queen Dragun Djinn and reborn Absorouter or Noctovision if you need it.

Brotaur's discard one card condition/World Chalice Guardragon's normal monster reborn didn't really work for me.

Needlefiber too inconsistent in this deck, not enough tuners. I found that the combos work better without Black Metal Dragon."

Gain advantage with continued destruction.,"The most simplest of strategies, go second and blow-up the field! And keep blowing it up!

In addition to that, Fire Kings, in the beginning of a game at least, is reliant upon the normal summon (at least your traditional builds). The deck will eventually be able to spit out special summoned monsters after the first turn, but it needs set up. This is why this is not a ""go first deck"" most of the time. There are some ""go-first"" cards, but first turn openings are sub-par. This is why I have tinkered with the deck through the years, adding Fire Fist-Leopard (to search Fire Formations), a Fire Formation Tensu (extra normal summon), and Caninetaur (dump a monster in the graveyard). Now with the addition of Gizmek Yata,  you are able to get an additional normal summon, plus a monster card in the graveyard for a special summon (note the restriction on the special summoned monster due to Gizmek Yata's effect).

I also included Naglfar, Generaider Boss of Fire into this build as a way to control the destruction ability of the High Avatar Garunix, plus give a level of protection against battle and card effects that you don't want to hamper your board (either through your opponents effects of your own). This in effect allows you to control your side of the field in a more pin-pointed way, and not just rely on blowing up the filed over and over. Which is still so fun! Plus, Naglfar is a level 9 beater that can be used with Agnimazud to bring out True King of all Calamities from you extra deck.

Please note than I am still trying to figure out the right ratios with these inclusions. Plus I would like to add some draw power to the deck, but not with Supply Squad seeing it can be a huge dead draw (personal experience)."

This sets up the Avian lockdown by getting Thunderbird on the field with Carrier's effect, and summoning Avian through Ninjitsu art of transformation.

Your main goal is to get two Hanzos in the grave before you use Getsuga the Shogun, so you can search two Twilight Ninja Jogen to make Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon, to protect against monster attacks, and summoning Apollusa for the wind target of Union Carrier.

There are multiple setups to work with, such as using yellow ninja as a target for carrier, since he's a wind attribute.

There are still some classic combo with <a data-name=""Ahrima, The Wicked  Warden"">Ahrima, The Wicked  Warden</a> and <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord of The Lair</a>. The Danger! monster are here to help get rid of some annoying monsters and Spells/Traps. Or you can special summon them and make a rank 8 XYZ with the classic Galaxy-eyes package.

To protect your field spell, you can summon <a data-name=""Beat cop from The Underworld"">Beat cop from The Underworld</a> using link spider and another token.

The card advantage is quite hard to maintain sometimes so two copies of <a data-name=""Recurring Nightmare"">Recurring Nightmare</a> can be useful.

If you don't need Nibiru, you can still discard him to the Graveyard (there are plenty of card effect for that in the deck) since it's a light Attribute target for <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>.

I'm playing one copy of <a data-name=""Fantastic Striborg"">Fantastic Striborg</a> because since it bounce to your hand the tributed mosnter. You cans for exemple send back to your hand Danger! Bigfoot!, summon Striborg. Then discard Bigfoot to bounce back to your opponant hand one or two cards on his field, then destroy a third with bigfoot's effect.

In the future, I'm planning to replace striborg with <a data-name=""Archnemesis Eschatos"">Archnemesis Eschatos</a> (available in eternity code ) since it  can be searched with <a data-name=""the melody of awakening Dragon"">the melody of awakening Dragon</a> and have  a quite interesting effect in my opinion.

The only traps I'm playing are the <a data-name=""Eradicator Epidemic Virus"">Eradicator Epidemic Virus</a> since it can be quite effective against lot of decks like Shadoll, ... and if you tribute your own monster you'll be able to summon Diabolos.  I wouldn't recommend playing others virus card because there are too specific.

The side deck is built in order to go first with a more classic play style, using <a data-name=""Lilith, Lady of Lament"">Lilith, Lady of Lament</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Sanctum"">Artifact Sanctum</a>, ..."

Uria/Armityle/Dimension Fusion are really just there for personal flavour and the deck would probably be a lot better if they were cut. The Scorpio/Cobra package does make Army more consistent because the fusion spell is then more searchable without sacrificing looking for your more important cards and then they can be used to summon Verte - Dragun. BUT i'm not overly sure I like them in (Scorpio/Cobra not Verte/Dragun) so they can probably be cut in favour of cards that actually do something.

Triples of Beckoning, Chaos Summoning and Spirit Gates because the search is just brilliant. I like 2 Sky Fires and Awakenings just so there's more chance of you getting them and not losing them to Desires, also nice to have extras incase they get destroyed.

2 Fallen Paradise, super easy to search it out and it provides brilliant prot/draw power. Could probably take it to 3 if you want but I think 2 is plenty. 2 Summoning beast, it's the weaker of the summoning cards but by no means useless.

Upstart, double Allure and double Desires because you love drawing cards in this deck, gotta get a hold of those summoners as quick as you can. Double Ash and Crackdown just because. I think the deck is fine going over 40 cards because there's so much draw, and almost all the cards are searchers so having that bit of extra protection cards in the mix I feel helps out without diluting the deck.

Blackwings are back and are perfect for MR5,"<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H45My867Vwg</a>

Once you have a full board, your opponent won't even be able to play at all. It's also very consistent and you'll almost always have the necessary cards. Basically for the infinite negate combo, you just need to be able to summon at least 3 blackwings if you have black whirlwind out OR 4 blackwings at once if you don't have black whirlwind. But even if you won't be able to make the full board, you can still summon out Simorgh using Crystron and the tuner that it summons out. At the end phase, summon out Avian using Simorgh's effect.

Have fun spamming out monsters and overwhelming your opponent."

<strong>Going First: </strong>

<em>(2 card starting hand: Quick Launch + Rakea/Aruha/Prison)</em>

Quick Launch to summon Tracer, link Tracer for Striker, add Boot Sector, normal any Unchained Twin, Striker destroy the Twin, add Tracer back, Twin to summon Sarama, Boot Sector summon Tracer, Sarama set back Twin, destroy Boot Sector, Tracer destroy Sarama, special any LV 4 Rokket, Sarama special Disaster or Abominable, link Striker and Disaster/Abominable for Rage,  synchro the 2 Rokkets for Savage Dragon.

<em>Your field is now: Rage, Facedown monster and Savage Dragon. </em>

I know, pretty wussy savage with 1 negate. but this is done with just the 2 cards. if you use other cards in your hand, you can get savage on 2-3 counter, and an Unchained Abomination on field. If you dont get access to rokkets in your starting hand, you can always make a Rage to superpoly thier field, and set a few traps.

<strong>Warning:</strong> Do <span><strong>NOT</strong> </span>use Rakea or Aruhas effect on field or in hand. You will be locked to Fiend monsters.

NOTE: yes Twin Twister would be a better option than mst."

This sets up the Avian lockdown by getting thunderbird on the field with Carrier's effect, and summoning Avian through Ninjitsu art of transformation.

Your main goal is to get two hanzos in the grave before you use Getsuga the Shogun, so you can search two Twilight Ninja Jogen to make Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon, to protect against monster attacks, and summoning Apollusa for the wind target of Union Carrier.

There are multiple setups to work with, such as using yellow ninja as a target for carrier, since he's a wind attribute.

With alpha searching berserkion then linking them all off and finishing with berserkion affect wrecking your opponents defense to easily OTK your opponent.

now I will explain every card and why I use it.

<span>Monsters</span>

<a data-name=""Adamancipator Analyzer"">Adamancipator Analyzer</a>  this card is super useful when going second because you pretty much get two free monsters for linking off or taking a synchro without using the normal summons. It is a very nice building block to get to the boss monsters for the deck.

<span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Seeker"">Adamancipator Seeker</a></span>  this card I only play one copy of because the only time I use it if I do not draw into it is for <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> to take out then synchro summon or link it off. Another little bonus for this card if you used Crystron Halqifibrax to get seeker out then you can use sign if it's in the GY to take it back out and use sign's affect to place any non tuner rock on the top then summon it with seeker's affect it is weirdly common to use this combo.

<span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Researcher"">Adamancipator Researcher</a><a data-name=""Adamatia Researcher""> </a></span> this card is super easy to bring out and does a lot for creating your board. because of its affect you can bring it out pretty much every time since basically every monster is rock then get another summon to keep expanding your board.

<span><a data-name=""Alpha the Electromagnet Warrior"">Alpha the Electromagnet Warrior</a>  </span>this card is essential to the deck because if summoned you can search berserkion which sets you up for success. Also, using its second affect lets you get more cards in the GY and on the field. (all electromagnet warriors have this affect)

<span><a data-name=""Beta the Electromagnet Warrior"">Beta the Electromagnet Warrior</a> </span> this card lets you search any magnet warrior from your deck this is useful to get the missing pieces for berserkion or just maximizing your board. Also as mentioned above its second affect

<span><a data-name=""Gamma the Electromagnet Warrior"">Gamma the Electromagnet Warrior</a>  <span>this card lets you bring out another magnet warrior warrior from your hand if it is summoned to keep expanding your board and bringing link materials or synchro materials. Also, the second affect mentioned above. </span></span>

<span><a data-name=""Delta the magnet warrior"">Delta the magnet warrior</a>  <span>this is the only original form of the magnet warriors that I play. this is another monster that gets all the pieces ready to bring berserkion out by sending one to the GY when summoned. when it is sent to the GY, you can banish 3 magnet warriors from your GY to summon Valkyrion the magna warrior from your hand or deck. which really sets up the OTK.</span></span>

<span><a data-name=""Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior"">Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior</a>  <span>this is the boss monster for the electromagnet warrior archetype. To summon berserkion you need to banish the electromagnet forms of alpha, beta, and gamma from your hand, field, or GY. Berserkions affect lets you destroy one card your opponent controls by banishing one magnet warrior from your GY. And for the icing on top, if it is destroyed by your opponent, you can special Summon the cards you banished to summon berserkion.</span></span>

<span><a data-name=""Valkyrion the magna warrior"">Valkyrion the magna warrior</a></span>  the only reason I play this card is for Delta to use its affect to special summon this and since it has 3500 attack it can blast some of your opponents monsters very easily or defend you well with a wopping 3,850 defense.

<span><a data-name=""Gorgonic Gargoyle"">Gorgonic Gargoyle</a> <span>this card is essentially a free summon since the only card you will summon will be rock type. Also it is level three like the electromagnet warriors to synchro summon consistently.</span></span>

<span><a data-name=""Sentry Soldier of Stone"">Sentry Soldier of Stone</a>  <span>this card lets you special summon itself when it is in the GY if all cards you control are rock type. This card is easy to summon and easy to link off or use as synchro material to farther build your board.</span></span>

<span><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> <span>this card is really useful to trash the opponents field and replace it with a token while taking out another monster. Another reason I play this card is because it is rock type which lets you do even more with it.</span></span>

<span>Spells</span>

<span><a data-name=""Adamancipator sign"">Adamancipator sign</a> <span>this card lets you summon a rock monster from your GY and if it is an adamancipator monster you can place one rock monster on the top of your deck then summon it with the Analyzer, seeker, or researcher you just pulled out of the GY. Another option with this card is to just get a magnet warrior out to keep building your board. </span></span>

<span><a data-name=""Foolish burial"">Foolish burial</a> <span>there are two ways I use this card one way is to send the missing piece of the berserkion to the GY, or my favorite one to send Sentry Soldier of Stone to the GY for essentially a free summon to link off or use a material for a synchro summon and I can use this affect every turn to repeatedly get extra materials out.</span></span>

<span><a data-name=""Magnetic Field"">Magnetic Field</a> <span>magnetic field lets you special summon a magnet warrior from the GY if you have a level 4 or lower rock monster on the field. Also if an earth rock type monster battled a monster and it was not destroyed you can return it to the hand which is super easy to wreck the opponents board</span></span>

<span><a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> <span>basically negates an ash or droll or banishes something like gizmek or banishes a monster that would be special summoned from the GY. Called by the Grave is very diverse allowing you to do many things with it.</span></span>

<span><a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> <span>destroys two of your opponents spell and traps by discarding one card. This card is used to clear the opponents spell and trap zone or nock of their best spells/traps.</span></span>

<span>Trap</span>

<span><a data-name=""magnet conversion"">magnet conversion</a></span> <span>allows you to target up to three magnet warriors in your GY and add them to your hand and if it is in the GY you can banish it and summon one of you banished monsters. this card is useful to recover monsters before they are banished or simply add cards to your hand to increase card advantage.</span>

<span>Extra Deck</span>

<span><a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a> <span>in my opinion this card is one of the most underrated cards, why play  <a data-name=""Crystal wing synchro dragon"">Crystal wing synchro dragon</a> when Draco Berserker of the Tenyi exists it's just better. This card is usually brought out by analyzer and delta or seeker/researcher and 2L3's. This card can absolutely devastate the opponent first when their boss monster activates its affect just banish it with Draco berserker and for its second affect keep devastating there field with its attacking capability.</span></span>

<span><a data-name=""Black Rose moonlight dragon"">Black Rose moonlight dragon</a> <span>this card is really useful if you are playing a deck with tons of high level monsters because you can keep putting them back in your opponents hand or extra deck.</span></span>

<span><a data-name=""Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"">Clear Wing Synchro Dragon</a></span> this card is basically Black Rose moonlight dragon that sends the level 5 or higher monster to the GY instead of the hand but also gets an attack boost.

<a data-name=""&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;F.A. Dawn Dragster&lt;/span&gt;""><span>F.A. Dawn Dragster</span></a> <span>this card is able to destroy 3 of your opponents spell and traps while negating them but it does get weaker every time you use this affect. It is very useful against a stall deck if you can bring it out.</span>

<span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Rise- Raptite"">Adamancipator Rise- Raptite</a></span> this card is here for the rare case you have seeker/researcher and Delta but if you can summon it it's a wonderful way to build your board.

<span><a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a></span> this card lets you negate a spell by sending the top two cards of your deck to the GY. This card is a must when playing pendulum decks. It also gets cards in your GY to use for summoning berserkion or just to re-summon.

<span><a data-name=""Apollousa Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa Bow of the Goddess</a> this card lets you negate an opponents monster affect by decreasing its attack by 800. If monster affects are getting in the way you should summon this to clear a few of them away.</span>

<span><a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> this is the go to OTK card with its insane ability to inflict damage and destroy monsters this is a very nice way to end combos by tributing the electromagnet warriors then banishing them to take berserkion out to finish the play.</span>

<span><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> this is a very easy card to take out then taking out a seeker with it to just keep synchro summoning. I really recommend summoning this card before any synchro summons just to increase capability.</a></span>

<span><a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> this is like borrelsword without the attacking capabilities but abilities to help all other monsters you control and bring out more. I tend to use this card in the beginning of combos unlike borrelsword which is for the end.</span>

<span>Notes</span>

I am still a tween (10-12 years old) so there may be some glaring grammer errors.

Depending on your hand, you can summon him during your first turn, or your second turn.

Once it is on the field, I'm not saying that's an instant win but your opponent will have trouble dealing with it since it can't be targeted or destroyed by effect, and every turn, you can destroy up to 3 card on the field (monsters and/or spell/trap).

A basic combo is to use dragon shrine,then send to the graveyard a <a data-name=""Blue-eyes White Dragon"">Blue-eyes White Dragon</a> then <a data-name=""The White Stone of Ancients"">The White Stone of Ancients</a>. At the end of your turn, special summon <a data-name=""Deep of Blue-eyes"">Deep of Blue-eyes</a>. With his effect, add 1 polymerization to your hand, then depending on your other card a <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a><a data-name=""Blue-eyes White Dragon"">. If you already have another blue-eyes monster in your hand, on your second turn, use the second effect of </a><a data-name=""The White Stone of Ancients"">The White Stone of Ancients</a><a data-name=""The White Stone of Ancients""> to send back to your hand </a><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a><a data-name=""The White Stone of Ancients"">. Then summon your boss Monster.
</a>

There are other combo which allows you to summon it on  your first turn or summon two copies but it depend too much of your starting hand.

For example, if you have a <a data-name=""Dragon's Mirror"">Dragon's Mirror</a> or <a data-name=""The Melody of Awakening Dragon"">The Melody of Awakening Dragon</a>."

1. You go second

2. Break their bord with Superpoly/Evenly/Dark Ruler

3. Search whatever you need with your impcantations as well as Manju/Gale Dogra/Preparation of Rites; Little Nekroz engine boosts consistency even more (Brio and Claus are also Ritual Spells to make Candoll/Bookstone work), Summoning Unicore with Kaleido gives you another search on top.

4. Flood the field with the big boys, Unicore and Amorphactor are Master Rule 5 ready like no other cards

5. Zaborg just for sh*ts and giggles

6. Use observatory to recycle talsimandra so you can draw 2 after you're done searching (so you dont draw into blue-eyes white D. or candoll/talismandra that only work when they are in your deck; yes Im looking at you Pot of Extravagance)

7. Enjoy"

The basic starter is to get 3 Warrior monsters on the field (min. 1 Lv4). It doesn't really matter if you get them in the beginning out or mid-way in the combo. <strong>Just keep in mind you have to get 3 monsters out, not more!</strong> Otherwise you will brick with missing MMZ spots for the full combo.

An example for a starting hand and how to play:
<p class=""engine-dark-box"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots, Vision HERO Vyon, Jet Synchron, Photon Thrasher, Junk Forward.</p>

<ol>
 	<li>Special Summon (hereafter referred to as <strong><em>SS</em></strong>) <strong>Photon Thrasher</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Either Normal Summon <strong>The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots </strong>or <strong>Vision HERO Vyon </strong>+ activate Vyon's Effect and send <strong>Destiny HERO - Malicious</strong> to the GY.
<ol>
 	<li> If you summoned <strong>The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots </strong>link into <strong>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</strong>. Afterwards activate <strong>PK</strong>'s effect and search <strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine.</strong> Set and activate the Trap.</li>
 	<li>If you summoned <strong>Vision HERO Vyon</strong>, activate <strong>Destiny HERO - Malicious </strong>effect and SS another copy, then Link <strong>with Malicious</strong> into <strong>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights.</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Link summoned <strong>Isolde:</strong> Use her effect and add to your hand any card that isn't necessary for the combo e.g. <strong>Blue Mountain Butterspy. </strong></li>
 	<li>Activate <strong>Isolde</strong>'s effect and send 4 Equip Spells to the GY: <strong>Cursed Bamboo Sword </strong>and <strong>Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade must go to the GY</strong>. Broken Bamboo Sword must stay in the Deck if not already in the Hand. SS <strong>Armageddon Knight </strong>or <strong>Dark Grepher</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Activate the effect of the SS monster (discard Blue Mountain Butterspy if using Dark Grepher) and send <strong>Summoner Monk</strong> to the GY (if your opening hand started with Armageddon and Dark Grepher try to get a Summoner Monk into the GY e.g. Link into Isolde with 2 other monsters, search 1 Destiny Hero - Malicious - SS Dark Grepher - send Armageddon from Hand and Summoner Monk from Deck to GY.).</li>
 	<li>XYZ summon <strong>Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Activate Number 60's effect and SS <strong>Summoner Monk</strong>.
<ol>
 	<li>Activate <strong>Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade </strong>and banish any 2 monsters if missing a Spell Card to discard for <strong>SM</strong>'s effect.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Activate <strong>SM</strong>'s effect: SS <strong>Rescue Ferret</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Link Number 60, Isolde and SM into <strong>Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians </strong>(for visual imagination into the left EMZ).</li>
 	<li>Activate <strong>Rescue Ferret's </strong>effect: SS <strong>Jet Synchron, Doppelwarrior, Red Rose Dragon</strong> into Selene's linked MMZ.</li>
 	<li>Synchro Red RoseDragon and Doppelwarrior into <strong>Garden Rose Maiden </strong>(for advanced we do it according to MR4; into linked MMZ)</li>
 	<li>Activate the effect's of following: Garden Rose Maiden, Red Rose Dragon and Doppelwarrior.
<ol>
 	<li>CL3: Summon 2 Doppel-Tokens into any MMZ.</li>
 	<li>CL2: SS <strong>White Rose Dragon</strong> + add Frozen Rose to your hand.</li>
 	<li>CL1: Add Black Garden to your hand.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Synchro Jet Synchron and White Rose Dragon into <strong>Assault Blackwing - Sohaya the Rain Storm</strong>. (<strong>Attention:</strong> don't activate Jet Synchron's effect that is triggered if send to the GY.)</li>
 	<li>Activate <strong>Jet Synchron </strong>from the GY and SS it. If possible discard a monster, if you have no monster discard Frozen Rose or first activate Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade to discard it, <strong>do not banish Doppelwarrior.</strong> <strong>Do not discard Black Garden</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Synchro Jet Synchron and 1 Doppel-Token into <strong>Puralis, the Purple Pyrotile</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Synchro Puralis, the Purple Pyrotile, Assault Blackwing - Sohaya the Rain Storm and Garden Rose Maiden into <strong>Cosmic Blazar Dragon </strong>(or any other of the 2 Lv12 Synchro Dragons). For visualizing you should have now Selene in the left EZM, Cosmic in the first from left (next to Field Spell) and 1 Doppel-Token in MMZ 4 or 5.</li>
 	<li><strong>Puralis, the Purple Pyrotile</strong>'s effect activate's.</li>
 	<li>Activate <strong>Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</strong>'s effect and SS <strong>Summoner Monk </strong>into a linked MMZ.</li>
 	<li>Activate <strong>SM</strong>'s effect (discard Frozen Rose or Divine Sword, <strong>do not banish Doppelwarrior, </strong><strong>do not discard Black Garden</strong>) and SS <strong>Rescue Cat.</strong></li>

 	<li>Synchro The Fabled Catsith and 1 Doppel-Token into <strong>Celestial Double Star Shaman.</strong></li>
 	<li>Activate Celestial Double Star Shaman's effect and SS Doppelwarrior from the GY into MMZ 4 or 5.</li>
 	<li>Synchro Celestial Double Star Shaman and 2 Assault Blackwing - Sohaya the Rain Storm into <strong>Shooting Quasar Dragon </strong>(linked MMZ 2).</li>
 	<li>Activate <strong>Black Garden</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Activate <strong>Garden Rose Maiden</strong>'s effect from the GY and SS <strong>Red Rose Dragon </strong>into the linked MMZ 3.

</li>
 	<li>Activate <strong>Black Garden</strong>'s effect; target <strong>Puralis, the Purple Pyrotile </strong>in the GY to SS itself into MMZ 4 or 5.
<ol>
 	<li>If playing online: I have encountered bugs that activating Black Gardens effect will not resolve right and just destroy the Token and nothing else happens. If this ever happen to you online just do Step #29 and retry it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Synchro Red Rose Dragon and Doppelwarrior into <strong>Ally of Justice Catastor.</strong></li>
 	<li>Activate <strong>Assault Blackwing - Sohaya the Rain Storm</strong>'s effect from the GY; banish 1 copy and SS the 2nd copy.</li>

Also if paired right with extra deck and spell and trap very meta. ,"Contrary to belief Fur Hire decks are a good deck to GO FIRST.

I know, I know, that’s sounds crazy. The strategy to this, is to combo on the 3rd turn. Due to fur hire effects they can all special summon each other among other effects and if you can keep your normal summon for a tuner monster, then you can build more negates and control the board better.

the fur hire combo is an easy combo to understand but be careful as it is easy to forget effects that you can activate because there is soooo many. The draw power is crazy and paired with skull dread it’s amazing.

summon a monster activate its effect and special summon another and continue the cycle until you can’t summon more or you reach the amount you wish to have based on the combo you want. I suggest always leaving a zone open because if you draw a tuner then you have a zone, otherwise you might brick. Dark ruler no more is a great card to prevent negates from stopping your combo.

It’s also very important to watch what attributes you summon as to link summon Folgo, you must have 3 different attributes and plan which monster you need to effect wise to continue the combo. Example: if your goal is to special summon dompa with Folgos effect and the special summon destroying a card on the field activating folgo’s drawing effect, then make sure you don’t summon a beast monster.

Rafale is also very important as it has a negate effect and I draw effect, which can continue the combo.

Soul levy is easily one of the most underated cards that recently came out. For every monster your opponent special summons they send 3 cards to the grave yard. Imagine going against a Shaddoll deck, Lightsworn deck or a pendulum deck and just destroying their deck in one turn. Because when cards in their deck are sent to the graveyard they special summon. In a meta game that lasts 2-4 turns swarming and surviving a turn but destroying your opponents deck can be very beneficial.

This is really just a guide, build decks that you have fun playing. Get your game on and high five the sky."

The only monster you you normal summon is mostly Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands or if you have to keep setting you also can use those monsters.

This used to be meta and I want it to come back to meta so I tried to make this deck and I hope you like it and use it.

enjoy :) .

Below I'll justify some of my choices

-Bujinki Ahashima: as long as you aren't restricted to beast types only, you can go into this and get a rank 2 (usally merfae of the forest) and then get to pop backrow when you use forest's effect to search

-Closed Forest: the only decent beast oriented field spell; prevents mystic mine, zombie world, lair of darkness from being activated and screwing you over (because if they do get on the field you are screwed)

-Spirtial forest:a good back up card, since a lot of your cards have low attack and you won't always be able to return a merfae to the hand

-super rush recklessly:basically lets you return a card to the deck for free if hide and seek is on the field, and then you can either return the target to the hand, or absorb it into mammy

-rapid red rushing hare: can special summon itself in an empty column, but is effect to destroy itself if something is place in the same column doesn't work if hide and seek is on the field. Can be used for going into leo, missus radius, and daruma doll

-the naturias:beast is an obvious choice, but you might have to go a little out of your way to summon him. Barkion is there just for exterio, and to give valfawn some use. I feel like if you get the right amount of resources you can try and summon Exterio traditionally.

-miracle synchro fusion draws a card if destoryed so it can be used for baiting backrow destuction. You could replace one of the copies with waking the dragon instead."

This particular build is more designed for going second and stealing the opponent's monsters with Red Baron/Zombie Necronize, but do know that this deck struggles to play through most interruptions so you may find going first to be preferable depending on the opposing deck. Most plays involve milling a Vampire Retainer/Familiar, using it to get a search, and tribute summoning/reviving stuff until you have enough to make Links, Xyzs, or just smack into the opponent for big damage. There's not a whole lot going on here, just mill as much as you can and get as many bodies on the field as possible to steal back some precious life points. If you want to up the power level of the deck some, the Zombie World support synergizes well with this deck and 1x Doomking Balerdroch, 2x Necroworld Banshee, +1 Glow-up Bloom and 2-3x Zombie World allow you to make some pretty strong boards when going first as compared to this going-second build."

Combo #3: Destroys atleast 3 trap/spell cards and gives you a nice amount of firepower.
Combo #4: Destroys 2 trap/spell cards, 1 set card, 2 any card on your enemy's field. Destroys a total of 5 cards your opponent controls.
Combo #5: A weak combo which can return most of your opponent's cards to the hand by discarding your own hand.
Combo #6: Destroys 2 trap/spell cards,  1 set card, 2 unbeatable boss monsters, and almost clear the enemy's field.
Combo #7: Nukes your opponent's field (use it against altergeist decks, sky strikers, subterrors)
Combo #8: Banishes 1 face-up monster, destroys 1 monster/spell/trap,  and destroys another monster.
Combo #9: Destroys a boss monster, and deals good damage.
Combo #10: Destroys enemy cards then ends the game dealing 10000+ damage to your enemy.

Tips:
Armageddon Knight/Dark Grepher targets: Orcust Knightmare, Plaguespreader Zombie, Gizmek Orochi.
Always check your graveyard and banished cards to see if you have any cards left before using Golden Castle.
Try to use l:P Masquerena when using link summon on strong monsters.
Use your side deck against annoying decks.
Be intelligent in choosing which monsters to discard."

This deck is a test; may be (and likely) it doesn't works. Furthermore, that is just for fun, there is no competitive purpose here.

Even Heart-eartH is an option if you have another true king.

Considering how it goes, i might change the yang zing paths for pot of avarice as it can cycle both bri and accel aswell, but if can't be used with the darkness of yang zing either.

""My deck is the best"" never sai (wrong)","Hello, duelists. This is the rokket link dragon deck after the 25/3 banlist. Although Destrudo is banned, the banlist doesn't affect rokket a lot. Elpy is unlimited, unlike in the OCG. So, this deck is still one of the most powerful decks in 2020. This is a going first deck with max 8 interruptions and the 2 cards combo have 5.

Requires: <a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a>, <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a>.

First, normal <a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a>, destroy itself, add <a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>, ss <a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>, link out <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a>, add <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a>, add <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a>, ss it, link out <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Romulus"">Dragunity Knight - Romulus</a>, activate <a data-name=""Dragon Ravine"">Dragon Ravine</a>, discard a card, send <a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon"">Absorouter Dragon</a> to GY, add <a data-name=""Silverrokket Dragon"">Silverrokket Dragon</a>, activate <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a>, ss <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> and <a data-name=""Silverrokket Dragon"">Silverrokket Dragon</a>, link out <a data-name=""Guardragon Elpy"">Guardragon Elpy</a> and <a data-name=""Guardragon Pisty"">Guardragon Pisty</a>, use Elpy to ss <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a>, ss Striker Dragon, destroy Darkness Metal Dragon, add Silverrokket Dragon , use Pisty to ss Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, ss Rokket Tracer, use Striker, Pisty, Elpy, Tracer to ss <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon</a>, destroy Dillingerous Dragon, discard Silverrokket and ss 2 rokket from your GY, Dillingerous Dragon gonna trigger its effect and ss itself, use Romulus and Quadborrel to ss <a data-name=""Unchained Abomination"">Unchained Abomination</a>, use Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, Dillingerous, Silverrokket to ss <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>, use Tracer to destroy Boot Sector Launch and ss <a data-name=""Magnarokket Dragon"">Magnarokket Dragon</a>, use Magnarokket and Tracer to ss Borreload Savage Dragon. And thats the end of the combo with 5 interruptions.

There are so much more different combos u can do with this deck. Like when u use Elpy, u can ss Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms or when u send a dragon to the GY, u can send <a data-name=""Keeper of the Shrine"">Keeper of the Shrine </a>if u already have Silverrokket, use Tracer to destroy Silverrokket instead of Boot Sector, and ss Keeper back...

Link for the 8 interruptions combo: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H-ndfp0AMk&amp;t=279s</a>

Thanks for reading my work"
