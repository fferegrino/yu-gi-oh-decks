Why is this? Simply put it that both companies are notorious at not only unoriginality and rehashing the same thing over and over; but also milking their same ideas to the point where the drops become crust instead of gold. While over the years we had some interesting occurrences from Ligthsworns to even Dogmatika; the fact that everything Dinosaurs touch becomes repetitive after awhile shows the reality with modern Yu-Gi-Oh and how Dinosaurs (as a whole archetype) symbolize corporate greed and how out of touch card design has it's consequences on it's own. That being said, the reason I went with the scrap variant was because it was the most recent to top at a YCS event with being at the Las-Vegas invitational back in February (with it finishing in the top 32 overall). Also while not directly aspired from this top 32 finished, I did concept some ideas for the sake of at least trying to find something new for Dinosaurs to try instead of repeatingly slapping the same gimmicks as hard as HEROs had the past few years.  With the DPE package being the mainstay for most of Yu-Gi-Oh and the epicenter of the current fuss in the TCG (besides the Adventurer Package); I had decided to go with <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> and <a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a> to either negate the effect before it happens, or to prevent it from repeating itself by stopping the special summong from the Graveyard. Another goody added in here is the Psy-Frame package: which includes Gamma + Driver, and <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Lambda"">PSY-Framelord Lambda</a> (a link-2 monster that allows you to activate psy-frame gear monsters from the hand whether you control a monster or not). The side deck featuring cards like <a data-name=""Token Collector"">Token Collector</a> and <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>are all checks and balances against decks like Phantom Knights, SwordSoul, and Numerous Adventurer packages running afloat. The Extra deck which hasn't really changed much aside from newest Charmer Link Monster (<a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a>), and maybe the super poly targets added in to keep Phantom Knights and other decks in checks at times. Then comes the scrap package, which features quite a mouthful to cycle from; but to put simply: you pop Scrap Raptor; Summon Chrimera off of the Raptors' Double Summon effect; Link Summon into <a data-name=""Scrap Wyvern"">Scrap Wyvern</a>, to special summon (preferably) <a data-name=""Scrap Chrimera"">Scrap Chimera</a>, to pop him to special summon <a data-name=""Scrap Raptor"">Scrap Raptor</a>, and pop one of your opponents cards. If that sounds like a waste of time that screams ""how do you do fellow kids"", then it obviously does, and Konami should feel ashamed and at least acknowledge that Dinosaurs ""felt"" more playable with or without this."

Cheap non meta but still fun to play.,"<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_U0IXjzg9M</a>  &nbsp;  This is a fun cheap Phantom Knights Deck I only made it because I already had the cards left.  If I start first I summon Dante. There are a lot of options, cockadoo, junk forward, kagemucha + any lv3 monster, silent boots with gloves or cloak.  Use Dantes effect to send 3 card from deck to gy hoping phantom cards, repeat in turn 2 if dante is still on field.  Next step summon Rusty Bardiche. Therefore you need 3 dark monster. With Dante, Armageddon and Foolish Burial at least there should be some phantom card in your gy. There are several ways: Easiest: Junk/Cockadoo/Kagemucha +Boots + cloak/gloves on hand. GY options: banish Wing, Blade or Sword to summon a knight from gy so you just need two others on hand. banish cloak to get boots on hand. If theres no trap in gy banish boots to get shade brigandine and activate instant. banish gloves to send wing to gy, activate wing to summon a knight from gy. banish fragile armor so send Wing, Blade or Sword, or a phantom knight if you have already one of them in gy. Activate Bardiche to protect yourself with blad or sword, sending to gy cloak gloves or armor  Next step summon dark requiem. Your oppenent need to have min 1 monster and 1 other card on field. Activate Bardiche send 1 lv3 knight to gy and get rank up on field. Summon Break Sword (where Bardiche points to) just like Dante OR rescue ferret (1 phantom knight and another lv3 monster), but you need two phantom knights lv 3 in gy and/or as material (you already have 1 because of bardiche). Destroy 1 card with Bardiche if he has 3 cards or more on field. Activate Break sword to destroy himself and 1 card from your oppenent, but he still needs to have 1 monster open on field. Activate Break Sowrds effect in gy and summon two lv 3 kngihts (getting lv4). Summon Dark Rebellion activates his effect even the monster from your oppenent has 0 atk. In your oppenents tunf activae rank up and summon dark requiem where bardiche points to to destroy 1 card. If you can summon Rebellion before Break Sword its fine, with break swords you can destroy 1 card which is usefull when your oppenent has a lot of cards on field.  In general: Use Leviair and Mist Claw to get back banished monsters. With twin twister send to gy what you actually need there and destroy spell traps from you or your oppenent (both can be usefull). If you dont get Dante protect yourself with a evilswarm (summon knightmare in first round is also good start). here i got Wee With and Dharc in Extradeck, beause i had them already. With them its easier to summon Bardiche. If you dont have them play the snychros and a second Cockadoo (Cockadoo+ lv 3 for coral dragon activate coral summon another card from gy than summon sky dragon) and antoher copy of dark hole and dark eruption.  I love the Legendary Hero Decks, i play nordic deck and supported them with battle of Chaos cards (thats why i have dharc). I also have a elemental/destiny hero deck but now more than the half of deck isnt from legendary hero deck anymore...  Big upgrade of the phantom deck is 3 Knights of torn scale, Burning abyss (Cir, Graff and Cherubini) but theyre ""expensive""...cheaper alternative and still good support is Wee Withc, Knightmare Phoenix and Unicorn, Physic Tracker and Wheeler + Emergency Teleport.  &nbsp;"

Lefty Driver can be used with Ursarctic Departure if you start with it in your opening hand. Righty+Lefty is a one-card Ursarctic Polari combo.  This deck uses Effect Veiler instead of Infinite Impermanence because it is a Tuner, which can help make the level 8 Synchros.  Phantazmay can help find the right Ursarctic monster, you need and puts a level 7 body on board.  Gadarla helps bypass various Barrier Statues because this deck relies a lot on Special Summoning, but you can also use Effect Veiler if you need to.  Nibiru can clear the enemy board and the token can be stolen with Ursarctic Big Dipper. It is also a Rock, so excavating it with Adamancipator Risen - Dragite can provide some removal.  If you choose to use Pot of Extravgance, then you will need to run 3 copies of all the Ursarctic Synchros."

Enjoy developing the rock combos in which can summon the big boss monsters that sto,"-Always pick to go first if able.  -Always activate special summoning effects EXCEPT for that of Granite (adding a rock monster to hand is always going to be the better move).  -Always wait to use the Adamancipator spells until you run out of gas with the monster effects.  -Don't wait to get Fossil Fusion in grave to use Miracle Rupture, just use it right away to get the grave effects of Weather Soldier or Block Dragon.  -Your targets for Foolish Burial or Miracle Rupture will usually be Weather Soldier or Block Dragon with occasionally sending Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite if you open with Adamancipator Signs.  -Your targets for Extra-Foolish Burial will always be Fossil Warrior Skull Bone or Fossil Dragon Skullgar (typically Skullgar for the free fusion summon). The ONLY exception is if you drew monster reborn, in which you would send Skullgios or Skull King for the free boss monster.  -Your targets for Granite will usually be Adamancipator Seeker or Adamancipator Researcher, but if you've already activated both their excavation effects, you can add Block Dragon.  EXTRA NOTE: Feel free to switch out Infinite Impermanence for a different handtrap like Ash Blossom or Effect Veiler. As of right now, I like Imperm the best because it can't be countered with Called by the Grave and it can't be negated by Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess."

While the deck is a bit expensive due to demanding 3 Recital Starlings as well as a lot of SR rarity cards, it's cheap enough that you can rely on opening the secret pack they come from a few times to obtain the cards necessary, and craft whatever you still need.  Nerval exists in the deck as a searchable 1-of to make going into Bird of Sovereignty much easier to do, and going into a Stormwinds and/or Dark Simorgh can end games while on top of 2 more disruptions (Utopic Future Draco and Ensemble Robin), but can be taken out by preference. The deck can go 1st or 2nd very well with some minor tweaks to the deck to make one or the other better.  The side deck options are alternatives you can try out instead of some of the options in the main deck."

Highly recommended for novice players and maths enthusiasts in general. STRATEGY : :. Summon mathmech subtraction or multiplier.  :. Use the mathmech multiplier effect on the enemy target  :. If you have mathmech addition you use its effect on the mathmech multiplier. If you have mathmech addition use its effect on the mathmech multiplier. This not only increases your attack points but also doubles the damage inflicted on the enemy. Or use subtraction to decrease the ATK points of the enemy target xD.  :. Watch your opponent surrender on the first turn :)

The deck does a good job setting a solid first turn board, searches out the pieces well and can play through an Ash without falling apart completely. The most basic opening play requiresÂ <strong>Magicians' Souls</strong> (Searchable by Illusion of Chaos and by extension Preparation of Rites) andÂ <strong>Aleister the InvokerÂ </strong>(Searchable by Magical Meltdown and by extension Terraforming)  Normal Summon Aleister and search forÂ <strong>Invocation</strong> (*If the search was hit by Ash Blossom just move on to the next part) Special Summon Magicians' Souls by sendingÂ <strong>Dark Magician Girl</strong> to the graveyard from the deck Link Summon <strong>Artemis, The Magistus Moon MaidenÂ </strong>with Magicans' Souls Link SummonÂ <strong>Predaplant Verte Anaconda</strong> with Artemis &amp; Aleister ActivateÂ <strong>Invocation</strong> and summonÂ <strong>Invoked MechabaÂ </strong>(If Aleister was hit by Ash you skip this step) Activate Verte in order to pitchÂ <strong>Red-Eyes Fusion, Dark Magician &amp; Red-Eyes Black Dragon</strong> and fusion summonÂ <strong>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</strong> Activate Invocation in the grave shuffle it back into the deck and take Aleister back to hand.  The combo nets you 2 omni negates and ends with 4 cards in hand and sets up your graveyard to draw 2 cards off of Soul Servant (which you might have opened with in which case the hand would be 5 cards) That is the main opener but there are other shorter ones, and they weave into each other to mostly always end on at least Dark Dragoon.  For the side deck. If you would rather run a standard Ash + Crossout set up simply remove the Solemn Strikes, Timaeus and Apprentice for the general package. Timaeus and Apprentice will usually be the first to be sided out for whatever you want, and I wouldn't argue with going down to 1 Eternal Soul for the 3 of whatever you need as an out generally I side in <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> if I have to go second (These can also be replaced with Droplets, but the deck already discards for the negates and I don't have any Droplets)Â  other than that the side is pretty standard backrow hate except with Dark Magic Attack cause it's a searchable Duster."

Surprisingly the new Archetype called âMagistusâ came out soon after the âSpirit Charmerâ was released in 2021. The âMagistusâ archetype had a perfect synergy for the âCharmersâ especially since they only rely on base from Attribute and Types. This deck is strong enough to be used in high Tier level on Master Duel or Tournaments(hopefully).... This build is very easy to obtain/play it and can be used for any newcomer duelist because most of the cards are actually straightforward for the combos which I already listed the key cards for anyone interested to play Charmer Deck.  Start with only using 3 simple Key Cards which is the only best I ever come out with for the Full Charmer's combos.  Just following the recommendation cards that are listed below. ___________________________________________  <strong>[Key Cards]</strong>: 3 Main Engine - <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a> - <a data-name=""Performage Damage Juggler"">Performage Damage Juggler</a> - <a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>  <strong>[Recommend]</strong>Â to Search/Use - <a data-name=""Lyna the Light Charmer"">Lyna the Light Charmer</a> (Hand) &amp; <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> (Spell/Trap Zone) - <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a> (Hand) - <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a>Â (Spell/Trap Zone) = <a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a> (Hand)  ___________________________________________  Once you finally set up your cards. You will proceed with the next step by activating â<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>â effect to send out â<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>â from your hand to the GY. Then use ""<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>"" effect to become Earth Attribute that allowed you to Summon â<a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend"">Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend</a>'' card from either hand or Deck by sending both â<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>â and â<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>â from the field to the GY, which make them to trigger of their effects by Chain Link 2 and bringing it back â<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>â from the GY to the field along with â<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>â by it own effect. Now you have finally had a chance to Summon â<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>â from either hand or Deck by its own effect. After that use â<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>â effect to search out â<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>â from your Deck then add it to your hand which is the only best Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF/Level 4/Light Attribute monster that can be able to search out by ""<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed - Dharc"">Familiar-Possessed - Dharc</a>"" effect when it Summoned by it own effect.  <strong>Reminder:</strong>Â Do not activate ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" effect during your turn when it Summoned to your field, it will disable you for summoning from the Exta Deck unless if you have too. (This is an Optional)  ___________________________________________  <strong>Tips</strong>: You might not actually get them from the opening hand with exactly cards. So I prefer you to try something else with different cards in your hand if one of the Key Cards are missing. You should better rely on your additional cards in your hand that might help you to set up your cards. Keep it in your mind that ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" is just an additional card to use Familiar-Possessed - Lyna's Effect to search out ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" from your deck to the hand.  ___________________________________________  <strong>[Additional]Â </strong>for moreÂ Consistency You can use ""<a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>"" as additional for ""<a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>"" or any Level 4 monster from your Deck like ""<a data-name=""Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre"">Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</a>"" or any Performage monster depending what card you need. Requirement: 1 any Spell card, except ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" card, if not, you can use it as well if you have too. I include â<a data-name=""Summoner Mon"">Summoner Mon</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Summoner Mon&quot;&gt;Summoner Mon&lt;/a&gt;k"">k</a>â from my Deck Profile since It actually works very well for any Level 4 monster.  ___________________________________________  The End Board got changed frequently due to lack of cards since I actually used Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon lately in the actual game which is not my original plan for this deck. So I came up with the new play style by giving you more options to play either ""<a data-name=""Number 106: Giant Hand"">Number 106: Giant Hand</a>"" or summon any link 2 like ""<a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>"" depending on any situation if you have more additional cards on your play to expand it.  I want to try something new in Master Duel with different cards that I have so it got changed especially from the Extra Deck. You can still use <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> as usual to link summon â<a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magician"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magician</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Selene, Queen of the Master Magician&quot;&gt;Selene, Queen of the Master Magician&lt;/a&gt;s"">s</a>â or ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>"" during your opponent's turn. You can also add as many hand traps you want as long the key cards had three copies for each the following Recommendation.  https://youtu.be/qWxPcD355y0  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

And with the new support this is now easier then ever. One key note is to make use of ""predator counters"" which reduce you're opponents monster level to 1 and allow more effects to happen (basically uses you're opponents resources). Although it's not crucial to utilise them it boosts the ease to make and strength of you're end board. This naturally makes the deck better going second. The ideal end board involves as many fusions as you can spit out. Mainly; dragostapelia, triphyoveryutum and predator fusion dragon. I do however run a neos package, this summons rainbow neos which can remove all you're opponents monsters or backrow without destruction or targeting, which helps enable OTKs. And as a plus rainbow dark dragon can be summoned with this deck if you happen to open up with it, but this rarely happens. You could equally use DPE or dragoon. This build is a more ""pure"" ish build although I do recommend checking out ""Branded Predaplants"" which is a better version of the deck."

Excellent support for the archetype included <em>Machina Citadel</em>, which functions as a quick effect board wipe of all your opponentâs monsters which is a very potent form of interruption. <em>Machina Overdrive</em> enables a circular resource loop between the banished pile, GY, deck and hand, while <em>Machina Redeployment</em> greatly increased the consistency of the deck. Newer support from main sets like <em>Unclaspare (R4NK enabler, free special summon and foolish burial)</em> and <em>Ruinforce (4600ATK beatstick and banish recursion) </em>have also greatly increased the power for this archetype.  The resulting support turns Machina from an archetype that was a jumbled mess into a compact powerful fighting force that can succeed in a grind game. Together with high impact staple trap cards and crippling floodgates, Machina functions as an anti-meta deck versus the combo-heavy meta! Control the game, simplify the game-state, then OTK your opponent in one fell swoop with your high ATK Machina army!  <a>If you want to see the deck in action, feel free to watch my Youtube video!</a> <p><span><strong>ARCHETYPES AND RATIOS</strong></span></p> The <strong>MACHINA</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 17 cards:  <em>1 </em><em>Ruinforce, 2 Citadel, 2 Fortress, 1 Metalcruncher, 3 Gearframe, 2 Unclaspare, 3 Redeployment and 3 Overdrive</em><em>. </em>Â This set of cards form the core of the deck, and once the cards in rotation, the monsters should rotate between the hand, field, GY and banished pile.  The <strong>HIGH IMPACT TRAP</strong>S in the Main Deck consist of 9 cards:  <em>3 Paleozoic Dinomischus, 3 Torrential Tribute and 3 Solemn Strike</em>. These trap cards are called âhigh impactâ since they all can profoundly change the duel with their immense power. These cards are the most interchangeable cards between the sidedeck and maindeck.  The <strong>FLOODGATE TRAP</strong>S in the Main Deck consist of 9 cards:  <em>3 Gozen Match, 3 Rivalry of Warlords and 3 Skill Drain</em>. All these âfloodgateâ traps hamper or even completely stop your opponentâs ability to make plays, while at the same time allowing the Machina pilot to pop off. Be careful when using these cards, floodgates may stop your own gameplay as well!  The <strong>CONSISTENCY</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 8 cards:  <em>3 Pot of Extravagance, 3 Urgent Schedule, 1 Foolish Burial and 1 Super Express Bullet Train</em>. Pot of Extravagance may as well be a Pot of Greed since the Extra Deck isnât needed much, giving the pilot a solid +1 for little cost. Urgent Schedule (With its main target being Bullet Train for extra resources) definitely gets your gameplan rolling as well, enabling a variety of plays with 2 free bodies on board.  The <strong>Extra Deck</strong> cards in this deck are mostly fodder for Pot of Extravagance and arenât used much, but they still have some utility. It can be used for niche scenarios, field removal and to Machina on the field to the GY. Zeus also can be easily made with 2-4 matierials to wipe the field. It consists of:  <em>1 Zeus, 2 Liebe, 1 Super Dora, 1 Gustav, 1 Drill Driver Vespenato, 2 Gear Gigant X, 1 Heavy Armored Train Ironwolf, 1 Accesscode, 1 Knightmare Unicorn, </em><em>1 Knightmare Phoenix, 1 Dharc, 1 Qliphort Genius and 1 Double Headed Anger Knuckle. </em>  The <strong>Side Deck</strong> features cards that hard-counter popular strategies that are bad match-ups for Machina Control. It was made with Eldlich and Virtual World in mind. Â It consists of:  <em>3 Artifact Lancea</em><em>. 3 Droll and Lockbird, 1 Harpieâs Feather Duster, 2 Twin Twisters, 3 Evenly Matched and 3 Solemn Judgment.</em> <p><span><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></p> The simple bread-and-butter âcomboâ this deck has involves normal summoning Machina Gearframe. It represents a âROTAâ and a âFoolish Burialâ jump-starting your entire strategy while obtaining follow-up for the next turn. <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Gearframe. Search Unclaspare.</li>  	<li>Unclaspare summons itself when searched (locking you into machines), and on summon, sends a Machina from deck to GY.</li>  	<li>With Unclaspareâs on-summon effect, send the Machina of your choice (Citadel is usually the target, since itâs the deckâs main win condition).</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Gear Gigant X with Gearframe + Unclaspare. Detach material to search for another Gearframe from deck for next turn follow-up.</li> </ol> The cool thing about this deck is that it doesnât feature long and complicated combos, since itâs mostly a âset 4 -&gt; passâ style of deck, making it simple to use! Even if this combo is interrupted, there are multiple ways to get Machina in the GY from deck with Foolish Burial, Urgent Schedule, and Machina Overdrive. Besides, youâre in no rush, since floodgates should bring your opponentâs plays to a standstill giving you plenty of time to set up.  The entire premise of this deck is to control your opponent with backrow, then beat them down with stronger monsters in a simplified gamestate. Remember to use every backrow to its full potential, using them at the most opportune time to stop an opponent. Even if your opponent destroys your Machina, they all have floating effects that occur in the GY.  <em>Fortress</em> destroys a card on the field when it is destroyed by battle and can handrip a card from the opponentâs hand if targeted by monster effect. <em>Citadel</em> summons itself from the GY when an earth machine is destroyed and can wipe the field by destroying your own machine â furthering your plays! <em>Ruinforce</em> can summon itself multiple times a turn given there is machines in the GY for it to banish and is an absolute POWERHOUSE during the battle phase.  If your opponent doesnât outright surrender to the floodgates and Machina recursion, the duel tends to develop into a caveman style âunga-bungaâ beatdown. If youâre a Yugiboomer like me who likes a simplified gamestate without much combo where all you do is destroy monsters by battle, Machina Control is the deck for you! <p><span><strong>THE ART OF FLOODGATES</strong></span></p> Hey Machina Pilot, you cannot just flip over floodgates rashly, here are a few tips to maximize pain on your opponent with floodgates! <ul>  	<li>Most Meta combo decks straight up lose when any one of the floodgates are flipped over. Protect your floodgates, and theyâll protect you!</li>  	<li>Monster reliant decks like Drytron, Tribrigade and Adamancipator die to <em>Skill Drain</em>.</li>  	<li>Multi-attribute decks like Virtual World, Flundereeze, Swordsoul and Dragon Link flop to <em>Gozen Match</em>.</li>  	<li>Multi-type decks and engines like Adventurer, Shaddoll-Invoked, Prank Kids and Sky Striker struggle vs. <em>Rivalry of Warlords</em>.</li>  	<li>Many decks use <em>Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</em>. To prevent this guy from coming back during standby phase, flip over <em>Gozen/Rivalry</em> during the draw phase.</li>  	<li>Many decks use the Adventurer engine. To prevent the engine from being used, chain <em>Gozen/Rivalry</em> to Rite of Aramesir. The player would be locked into the tokenâs type and attribute which are Fairy/Earth.</li>  	<li>Many decks use <em>Predaplant Verte Anaconda</em>. When the fusion danger noodle is summoned, chain Gozen/Rivalry to prevent the Dragoon or DPE from coming out!</li>  	<li>When an opponent reaches a part of their combo that doesnât match their archetypeâs type/attribute, flip over Gozen/Rivalry. For example, when Virtual World/Adamancipator/Swordsoul summons Halqifibrax, Gozen/Rivalry would lock them from summoning any other monster!</li>  	<li>Careful when using Gozen Match, it will lock out the earth/dark portions of your Machina Deck. It is better to be locked under Earth than Dark, since the Earth attribute offers more options for the Machina Pilot.</li>  	<li>When using Skill Drain, try to already have Ruinforce, Citadel, and Fortress in rotation in the GY, field and hand. These all cycle around to summon each other forming a resource loop, while their effects on the field are negligible. This trio are superior in a game of beatdown, since they are relatively easy to summon and are high ATK.</li>  	<li>Decks with built-in backrow destruction like Eldlich and Virtual World are bad-match-ups for this deck. Be sure to side appropriately when facing these them!</li>  	<li>If youâre facing a lot of backrow removal, side in Solemn Judgment or Anti-Spell Fragrance to ward off those pesky Lightning Storms, Cosmic Cyclones and Twin Twisters.</li> </ul> <p><span><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></p>  <ul>  	<li>Try to force out a simplified gamestate, where a grindgame is dominant. What this deck lacks in combo potential, it makes up for it in defensive control.</li>  	<li>Since this deck can summon 2 rank 10s easily with Citadel, Ruinforce, Super Express Bullet Train and Urgent Schedule, Machina Control can make Zeus. 2 material + Rank 10 Train + Juggernaut Liebe -&gt; 4 material Zeus.</li>  	<li>This deck obviously prefers to go first. However, trap cards are surprisingly good at breaking apart established boards! Most meta boards can be broken using floodgates backed up by high impact trap cards. Bait out negates, then obliterate your opponentâs board with the appropriate card like Torrential Tribute of Gozen/Rivalry. After your opponentâs board is sufficiently softened up, thatâs when you can start using your Machina strategy.</li>  	<li>This deck can OTK in a blink of an eye, since due to the sheer offensive firepower of Ruinforce. This deck can also generate a lot of monsters with high attack on field with free special summons, while your opponent is hindered by your floodgates.</li>  	<li>Machina Control is fairly cheap as far as meta decks go. All thatâs needed is the 17 card Machina core + Trap Cards + 15 Extra Deck fodder for Extravagance. Expensive cards can be replaced by cheaper alternatives and the deck wonât lose much power.</li>  	<li>Other cards for consideration in this deck that work excellently in Machina Control are Anti-Spell Fragrance, Lord of the Heavenly Prison, Ice Dragonâs Prison, Heavy Storm Duster, Waking the Dragon and Trap Trick.</li> </ul> <p><span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span></p> Nostalgic machine archetypes always have a special place in my heart ever since Iâve had cards like Machine King, Roulette Barrel and Mechanical Chaser from my childhood. My favourite archetype, Ancient Gears also are strong with recent support, but arenât enough to reach meta status. Cyber Dragon reaches Rogue status, but only with the support of cards like Dragoon and DPE which arenât native to the archetype. I wanted a pure machine deck that could do well while staying true to its roots!  When support for Machina with Mechanized Madness and other main sets arrived, I was super excited! Seeing Machina top tournaments for the first time with pilots like <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/machina-17/"">Kyle Galliw</a> and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/earth-machine-10/"">Elias Tsirogiannis </a>using a Machina cards was inspirational, to say the least. Using their decks as a base, Iâve made my own updated version of their lists, designed to absolutely tear into the current meta!  With Machina Control, may you strangle your opponents to the Shadow Realm with your paralyzing floodgates, high impact traps and seemingly endless Army of Machines. Dictate the pace of the game, simplify the board, then beat your opponent down with your Machina!  And with that, Iâm totally bringing this deck to terrorize my next locals. &gt;:D GLHF Duelists!  <img class=""aligncenter"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/dsWFc2L.png"" alt="""" />"

Maxx ""C"" generates so much value by punishing your opponent for playing the game. On the other hand, Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring is a way of hindering your opponent while they try build their board.  Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring is also used because its able to neagte the second most played stable Maxx ""C"", which would be the most played card if only Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring didn't counter it.  In order to combat this, I replaced a mid-tier stable for a hard counter for Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and Maxx ""C"". It's called Called by the grave. The Master Duel format only allows for 2 copies per deck so I replaced the 1 copy of Infinite Impermanence with Tachyon Transmigration as running 1 copy of a hand trap isn't ideal, but running a card that is better for going first, providing a free omni-/multi-negation is better than a card that can only target monsters."

A deck focused on using Blue Eyes to summon out powerful monsters from your Extra Deck. It's not really a great d,"<p>A super common way for you to special summon cards in this deck is from the graveyard, so do not be afraid to discard cards. Depending on what you have in your hands will greatly change how you play this, but this deck is also the famous ""Brick-Eyes"" where you can get a hand first round and realize, ""If he has Ash Blossom in his hand or Solemn Judgement on the field I lose."" This deck prefers going second as it has several easy set-ups into an OTK, but also can be completely wiped by any amount of negation. When going first, you have 4 plays;</p><ol><li>Get 2 level 8 cards on the field, Summon Draglubion, use its effect to special summon Heart-eartH Dragon, attach 1 of your Numeron Dragons as material. Heart-eartH dragon cannot be destroyed by battle and any damage you would take from battles involving the card your opponent takes instead. When the opponents turn ends their entire field will be banished, which leads you to using Draglubion to summon your other Numeron Dragon, attaching anything to it as material and than attacking your opponent directly for 18,000 damage. Even if they do get rid of Heart-eartH Dragon you can still summon Numeron Dragon, which means as long as there is a card in attack position on your opponents field you probably win, so this is still a very good first turn play.</li><li>Summon Blue Eyes Spirit Dragon in defense position. It can negate a graveyard effect once per turn and if it is targeted for an effect, you can tribute it to switch into Azure Eyes or Black Rose, which will essentially negate the targeting effect and prevent all of the dragons on your field (including itself) from being targeted until the end of your next turn.</li><li>Summon Chaos Max Dragon, it has a huge attack, your opponent cannot leave defense position monsters on the field and it cannot be targeted or destroyed by card effects. This isn't a sure fire win, it isn't your best option, but it is an option.</li></ol><p>&nbsp; When going second:</p><ol><li>Get Numeron Dragon on the field along with as many XYZ monsters as you can manage.<ol><li>Try not to special summon more than 4 times if you can help it, as the rock is a threat, but if you need to than you need to</li></ol></li><li>Get Neo Blue-Eyes on the field using either Greater Polymerization or Predaplant and just beat the living hell out of your opponent. It will be able to attack 3 times, cannot be destroyed by monster effects and deals piercing damage. It's a big 4500 beatstick that can deal 13500 damage in a single round</li><li>If you're running it, get Accesscode Talker out, best to do this through link climbing. This means climbing up from Link 1 or 2, to 3 and than into Accesscode. You'll than have 2 or 3 non-targeting pops to destroy cards on the field 5300 attack monster on the field.</li></ol>"

GG","The strat is all about starting off with a baby and dragonic diagram. Use the field spell to destroy the baby and add Lithosagym to the hand. The baby will let you special summon Oviraptor which you use to bring a baby to the hand. Then normal summon the baby and use oviraptor to destroy it and special summon the other baby from the grave. Then use that other babies effect to bring out another baby to the field.  Then use Lithosagym to kill both babies and bring himself out (allowing you to banish 3 cards from the opponent's extra deck. Then since both babies were killed, use them to bring out aeolo and another level 4 dino (misc or giant rex usually) and then turn your 2 level 4's and aeolo into Trishula to banish a card from your opponents hand. Then use both level 9's to bring out true king of all calamities.  Depending on the other cards in your hand you can also potentially get out Ultimate Conductor Tyranno and a baby for further plays."
