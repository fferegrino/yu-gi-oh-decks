All thanks to Thunder Dragondark and Fusion. You know what 1 card combo, multiple disruptions (Battle Butler 2 Raigeki), super recu","Konami hates ABC, it means this will get hit sooner or later. It's even more consistent (just need 1 Prank-Kids monster), more powerful (non-target, wipes board, TWICE), and with the same recursion as ABC/Salamangreat. Heck it even fits with just only 1 Verte (more broken with 3 Verte tho, but Verte limits your ceiling at the same time).  Combo is standard, normal summon/ss random Prank-Kids (non-token tho), make Meow-Meow, use Prank-Kids gy effect ss another Prank-Kids (we need every Battle Butler material in gy/banished tho, Fansies sends other to gy, Rocksies banishes hand and draw), make Doodle-Doo, use Doodle-Doo chain Prank-Kids gy eff ss another Prank-Kids, add field spell for recursion or fusion spell to make link 4 (if we face backrow deck). If we face non-backrow-heavy deck, we can proceed to Verte, use field add Rocksies/Fansies (both are important), use Verte send Thunder Dragon Fusion by returning Battle Buttler material from banished/gy to deck, use field increasing 500 atk.  The recursion line needs Dragondark if with limited Verte, use Thunder Dragon Fusion gy eff add Dragondark, Rocksies banishes Dragondark for another Thunder Dragon Fusion, but you gotta trigger Fansies to meet Battle Butler material requirement in gy, proceed the same Prank-Kids way again and again lol.

The main deck consist of the usual HERO goodstuff plus Avian and Burstinatrix. I use two Polys since the ideal stuff is to summon both Sunriser and Grandmerge. I also included a limited Plasma and Dark Law package for when you're required to go first, but make no mistake, this is a going-second beatdown strategy. There's only one of Adusted and Dark Calling each, but I feel that's enough given how easily searchable is.  It lacks in hand traps but makes up for it with plenty of S/T removal for floodgates and Called by the Grave for opposing hand traps since what you want is to get your combo through and not necessarily stop the opponent's.  The Extra Deck is where the real meat is. Our most important card is Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer, who will fetch our vanillas. Grandmerge and Inferno Wing will be our main beatsticks, usually paired with Sunriser. Once Grandmerge destroys a monster, you will tag out to Chaos (be wary of the level restriction!!). I chose Chaos as my prefered tag-out target given his useful negate, but you could make an argument fot not really needing it at that point. To be completely honest with you, I just like Chaos. You could also summon him with Poly or Miracle (yes, you can) given the right situation.  The rest is just more HERO goodstuff: Dark Law because Dark Law, Blast for S/T, Bane for an alternative Dark Calling summon, Absolute Zero/Acid combo for board wipe, Trinity for even more damage, and the rest of the Xtras for more combo and damage.  Lastly, the Side Deck is just ""other things you can use"" rather than an actually functional Side.

The main idea of the deck is summoning as quick as possible a Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX dragon and a Blue-Eyes Chaos dragon to attack and make OTKs without worrying about possible rival responses due to the inherent protection of these monsters which makes them something really hard to deal with and with almost no response in the meta strategies as the high attack and their extremely powerfull defense (obvously due to their effect, not the defense stat which is 0 in both ritual monsters) forces your rival to go for very specific plays to remove them from the field: They cannot be destroyed by card effects... and they cannot be targeted!!!  Even though it is difficult to go through their defense, it is possible that your rival manages to get a response to the presence of these monsters on the field... However, this deck profile presents 5 cards (2 x solemn strike and 3 x The Ultimate creature of destruction). The Ultimate Creature of destruction makes a Blue-Eyes monster you control totally immune to any card effect and destruction by battle and the Solemn Strike can be used to avoid special summons that might cause you problems or monster effects that might become an incovenient such as the Borreload Dragon effect or the Topologic Zeroboros.  Last but not least, this deck profile is not limited to the main deck monsters and effects, the 3 copies of Number 97: Draglubion give you acces to all the other Number dragon monsters in the extra deck with amazing effects and strategies to look for the OTK in case that the main strategy of the deck doesn't work."

By combining the Subterror Guru stringent strategy with the obvious stringency of floodgates, you can arise the highest level of control ever imagined in the game. Playing there can be only one at 3 and Gozen Match at 2, you can lock your oponent out of all the combos and strategies that imply monsters of the same type or different atributes. Furthermore the deck is designed to adapt the strategy to the oponent's deck by removing from the main deck the floodgate which isn't useful against an archetype (i.e: Playing against slamangreat you should remove gozen match as all the Salamangreat monsters are fire type, so the card is basically a ""brick"") and introducing in the main deck nteresting cards for a control deck such as Ash Blossom, Crackdown, Super Polymerization or Skill drain. You can even introduce 2 evenly matched in case of going second, which might be a weakness of the deck if you don't control the tempo porperly.  Furthermore you play 2 copies of mystic mine (+ terraforming + set rotation) that might slow the game enough to help you to take control of the game in situations in which you don't draw the Subterror Guru (which is one of the main problems that could arise when playing this archetype).  And last, but not least, I have incorporated a card I consider hardly underrated by the competitive comunity that is Witch's Strike, with a lot of potential in a format in which the negations are so extended. If activated and resolved, you have many chances to win the duel."

Banishing? Resurrection? Locking down the board? The DM deck you never knew you needed is HERE!,"This deck centers around using Dark Magician, Eternal Soul, and Dark Magic Circle, with the purpose of banishing your opponents cards as well as other independent supplements meant to make dueling you a living hell. It dominates in casual play and, with a couple card change-ups, is also very competitive in tournament play.  <strong>Basic strategy</strong>: Eternal Soul and Dark Magical Circle are continuous traps and spells respectively. DMC allows you to look at the top 3 cards in your deck and select 1 that is Dark Magician related and add it to your hand immediately. Then you can choose the order of the other 2 cards. 2nd effect: When Dark Magician is summoned to the field, banish an opponent's card. This effect can be done multiple times per turn. Eternal Soul is your DM summoning engine. Once during either turn, you can Special Summon a DM from your hand or deck, thus activating DMC's effect. It doesn't matter if DM is destroyed, cause he'll just come back to banish. Plus ES guards your DM from any card effects.  <strong>Banishment engine support Cards</strong>: Soul Servant, Metalfoes Fusion, Magician's Rod, Foolish Burial Goods, Dark Illusion, and Card Destruction. These are all meant to either help you draw those top 3 cards, or search them directly from your deck. More details below.  <strong>Search engine</strong>: Use these cards to specifically search out DMC, ES, and/or DM directly from your deck.  Magician's Rod allows you to add any spell or trap to your hand upon Normal Summon (use to search for DMC or ES). If in the graveyard, you can tribute your Dark Magician to the graveyard to place Rod back in your hand, setting you up for another spell/trap search and DM special summon/banish combo next turn.  Soul Servant: Allows you to place any DM-related card at the top of your deck, ready for your next draw. Then, you can banish this to the GY and if you have DM on field or graveyard, draw that card. If you have both DM and DM Girl in field or graveyard, you can draw twice! Because it's a quick-play, you can basically activate this whenever you want. Use with DMC to guarantee a card you want (like ES!)  Foolish Burial Goods: Sets you up for your draw engine by sending Soul Servant, Magician Navigation, or Metalfoes Fusion from your deck to the graveyard. See draw engine section below.  Magician's Souls: Discard this from your hand to send DM directly from the deck to the GY, then special summon a DM to the field (why wait for that pesky draw?). Also use it to dump DM Girl to draw 2 cards after banishing Soul Servant.  Illusion Magic: Tribute any spellcaster from your field to search 2 DMs and add them to your hand (combo by tributing DM to bring him back for a banish later or tribute Rod so that Rod can come back to your hand for another Summon/search combo on your next turn).  <strong>Draw Engine: </strong>Another way to get your DMC, ES, and DM combo into your hand as fast as possible, if you don't have any search cards.  Soul Servant: See above. Dump DM Girl and DM into the GY, before using this, to draw 2 cards (this is literally the only reason DM Girl is in your deck).  Metalfoes: We don't care about Metalfoes fusion summoning, only its draw effect. Use Foolish Burial Goods to dump this into your GY, then you can shuffle it back into your deck and draw a card.  Card Destruction: Currently limited to 1 in official gameplay rules, but if you're playing for fun, run 3. You know the feeling of drawing a crappy hand? Any deck suffers from this from time to time. Use Card Destruction to dump it and draw a new hand (with the added bonus of putting cards like DM, DM Girl, Soul Servant, and Metalfoes into the GY). If you're an official player, run 2 Spellbook of Secrets to search Spellbook of Knowledge to draw 2 cards.  Magician's Souls: When this card is on your field, you can ditch 1 or 2 spell/trap cards from your hand or field to the GY and then draw that many cards. I don't use this affect that much, but it's there if you need it.  <strong>Additional DM support:</strong> Other cards not focused on your revival/banishment engine, but their tricks add another layer of offensive and defensive flexibility. Includes Secret Village of Spellcasters, Magician of Dark Illusions, Apprentice Illusion Magician, Palladium Oracle Mahad, Eye of Timaeus, Secrets of Dark Magic, and Magician Navigation  Secret of  Spellcasters: Lock down your opponent's board. As long as you have a spellcaster on the field, they can't use their spells.  Magician of Dark Illusions: A supplement to your standard DM. This card is great because it's name becomes DM while on the field, allowing you more DMs to use with DMC. While you can't revive it with ES, it's great for summoning directly from your hand if you activate a spell/trap on your opponents turn. Say you have DMC on the field, but no ES yet. Just activate another spell/trap during your opponents turn to bring this out from your hand and get a quick banish on them, disrupting their strategy. I can't tell you how much more flexibility this card offers you. It's even a lvl 7, which will be important later on.  Apprentice Illusion Magician and Palladium Oracle Mahad: These are the jacks of all trades! They're powerful beatsticks that are ridiculously easy to special summon from your hand and have killer effects. AIM pulls DM from deck to your hand when you summon her, and you can tribute her to give another magician an extra 2000 Atk/Def! Mahad can double his Atk points when fighting a Dark monster, and if he's destroyed, you can special summon DM from hand, deck, or grave.  Eye of Timaeus and Secrets of Dark Magic: Activate these to bring out your Fusion monsters. Easily searchable with Soul Servant or Magician's Rod. Timaeus requires you to only have 1 DM on the field (easy!) and Secrets needs you to have both Fusion materials, but they can stay in your hand instead of exposed on the field.  Magician Navigation: Great for summoning a DM straight from your hand and another from your deck (setting you up for multiple banishments or an XYZ or Fusion Summon). It's 2nd effect is arguably more useful though, allowing you to negate an opponent's spell/trap card's effect for that turn.  <strong>Additional support:</strong> Same purpose as your DM support: lockdown your opponent from countering or effectively implementing their own strategies. These allow you to be more proactive in your offense and defense: Ash Blossom, Infinite Impermanence, Solemn Judgment, and Gozen Match. Alternatives include Skill Drain, Twin Twisters, or Solemn Strike/Solemn Warning  Ash Blossom: Discard to negate a summon or search effect. Sometimes your opponent needs that one card to get their strategy going. Deny them that with this card  Infinite Imperm: Your opponent's monster effect making things hard for you? Use this to negate that effect for a turn, as well as a spell/trap effect.  Solemn Judgment: Sacrifice half your life points to activate this?!?! What?! Trust me, you'll need this. It's a counter trap, so only counter traps can counter it, so you're basically guaranteed to cancel out whatever it is your opponent is planning and destroy it. Disrupting them from summoning their trump monster or ace spell/trap is worth half your LP, cause if you don't, you'll lose a lot more than that.  Gozen Match: My personal favorite. Each player can only control 1 attribute of monsters while this card is in play. This is perfect for you because most of your monsters are Dark anyways. And against decks where multiple attributes are used, it's a nightmare. *Note: You won't be able to use certain Extra Deck monsters and Mahad if this is active on your field.  <strong>Fusion Monsters:</strong>  DM the Dragon Knight: Your biggest challenge is going to be protecting DMC and ES while they're active, because your opponent will definitely target them. This giant beatstick boasts 3000 Atk AND protects your spells and traps from any card effects. Also, it's name becomes DM on the field or GY, so it benefits from your DMC and ES combo as well!!! Summon this, and ES protects it from any card effects and it protects all your spells/traps from effects as well. The only way for your opponent to attack your field is with a monster with +3000 Atk, and even then, you can always just bring it back with ES. Broken.  The Dark Magicians: Also very useful effect, allowing you to draw 1 card for every effect activated. If it's a spell/trap, you can set it and/or activate it right then and there, depending on the type of spell or trap. And if it's destroyed, special summon DM and DM Girl from hand deck or graveyard to set off DMC's effect as revenge.  When Dragun of Red-Eyes comes out, you will also want that in your Extra Deck for sure! If you need Fusions with just raw attack power, consider Amulet Dragon, Dark Paladin, and Dark Cavalry. Their effects are more limited, but they can shine in terms of brute strength.  <strong>Xyz</strong>: Red Eyes Flare Metal Dragon, Number 11: Big Eye, and Ebon Illusion Magician. All of these are lvl 7 Xyz (and you conveniently have 6 lvl 7 monsters that can be easily put on the field at the same time. Ebon Illusion Magician is especially useful for this deck, allowing you to special summon spellcasters and have a banishing effect of its own! Your next most useful Xyz is Red-Eyes, oddly enough. It'll further lock down your opponent by inflicting 500 LP damage every time they activate a card or effect. Your opponent must choose: carry out their strategy at the expense of their LP, or save their LP at the expense of taking any action against you. Big Eye simply lets you take control of an opponents monster permanently. Ebon High Magician is also an option if you want, as well as Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack for link summoning (though this is a Wind-type)  <strong>Links: </strong>I don't really know how to use Links that much, but you can definitely include some. I'd keep DM the Dragon Knight, The DMs, Dragun of Red Eyes (when it comes out), Ebon Illusion, Red Eyes, and Big Eye as essentials.

It's been a while with a bunch of Banlist changes that greatly affected the deck for the better. Tenyi Yang Zing (TYZ) is a deck that's main focus is on card advantage. Card advantage is how TYZ is able to get a leg up on other decks and overwhelm them Non-effect monsters and synchros. The main play of the deck is to use one of the 3 one card starters (Souleating Oviraptor, Draconnet, Mathematican) to synchro summon Denglong and search Nine Pillars (Pro tip don't set backrow until you search Nine Pillars to ensure your opponent doesn't know where you set it). Then afterwords, use Denglong's effect to send a Tenyi from deck to GY (the best one to send, most of the time, is Ashuna) (BTW the level change isn't that important). Then on the opponent's turn negate something with Pillars and off of denlong being sent to GY summon Bi'an, then you revive Denlong with either Buddy Force or Back to the Front, use denlong to search Yang Zing Path (for card advantage), and when you see an opportunity use Bi'an to synchro with Denlong into Baxia and shuffle 2 cards on the opponent's field (Pro tip don't chain Bi'an to a card effect because if you do Baxia will miss timing, also Bi'an gives Baxia battle protection). That's the main bread and butter combo of the Deck that's a +2 in card advantage and gives you a way to recycle the Yang Zings (and draw 2) and puts a Tenyi in the GY. The new stuff include an unlimited copy of Vessel for the Dragon Cycle without having to add 5 extra cards to my deck to meet the trinity requirement. And because of that I cut the World Legacy package since Baxia is good enough removal and I needed space for Crystron Halqifibrax (which helps get denglong on the board even with super bricky hands). And Miscellaneousaurus is another target to send for soul just in case you already burned Carboneddon or hard drew it."

At that time, advanced format was dominated by the Nekroz Archetype, before Konami decided to enter the stage with a flood of bans, in a successful attempt to rebalance the metagame.  As time went by and game evolved, new sets were released with ever greater cards each time, ultimately leading Konami to reconsider its banlist, and set free the Nekroz top cards one after the other: Shurit … Brionac … until very recently, when <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> finally got back to three!  <strong>Now that the deck can (almost) be played at full power, I thought it would be interesting to share some knowledge on the Nekroz mechanics &amp; strategies, that may seem a bit obscure at first glance. Hence this extensive guide covering various aspects of the deck, as well as some insight on my personal build. Hope you like it.</strong>  <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/d/d6/Mat-YOT-Nekroz.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20150330032038"" width=""743"" height=""415"" alt=""image"" />  <span><strong><u>Foreword:</u></strong></span>  Nowadays, there is a widespread decklist of the Nekroz that is often featured on Youtube. I invite you to check the following link first, in order to see by yourself: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-tBsd1JpOg</a>. Admittedly, this variant is much more explosive thanks to its insane 1-card combo generating an impressive card advantage. However, despite the “hype”, and after having extensively tested both versions, I still think the Impcantation build is better. Let me briefly outline the main reasons behind this statement: <ul>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">Deskbot 0</a><a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">03</a>, the combo starter, is not searchable:</strong> if you do not draw it, you drastically decrease your chances of winning the duel because your entire build is oriented (artificially skewed) towards this particular combo, and therefore less efficient in every other scenario.</li>  	<li><strong>Tons of hard bricks:</strong> two <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a>, one <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing"">Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing</a>, and one <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> (to a lesser extent), and you still need to play with a 40-card deck if you want to open <a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">Deskbot 003</a> more often. There is a 42.71% probability to open at least one brick in your starting hand (4 bricks / proba going first / 5 cards in hand), and still a 33.76% proba if you do not count Kristya. That means at least one out of 3 starting hands, which is not negligible.</li>  	<li><strong>Destroyed by hand trap:</strong> if the combo is shut down only once, it is “end of turn”. Deskbot 003 into Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring = “GG” and I am not being sarcastic. Some will say: “yes but it is the same for any combo if stopped properly, right?”. Not quite actually, many combos rely on various extenders and can still survive a hand trap, while other can at least adapt themselves and achieve decent end boards while being disrupted. There is no such possibility in this case.</li>  	<li><b>Nibiru incoming: </b>Even though the combo includes a <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> early on (negate ability), it is still too late to avoid <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, which will not hesitate to crush your board whenever it can.</li>  	<li><strong>The deck needs to run 3x <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></strong> to protect against <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>. Should you want to have a “high” chance to go through your entire combo, you would need <a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">Deskbot 003</a> + CBG in hand (both not searchable). This leads to a probability of only 23.72% of drawing them (going first / 5 cards in hand), meaning 1 chance out of 4. Adding the proba of being Nibiru’ed, it does not fly… And you also have to take into account this combo can almost only be performed going first (would be countered otherwise) which once again reduces your chances of achieving it.</li>  	<li><strong>Conclusion: this really is a trade-off scenario:</strong> <em>are you willing to sacrifice stability for a powerful combo which will most likely win you the game if properly conducted?</em> I would say this is a high risk/high reward dilemma, but I myself would rather bet on consistency on the long run. Overall, too many flaws in my opinion that drastically decrease the real chances of going through your combo.</li> </ul> <strong><u>If you disagree, I would very much like to hear your thoughts in the comments section below!</u></strong>  <strong><em>That being said, let me guide you through the mysteries of the Nekroz…</em></strong>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>Strengths:</u></strong></span>  <strong>Unmatchable Search Engine: </strong>It is so powerful… it might even destabilize beginners who won’t know where to start! <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a>, on its own, enables you to access ANY Nekroz card, either directly, or through another layer of search thanks to <a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a>. Let’s not forget <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a>’s second ability, which can also retrieve from grave by discarding itself.  <strong>Consistent as Hell: </strong>Add the “Impcantation” package and ridiculous spells such as <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a> to the Nekroz core engine, and you get a deck thanks to which pretty much any hand can get you what you want. I really mean it, the deck is so stable (no bricks at all), you will often feel overwhelmed by the plethora of options available to you.  <strong>Absolute Power Plays:</strong> <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a> effects are game changers: Trishula will grant you a huge card advantage while Unicore’s Extra-Deck Lock will shut down most of the strategies of your opponent if not dealt with.  <strong>Highly Versatile:</strong> You can choose whether you prefer to go 1st or 2nd… and that is pure luxury! I certainly built this deck with a “going 2nd” approach in mind (even though <a data-name=""Vanity's Ruler"">Vanity's Ruler</a> is a turn 1 option), but you can aslo decide to start the duel if you feel the need to, depending on the deck you are facing. This build can clearly adapt and compete in both scenarios.  <strong>Very Resilient: </strong>So many searchers in the deck = not too difficult to sail through a sea of negates &amp; interruptions while developing your strategy “seamlessly”. Many ways to bait your opponent &amp; resolve crucial cards.  <strong>Double Trouble!</strong> Nekroz have a huge impact on board, that’s for sure. What if I told you they can be even better when kept in hand? All Nekroz come up with two effects: one that activates on the field, and the second one from hand. Nekroz of Trishula negates effects that target your other Nekroz monsters, while <a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus</a> acts like a <a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a>, ending the battle phase right after being discarded, an ability that will help you a lot to stall the game and buy some time.  <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/banned-camp/images/6/68/Brio.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20190907235634"" width=""496"" height=""496"" alt=""image"" />  <span><strong><u>Weaknesses:</u></strong></span>  <strong>Ritual Summoning Condition: </strong>Obviously, Ritual Summon is not the easiest way to summon a monster in Yu-Gi-Oh. And the restrictive conditions regarding the level of the tributes will force you to think twice before making a move. Fortunately, Impcantations are a blessing for this deck (and any other ritual-based deck) and make it much easier to summon your favorites creatures!  <strong>Search-Lock Effects: </strong>I said in the previous section that this deck worked a bit like an open bar, where you can pick any card you want with ease. However, every Nekroz player loathes cards that prevent you from searching directly from deck. <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> or <a data-name=""Mistake"">Mistake</a>, to name a few, will haunt your worst nightmares…! In the current metagame (July 2020 – MR5) dominated by Adamancipator and Eldlich, these cards are not prevalent (even in sides), so don’t worry too much.  <strong>Over-Passivity:</strong> On your opponent’s turn, you can defend yourself, but you cannot actively interrupt his/her plays with the Nekroz engine at all. You will rely on your “going 2nd” cards and hand traps to do so. You have no negates available, no removal that can be activated during his/her turn.  <strong>No Signature Trap?</strong> If you read Nekroz cards carefully, you probably noticed some of them mentioned traps in their description (such as Clausolas), but no Nekroz trap has ever been released so far. Maybe Konami thought it was not necessary considering the huge impact of the archetype on the game when it first came out. Nowadays though, almost every archetype as its negating trap, and I would be glad if Nekroz had one. Famous examples are: <a data-name=""Toon Terror"">Toon Terror</a>, <a data-name=""Salamangreat Roar"">Salamangreat Roar</a>, <a data-name=""Orcust Crescendo"">Orcust Crescendo</a> etc…  &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>Strategy:</u></strong></span>  <strong><u>Main Objective:</u></strong> <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> + <a data-name=""Vanity’s Ruler"">Vanity’s Ruler</a> on board --&gt; Prevent your opponent from special summoning + Negate all effects of monsters summoned from the Extra Deck // Trishula + Valkyrus in hand --&gt; Protection from targeting effects (Trishula Negate ability) &amp; Protection from battle (Valkyrus ends battle phase).  Most often, you will want to ritual summon <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> with <a data-name=""Nekroz Kaleidoscope"">Nekroz Kaleidoscope</a>, sending a <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> to the grave in order to add any ritual card directly from your deck to your hand. <strong>I would consider this play as the main generic move you will surely repeat over and over, against a great variety of deck, when playing Nekroz.</strong>  If your opponent does not use the Extra Deck (Monarch Archetype for instance), change of plan: obviously, you should go 2nd against such decks, BUT, if your opponent lets you start, THEN: try to XYZ <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> + <a data-name=""Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands"">Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</a> for a rank 4 play --&gt; I suggest <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a>. And make sure you end the turn with Valk in hand. Bagooska will prevent any monster effect from activating on the field, and Valk will keep your health points safe. Do not try to build any sort of “Nekroz-related” board (Brionac or Clausolas or Valkyrus or anything else on turn one), it is useless. Your powerful Nekroz are meant to be unleashed on turn 2. Protect yourself, try to stay alive one more turn, and only start building up your offensive the turn after.  <strong><u>Main Combo when Going 1st:</u></strong>  You can achieve same end board with multiple combinations. The sequencing is primordial.  <strong><a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> + <a data-name=""Impcantation Chalislime"">Impcantation Chalislime</a> + <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a> in hand</strong> <ul>  	<li>Reveal Unicore, use Chalislime effect into Talismandra effect into Cyber Angel Benten in hand</li>  	<li>Brionac discard into Clausolas discard into Kaleidoscope in hand</li>  	<li>Ritual Summon Unicore with Kaleidoscope dumping Herald to Grave</li>  	<li>Add Cycle from deck with Herald’s effect</li>  	<li>Use Cycle to revive Brionac from grave dumping Benten to grave</li>  	<li>Use Benten effect to add Vanity’s Ruler from deck to hand</li>  	<li>Normal Summon Vanity by tributing Talismandra and Brionac</li> </ul> <strong>--&gt;</strong> Preparation of Rites OR any impcantation can also provide you with a piece of the combo. Pretty much all your cards are combo pieces at this point &#x1f609;  <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/3/34/LawofLight-WC08.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110617020416"" width=""453"" height=""340"" alt=""image"" />  <strong><u>When Going 2nd:</u></strong>  Take down your opponent defenses one by one and build up your own board: <ul>  	<li>Evenly Matched &amp; Super Poly to wipe their board</li>  	<li>Summon your Boss Monster Trishula to banish exactly 3 key cards from hand, field and grave</li>  	<li>Summon Valkyrus to draw by tributing your impcantations, and refill your hand</li>  	<li>Summon Unicore to negate effects from annoying monsters</li>  	<li>Summon Brionac to shuffle back up to two monsters summoned from the Extra Deck</li>  	<li>Swing for game, you can even super poly your own Nekroz during battle phase for extra damage --&gt; Example: Super Poly Brionac &amp; Unicore for Mudragon = +1900 ATK for lethal!</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>Rationale Behind Ratios:</u></strong></span>  <strong><u>Nekroz Core Engine:</u></strong>  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a>:</strong> Nothing to discuss here, 3 is mandatory.  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a>:</strong> Idem, at 3 since the last banlist, adding a lot consistency to your opening hands.  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a>:</strong> Can be searched via Brionac, no need to play at 3. You can even consider playing only 1.  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus</a>:</strong> 3x would be a little too much (arguable), you do not want to open it, but you definitely want to end your turn with it. 1x is not enough. You need at least one to end the battle phase, and another one to recycle your dead draws &amp; Impcantations on board. It is also a strong body.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a>:</strong> I main only one, but I also have another copy on my side deck. Usually, you first summon it through Mirror, and then with Cycle (from grave). However, I sometimes need two in order to deal with huge threats or powerful continuous spell/traps.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Decisive Armor"">Nekroz of Decisive Armor</a>:</strong> Personal tech choice (most of the time swapped in game 2 for Trish if not needed). Can be very helpful to break the 3000th ATK wall. None of your Nekroz can beat a <a data-name=""Blue-eyes White Dragon"">Blue-eyes White Dragon</a> which is annoying. And I guarantee you, you should not neglect that. You will sooner or later find yourself in a spot where you would just need a slightly higher ATK monster to make the difference and win the duel. Furthermore, its ability to destroy AND banish any set card, as well as its Honest-like ability in hand make this card a very versatile option to consider. This card is usually underrated in my view.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz"">Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz</a>:</strong> I tried him at x3, it was too bricky. I tried him at 2x, could came in handy, but most of the time, I felt like the second copy was too much. 1x is fine according to me: Shurit can be searched with Brionac (so technically, you have 4x). You want to use it once from hand, and you can even use it twice thanks to Mirror, so it seems enough.  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Nekroz Kaleidoscope"">Nekroz Kaleidoscope</a>:</strong> When Unicore was limited, I would only play one. Now that it is at 3x, 2x Kaleidoscope feels right as it is the principal option you will use to summon Unicore.  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Nekroz Cycle"">Nekroz Cycle</a>:</strong> Best Nekroz ritual spell, helps you a lot in late game.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Nekroz Mirror"">Nekroz Mirror</a>:</strong> The most situational ritual spell, you will almost every time use it to summon Trishula by banishing Brionac and Clausolas OR Shurit from grave.  <strong>Remark: </strong>All these ritual spells are searchable via Clausolas, so you do not need a playset. It would be way too much.  <strong><u>Impcantation Package:</u></strong>  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Impcantation Chalislime"">Impcantation Chalislime</a>:</strong> Best Impcantation, you want to open it, but you do not play enough other Impcantations to run 3x copies. 2x is enough. The third one would most likely end up dead in hand.  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Impcantation Talismandra"">Impcantation Talismandra</a>:</strong> Talismandra into search for Brionac or Unicore is the most common play. You never want to open this card so 3x is too much. It needs to be special summoned with one of  its mates.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a>/ 1x <a data-name=""Impcantation Penciplume"">Impcantation Penciplume</a> / 1x <a data-name=""Impcantation Bookstone"">Impcantation Bookston</a><a data-name=""Impcantation Bookstone"">e: </a></strong>Best scenario is to open one of them and special summon Talismandra. You could replace one Bookstone (the less useful) for one other Pencilplume, to improve your late game. I prefer to run one of each in order to diversify my draws and options.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a>:</strong> I see too many people running more than 1. This is wrong. This card is searchable and can even be easily retrieved from grave. What’s more, there is already 5 other ritual spells in the deck which is almost too much. With 6 ritual spells, you have a 57.71% chance to open at least one (going first / 5 cards in hand). Let’s say you want to add 2 more, proba would therefore rise to 69.40%, more than 2/3, whereas you do not want to see them in your hand!! 6 ritual cards already account for 15% of your deck, this is huge!! Be very careful about bad ratios, they can totally ruin your chances of winning.  <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/f/fc/Impcantation.png/revision/latest?cb=20181014043418"" width=""452"" height=""454"" alt=""image"" />  <strong><u>Rest of the deck:</u></strong>  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a>:</strong> Best spell in the deck, 3x is mandatory. How come this card is still at 3x? Thanks Konami!  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands"">Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</a>:</strong> grants you one ritual search, enables XYZ rank 4 plays with Unicore, is your only normal summon except from Vanity’s ruler. 3x is a must.  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>:</strong> particularly effective in Nekroz since you never have to set any trap.  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>:</strong> generic hand trap. Replace it depending on the state of the meta.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> / 1x <a data-name=""Vanity’s Ruler"">Vanity’s Ruler</a>:</strong> for the combo play. No need for more copies, both are searchable. Why Ruler instead of Kristya? Kristya's special summoning condition is too hard to meet, you will never use it... and downside is it also prevent YOU from special summoning. Impcantations make it so easy to normal summon Ruler that I do not see any reason not to play it.  &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>Useful Tips:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a>’s effect states “banish EXACTLY 3 cards”, there is a restriction that <a data-name=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a> does not have. Keep in mind if your opponent has no card in hand, the effect won’t activate at all!</li>  	<li>When sequencing your plays, do not forget (if possible) to play <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a> after having already summoned a Nekroz, in order to retrieve the ritual spell used from grave.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a> can bounce back monsters that were special summoned from THE EXTRA DECK. Do not extrapolate this statement. If an XYZ, Synchro, Fusion etc… monster has been summoned via <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> for instance, Brionac’s ability won’t trigger.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus</a>’s recycling ability can be used by tributing monsters from your HAND, not only your FIELD.</li>  	<li>Do not forget, you are locked into summoning from the Extra Deck if you have an impcantation on board.</li>  	<li>Remember you need to reveal a specific card from your hand before playing any Impcantation. Always think about it before making any other play and realizing right after you cannot fulfill the requirement anymore!</li>  	<li>Brionac into Clausolas into Nekroz Mirror = you can invoke Trishula by banishing from grave the two above-mentioned creatures.</li>  	<li>Bear in mind your ritual spells have effects in grave that require you NOT HAVING any monster on the field to trigger.</li>  	<li>If you opt for the Manju play, you will not be able to summon Vanity. Be warned!</li>  	<li>If you do not ritual summon after using Chalislime's effect, you will lose 2000 HP, ouch!!</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus</a> can only be discarded by banishing a Nekorz card from grave!</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>Extra Deck:</u></strong></span>  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a>:</strong> to get a free ritual card out of Kaleido/Unicore.  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Elder Entity N’tss"">Elder Entity N’tss</a>:</strong> to destroy a card out of Kaleido/Unicore.  <strong>Super Poly Targets:</strong> Classics include <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> and <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a>. The latest can also be used on your own monsters, as I explained previously.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Number 41 Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41 Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a>:</strong> to slow down your opponent, survive until turn 2.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Evilswarm Exciton Knight"">Evilswarm Exciton Knight</a>:</strong> emergency option ... to nuke the board!  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Daigusto Emeral"">Daigusto Emeral</a>:</strong> for the very late game, to reload your deck (very rarely used).  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>:</strong> if you face a deck abusing effects from grave.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Shooting Quasar Dragon"">Shooting Quasar Dragon</a>:</strong> any level 12 will do fine (<a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon</a>, yes, you can finally use this ultimate beast!): level 12 = 2x Brionac OR Valk + Unicore OR Trish + Clausolas with Kaleidoscope.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Star Eater"">Star Eater</a>:</strong> any level 11 will do fine: level 11 = Valk + Clausolas with Kaleidoscope.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Shooting Star Dragon"">Shooting Star Dragon</a>:</strong> any level 10 will do fine: level 10 = Unicore + Brionac with Kaleidoscope.  <img class="""" src=""https://roadoftheking.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ro3rd-Nekroz-LA-WCQ-National-2015-Playmat.jpg"" width=""678"" height=""394"" alt=""image"" />  <span><strong><u>Side Deck:</u></strong></span>  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Super Polymerization""><strong>S</strong>uper Polymerization</a>:</strong> you have some free space in your Extra Deck, so why not using it? Another strong way to avoid negates and get rid of your opponent’s monsters.  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>:</strong> very helpful against backrows, as the Nekroz engine does not contain that many removals. And very op, come on!  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>:</strong> break monster-based lockdowns, avoid negation. Useful against combo decks abusing Halqifibrax and building powerful end boards.  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>: </strong>tons of combo decks out there that cannot play against Nibiru. Best way to wreck their board.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a>:</strong> whenever you think one is not enough. For late game, against control decks.  <strong>--&gt;</strong> The rest is up to you, depends on the meta as usual. 2x Twin Twisters, 2x Cosmic Cyclone, 2x D.D. Crow etc…  &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>Other options to consider:</u></strong></span>  <strong><a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">Deskbot 003</a>:</strong> already mentioned in the foreword section of this guide. I am not a fan, but very explosive &amp; impressive combo involving <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> and <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a> (no joke!?). If you feel luck is on your side, go for it!  <strong>The Zaborg Dilemma:</strong> I tested a lot <a data-name=""Zaborg The Mega Monarch"">Zaborg The Mega Monarch</a>, and I must say I have mixed feelings regarding its viability for (semi-)competitive play. Its effect is very strong, no doubt, but the conditions required to benefit from it seem quite huge to me. It also comes with its share of drawbacks: It is not searchable, it uses your normal summon, and therefore collides with Manju and Vanity. It helps deplete your opponent’s extra deck, but you can already rely on Unicore to do the job (a bit redundant). You need to tribute a LIGHT monster in order to choose which cards you send to GY from the opponent’s Extra Deck --&gt; it means you would have to reconsider and adjust your impcantation ratios in a way that would not be optimal otherwise. Can sometimes end up dead in hand, especially if you draw it after turn 1.  For fun/casual play however, I would highly recommend giving it a try, as you can potentially have access to some sick combos if you combine Zaborg with <a data-name=""Miracle Synchro Fusion"">Miracle Synchro Fusion</a> and specific Extra Deck monsters. <strong>Let me know in the comments if you would like more information.</strong>  <strong>Splashing Dragma:</strong> the new Dragma Archetype which will make its debut in the “Rise of the Duellist” set (only available in OCG at the moment), will most likely redefine the way we play Nekroz. I do not want to elaborate on this topic. One thing at a time, mastering the actual version of the deck is already quite complicated.  <strong><a data-name=""Nekroz of Gungnir"">Nekroz of Gungnir</a>:</strong> I first included it in my side deck but decided to replace it with <a data-name=""Nekroz of Decisive Armor"">Nekroz of Decisive Armor</a> which comes up more often. Good removal overall that can find its place in the side deck.  <strong><a data-name=""Celestial Observatory"">Celestial Observatory</a>: </strong>very good in this build, enables to replenish your Impcantation engine by shuffling back Talismandra in your deck. Benten and Brionac are also great targets.  <strong><a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>:</strong> can search for Unicore and Shurit, but there’s so many searchers already, do you really need one more? Maybe...  <strong>Any other suggestions let me know!</strong>  <strong><u><img src=""https://d1rw89lz12ur5s.cloudfront.net/photo/gamekeeperonline/file/516823/large/$_1.jpg?1473964873"" alt=""image"" /></u></strong>  <strong>If you are one of those who’ve read this far… well, thank you! </strong>I hope this guide has facilitated understanding of many key aspects of the Nekroz, and clarified most of the dark spots surrounding these mysterious knights possessed by the spirit of the dragon!  <strong>Here are some other deck profiles you might like:</strong>  <em>Phantasms’ Awakening – How to tame the Sacred Beasts!</em> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/phantasms-awakening-how-to-tame-the-sacred-beasts/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/phantasms-awakening-how-to-tame-the-sacred-beasts/</a>  <em>Nostalgy Time – An Extensive Guide on How to Play Toons </em><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/nostalgy-time-an-extensive-guide-on-how-to-play-toons/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/nostalgy-time-an-extensive-guide-on-how-to-play-toons/</a>  <strong><em>Lightning</em></strong>"

With the new Dragma archetype coming out next month, I think they can work well as a rogue strategy. Mostly using the older Lunalight strategy of actually fusion summoning, and using the Dragma cards to send Lunalight Cat/Panther Dancer to the graveyard, and using Wolf to fusion summon using the graveyard. While it's not perfect, and there are better archetypes to splash Dragma with, I think this will be the best way to use Lunalights in the future."

Before you click away, I didn't go over 40 for my reasons. <ul>  	<li>Nibiru: In this format, there are so many combo decks that this is a staple. Play at 3.</li>  	<li>Destiny Hero Plasma: This is your backup plan in case you go first. It does have only 1900 attack but a skill drain is nothing to laugh at. Also above level 4 so you can use it for dark calling fodder. Play at one, however.</li>  	<li>Honest Neos: Helps in otks and if needed can be used for fodder for dark calling.</li>  	<li>Malicious: Overall needed at 2. This helps so much with your combos if  It also can be banished for dark calling.</li>  	<li>Faris: 2 monsters on board,  a poly searched, and 2 monsters in gy. Fodder for calling. Must have at 3</li>  	<li>Adusted Gold: Discard for dark calling. Your evil hero can't fuse without this. However, you are going to run one dark fusion as anymore I feel is a brick.</li>  	<li>Stratos: Your searcher for the entire deck. Run at 3.</li>  	<li>Celestial: Dystopia Fodder and a draw 2 if you have no cards in your hand. However, a brick otherwise. Run at 1.</li>  	<li>Liquid Soldier: Special summons from your graveyard and if used as fusion material... allows a draw 2 discard 1. Run at 1 because there are better pieces out there.</li>  	<li>Solid Soldier: Special Summons from hand and if sent by a spell effect (Polymerization) allows you to bring back a hero in defense. Again run at 1.</li>  	<li>Shadow Mist: If sent to gy... allows to search a hero. If special summoned... allows to search mask change. Put at 3.</li>  	<li>Vyon: Sends a hero to gy (most of the time shadow mist). Banishes one monster from gy to add a poly. Run at 3</li>  	<li>Increase: While in spell and trap zone you can tribute a monster to special summon it. If you do this you can special summon another vision hero from the deck. Run at 2, could be changed.</li>  	<li>E- Emergency call: Also a searcher. Run at 3</li>  	<li>Dark calling: A miracle fusion that can summon mali bane. Run at one as it is easily searchable</li>  	<li>Poly: Nothing to say at this except searchable. Run at 1</li>  	<li>Reinforcement: Another searcher. Run as much as possible</li>  	<li>Miracle Fusion: Banishes from gy to summon. Searched from sunrise so run at 1.</li>  	<li>Fusion Destiny: Neos fusion without the restriction. Run at 3</li>  	<li>Mask change: Think of this like a quick play fusion summons using one monster. It special summons the same attribute. Watch for that.</li>  	<li>Called by the grave: Anti Eldlich and protects you from hand traps. Run at 3</li> </ul> </li> </ul> EXTRA DECK <ul>  	<li>Mali Bane: Untargetable removal that gains attack when it removes. Protected from getting destroyed.</li>  	<li>Dystopia: Summoned with fusion destiny. 1600 burn dmg and can destroy if attack is different then 2800.</li>  	<li>Adoration: Underclock taker</li>  	<li>Acid: Removes all spells and traps when it leaves the field.</li>  	<li>Escuridao: Gains 100 atk for every hero in your gy.</li>  	<li>Absolute Zero: Removes all monsters when it leaves the field.</li>  	<li>Sunrise: Monsters you control gain 200 ATK for each different Attribute you control as well as when it is summoned, it searches a miracle fusion and when another hero attacks you can target and destroy one card on the field.</li>  	<li>Dark Law: A macro cosmos for their field and when a card is added to their hand... you can banish one random card from their hand. I run this at 2 because there are a lot of darks in your deck.</li>  	<li>Blast: When summoned halfs an opponent's monster's attack. You can pay 500 lp once per turn (quick effect) to return an opponent's spell/trap to hand.</li>  	<li>Dangerous: A mill.</li>  	<li>Dread Decimator: This card, also any hero monsters it points to, gains 100 ATK for each hero monster with different names in your gy.</li>  	<li>Wonder Driver: Reuses your miracle fusion or poly.</li>  	<li>Cross Crusader: Revives a destiny hero from gy. Run at 2.</li> </ul> You can side out Nibiru for dark ruler in case of any negate boards. Sad thing is that you don't deal any damage after it resolves. However, it is better to be able to try to destroy their board. Twin in case of mystic mine. Lightning Storm because it is nice removal. If they are not running handtraps.... :/ cmon. You can side it out for infinite impermanence.  &nbsp;"

I incorporated Yuri's new support into his deck since he didn't have a full 40 card deck in the Yugioh Arc V series. Yuri had two decks in the series an ancient gear one and a Predaplant one. This updated deck focuses on both of his Predaplant and Honor Student Ancient Gear Deck. My Character decks are NOT meant for yugioh official tournaments. The duel below Yuri Vs The Lancers Students will show you why the deck is built the way it is.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaoX1uzKOiw"

I have no idea what to tag this now.,"If you like big numbers than this is the deck for you. This decks goal is to get out Red Supernova Dragon as quick as possible using the synchron/junk monsters. Using cards like Halqifibrax and Junk Speeder you can get this card out off of a single normal summon.  &nbsp;  Why is X card run?  <strong>Main Deck</strong> <ul>  	<li>3 Jet Synchron: Jet is a level 1 tuner that is a 1 card full combo. He has a handy revival effect that can easily be abused with cards like Linkuriboh or Junk Converter who will dump him into the grave while giving you advantage. On top of all of this if you synchro summon with him and he ends up in the graveyard he searches a Junk monster from your deck. Don't run any less than 3.</li>  	<li>1 Deskbot 001: 01 is used with Auroradon to summon several synchro monsters in one turn due to 01 reviving himself whenever you summon 2 or more monsters at once. While he is great for alternate combo strings when you don't open Junk Converter or Jet Synchron you don't ever want to normal summon him unless you need a level 1 tuner. He is best left in the deck until he is needed. Also his name tells you how many copies to run.</li>  	<li>2 Synchron Carrier: This boy is a level 2 non-tuner which makes him a great target for Junk Synchron. While on board he gives lets you normal summon again if you are summoning a Synchron monster. If you manage to synchro summon while he is on the board he will also give you a level 2 token. I don't want to run more than 2 since there are other more useful level 2 monsters, and you can't special summon him.</li>  	<li>3 Junk Converter: As the name implies he converts useless tuners into synchrons. He does this by sending them to the gaveyard as well as himself. You can then add any synchron from deck to hand. On top of this he is a level 2 non-tuner meaning him + Junk Synchron lets you summon out Junk Speeder. Plus when he is used for a synchro summon you are able to summon a Synchron from your graveyard allowing you to access garnets while they are outside of the deck. The only thing I dislike about it is that it was not a retrain of Quillbolt Hedgehog. Run 3.</li>  	<li>1 Fleur Synchron: Of the 4 garnet tuners you run he is the second least offensive to draw into. You want to summon him off the effect of Junk Speeder which will be explained later. If he is used for a synchro summon he lets you summon a level 2 monster from your hand which could help with play extention but I found it easier to just save him for the summon of Red Nova. Run 1.</li>  	<li>1 Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion: He is a level 2 tuner monster that summons a level 3 token when he is sent to the graveyard. This effect is best used either by summoning him off Halqifibrax or summoning with the effect of Auroradon to get the precious level 5 synchro summon. He has other effects but this isn't a Mecha Phantom Beast so they don't really matter. Run 1.</li>  	<li>2 Doppel Warrior: He is a level 2 non-tuner monster with a special summon condition. If a card is summoned from the graveyard (Jet Synchron, 001, or the effects of Junk Synchron and Converter) you can summon him form your hand. If you use him for a synchro summon he will give you 2 level 1 tokens. He can be a bit of a brick sometimes but his utility outweighs that minor flaw. As the artwork shows run 1 or 2 copies of him.</li>  	<li>2 Junk Forward: This level 3 manga Speed Warrior retrain. He is a non-tuner who can special summon himself so long as you control no monsters. While a free non-tuner is great I don't quite know if I would want to run 3. Since he isn't level 2 you will have to use less useful non-tuners to synchro summon with him. Run 2 or 3</li>  	<li>2 Junk Synchron: One of my favorite cards in the entire game. He is a level 3 tuner with the ability to summon a level 2 or lower monster from your graveyard on his normal summon. One of the best things you can do in this deck is pitch Junk Converter and any tuner to search Junk Synchron. Then you summon Junk Synchron allowing you to revive Junk Converter which lets you perform a level 5 synchro summon. I wish he was worth running three or but him being so reliant on a using your normal summon makes him a little situational. Run 1 - 2</li>  	<li>1 Road Synchron: He is a level 4 tuner who may as well be a level 2. He has two effects that change his level. If you use him to summon a monster that isn't Road Warrior his level is reduced by 2. His second effect increases his level by 1 if he attacks. He is one of the worse cards in the deck but him being treated as a level 2 or even 3 is useful for something a little later. Run 1 so you don't see him.</li>  	<li>2 Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing: This level 4 plane lets you summon two tokens if he is special summoned. You use him for a combo with 001 that I will explain later. But for now did you know his level increaces by the level of all Mecha Phantom Beast tokens you control? Run 2 so you don't need to put it back with avariece every time.</li>  	<li>1 Quickdraw Synchron: This rootin tootin level 5 cowboy tuner is the fastest summon in the west. You can special summon him from your hand by discarding a card which can lead to Halqifibrax combos, but I use him as another garnet for something I will explain later. Run whatever number you feel like.</li>  	<li>3 Fantastical Dragon Phantasmay: This level 7 dragon is used to fix hands if you are going second. You can summon him when your opponent link summons then draw cards equal to the link rating +1 and return cards from your hand equal to the link rating back to the deck. He is also able to negate effects that target cards you control and sends cards from your hand to the graveyard in the process. Him being level 7 lets you immediately go into Savage dragon late game once you run out of steam. While he is good you may want to run other hand trap cards instead. Feel free to replace him if you need to.</li>  	<li>3 Called By The Grave: Speaking of hand traps, this card stops them. Do not run any less than 3, this deck is pretty linear and has several choke points. Run 3.</li>  	<li>1 Foolish Burial: This card allows you to get whatever you need into the grave. Need 001 or Jet. You are good. Need a level 2, its got you covered. Its not necessary so run by preference.</li>  	<li>1 One For One: This one card lets you trade one monster card in your hand for one level 1 monster in your deck. You can summon 001 or Jet Synchron for your one card combo. Run 1 because its at 1. Unless you are in the ocg.</li>  	<li>3 Pot of Avarice: This card helps reset your extra deck as you can easily run out of usable cards. It also lets you draw cards. Just be careful of D.D. Crow or Called By The Grave as the card will fail to resolve if one of the cards you target gets banished. Run 2 or 3.</li>  	<li>2 Starlight Junktion: This piece of Synchron support lets you swap any tuner for a Synchron in your deck with a different level. Plus if you manage to synchro summon on your opponents turn you can spin an opponents card. This card is not necessary but can be very helpful. Run by preference.</li>  	<li>3 Tuning: This is just Junk Converter but a spell card. When activated you can add a synchron monster from your deck to your hand then mill the top card of your deck, which if you are lucky can get you those precious level 2 monsters. Run 3.</li>  	<li>1 Upstart Goblin: This makes your deck 39 cards.</li>  	<li>2 Infinite Impermanence: This is a trap card that works like a spell card. It can help you get past a Savage Dragon or an Appolousa. You may want to run evenly matched or lightning storm instead.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  Everything here is 1 of but feel free to experiment with the cards or ratios if you like. <ul>  	<li>Linkuriboh: This little guy is part of the Jet Synchron and Halqifibrax combo. You can link summon him by tributing a Jet Synchron you control. Then you summon back Jet and you have the tuner and non tuner necessary for Halqifibrax. If you leave him on the board he can reduce an attacking monters attack to 0. If you run Halqifibrax, run this card.</li>  	<li>Linkross: This thing converts your useless link monsters into level 1 tokens for yet more synchro plays. I don't normally use him but I he is too good to leave out.</li>  	<li>Crystron Halqifibrax (or Needlefiber if you are a weeb): This card is one of the best cards ever made. It is a link 2 that requires a tuner and a non-tuner which summons a tuner from your deck. Nine out of ever ten games you will want to summon him. I use him to summon O-Lion, 001, and Jet Synchron in order to go into Auroradon. If you don't do that you can always tag him out for a synchro tuner in your extra deck and synchro summon on your opponents turn. Fun with Junktion on the field.</li>  	<li>Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon: This thing is a token summoning machine. He is a link 3 that summons 3 level 3 tokens to your board. I like to summon him using 001 and Halqifibrax so I can summon back 001 to go into other synchro monster. When you summon him you are locked out of link monsters for the rest of the turn but that shouldn't matter past this point. You can also tribute 2 monsters you control to summon Coltwing to summon back 001 again for even more synchro plays. Cant go wrong with this card,</li>  	<li>Accel Synchron: He is a level 2 synchro tuner that lets you draw a card on his summon. You can also synchro summon using him on your opponents turn. The easiest way to get him out is by either summoning some Linkross tokens or with the effect of Halqifibrax. He is good, I just don't understand why he needs legs and arms.</li>  	<li>Martial Metal Marcher: This is a level 3 synchro tuner. It is a slightly more restrictive version of Junk Synchron who can summon back a tuner from your graveyard. If you manage to synchro summon with him whatever you summon can become a tuner. You can summon him with the Linkross tokens or Halqifibrax.</li>  	<li>Crystron Quandax: This is what happens to Halqifibrax when you tribute him to summon a synchro tuner. He is a level 4 synchro tuner that lets you synchro on your opponents turn. Currently I am running his as I want to get more tuners in my graveyard, but I will talk about some possible replacements later.</li>  	<li>Old Entity Hastorr: He is a level 4 non-tuner synchro monster. You may be saying right now, why are you not running Herald Of The Arc Light? To which I say it looks cool. But Hastorr is more useful than you think. You see if you use him for a synchro summon he equips onto an opponents monster and negates their effects. They could just destroy him, but then his second effect steals their monster.</li>  	<li> Accel Synchron: This level 5 synchro tuner lets you modulate his level by sending synchrons from your deck to the graveyard. I will sometimes use him to clear tokens off the board. He also lets you synchro summon on your opponents turn.</li>  	<li>Junk Speeder: When I first saw this card it brought a tear to my eyes. This is one of my favorite pieces of legacy support in the game. This level 5 non-tuner combonation of Junk Synchron (not required to summon) and Speed Warrior (retaining his 1800 boosted attack) allows you to swarm the field with as many Synchrons as possible from your deck. He is the centerpice of this entire deck. With this versetile effect you are alble to go into any synchro monster you could possibly dream of. Though it locks you into synchro monsters, this effect is well worth it. If he attacks the turn he is summoned you can double his attack points to 3600 allowing him to get over most monsters. With the current build I have the goal is to summon him with at least 3 open main monster zones, then with his effect you will summon Fleur Synchron, Road Synchron, and Junk Synchron. You then tune them all together in order to summon Red Supernova Dragon. While I want to say you should run more than one, you will quickly run out of tuners once you use him so its best to leave him at 1.</li>  	<li>Stardust Charge Warrior: This level 6 non-tuner synchro that lets you draw a card. He can be used if you also manage to summon a Jet Synchron off of Junk Speeders effect. He can also attack all of your opponents special summoned monsters but good luck getting over anything with his 2100 attack.</li>  	<li>Shooting Risar Dragon: This level 7 synchro tuner is part of the alternate combo string. When you summon Auroradon while 001 is in your graveyard you can synchro summon with two tokens to get out this card. Using this cards effect you can then send Quickdraw Synchron from deck to grave to make this card a level 2 tuner. You can then tune him with the remaining token for Junk Speeder.</li>  	<li>Clear Wing Synchro Dragon: This level 7 non-tuner synchro monster is a late game option meant to lead into Borreload Savage Dragon. He is able to negate effects if you leave him on the field, but savage is just a little better.</li>  	<li>Borreload Savage Dragon: This card is a level 8 non-tuner synchro monster that have at least 250 more attack than Ultimate Conductor Tyranno as well as negates equal to the link rating of the card you chose to equip to him. Overall he is probably better than the boss monster. Speaking of the boss monster...</li>  	<li>RED SUPERNOVA DRAGON: This is the biggest beat-stick you will ever see. With the near endless amount of tuners you will be dumping into the graveyard (which will be a minimum of 4) will increase his attack points by 500 for each. He also has a quick effect that banishes your entire board resetting them to zero, but be careful because you don't get him back until YOUR next end phase.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>Other Cards To Try</strong> <ul>  	<li>Unkown Synchron: Level 1 tuner that can special summon itself if your opponent controls a monster. There are too many other good level 1 Synchrons and his effect is only one per duel.</li>  	<li>Cyberse Synchron: Level 1 tuner that can double the level of a level 4 or lower monster. Might take out Road Synchron for this guy as Cyberse Synchron also offers some effect proteciton.</li>  	<li>Satellite Synchron (Not Pictured): Level 2 tuner that I forgot existed. He can special summon himself from the hand if summon a card from your graveyard and has level manipulation. Definitly worth considering,</li>  	<li>Steam Synchron: Level 3 tuner that lets you synchro on your opponents turn. Could be a backup level 3 in case you run out of Junk Synchron.</li>  	<li>Drill Synchron (Not Pictured): Level 3 tuner that lets gives your warrior monsters piercing and if you do pierce you get to draw a card. Good backup level 3 Synchron.</li>  	<li>Scrap-Iron Signal: Reusable counter trap that stops monsters. It requires you to control a synchro monster that lists a synchro monster as one of its materials.</li>  	<li>Herald Of The Arc Light: Better than Hastorr, but I still don't want to play him.</li>  	<li>Old Entity Cthugua: With Auroradon, Coltwing and Deskbot 001 you can get out two of these guys for a rank four monter and draw 2 cards. He also spins all rank four monsters so if you know a Zoodiac player you can always mess with them. Here are some fun Xyz monsters to try. <ul>  	<li>Number 39: Utopia: Rank 4 and its many forms: <ul>  	<li>Number 39: Utopia The Lightning to get over annoying cards.</li>  	<li>Number 39: Utopia Double to swing with 10,000 attack.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Daigusto Emeral: Rank 4 that is a mini pot of avarice. Worth considering.</li>  	<li>Gem Knight Pearl: Rank 4</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>2nd Junk Speeder: Extra deck too tight and main deck doesn't have enough resources.</li>  	<li>T.G. Hyper Librarian: Level 5 synchro non-tuner. Free draw power if you can continue to synchro summon.</li>  	<li>Coral Dragon: Level 6 synchro tuner. Level 6 tuner is a bit awkward to use, but it can pop cards your opponent controls.</li>  	<li>Satellite Warrior: Level 10 synchro. Requires a tuner and 1+ non-tuner synchro monsters. He then pops several cards and gains 1000 attack for each. He also summons 3 level 8 or lower Stardust, Warrior, or Synchron monsters from your graveyard to go into Shooting Quasar Dragon.</li>  	<li>Shooting Star Dragon T.G. - Expansion: Level 10 synchro that requires a tuner synchro and 1+ synchro monsters to summon. Has a quick effect destruction that responds to monsters and banishes tuners as a cost. It can also negate an attack and can summon itself from the graveyard by tributing two synchro monsters.</li>  	<li>Shooting Star Dragon (Level 10 synchro) + Shooting Quasar Dragon(Level 12 synchro): Quasar can negate any card spell speed 2 or lower, can attack at least twice and floats into Shooting Star Dragon. Shooting Star Dragon can attack up to 5 times depending on your luck but can't be summoned without Stardust Dragon. But it does float into Stardust Dragon.</li>  	<li>Cosmic Blazar Dragon: Level 12 synchro. Quasar but he banishes himself until the endphase so he is protected from removal. He dosent float though.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <strong>Pros</strong>  This deck is extremely flexible. You can easily change this to focus on whatever boss monster you chose. Synchro support has been amazing recently and this deck is great example of that. The 5D's nostalgia also helps. You can easily fit more hand traps into this deck as they can just replace some of the worse tuners and they wont get in the way.  &nbsp;  <strong>Cons</strong>  My build has no way to stop Nibiru. If you want to go into Red Supernova you need to summon at least 6 monsters. A few well placed hand traps like Ash Blossom or Called By The Grave can easily stop this deck. This deck will also probably no longer be legal by the end of the year as Jet Synchron and Deskbot 001 are in a prime position to be banned for the sins of Crystron Halqifibrax and friends. Also Red Supernova Dragon summons himself back durring your endphase which isnt a problem on any other similar 5D's cards which just made it a worse Topologic Zeroborus.  &nbsp;  <strong>Final Thoughts</strong>  This deck is fun to play. I had been growing somewhat sick of this game recently and rebuilding my first ever good deck has reminded me why I fell in love with this game to begin with. I just hope I'm able to play this deck once at a local before its gone."
