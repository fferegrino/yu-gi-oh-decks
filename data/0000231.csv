Here's how:  1 to 5 you just do the same to bring out Number 99  6. Summon Leo Utopia Ray, attach Hyper to it  7. Use Leo's effect to equip it with Pegasus  8. Equip it with Tornado in your hand (was added by Armed Sage's effect)  9. End your phase  10. During your opponent's Draw phase, use Number 99's effect to summon Number 38 and attach Hyper to it  If you do it successfully, you will have 2 monster effect negates, 1 spell negate. Also if your opponent attack, you can change it ATK to 0 by using Number 99's effect  &nbsp;"

The only interesting things should be the ratio of traps I'm using and the side deck.  I run 3 Chuche because you really want to see it through opening it or through Kauwloon, the second one being the more preferable option if you're able to make it live on your first turn.  Normally if someone runs Xuanwu they like cutting Chuche down to 2, but personally I'd prefer the extra trap over not seeing Chuche as much.  My build likes going first, but it has tools for going second as well. I feel like I don't need to explain many of the extra or side deck choices, though those are where most VW decks differ.

After that you can pop one of your backrow to summon your eldlich, if you open with eldland the advantage becomes really disgusting.  In the opponent's turn mirrorjade can send another albion to get another branded fusion/opening/albaz to get some fusion plays going, otherwise it can send titanklad wich will get you ecclesia wich will get you punishment.  You can totally mess around with ratios and wich traps to run but I think that the idea behind the deck of mirrojade+eldlich and some set cards is really strong.  You could probably play lord of the heavenly prison, but you'd probably need to make more space for it since eldlich on its own has kind of an hard time triggering it (because the traps lock you into zombies).  Also you could play more ways to get into branded fusion (another alubert, kitt etc), but while branded fusion is a strong play I'd rather play more traps since they are really good this format, and in general is better to open a lot of traps and way to get to branded fusion than just a lot of cards that get you branded fusion.  You could also play the destroy phoenix enforcer engine and it works well with mirrorjade, probably if you cut like the second albaz, 1 huaquero, golden land forever and the lost winds you could totally play like that."

The fiend engine adds <a data-name=""Tindangle Jherlth"">Tindangle Jherlth</a>, which can discard another card and send a Tindangle, which will be <a data-name=""Tindangle Intruder"">Tindangle Intruder,</a> from your deck to special summon itself, then if Intruder was sent to the graveyard it will summon itself. On flip Jhrelth can add or send any flip monster and Intruder can search <a data-name=""Tindangle Angel"">Tindangle Angel.</a>  The Subterror engine can get to <a data-name=""Subterror Guru"">Subterror Guru which can add </a><a data-name=""Subterror Fiendess"">Subterror Fiendess</a><a data-name=""Subterror Guru""> for a negate,</a> Subterror Volteluric can allow you to make <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a>, or Subterror Succession which gives us access to our other engines.  The Shaddoll engine gives us access to the powerful Fusion monsters but the main deck Shaddoll monsters are especially powerful in this deck as disruption and incredibly sticky monsters. The Dogmatika package allows us to access the Shaddoll engine through <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone's graveyard effect.</a>  Floodgates like <a data-name=""Summon Limit"">Summon Limit</a> and <a data-name=""There Can Only Be One"">There Can Only Be One</a><a data-name=""There Can Only Be One""> and board breakers like </a><a data-name=""Needle Ceiling"">Needle Ceiling</a><a data-name=""There Can Only Be One""> and </a><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being""> are especially good in this deck because it uses a lot of set monsters which are unaffected by these floodgates, and these floodgates also slow the game enough that one or two disruptive flip effects a turn cycle can turn the game in your favour.</a>"

Always summon Harr first, then typically Utgarda. Try to keep Harr on board as he's your most powerful boss. Typically you'll make Jormungandr as your first extra deck monster, the rest are toolbox.  The deck grinds very well with an abundance of interactions and negates as well as Hela's ability to revive a generaider every single turn. Your opening turn is typically very linear, but beyond that the deck has many routes you can advance through based on the game state, so make sure you understand how to manage your resources properly.  Starlight Road and Summon Limit can single handedly win you games in best of 3's, so keep those in your side deck. Feel free to switch the handtraps around for whatever you prefer or is meta at the moment.  You can cut N'tss, Link Spider, and Dyson Sphere from the extra deck based on preference as well."

Not competitive, but did get me the Platinum in Yu-Gi-Oh Legacy of the Duelist so there's that!","This is the deck I built that got me a Platinum trophy on Yu-Gi-Oh: Legacy of the Duelist.  It's not competitive in a real-life environment but does the job very well in that game.  I've been a big fan of Spirits ever since Noah's Ark *chirping crickets* in the anime, so hopefully this deck shows off some of the cool stuff they can do!  The main strategy of the deck is to disrupt and hit hard.  Having the ritual monsters break boards via their effects and then using them to special summon out Amano-Iwato (so it isn't bounced back to the hand by it's own effect) to prevent your opponent activating monster effects is the main strategy.  I also like having Great Long Nose as it can really limit your opponents options from breaking your board and getting going again.  I wanted to keep the deck as purely Spirit themed as possible, hence no extra deck, but Pre-Preparation of Rites is far too useful for getting this deck going to leave out and after playing through the game having a deck without Twin Twisters or Mystical Space Typhoon in it just felt wrong to me &#x1f602;!"

Anyway, here is my Heroic Challenger deck, named after pretty much the MVP of ancient Sparta and the movie <em>300</em>, Leonidas I.  &nbsp;  Heroic is intended to be an offensive, go-second deck, and the support they got is supposed to remind you. Their new Rank 4, Cliaomh Solias, can bring your Life Points down to 500 in exchange for doubling the ATK of a monster on your field once the Battle Phase starts. If combo'd with one of their Spell cards, Heroic Chance, that monster's ATK can be doubled again which can easily lead to an OTK. To help facilitate said OTK, this deck runs a total of 8 hand traps and 3 backrow removal.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

You want to have about 8-10 cards in hand at the start of you main phase 2. Including atleast 2 Ojamassimilation and 1 Ojamagic. You can easily make A-to-Z Dragon Buster Cannon with the Ojamassimilation but keep in mind that using the materials for ABC-Dragon Buster and 1 other monster on field to summon Saryuja and still summon ABC while using the materials from the GY. You can also use the effect of ABC once before summoning XYZ to create A-to-Z. You only need 1 Ojama Blue to pull this combo off meaning that you only need 1 of your Ojama Blue, Summoner Monk, Rescue Cat or Ojamatch. 11 Cards in your deck start your combo. If you dont draw them try to use your Ojamas to get a level 2 xyz to summon AA-Zeus or Melffy Mommy and hope for the best."

This one is a lot better and is likely to be the best this deck will get, or at least close. I'll update the explanations to include/remove stuff I changed, but otherwise it'll remain mostly the same with strategy explanation. Also I am including Epsilon who, at this time, is only in the OCG. He will be in the TCG with the upcoming pack in February, so for now replace him with Delta.  <span>Card Explanations:</span>  <span>Main Deck:</span>  Pretty simple strategy with Magnet Warriors. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are all easy to get out using each other, just read their effects and you should understand easily. Epsilon is good for getting them into the GY, which is not something Magnets mind very much as there are multiple ways to get them out of there, and Berserkion can be summoned using Magnets in the GY. The Adamancipator cards are good for getting Magnets out easily as well. Magnet Induction is another good searcher for Magnets, as well as Adamancipator Friends. Monster Reborn is a general good card for Magnets since it offers a way to special summon them for their search effects. Magnetic Field is very good as it allows you to special summon a Magnet from the GY, and it also offers very good battle protection as any monster destroying one of your Magnets (or Adamancipators) by battle will return that attacking monster to the hand. While this is a good effect and is great to have, it is not essential, so I opted not to add something like Terraforming. Ash Blossom is just a general good negate, which are needed as Magnets are not the best archetype in the world in all honesty. Berserkion is a good boss monster on his own, and has a non-once per turn destruction by banishing a Magnet from the GY, as well as summoning the 3 Magnets after being destroyed. Valkyrion is only there for the summon of Imperion, as well as Poly. Deskbot is for a specific combo I'll go over later. Gamaciel is a great form of removal that's very important because this deck struggles a lot with stuff like Dragoon. Adamancipator Signs lets you summon a Magnet or Adamancipator from the GY, basically another Monster Reborn, and if you use it on an Adamancipator you can put a Magnet on the top of the deck for the Adamancipator effect. Adamancipator Friends is good for if your opponent negated everything else you have and you need something in your hand at least. I wouldnt use it until you're out of options since it locks you out of summoning except for rock monsters and most of the extra deck isn't rock.  As for the side deck, I kinda just threw in stuff I thought would be good for general negation. You can put whatever you want I didn't put much time into it.  <span>Extra Deck:</span>  Imperion is the main boss monster of the deck. 4000 attack beatstick plus an almost-omni-negate, and he can summon Berserkion and Valkyrion from the deck upon leaving the field via card effect, similar to Berserkion (which is why I run two copies of both). Baronne is a secondary boss, pretty easy to get out in this deck in a strategy I'll go over later. Borreload Savage Dragon is another good negate, and isn't used nearly as often as Baronne but is still useful in certain situations. Zeus is mainly used if you want a board wipe, which is mainly brought out by attacking with Gorgonic, who also negates. Gorgonic is very easy to get out as it can be brought out with two Magnets, and offers good negation (But be careful, because if you want Berserkion on the field you can't use the Magnets as Xyz material for this or else you can't summon Berserkion). Underworld Goddess is good to get one of their monsters out and negate the others. Acesscode Talker, Knightmare Phoenix, and I:P Masquerena are all general support cards, you should be able to figure out how to use them. Auroradon and Halqifibrax are also for the Baronne summon covered in a bit, and the secon Halqifibrax is for after you use the other one and is good for getting out Adamancipators. Cherubini is useful for getting another Magnet in the GY, as well as offering destruction protection. Verte is the main way to get out Imperion.  &nbsp;  <span>General Strategies and Downsides:</span>  This deck's capability is very dependent on your starting hand, as it contains a lot of monsters, so don't expect this deck to be 100% consistent as sometimes you can just get a horrible hand. That being said, most of the time you can take pretty good advantage of your starting hand to at least get something on the board. After playing this deck a lot, you should get the hang of what order to do certain things, but be weary that this deck is very easy to brick with. One negate on a not-amazing starting hand could lead to you ending the turn with just a useless Magnet normal summoned and that's it. The deck is pretty good at searching though, so playing it at 45 cards is actually better for consistency, and since making that change I've actually bricked less with it.  General way to get out Imperion is to swarm the field with Magnets and at least get two out for Verte. You usually need at least one of the level 8 Magnets in your starting hand so you can search out the other with Alpha and fuse them turn 1. Baronne has a somewhat-fast combo to get it out, which is basically the longest combo in the deck which isn't saying much. You need at least one Adamancipator and any other card, then summon Halqifibrax. Use his effect to summon Deskbot, then link them both into Auroradon. Use his effect to summon 3 tokens, which activates Deskbot's GY effect to summon himself. Deskbot is level 1, the tokens are all level 3, and Baronne is level 10. 1+3+3+3=10, so easy summon for Baronne with just two monsters. This combo also gets Halqifibrax in the GY, potentially to be used for Borreload. Borreload can be summoned with the level 4 Adamancipator and Epsilon, so you won't be getting him out nearly as much as Baronne, but sometimes you'll be in this situation where they're the only two cards on field and this'll be a good option. As mentioned before, you'll want to get Zeus out with Gorgonic generally, as his board wipe can be very useful for some problem cards. The other cards I basically went over already, and they're easy to understand how to use anyways.  This deck has a really big problem against Dragoon, which I guess so do a lot of decks. The only way I can really deal with it (besides just negating Verte) is to Kaiju it, which is why I play 3 of him in the deck. I wouldn't suggest Super Poly, as that makes summoning Imperion almost impossible because you can't use material from the hand. This deck doesn't summon Valkyrion because he's useless as a monster and the normal monsters are obviously bad (them being the intended way to get him out). Of course if you want to change the deck to remove Imperion altogether, go ahead, but I like using Imperion because he's in the archetype and actually not too bad of a monster. I might not have a choice if Verte gets banned though, since then I won't really know how to consistently get Imperion out.  <span>Afterword:</span>  So yeah, that's a basic summary of this deck. My friend helped me make this deck and I thank him a lot for this, as this is absolutely my favourite deck to use and Magnets are my favourite archetype in general. I hope you enjoy using this deck like I do, as even now I'm still finding out some combos this deck can do depending on what cards you get stuck with, and I'm still happily beating all my friends with it (if they don't use Dragoon of course). While this is definitely my most fun deck, it is also a deck made to win, so that's why I'm labelling it non-meta."

They end up in your GY and can summon themselves from there every turn. They spam Level 4, but mostly Level 8 monster to the field. With that being said they don't really do all that much besides that. King and Queen have okay effects, getting better with Light and Dark on the field (the monsters, not the all caps attributes) and Ogdoabyss is crazy strong but not enough on its own, yet its gimmick prevents you from playing anything else really.</span>  <span>At first people tried out Invoked, since this deck doesn't rely on its Normal Summon but quickly moved on after realising that other engines actually contribute to their endboard. I mean what are Ogdoadics gonna do? Send their own Mechaba?</span>  <span>Then there was OTK Ogdoadic. You spam out Level 8 monsters, playing through a few negates thanks to cards like Kaijus, Gizmek Orochi, Beast King Alpha and OTK with Draglubion. While the Draglubion OTK engine remains in most decks, the deck itself has always felt incredibly generic. Nothing the board ended on was really unique. Neither its endboard nor its wincon.</span>  <span>After the release of the new Alien support many people, myself included, tried that out. And while this version had been the most fun and unique so far, it wasn't really the most consistent. You could summon Cosmic Slicer just fine and then summon a Kid but Kid's an uncontested Normal Summon away from being run over with its meager 1600 ATK. And even if you made it past your opponent's Normal Summon you basically ended on a single Bagooska which took twice as long to summon as regular Bagooska.</span>  <span>I think it's no stretch to say this deck was still missing something. There was the ""add 11 cards to my hand"" deck using Bishbaalkin but this deck never took off. (If you can spell Bishbaalkin correctly on your first attempt you play too much yugioh. I play too much yugioh.) By the time you draw all your cards you've already used every card effect there is so either you fill your deck up with handtraps and probably won't get to Bishbaalkin if it's not for exactly Snake Rain or you end up with 6 cards in hand which perfectly mirror your GY and essentially have become useless. And then of course you only end on slightly more than the previously mentioned discount Bagooska.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>In comes DPE.</span>  <span>DPE has taken the meta by storm. It destroys a card every turn and summons itself from the GY every Standby Phase. Let me say that again: Summons. Itself. From. The. Graveyard. Ogdoabyss won't send DPE. DPE actually works with Ogdoadics' own boss monster. Nunu is a 1,5 card combo (send for Zohah) using up your Normal Summon and Snake Rain is a 1,5 card combo (discard for cost) without a Normal Summon which end in DPE plus Ogdoabyss. While this may not seem much, it's DPE and a board wipe and thanks to Water Lily you can easily use Ogdoabyss multiple times by tributing it for Keurse and bringing it back right after. <strong>Ogdoadics have, for probably the first time, became part of their ideal endboard.</strong></span>  <span>Some thoughts and bullet points:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>If you destroy DPE during your own turn first, while risking of runnning into Called By the Grave, you can use Ogdoabyss first to then destroy any follow up they might still have after having their board wiped.</span></li>  	<li><span>If you open Fusion Destiny you can summon Dagda instead of Verte and pop Scythe during your opponent's turn. Neither Scythe nor DPE will be affected by Ogdoabyss.</span></li>  	<li><span>Gamma is insane in this deck and enables Chaos Ruler, which pretty much guarantees combo. Even if you mill either Dasher or Celestial with Chaos Ruler you can simply add them to your hand and still have just milled 4 cards in a GY oriented deck.</span></li>  	<li><span>Still working on some ratios but Water Lily is so easily searchable that you really don't need to open it (if you can't summon Nauya chances are you won't get enough Reptiles into the GY anyways) and after resolving it's effect twice the game should be decided by then anyways. But yeah, ratios might be subject to change.</span></li> </ul> <span>Okay Dogmatika doesn't really contribute anything unique BUT you can still Normal Summon Ecclesia after using Verte/Fusion Destiny which is cool. You can then add Dogmatika Punishment and, if you used Nadir Servant, add Fleur in End Phase with Titaniklad. They won't survive Ogdoabyss but that's fine, they'll have served their purpose.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><span>The 1,5 card combos.</span></span>  <span>My shift is about to end so I'll bring this one to a close. I'll quickly go over the two aforementioned combos.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Nunu + card to send:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Send Nunu from hand to send Zohah from deck</span></li>  	<li><span>Add Zohah by sending the card in hand</span></li>  	<li><span>NS Zohah and SS Nunu from GY</span></li>  	<li><span>Overlay for King of the Feral Imps</span></li>  	<li><span>Imp adds Nauya from deck</span></li>  	<li><span>Send Nauya from hand to send Keurse from deck</span></li>  	<li><span>Tribute Imp for Keurse and then SS Nauya frrom GY with Keurse</span></li>  	<li><span>Nauya adds Water Lily from deck</span></li>  	<li><span>Link both into Verte (Nauya gets banished) --&gt; 4 Reptiles in GY</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Water Lily, send and summon Ogdoabyss</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Verte for DPE</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span>Snake Rain + discard OR Nunu + Nauya:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Activate Snake rain by discarding a card in hand, sending Nunu, Nauya, Keurse and Aleirtt</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Sendung Nunu for Aleirtt and Nauya for Keurse achieves the same game state</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Summon Nunu from GY</span></li>  	<li><span>Tribute Nunu (gets banished) for Keurse and use Keurse to summon Nauya</span></li>  	<li><span>Nauya adds Water Lily</span></li>  	<li><span>Tribute Nauya (gets banished) for Aleirtt, return both Nunu and Nauya to GY with Aleirtt</span></li>  	<li><span>Link both into Verte --&gt; 4 Reptiles in GY</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Water Lily, send and summon Ogdoabyss</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Verte for DPE</span> <ul>  	<li><span>From here on out you can use Nadir Servant, sending Tinaniklad, to search and NS Ecclesia, search Punishment and add Fleur in EP</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"

So here you go. The digital bugs have the ability to change their level, give a boost to insect xyz monsters when used as a material, and summon each other for an xyz summon. That's the bases of this deck, get out some powerful xys monsters most people underestimate. Link monsters like access code are only there to provide support, they are not necessary but do give an advantage. Only threw in the access code because I was lucky and got one for a pack. The rest are there to support the bugs and provide cover while the boss is summoned. You don't have to stick with this exact set up, I'm sure there's ways to improve it. But if you decide to build this deck I wish you good luck and I really hope you enjoy it."

But because Doomking Balerdroch and Zombie World go together like chocolate and peanut butter, you would still prefer to go first and set up this degenerate 2-card board. Speaking of which, Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon Lord can summon a Zombie from your Graveyard during the opponent's turn, so if they try to get stop your Balerdroch from reviving itself with Called By the Grave or Ghost Belle, Zombie Dragon Lord can use his effect to revive it anyway."
