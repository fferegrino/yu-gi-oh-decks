Then, Special Summon Hiro with Saryuja but only if you have up to 3 x MD monsters, including Hiro. Also, although not mandatory, place Baronne on Main Monster Zone (MMZ).</p><p>2) Clear at least 2 x MMZ with Ravenous/Baronne/Raigeki. Then, set all Traps and end your turn. During your opponent's Draw Phase, activate these Traps in order explained below:</p><ol><li>Powerful Rebirth &gt;&gt;&gt; Wattfox</li><li>Reverse Reuse &gt;&gt;&gt; MJ #2 as face-down</li><li>Give and Take &gt;&gt;&gt; Wanghu</li><li>All-Out Attacks</li></ol><p>3) What is going to happen is that Wanghu destroys Wattfox, which shuts down anything your opponent can try to break you, including hand-traps. Then, via All-Out Attacks, MJ #2 will flip face-up and you can start milling your opponent. While your Traps are resolving, feel free to negate one thing your opponent can activate in response to them with Baronne.</p><p>4) After your job is done with Traps, MJ #2 is going to excavate three monsters, which are MJ #2 + Hiro + Wanghu. Should it come to that, place these monsters in order below and know that if you have two more Main Deck monsters, place them as last:</p><ol><li>MJ #2</li><li>Hiro</li><li>Wanghu</li></ol><p>5) Now, your opponent draws 3 cards each time Hiro has been activated.

It is a condensed ball of every problem Yugioh boomers and other card game players will lie about on Twitter. Usually, this is just nonsense, but in our case, it is a guide. Run down the timer with your combos, throw out stupid staples, and make a million negates.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Be the reason someone quits master duel.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">So here&rsquo;s my modern-day deck list for 60 6 samurai. It&rsquo;s very straightforward, you&rsquo;re playing 3 of every six samurai monster that can spam out other six samurai monsters or special summon themselves for free. 3 Kizaru, 3 Grandmaster, 3 Great Shogun Shien, and 3 Kageki.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">We&rsquo;re also running 3 Mizuho and 3 Shinai. Each one of these special summons themself from their hand if you control the other. This matters since they&rsquo;re searchable from secret Six Samurai Kizaru. Even more so since this deck&rsquo;s best 2 extenders are rank 3.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This gets us into a larger point of strategy. Counter generation. Six Samurai as a deck revolve around generating bushido counters every time a Six Samurai monster is summoned. Gateway of the Six Samurai let&rsquo;s us search for a Six Samurai monster for every 4 counters anywhere. But it only generates 2 counters for each summon. This means we either need multiple counter-generating cards or we can use extenders to turn every 2 monsters into a different 2 monsters and some counters.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For example. 2 levels 3&rsquo;s go into M-X Saber invoker which goes into kizaru and a search. Or islolde into hatsune. Going two for 2.5 lets the deck deal with heavy costs and negs that come with link spamming and starting combos.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I&rsquo;ll also mention here the three great shogun shien. It&rsquo;s a hard floodgate of an opponent&rsquo;s spells and traps that summons itself for free. In the TCG I&rsquo;d be a bit more hesitant about running it, but in Master Duel's janky best-of-one format it&rsquo;s so much stronger than it has any right to be.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This list makes use of several powerful engines. Most notable is the Kashtira engine. It&rsquo;s a simple tool that gets us disruption removal and free attack thanks to the field spell.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">But even more interesting is the zodiac engine. Zodiac Barrage has no restrictions or real cost so At its most basic it pulls out an extra material for a link monster or just an extra disruption with Zoodiac Drident. But more interestingly we can use zodiac barrage to destroy six samurai fuma to trigger her effect.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>So it ends up being a plus one. Fuma is also searchable thanks to Isolde two tales of the noble knights or literally any six samurai searcher.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Zodiac Barrage and Kashtiras contribute to what put this deck head and shoulders above my early iterations. Not only is it a stupid wombo combo deck, but you have tools to play going second.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The extra deck is very straightforward. Let&rsquo;s split it into extenders and end board.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">We have the before-mentioned extenders of mx saber invoker and Isolde but let me explain the other 3. Battle Shogun of the Six Samurai is a searcher for Gateway of the Six Samurai. He does take as discard and doesn&rsquo;t lead to any further plays on his own so he has to be used either in specific 3-4 card combos or after we&rsquo;ve done some setup with Isolde and M-X Saber Invoker. Basically, unless you're guaranteed to have follow up don&rsquo;t make him.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Skull Dread Saryuja is a bread and butter extender. Especially since most of this deck is extenders and 1-card engines. Drawing 4 is crazy and with some extra searches, thanks to Isolde, Gateway and Kizaru the put-back 3 cost doesn&rsquo;t hurt.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Leviar is an extender&rsquo;s extender. If we have already used mx saber invoker and Isolde to make Hatsume we can then follow up the hatsume skill with a leviair. To keep the loops going. It&rsquo;s very overkill, but does sustain some otherwise suboptimal starts.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For our end boards, we have a large chunk dedicated to generic link spam. IP Masquerna lets us benefit from leaving out materials. Knightmare Gryphon is a monster effect negate floodgate. Appollosa is just 4 monster negates. And Underworld Goddess is a out to problematic monsters and an extra target for I:P.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For XYZ&rsquo;s we have Abyss Dweller and Bagooska. Bagooska is a simple backup plan. Abyss Dweller is an anti-graveyard floodgate. Master Duel being a best-of-one format makes this awkward to use. Since you kinda just gotta feel it.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Naturia Beast and six samurai shien are our spell negates. Of course, Naturia Beast is a much better play but we need access to Shien&rsquo;s Squire to get it. This means we have to go through a limited number of good but not guaranteed options to get it from the deck. Much more often we&rsquo;ll go for shi en who&rsquo;s only 1 spell or trap negate.</p>"

Today's Level 9 monster we are taking a look at is&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 009&nbsp;</strong>which is a Level 9 EARTH Machine monster whereas its effect could matter less. I should've come to realization of what a Deskbot Prediction Princess Deck should be much sooner, but at the time, I was thinking ""Deskbot 009 is an EARTH monster, this is not going to work,"" like a dumbdumb and I completely forgot that&nbsp;<strong>Machine Duplication&nbsp;</strong>exists. You see, every Deskbot monster has 500 ATK/DEF and they each have their own ways of increasing their ATK/DEF to very large amounts. They are practically begging you to use Machine Duplication with them. And the Deskbot cards actually make getting to 009 extremely easy, specifically&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 003</strong> does. On Normal Summon, 003 can Special Summon a Deskbot monster from Deck, except for itself, which can immediately get a 009 onto the field. There you go. End of story. Now just activate Machine Duplication for 2 more copies of 009 from Deck, and now you've got yourself Rank 9 access and an additional Level 9 monster to boot. So all you really need for combo is&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 003</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Machine Duplication</strong>. Now, we are playing&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</strong> and&nbsp;3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which we can use for Bibliomuse access through Summoning Kaku for free (by Linking 003 into&nbsp;<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong>), but we don't exactly need to rely on it. And if we don't draw Monstrosity or Machine Dupe, we can just use 009 and Kaku as Rank 9 access. You could instead play a <strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong> package with&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> but I like Bibliomuse access more.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">For the monsters: 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei is a Quick Effect to flip a monster face-up or face-down and during the End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down. Tarotreith can either be Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei&rsquo;s End Phase effect. On flip, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from your Deck face-down and she can Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters either face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from GY face-down if she was tributed and sent there. On flip, she can add a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand, and while she&rsquo;s face-up on field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent&rsquo;s effects. For our Flips, we have 2 <strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it from Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</strong> which can Special Summoned from hand if there is a monster in the Extra Monster Zone. This is extremely easy to do in this Deck with you being able to Link off a Normal Summoned&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 003</strong> for a&nbsp;<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong>. Also, you can target a face-up monster in the EMZ and equip it and when this card destroys a monster by battle, you can Special Summon a monster card that is equipped to it. Kaku is good for just getting a Level 9 onto the field, but it can also act as removal in some applications as well. And on top of both of those things, it makes for a good Small World bridge due to its Type and Attribute. 3&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 009</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 003</strong>. 009 is just a Level 9 monster that we can easily access through 003 and Machine Dupe. 003 can Special Summon a Deskbot straight from Deck on Normal Summon. Both have 500 ATK which means that they can both be targeted by&nbsp;<strong>Machine Duplication</strong> and because Machine Dupe is not a once per turn, if you draw more than one, you can dupe 009 first for Rank 9 plays and then dupe 003 for Link plays. 3&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald</strong> which sends a Fairy from Deck or Extra Deck to GY to increase its Level by the Level of the sent monster. And because it has 500 ATK and is a LIGHT Fairy, it makes as a good way to bridge to 003. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can also banish it from GY during the Standby Phase in order to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. 3&nbsp;<strong>Small World</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which can either Special Summon a Level 9 from hand or target a Level 9 you control and Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from Deck with a different Type and Attribute than it but with different names. 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Machine Duplication</strong> which targets a Machine monster you control with 500 or less ATK and Special Summons up to 2 monsters from Deck with the same name as that monster.

Uses some multiple of extra deck cards in case your up against Kashtira. I've been working on this deck since the Merli ban on masterduel. Not as viable in other formats due to Kitkallos ban.

Typically if you don't full-combo, it's because you already drew what you were searching and just opened boss stage + monstrosity anyways. There are also a lot of two-card combos that get you to the ideal board even if you don&rsquo;t draw any starters, but in most cases you&rsquo;re working with one-card combos that use additional cards as extension to play through hand traps.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">An issue this deck had previously was drawing a Generaider you wanted to summon off of Boss Stage.

When summoning Jormungandr using Laevateinn, you can equip any spells from grave that might dead a Superheavy on a future turn if it looks like you might have to go for a second round of combo.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">The Superheavies also give you access to a Pendulum Summon - Regrettably only at a maximum scale of 8, but that&rsquo;s more than enough to Pend extra superheavies, Lee, or Loptyr.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Weaknesses &amp; Deck Building Concessions:</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">There's a really good argument to play 1 Superheavy Samurai Scales and a decent argument to play 1 Superheavy Samurai Security, as they can sometimes help you play through hand traps. That's the main reason Soulgaia Booster and Soulpiercer were bumped to three, and Vala cut to 1. I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable including them due to how many garnets this deck already has, but they do have their own merit. I even spent time testing Superheavy Samurai Magnet as a way to increase the amount of two-card combos and as a way to bait/play through interruption, but at least in my testing, it didn&rsquo;t result in any meaningful/guaranteed additional lines. </span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">I didn't feel good about it, but I cut the Ty-Phon for Baronne &amp; Assault Synchro Stardust Dragon. Cutting Crocodragon Archethys didn't feel bad; Typically if you're able to make it you're already winning anyways. If you get hand trapped once or twice, if you can't force through to Ib &amp; Monstrosity you can usually at least end on Baronne. You might cut Trencher for Ty-Phon, but I&rsquo;m not familiar enough with Generaider to make that call.</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">If your opponent holds the Ash for Monstrosity, you're screwed... Unless you can weave in Gigant X for Pathfinder before summoning Trishula, in which case you can just pend it out. You at least still get to Boss Stage in this scenario, and I liked having a secondary way to bridge the Superheavies to the Generaiders. If you open Pathfinder, just think of it as bad Loptyr.</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">The Ib and Soulpiercer searches are typically chainblocked by Wakaushi effect to scale itself and Tilting effect to summon Wakaushi from the extra respectively.</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">A hand trap on Titling/Gigant X typically hurts as well, though sometimes it just doesn't matter and you can play through it either by setting up an additional Superheavy body or by using it to bait interaction when you already have another way to Wakaushi. Same goes for an Ash on specifically Big Benkei. However, all of these spots are risky to hand trap since certain extenders let you play through them unscathed; The conundrum is kind of like pre-banlist R-ACE.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">I tried really hard to make a version of the combo where you summon Baronne before triggering Monstrosity, but I seriously struggled to make both happen.

It also allows you to cut Nidhogg, since you no longer have to worry about activating Monstrosity on Trias Hierarchia.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Conclusion:</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">You&rsquo;re still playing Generaider. You still have the potential to lose to every hand trap under the sun, but at least this build can sometimes play through them. However, the heightened ceiling that the guaranteed access to Monstrosity provides (via Ib) is ludicrous. If you pull off the combo, you&rsquo;ve pretty much won the game on the spot. I struggle to imagine a deck that can break this board consistently without cards like Lava Golem or Sphere Mode.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
