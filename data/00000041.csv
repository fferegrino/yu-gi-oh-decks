Then, Special Summon Hiro with Saryuja but only if you have up to 3 x MD monsters, including Hiro. Also, although not mandatory, place Baronne on Main Monster Zone (MMZ).</p><p>2) Clear at least 2 x MMZ with Ravenous/Baronne/Raigeki. Then, set all Traps and end your turn. During your opponent's Draw Phase, activate these Traps in order explained below:</p><ol><li>Powerful Rebirth &gt;&gt;&gt; Wattfox</li><li>Reverse Reuse &gt;&gt;&gt; MJ #2 as face-down</li><li>Give and Take &gt;&gt;&gt; Wanghu</li><li>All-Out Attacks</li></ol><p>3) What is going to happen is that Wanghu destroys Wattfox, which shuts down anything your opponent can try to break you, including hand-traps. Then, via All-Out Attacks, MJ #2 will flip face-up and you can start milling your opponent. While your Traps are resolving, feel free to negate one thing your opponent can activate in response to them with Baronne.</p><p>4) After your job is done with Traps, MJ #2 is going to excavate three monsters, which are MJ #2 + Hiro + Wanghu. Should it come to that, place these monsters in order below and know that if you have two more Main Deck monsters, place them as last:</p><ol><li>MJ #2</li><li>Hiro</li><li>Wanghu</li></ol><p>5) Now, your opponent draws 3 cards each time Hiro has been activated.

It is a condensed ball of every problem Yugioh boomers and other card game players will lie about on Twitter. Usually, this is just nonsense, but in our case, it is a guide. Run down the timer with your combos, throw out stupid staples, and make a million negates.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Be the reason someone quits master duel.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">So here&rsquo;s my modern-day deck list for 60 6 samurai. It&rsquo;s very straightforward, you&rsquo;re playing 3 of every six samurai monster that can spam out other six samurai monsters or special summon themselves for free. 3 Kizaru, 3 Grandmaster, 3 Great Shogun Shien, and 3 Kageki.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">We&rsquo;re also running 3 Mizuho and 3 Shinai. Each one of these special summons themself from their hand if you control the other. This matters since they&rsquo;re searchable from secret Six Samurai Kizaru. Even more so since this deck&rsquo;s best 2 extenders are rank 3.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This gets us into a larger point of strategy. Counter generation. Six Samurai as a deck revolve around generating bushido counters every time a Six Samurai monster is summoned. Gateway of the Six Samurai let&rsquo;s us search for a Six Samurai monster for every 4 counters anywhere. But it only generates 2 counters for each summon. This means we either need multiple counter-generating cards or we can use extenders to turn every 2 monsters into a different 2 monsters and some counters.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For example. 2 levels 3&rsquo;s go into M-X Saber invoker which goes into kizaru and a search. Or islolde into hatsune. Going two for 2.5 lets the deck deal with heavy costs and negs that come with link spamming and starting combos.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I&rsquo;ll also mention here the three great shogun shien. It&rsquo;s a hard floodgate of an opponent&rsquo;s spells and traps that summons itself for free. In the TCG I&rsquo;d be a bit more hesitant about running it, but in Master Duel's janky best-of-one format it&rsquo;s so much stronger than it has any right to be.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This list makes use of several powerful engines. Most notable is the Kashtira engine. It&rsquo;s a simple tool that gets us disruption removal and free attack thanks to the field spell.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">But even more interesting is the zodiac engine. Zodiac Barrage has no restrictions or real cost so At its most basic it pulls out an extra material for a link monster or just an extra disruption with Zoodiac Drident. But more interestingly we can use zodiac barrage to destroy six samurai fuma to trigger her effect.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>So it ends up being a plus one. Fuma is also searchable thanks to Isolde two tales of the noble knights or literally any six samurai searcher.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Zodiac Barrage and Kashtiras contribute to what put this deck head and shoulders above my early iterations. Not only is it a stupid wombo combo deck, but you have tools to play going second.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The extra deck is very straightforward. Let&rsquo;s split it into extenders and end board.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">We have the before-mentioned extenders of mx saber invoker and Isolde but let me explain the other 3. Battle Shogun of the Six Samurai is a searcher for Gateway of the Six Samurai. He does take as discard and doesn&rsquo;t lead to any further plays on his own so he has to be used either in specific 3-4 card combos or after we&rsquo;ve done some setup with Isolde and M-X Saber Invoker. Basically, unless you're guaranteed to have follow up don&rsquo;t make him.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Skull Dread Saryuja is a bread and butter extender. Especially since most of this deck is extenders and 1-card engines. Drawing 4 is crazy and with some extra searches, thanks to Isolde, Gateway and Kizaru the put-back 3 cost doesn&rsquo;t hurt.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Leviar is an extender&rsquo;s extender. If we have already used mx saber invoker and Isolde to make Hatsume we can then follow up the hatsume skill with a leviair. To keep the loops going. It&rsquo;s very overkill, but does sustain some otherwise suboptimal starts.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For our end boards, we have a large chunk dedicated to generic link spam. IP Masquerna lets us benefit from leaving out materials. Knightmare Gryphon is a monster effect negate floodgate. Appollosa is just 4 monster negates. And Underworld Goddess is a out to problematic monsters and an extra target for I:P.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For XYZ&rsquo;s we have Abyss Dweller and Bagooska. Bagooska is a simple backup plan. Abyss Dweller is an anti-graveyard floodgate. Master Duel being a best-of-one format makes this awkward to use. Since you kinda just gotta feel it.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Naturia Beast and six samurai shien are our spell negates. Of course, Naturia Beast is a much better play but we need access to Shien&rsquo;s Squire to get it. This means we have to go through a limited number of good but not guaranteed options to get it from the deck. Much more often we&rsquo;ll go for shi en who&rsquo;s only 1 spell or trap negate.</p>"

Today's Level 9 monster we are taking a look at is&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 009&nbsp;</strong>which is a Level 9 EARTH Machine monster whereas its effect could matter less. I should've come to realization of what a Deskbot Prediction Princess Deck should be much sooner, but at the time, I was thinking ""Deskbot 009 is an EARTH monster, this is not going to work,"" like a dumbdumb and I completely forgot that&nbsp;<strong>Machine Duplication&nbsp;</strong>exists. You see, every Deskbot monster has 500 ATK/DEF and they each have their own ways of increasing their ATK/DEF to very large amounts. They are practically begging you to use Machine Duplication with them. And the Deskbot cards actually make getting to 009 extremely easy, specifically&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 003</strong> does. On Normal Summon, 003 can Special Summon a Deskbot monster from Deck, except for itself, which can immediately get a 009 onto the field. There you go. End of story. Now just activate Machine Duplication for 2 more copies of 009 from Deck, and now you've got yourself Rank 9 access and an additional Level 9 monster to boot. So all you really need for combo is&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 003</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Machine Duplication</strong>. Now, we are playing&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</strong> and&nbsp;3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which we can use for Bibliomuse access through Summoning Kaku for free (by Linking 003 into&nbsp;<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong>), but we don't exactly need to rely on it. And if we don't draw Monstrosity or Machine Dupe, we can just use 009 and Kaku as Rank 9 access. You could instead play a <strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong> package with&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> but I like Bibliomuse access more.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">For the monsters: 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei is a Quick Effect to flip a monster face-up or face-down and during the End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down. Tarotreith can either be Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei&rsquo;s End Phase effect. On flip, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from your Deck face-down and she can Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters either face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from GY face-down if she was tributed and sent there. On flip, she can add a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand, and while she&rsquo;s face-up on field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent&rsquo;s effects. For our Flips, we have 2 <strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it from Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</strong> which can Special Summoned from hand if there is a monster in the Extra Monster Zone. This is extremely easy to do in this Deck with you being able to Link off a Normal Summoned&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 003</strong> for a&nbsp;<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong>. Also, you can target a face-up monster in the EMZ and equip it and when this card destroys a monster by battle, you can Special Summon a monster card that is equipped to it. Kaku is good for just getting a Level 9 onto the field, but it can also act as removal in some applications as well. And on top of both of those things, it makes for a good Small World bridge due to its Type and Attribute. 3&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 009</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 003</strong>. 009 is just a Level 9 monster that we can easily access through 003 and Machine Dupe. 003 can Special Summon a Deskbot straight from Deck on Normal Summon. Both have 500 ATK which means that they can both be targeted by&nbsp;<strong>Machine Duplication</strong> and because Machine Dupe is not a once per turn, if you draw more than one, you can dupe 009 first for Rank 9 plays and then dupe 003 for Link plays. 3&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald</strong> which sends a Fairy from Deck or Extra Deck to GY to increase its Level by the Level of the sent monster. And because it has 500 ATK and is a LIGHT Fairy, it makes as a good way to bridge to 003. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can also banish it from GY during the Standby Phase in order to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. 3&nbsp;<strong>Small World</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which can either Special Summon a Level 9 from hand or target a Level 9 you control and Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from Deck with a different Type and Attribute than it but with different names. 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Machine Duplication</strong> which targets a Machine monster you control with 500 or less ATK and Special Summons up to 2 monsters from Deck with the same name as that monster.

Uses some multiple of extra deck cards in case your up against Kashtira. I've been working on this deck since the Merli ban on masterduel. Not as viable in other formats due to Kitkallos ban.

Typically if you don't full-combo, it's because you already drew what you were searching and just opened boss stage + monstrosity anyways. There are also a lot of two-card combos that get you to the ideal board even if you don&rsquo;t draw any starters, but in most cases you&rsquo;re working with one-card combos that use additional cards as extension to play through hand traps.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">An issue this deck had previously was drawing a Generaider you wanted to summon off of Boss Stage.

When summoning Jormungandr using Laevateinn, you can equip any spells from grave that might dead a Superheavy on a future turn if it looks like you might have to go for a second round of combo.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">The Superheavies also give you access to a Pendulum Summon - Regrettably only at a maximum scale of 8, but that&rsquo;s more than enough to Pend extra superheavies, Lee, or Loptyr.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Weaknesses &amp; Deck Building Concessions:</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">There's a really good argument to play 1 Superheavy Samurai Scales and a decent argument to play 1 Superheavy Samurai Security, as they can sometimes help you play through hand traps. That's the main reason Soulgaia Booster and Soulpiercer were bumped to three, and Vala cut to 1. I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable including them due to how many garnets this deck already has, but they do have their own merit. I even spent time testing Superheavy Samurai Magnet as a way to increase the amount of two-card combos and as a way to bait/play through interruption, but at least in my testing, it didn&rsquo;t result in any meaningful/guaranteed additional lines. </span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">I didn't feel good about it, but I cut the Ty-Phon for Baronne &amp; Assault Synchro Stardust Dragon. Cutting Crocodragon Archethys didn't feel bad; Typically if you're able to make it you're already winning anyways. If you get hand trapped once or twice, if you can't force through to Ib &amp; Monstrosity you can usually at least end on Baronne. You might cut Trencher for Ty-Phon, but I&rsquo;m not familiar enough with Generaider to make that call.</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">If your opponent holds the Ash for Monstrosity, you're screwed... Unless you can weave in Gigant X for Pathfinder before summoning Trishula, in which case you can just pend it out. You at least still get to Boss Stage in this scenario, and I liked having a secondary way to bridge the Superheavies to the Generaiders. If you open Pathfinder, just think of it as bad Loptyr.</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">The Ib and Soulpiercer searches are typically chainblocked by Wakaushi effect to scale itself and Tilting effect to summon Wakaushi from the extra respectively.</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">A hand trap on Titling/Gigant X typically hurts as well, though sometimes it just doesn't matter and you can play through it either by setting up an additional Superheavy body or by using it to bait interaction when you already have another way to Wakaushi. Same goes for an Ash on specifically Big Benkei.

I struggle to imagine a deck that can break this board consistently without cards like Lava Golem or Sphere Mode.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

It has many starters allowing you to get things going.<br /><br />Ash can even be used as a starter to link into Almiraj and then Gardna. I love Iblee lock and honestly, it gets me a scoop more often than not, and if not doing the combo to rip more than half of their extra deck gets me the scoop. One huge weakness is people with little or no extra deck usage so I added a branded twist to the deck to balance this allowing for big extra deck monsters to also be summoned. There is also the ability to summon Luluwalilith with using her as either a target with Maximus if you see no way to get Alba Zoa or if you are able to summon Alba Zoa summoning Cartesia at the end of the turn. Use her effect only when your opponent uses a monster effect to summon a monster (Thing Magician Souls or Mathtech) allowing you to summon Grang in the chain, then when the monster is summoned you can use both his effects using the first to send him to the GY then using the 2nd effect to summon Luluwalilith.<br /><br />While this deck does have flaws and is in no way Meta, you can still climb high and to be honest I use it as I love it. The changes you could make is one less Dogmatikalamity for another thrust or swap Iblee for Maxx c and while it pains me to say this White Relic &amp; White Knight see very veryyyyy little play but are good when you find that perfect slot.

(maybe)","<p>Once again in my never-ending crusade to make my favorite archetypes cook in ways I never thought possible, I have found the best way to play Gameciel Turbo! Now, the concept of this deck is simple, go into Gameciel with Kyoutou Waterfront and bully our opponent with well-timed non one per turn omni-negates. However, because Konami won't give Kaijus any new support (hopefully for now), our best shot of playing Kyoutou are opening it, Terraforming, or Ancient Fairy Dragon and because Kaijus are limited by their own summon clause, Saryuja Skull Dread is our best friend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now what deck can link climb, synchro summon, AND search Kyoutou? Why Crusadia, of course! With two card combos that can end on two Link 4s, this deck has the sauce to get the job done. And of course, because it's me, I got a nice, little tech that gasses up the deck surprisingly well. The honorary Crusadia monsters Parallel eXceed and Link Infra-Flier are perfect for the deck and searchable with Cynet Mining for the latter, giving the deck functionally 7-8 more Crusadia monsters to extend with (depending on personal ratios), which means tehnically one Crusadia name is full combo with one of those cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The deck isn't the best, of course. The right number of negates can shut it down and that stupid rock is a thorn in its side, but if it can pop-off, it's a threat to behold. Not to mention it cheap, so you could cook it up for a relatively low price. What Kaijus you use outside of Gameciel (if any at all) is up to you all.</p>"

Either way, the Ancient Gear support from Legacy of Destruction was revealed and I am quite impressed with we got. If anything, it heavily supports the Fusion aspect of the Deck, giving you a much easier way to get an&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Golem</strong> onto the field, or in this case, <strong>Ancient Gear Dark Golem</strong>, whose name becomes Ancient Gear Golem on field, while also giving you an easy way to search for <strong>Ancient Gear Fusion</strong>. And because you have an Ancient Gear Golem on field, you are now able to Fuse using materials from Deck with Ancient Gear Fusion. The Level 9 monster we are looking at today is&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Megaton Golem</strong> which is a Level 9 EARTH Machine Fusion Monster that requires 3 Ancient Gear Monsters as material. I could care less about what its effect does. However, the Ancient Gear support makes this card comically easy to get out onto the field, and even two of them for that fact. In my previous Ancient Gear Prediction Princess Deck that featured <strong>Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon</strong> as our Level 9 of choice, I talked about not even trying to make Megaton Golem because of how hard it was for Ancient Gears to get to their Fusion Monsters unless you literally draw the right 3 or 4-card combo. But their support in Legacy of Destruction requires a simple 2.5 card combo. You need<strong> Ancient Gear Tanker</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Dark Golem</strong>, and a discard. Normal Summon Tanker whose effect triggers on Normal Summon to Special Summon an Ancient Gear from hand ignoring its Summoning Conditions. Special Summon Dark Golem whose effect on Special Summon triggers to add up to 2 Ancient Gear cards and/or <strong>Geartown </strong>from your Deck to your hand, then discarding a card. Add&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Fusion</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Geartown</strong>. Activate Geartown and then use Tanker's effect to pop it. If you have a second copy of Ancient Gear Fusion in hand, use Geartown's effect to Special Summon another copy of Ancient Gear Dark Golem from Deck. If you don't, then just Special Summon <strong>Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon&nbsp;</strong>from hand, Deck, or GY. Activate Ancient Gear Fusion to fuse using your Dark Golem on field and 2 other Ancient Gears in Deck to Fusion Summon&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Megaton Golem</strong>. From here, you can go for a Rank 9, or if you have the second Gear Fusion and Special Summoned another Ancient Gear Dark Golem off of Geartown, you can Fuse into another Megaton Golem if you want. Is this Deck better than the version of Ancient Gear Prediction Princess that focuses on Reactor Dragon? I think that both Decks' consistency is pretty much around the same. You need to jump through more hoops when it comes to Fusion Ancient Gear Prediction Princess compared to normal Ancient Gear Prediction Princess, but the Fusion variant is definitely much cooler and seems almost like an add-on to the previous version, giving you the boon of being able to utilize the Ancient Gear Fusion Monsters like Megaton Golem and Chaos Giant as OTK tools.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Main Deck monsters: 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on field face-up or face-down and she can also Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down during the End Phase. Tarotreith must either be Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei's End Phase Effect. Her Flip Effect allows you to Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down, and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of monsters you control either face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from GY if she was tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect allows you to search for a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck and while she is face-up on field, she gives all of your Ritual Monsters targeting and destruction protection from your opponent's effects. 1&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>. Deus-X negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it. Pot of the Forbidden's Flip Effect allows you to choose 1 effect between drawing 2 cards, returning all Spell/Traps on field to the hand, destroying all monsters your opponent controls, and looking at your opponent's hand and shuffling a card of your choice from it back into the Deck. For the Ancient Gear monsters, we are playing 1 <strong>Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon</strong>, 3 <strong>Ancient Gear Dark Golem</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Tanker</strong>. Before I get into them, I want to talk about&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Commander</strong>. While it is on field, you can send an&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Golem</strong> from yoru hand, Deck, or face-up Monster Zone to the GY to immediately Normal Summon an Ancient Gear monster. And if you Normal or Special Summon Ancient Gear Golem, you can Special Summon an Ancient Gear Golem from your hand or GY ignoring its Summoning Conditions. And you can also banish Commander from GY to place an Ancient Gear Continuous Trap from your hand face-up on your field. Ancient Gear Commander is not a bad card. If anything, it gives Ancient Gears something to do turn 1 other than make&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Howitzer&nbsp;</strong>pass. But there are several issues that prevent it from being too good or realistically that good in a non-pure Ancient Gear Deck like this one. For one, you need to play the original Ancient Gear Golem for its effect.&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Golem - Ultimate Pound</strong> is not listed in its effect which goes against the entirety of the Legendary Duelists Ancient Gear support with cards like&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Frame</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Megaton Golem</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Fusion</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Cross-Dimensional Duel</strong> mentioning Ultimate Pound in their effect next to the original Ancient Gear Golem. Ultimate Pound does not have its name be treated as Ancient Gear Golem at all, so it would've been really nice if we were able to utilize Ultimate Pound with the Legacy of Destruction Ancient Gear support. Like imagine Special Summoning Ultimate Pound with Tanker and popping it with Tanker's effect to search for a Polymerization and adding back another Ancient Gear from GY to have the ability to go into&nbsp;<strong>Guardian Chimera</strong>. I'm not saying that you would be playing Ultimate Pound if the support did name it, but it would've been nice to have the option to do so, especially in my case because Guardian Chimera is a Level 9 which is great for Monstrosity purposes. This all makes Ancient Gear Commander better in a pure version of Ancient Gear rather than in a Deck utilizing the Ancient Gear cards as a supplemental engine. Its effects require you to play the original Ancient Gear Golem and the plays that it does manage to facilitate are better for pure Ancient Gears going first. Going back to the Ancient Gears we are playing, Reactor Dragon is a Level 9 that we can access from hand, Deck, or GY by popping our copy of&nbsp;<strong>Geartown</strong> that we will be searching. You could play 2, but I feel like it is non-ironically better and easier to just fuse into a Megaton Golem for the second Level 9. Ancient Gear Dark Golem is treated as Ancient Gear Golem while on field or in GY. If it is Normal or Special Summoned, you can add up to 2 Ancient Gear cards and/or Geartown from your Deck then discard a card at the cost of being unable to set cards for the rest of the turn. And of course, it has the Ancient Gear effect of making your opponent unable to activate Spell/Trap cards if it attacks until the end of the Damage Step. I want to note that Dark Golem does not say that the cards you search need to be of different names. You can search 2&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Fusion</strong> or 2&nbsp;<strong>Geartown</strong> if you really wanted which is nice to know based on what hand you draw. Tanker can Special Summon an Ancient Gear from hand other than itself ignoing its Summoning Conditions on Normal or Special Summon. But if your opponent controls a monster, you can Special Summon that monster from your GY instead. While it is on the field, you can target a face-up card you control and destroy it to give all Ancient Gear Golem and all monsters you control that mention it 600 ATK for the rest of the turn. You could play Ultimate Pound to go with Ancient Gear Tanker, but getting Dark Golem off of it is so much better considering that you can search for Geartown off of Dark Golem and pop it with Tanker.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction&nbsp;</strong>which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down, and you can also banish it from your GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess monster from your Deck face-down. 2&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> which is used to Ritual Summon Prediction Princess Tarotrei and you can also banish it from your GY except the turn it was sent there to search for a Prediction Princess monster. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Clockwork Night</strong> which turns all face-up monsters on the field into Machine monsters, giving all of your Machine monsters 500 ATK/DEf while your opponent's Machine monsters lose 500 ATK/DEF. But the effect that we are playing this card for is its GY effect which is that you can banish it can discard a card to search for an EARTH Machine monster from Deck. 3 <strong>Foolish Burial Goods</strong> which we are using to send Clockwork Night from Deck to GY. 3&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Fusion</strong> which Fusion Summons an Ancient Gear Fusion Monster from Extra Deck using monsters from hand or field as Fusion Materials, but if you use an&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Golem</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Golem - Ultimate Pound</strong> you control as material, you can also use monsters in your Deck as material. This card is not once per turn, so if you draw multiple, you can Fusion Summon multiple times a turn, and since Ancient Gear Dark Golem becomes Ancient Gear Golem on field, you can Fuse using your Deck as well. 1&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Advance </strong>which adds an Ancient Gear Spell/Trap from your Deck to your hand on activation other than itself. As a soft once per turn, you can Tribute a monster to draw a card and also gives you the ability to Normal Summon Level 5 or higher monsters that are Ancient Gear Golem or that mention it for the rest of the turn. You also cannot set cards the turn you activate this card. We are playing this card as our 4th copy of Ancient Gear Fusion. You don't need to play this card, but it is nice to have this as an extra copy of Gear Fusion because I just like the feeling of Fusion Summoning 2&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Megaton Golems</strong> and using them to Xyz Summon <strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Geartown</strong> which gives both players the ability to Normal Summon Ancient Gear monsters for 1 less Tribute and when it is destroyed and sent to the GY, you can Special Summon an Ancient Geare monster from hand, Deck, or GY with our targets being Reactor Dragon and Dark Golem where Dark Golem can actually be Special Summoned unlike the original Ancient Gear Golem and Ultimate Pound.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Chaos Ancient Gear Giant</strong> which needs 4 Ancient Gears as Fusion Material which is comically easy with Dark Golem being treated as Ancient Gear Golem and also being able to search for Ancient Gear Fusion. It is unaffected by your opponent's Spell/Trap effects and your opponent cannot activate their monsters' effects during the Battle Phase. It can attack all monsters your opponent controls once each and it inflicts piercing damage. I feel like it would be criminal not to play this card when you are playing the new Ancient Gear support which practically screams make Chaos Giant with how easy it is to get Dark Golem onto field and search for Ancient Gear Fusion. 2&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Gear Megaton Golem</strong>. Its effects really do not matter at all other than it being able to float into an Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem from Extra Deck if your opponent removes it from the field.

Pegasus would be proud","<p>Its hard to stall out w/this deck. I've tinkered and fidgeted around and tested it to where I've been happy and consistent with it. Its happy going first or second. 1st works great to setup your toon board and then strike for direct hits on turn 2. Kashtira Fenrir and Unicorn grab awesome tools. The black stone of legend tributes itself for Red-Eyes Toon Dragon, have another toon in hand? Special it out w/RETD. Getting ToonKingdom as quicky as possible to keep your field stacked is great. Lots of cards to bait your opponent into Ash and even if you get Drolled you could stil be okay if you can get TK on the field and then use Toon Pageflip you can still reveal 3 and let your opponent randomly choose which one they'll have you special summon out. Kashtira Birth not only allows Unicorn and Fenrir to be normnal summoned but also allows the other toons outside of BLS to be normal summoned. If you can snag an opponents monster, its now a toon as has the same abilitt to attack dirrect ignoring the monsters and with Toon Kingdom its also protected.&nbsp;</p>"

Through a 2-card combo, you are able to get Ib onto the field, search for&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>, and Synchro Summon a Level 9 monster. However, this Deck is not that. Before I get to the Ice Barrier Deck with Ib, I want to show off Ice Barrier Prediction Princess featuring&nbsp;<strong>Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</strong> as our Level 9 monster of choice. You can't go into it with Ib, but you can definitely go into it with pure Ice Barrier, especially with their new support from TW01. Trishula is a Level 9 WATER Dragon Synchro Monster that requires 1 Tuner and 2 or more non-Tuner monsters as Synchro Material. On Synchro Summon, Trishula can banish up to 1 card each from your opponent's hand, field, and GY with the card in their hand being banished at random. For a 3-card combo that gets you a single handloop and full Prediction Princess combo, that isn't too bad for all things considered. It still isn't great, but it's the thought that counts (probably). Our 3-card combo consists of&nbsp;<strong>Georgius, Swordsman of the Ice Barrier</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Hexa Spirit of the Ice Barrier</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>. Normal Summon Hexa Spirit and use its effect to send&nbsp;<strong>Mirror Magic Master of the Ice Barrier</strong> (I swear, they are running out of names for these cards) to the GY and change its Level to 2. M^3 of the Ice Barrier triggers upon hitting the GY to search for <strong>General Wayne of the Ice Barrier</strong>. Since you control an Ice Barrier monster, Special Summon Georgius from hand and use its effect on Special Summon to Special Summon General Wayne from hand. Wayne triggers on Special Summon to search for&nbsp;<strong>Winds Over the Ice Barrier</strong>. Activate Winds to tribute Georgius to Special Summon a Level 2 non-Tuner Ice Barrier monster from Deck. Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Zuijin of the Ice Barrier</strong> (which is the only one we are playing). 2+2+5=9, so Synchro Summon Trish and banish a card out of your opponent's hand. Activate Monstrosity and now you are on your way. With Ice Barrier having a card like&nbsp;<strong>Medallion of the Ice Barrier</strong> as a non-once-per-turn search for any Ice Barrier monster in addition to generic search tools like&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>, it is pretty easy to to actually get here as long as you have Monstrosity. And you also have cards like&nbsp;<strong>Foolish Burial</strong> to send M^3 and&nbsp;<strong>One for One</strong> to get Hexa Spirit from Deck.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Main Deck Monsters: 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on field face-up or face-down and she can also Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down during the End Phase. Tarotreith must either be Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei's End Phase Effect. Her Flip Effect allows you to Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down, and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of monsters you control either face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from GY if she was tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect allows you to search for a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck and while she is face-up on field, she gives all of your Ritual Monsters targeting and destruction protection from your opponent's effects. 1 <strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> and 1 <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>. Deus-X negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it. Pot of the Forbidden's Flip Effect allows you to choose 1 effect between drawing 2 cards, returning all Spell/Traps on field to the hand, destroying all monsters your opponent controls, and looking at your opponent's hand and shuffling a card of your choice from it back into the Deck. For the Ice Barrier monsters, we are playing 1&nbsp;<strong>General Wayne of the Ice Barrier</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Georgius, Swordsman of the Ice Barrier</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Mirror Magic Master of the Ice Barrier</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Zuijin of the Ice Barrier</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Hexa Spirit of the Ice Barrier</strong>. I'll be ignoring their floogate/floodgate-adjacent effects because they frankly do not matter in the slightest. General Wayne can Special Summon himself from hand if your opponent controls a monster and you control an Ice Barrier Monster and on Normal or Special Summon, you can search for an Ice Barrier Spell/Trap from Deck. Because we are aiming to go first, we only play the 1 copy to search for it and Special Summon it by another effect. Georgius can Special Summon itself from hand if you control an Ice Barrier monster and if he is Normal or Special Summoned, you can Special Summon a Level 5 or lower Ice Barrier monster from hand or GY. Mirror Magic Master can Tribute 1 other Effect Monster you control to Special Summon up to 3 Ice Barrier Tokens (Aqua/WATER/Level 1/ATK 0/DEF 0) and then Mirror Magic Master's Level is increased by the same number of Tokens you Summoned but you cannot Special Summon monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn except for WATER monsters. Also, if M^3 is sent to GY, you can add an Ice Barrier card that is banished or in your Deck to your hand except for M^3 of the Ice Barrier. You realistically only need to play 1, but you kind of really need to send it to GY, so playing 2 ensures that there is at least 1 in Deck to send to GY. Zuijin can Tribute itself to Special Summon a Level 5 or higher Ice Barrier from hand and if it is in GY, you can&nbsp; target a Level 3 or higher WATER monster you control, reduce its Level by exactly 2 and Special Summon Zuijin from GY, but banish it when it leaves the field. We are only playing Zuijin as a Level 2 non-Tuner Ice Barrier to get from Deck with Winds Over the Ice Barrier, but you can realistically play any Level 2 non-Tuner Ice Barrier. It is just that Zuijin has a GY effect that can allow you to use it as an extender or something. Hexa Spirit can send a Level 3 or lower Ice Barrier monster from Deck to GY to have its Level become the Level of the sent monster until the end of the turn. We are using this effect to send Mirror Magic Master from Deck for a search while also modulating Hexa Spirit's Level.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion&nbsp;</strong>for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Medallion of the Ice Barrier</strong> which is a non-once-per-turn search for any Ice Barrier monster from Deck which is really good for consistency. 3&nbsp;<strong>Winds Over the Ice Barrier</strong> which tributes any number of Ice Barrier monsters to Special Summon the same number of Level 4 or lower Ice Barrier monsters from Deck with different names. And during your Main Phase, you can banish this card from GY except during the turn it was sent there to target an Ice Barrier monster that is banished or in GY and add it back to hand. 3 <strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down, and you can also banish it from your GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess monster from your Deck face-down. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which can either Special Summon a Level 9 monster from hand or target a Level 9 monster you control and Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from your Deck with a different Type and Attribute than that monster but with different names. 1&nbsp;<strong>One for One</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Foolish Burial</strong>. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Solemn Judgment</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong> which Special Summons a Flip Monster from Deck face-down on Fusion Summon. 1&nbsp;<strong>Trishula, Zero Dragon of the Ice Barrier</strong> which needs a Tuner and 2 or more non-Tuners as Material. On Synchro Summon, it can banish up to 3 cards your opponent controls and if it is Synchro Summoned and destroyed by your opponent's card, you can Special Summon regular Trishula from Extra Deck or GY, make its ATK 3300 and halve the ATK of all face-up monsters your opponent controls and negate their effects. Big Trish is just something that Lancea can float into. 1 <strong>Lancea, Dragonic Ancestor of the Ice Spirit Mountain</strong> which can once per chain Special Summon an Ice Barrier monster from hand, Deck, Extra Deck, or GY if your opponent Special Summons a monster(s) and change a monster your opponent controls from Attack Position to Defense Position. This effect is a hard twice per turn. And if Lancea is Synchro Summoned and leaves the field by your opponent's card, you can Special Summon an Ice Barrier Synchro Monster from Extra Deck which is treated as a Synchro Summon. 1&nbsp;<strong>Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> for Ritual searches. 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>S:P Little Knight</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Gravity Controller</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 3&nbsp;<strong>NIbiru, the Primal Being</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>"

Since they banned Isolde, I've turned back to Pendulum Magician and cooked up a good list and i went undefeated. Since its a rogue contender people don't know how to handtrap the deck or use negates against it, so you can always end on multiple internuptions, and break boards going second. For going first you can side Crossout and handtraps(droll,nib) and you can also go for the Dracoslayer engine to fetch any field spell from your deck, I've played Necrovalley and Secret Village, and decks can't play throigh the fieldspell + 5 negates.Your typical gameplan consists of getting the new Supreme King Gate Magician out on the field and use its effect to get multiples in rotation.

Tearlament monsters are ideal to mill as much as possible to turbo out powerful fusion monsters like Grapha and Rulkallos to protect your combo lines. Like every Tearlaments strategy, this deck aims to mill as much as possible and gain beneficial effects from those mills. The reliance on mills makes this strategy unpredictable and luck dependant, meaning that there are hardly any straightforward combos. Combos are hand/mill dependent - leaving the rest of the game up to the duelists individual skill, decision making and mental fortitude (that's the Tearlaments is regarded as a difficult to pilot deck). Tearlaments are also infamous for requiring a great deal of skill, since the pilot has to be aware of the various interactions they have in the GY and the amount of cards left in their maindeck.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">First, you do as much milling as possible to get searches triggered and your GY set-up. Your boards vary, but generally have a mix of Rulkallo's summon negate, Grapha's omni-negate, Kaleido-Heart's shuffle, Sulliek's negate, Perlereino's pop and Ishizu card's graveyard shuffling.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Going second, this deck's gas ploughs through interruption and negates (especially if you chainblocked to guarantee effects to go through). This deck can also side in a ton of boardbreakers and still remain consistent. Best cards to side out are your Synchron package (Tuning + Revolution Synchron) and Tearlament Grief + Hearbeat. <br /></span></p><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Here is the deck's new fancy combo featuring Ancient Fairy Dragon, Revolution Synchron and Visas Amritara:</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;""><em>Level 4 monster + Revolution Synchron = Field spell search, +1000 LP gain, Tearlament spell/trap search.&nbsp;</em></span></div><ol style=""text-align: left; list-style-type: decimal;"" start=""1"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_253""><li style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400; color: #000000;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Do your opening plays to search and mill to set up your GY.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400; color: #000000;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Normal summon your level 4 monster.

The deck is level 7 focused so Big Eye outs as well as using Ash to synchro into a Baronne De Fleur has helped a ton. There is a small Dark Magician package that can be replaced with a Kashtira package if you so wish but the Illusion of Chaos and triple Magicians' Souls is just generic good card draw. I felt Illusion of Chaos was a brick after the first turn so I swapped out my Kashtira package with a full Dark Magician package to either summon Illusion of Chaos via Secrets of Dark Magic or fusing into The Dark Magicians. Dragoon is the Timaeus target but you can swap out Timaeus for Super Poly against dragon decks.</p>

Your Supreme King Gate cards can be searched by scaling Supreme King Gate Magician, or by summoning Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm. The latter can be done using the normal summon, or by sending it to the graveyard with an empty field. Supreme King Dragon Lightwurm is your best high pendulum scale, and can be used with another level 4 monster to summon a level 4 synchro monster or a level 7 for a rank 7 xyz monster (using its scale effect for the latter). Destrudo is an alternative target for Dragon Shrine, since Darkwurm won't work in the graveyard with a monster on the field. Clear Wing Synchro Dragon should normally be banished with Soul of the Supreme Celestial King, but can also be summoned off a level four and an Ash Blossom or Destrudo. Supreme King Gate Infinity is not normally run in this deck due to its restrictive pendulum effect, but I chose to run it in order to use Gate Zero's effect to search a fusion spell such as Super Polymerization or Destiny Fusion. Effect Veiler is chosen over Imperm because it can be used with a level 7 monster to synchro summon. Radian is chosen over other Kaijus because its attribute allows it to be banished from the grave to summon a Chaos monster, removed with Super Polymerization and Starving Venom, or Pendulum Summoned even if Darkwurm is in the scales, and its level is also useful for xyz summons should you pendulum summon it. Odd Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon is chosen over other ""Pendulum Dragon"" monsters because it is a level seven, has good stats and pendulum scale, and is a normal mosnter that can be sent to the grave with Dragon Shrine for free deck thinning. Supreme King Odd-Eyes is intended to be Special Summoned from the deck using the non-negated Z-Arc from Soul of the Supreme Celestial King. Odd-Eyes Arcray Dragon can be summoned in place of the negated Z-Arc from Soul of the Supreme King should your opponent try to play around it by avoiding the use of spell cards, and it its name clause allows you to keep the trap in the grave online indefinitely. Book of Eclipse and Book of Moon are interesting experimental inclusions because they can turn a Z-Arc summoned with Soul of the Supreme King face down, allowing its Raigeki effect to go off without being negated. It will then not return to the extra deck on your end step, nor will it be negated if flipped face up again. Some of the Side Deck cards, including Destiny Hero Plasma, the Chaos monsters, and Supreme King Clear Wing, are included for only testing purposes rather than as serious options for tournament play.</p>"

Very different archetypes. How are they connected together? -Ogdoadic Daybreak. Daybreak tributes 1 reptile and summons a token for every 2 levels that monster had. This Card is actually kinda amazing, and even has a effect to return the usually dead -Nunu, the Ogdoadic Remnant that are banished to your deck, and send a Reptile from your deck to the GY. Daybreak has a thousand uses, from spamming your field with Tokens by using Curse + Nauya / Nephilabyss, or even tributing a level 2 reptile like Lamia to send Lamia to the gy and replace it. Spright uses these level 2 tokens (Reptiles don't really care that they are level 2 usually) to summon themselves, as ammunition for Red/Carrot, and for a link summon.&nbsp;</p><p>Deck can go both first and second. Triple Tactics is a must, as based on your hand, just 1 Ash makes you pass your turn. Droll doesn't affect this deck a lot. Nibiru on the other hand, is the true counter to this deck. The Monsters you end on don't have a huge enough Stat to give you a huge enough Nibiru token, but with just a rock token in your field, you can't summon Nunu back on your turn.</p><p>This deck, and Ogdoadic itself can run a million options. Therion Empress was my most successful, as it was a easy level 8. Other Therions are raw bricks though, and makes using them risky. So, I just played 1-2 Empress, since it's the second easier level 8 reptile to get out.</p><p>This deck doesn't actually ""brick."" I say that beacuse Starting with a spright in your hand without some kind of reptile starter (Snake Rain, Nauya, Nunu, Or even Water Lily) makes for one of the worst possible hands in this deck. Another reason to run TTT.</p><p>Important Cards:&nbsp;</p><p>&bull; -Ogdoadic Daybreak (Level 2 token spammer), -Reptilianne Lamia (Best Tuner in the Deck, Connects Spright and Ogdoadic together just like Daybreak)</p>"

The aroma cards work together to help you draw more cards and mostly all the monsters in this deck can be special summoned in some way. Laurel is the key piece, it special summons if your life points are greater than your opponents and when its sent to the grave yard you can choose to gain 500 LP. You can use the GY effect of laurel if both the link jasmine and the normal monster jasmine are on the field and you draw 2 cards. Beargram is a new addition, but its worked out pretty well and is a great boardwipe and a lvl 9 so makes for good barrone material. Will upload replays if anyone is interested, I have some pretty cool ones.&nbsp;</p><p>I plan to add the new aroma cards when they come to master duel, but for now this is it.</p><p>Any suggestions are welcome!</p>"

To be honest, the deck is much worse, ESPECIALLY if you don't want to spend 400 big ones on the Diabellestar engine.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, some special sauce is here to spice things up again.</p><p>The deck has a much harder time getting Angelica's Ring onto the field after the ban, which is key to preventing some of the deck's biggest weaknesses like Lightning Storm and Dark Ruler. Instead, Assault Synchron will help us run throught the Mannadium line to set up a Reframing, offering us a counter-trap omni negate.</p><p>On the other hand, Tuning plus Rev Synchron gets us more cards milled into the graveyard, and even gives us access to the legendary Power Tool Dragon. He can get us a guaranteed durendal, then use rev sunchron again out of the grave to turn him into Crystal Wing. That helps us smell what the Rock is cooking-- and play under Nibiru.</p><p>Finally-- Battlin' Boxers make a big impact by getting free bodies on the field. Uppercutter makes a great normal summon into sparrer-- allowing you to make a free rank 4. My favorite play is to use the two 4's seperately if you have access to Revolution Synchron. Use the Rev and a boxer to make Power Tool Dragon, then reborn the Rev and use another boxer to make our shawty Angelica. It's extra nifty if you mill an Infernoble Knight with the effect of Rev!</p><p><strong>Ideal End Boards:</strong></p><p>The best end board you can achieve would include two copies of Charles, one Gearfried, and one Amritara. This sets you up with two spell negates, a monster negate, and an omni-negate that can stop Dark Ruler. If you have Roland in the grave, make sure to equip him to Charles on your opponent's turn for a free destroy!</p><p>Another option is having Two Charles, one Gearfried, and Crystal Wing on your end board. While it may not be as diverse as the first option, it does play safer under the Rock.</p><p><strong>Some Extra Tips:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sometimes you could end up with a leftover Power Tool Dragon, which can be awkward. If you have an extra Assault Synchron, he can go straight into Power Tool Braver Dragon for a nice monster negate. Otherwise... S:P is always cracked.</p><p>Watch out for that Warrior lock that comes from the incredible Noble Arms Museum! It can cut off your Mannadium and Power Tool combos if you aren't careful.&nbsp;</p><p>When running the Mannadium line, think carefull on how you use Trisukta. Normally you will want to get you hands on that Reframing from Amritara-- but do remember to respect the Rock. Trisukta can synchro with any other level 4 to just make Baronne. Better safe than sorry.</p><p>Sales ban is for Droll and Lock Bird. We all know he is a menace for this deck, that's nothing new. While this version plays a bit better through D Shifter, Droll is arguably even more impactful now because of the boxers. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.</p><p><strong>End:</strong></p><p>While Infernobles have seen better days, the loss of Isolde is not the end for the Knights. I'm sure there are stronger builds made with the DIabellestar engine, so make sure to take a look at those too. If you are more on the budget side-- give this build a try.

Unfortunately, Dinomorphia isn't really viable as it heavily relies on trap cards, and it heavily loses you life points. It's optimal to lose as many as possible though, but that again, is a double edged sword. It makes it very easy for the opponent to just randomly pick you off with a stray effect or attack. It's key to get your fusion monsters out as soon as possible, especially Rexterm, as its effect makes it so your opponent can't activate monster effects on the field whose ATK points are equal to or higher than your LP. In conjunction with it's quick effect that makes all ATK points of your opponent equal to your LP after paying half of your LP, it makes for a good combo. And if your LP are already low, it makes it very frustrating for your opponent to get rid of it, unless they have effects they activate in the hand/GY or with spells/traps. There are some changes that can be made. A new Dinomorphia trap card, Dinomorphia Intact, can replace Solemn Strike on top of using its GY effect to negate battle damage if banished.</p><p>I typically use Dinomorphia Frenzy/ or Domain to get Kentregina out and use her effect to banish a Dinomorphia trap card and use its effect to get out Rexterm. Though if you get Ultimate Conductor Tyranno in your hand, you can use the same effect of getting Kentregina out, and then banishing those 2 dinosaur monsters to bring him out. He is great support as his effect destroys one of your monsters in your hand or field, and then flip all your opponents monsters to face down defense position. And then he gets to attack each monster anyway, but he can deal 1000LP to your opponent if he targets a defense position monster, and it destroys it without having to actually fight it. NOTE: he just has to target it for an attack. There are also some XYZ monsters to help round things out and add more variety. Dolkka and Laggia can be summoned with 2 of any of the LVL 4 Dinosaur monsters and are summoned at your discretion. Also, of course, Utopia, Utopia Prime, and then Zeus. Durendal is a placeholder. I legitamately had nothing else to throw in the extra deck that made sense, and Master Duel just included it randomly at some point, and I have been too lazy to swap it out. SO, just ignore it.</p><p>In conclusion, I'm not terribly good at Yu-Gi-Oh, but I really enjoy the archetype regardless as it's different from what other decks do. As well as being a little anti-meta, it has cool monsters (Kentregina &lt;3) and a unique playstyle. It's very satifying to win as you are constantly low on LP and are always making a comback.

We are using Monk Benkei only for its Pendulum Effect which is if you control a SHS monster, you can add a SHS Soul monster from Deck to hand. We are always using this effect to get something like Soulgaia Booster or Soulpiercer if we need a Level 4 non-Tuner for our combo or getting Soulhorns if we need a Level 1 non-Tuner. Wakaushi&rsquo;s Pend Effect is that if you have no Spell/Traps in your GY, you can place a SHS Pend Monster except itself from Deck in your Pend Zone and Special Summon Wakaushi from its scale. And the only one of its monster effects that we are using is Wakaushi being able to scale itself from face-up Extra Deck if it is used as Synchro Material and sent there. Soulgaia Booster targets a SHS monster you control and equips itself from hand or field to that monster, and if it is equipped to a monster by its own effect, you can Special Summon it. Its other effects are not exactly relevant as we are just using this card as a Level 4 non-Tuner we are able to Summon. Soulpiercer also targets a SHS you control to equip itself from hand or field to that monster, and if it is sent from field to GY, you can add a SHS monster from Deck to hand other than itself. This effect is not once per turn. Soulhorns also targets a SHS you control and equips itself from hand or field to it, and while it is equipped by its own effect, you can Special Summon it. Motorbike can discard itself if you have no Spell/Traps in GY to add a Superheavy Samurai monster from Deck to hand except itself. It&rsquo;s other effect allows you to target a Machine you control to increase its Level by 2, but we aren&rsquo;t exactly Synchro comboing like you would normally in SHS, so this isn&rsquo;t relevant. Stealthy is an inherent Special Summon from hand if you have no Spell/Traps in your GY once per turn. And since it is a Level 1 monster, it can also meet your Level 1 non-Tuner requirement. Also, if you have no Spell/Traps in GY, you can Quick Effect Tribute it to target a Spell/Trap in your opponent&rsquo;s GY and set it to your field but banish it when it leaves the field. This effect will rarely come up, but supposedly if your opponent Imperms you and you already have a Level 1 non-Tuner other than Stealthy in rotation, you can use this to get another piece of interruption for yourself. 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Karakuri Gama mdl 4624 &ldquo;Shirokunishi&rdquo;</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> which can Quick Effect banish itself from GY and target a Karakuri monster you control to change its Battle Position.

Monstrosity can either Special Summon a Level 9 from hand or target a Level 9 you control and Special Summon 2 Level 9&rsquo;s from your Deck with a different Type and Attribute than it but with different names. Succession Special Summons a monster from GY to your zone a Link Monster points to. It&rsquo;s not necessary, but if you draw Monstrosity, I would like another target to search with Ib, especially since Succession getting you back a Level 9 can benefit you so much. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Extra Deck: Before I get into it, I just want to say that I know that Superheavy Samurai can make a wild number of interactions through several different monsters that they can churn out from the Extra Deck.

A normal Prediction Princess endboard has a monster in the EMZ and 3 monsters in your Main Monster Zones, and once we get to the opponent&rsquo;s turn, all of our Monster Zones are filled.

I've always liked the Adventuring/JRPG theme of the World Chalice Archetype ever since they were released. The four 2000 ATK normal monsters I inculded because they feel like characters you'd either fight/join/meet on your adventure. This deck is very dated as I often played it against people who still weren't even playing Link monsters. It's not an amazing deck by any means but it's a nostalgic deck that I've upgraded here and there over the years without losing its truest form.</p><p>I've always had to play on a very tight budget so World Legacy Succession, Ib the World Chalice Justiciar and Lib aren't even in my deck yet.

Primarily against decks that rely on the Battle Phase. Don't have much of a problem out pacing them in that sense but if your opponent is more of a manipulative/combo or stun deck... well... you're going to have to make your own side deck for that. I usually run this deck when I'm in a fightin' mood and it's to battle or be doomed trying. Fortia is key to be on the field at first fight and getting in direct with Bashileos is key to winning. If you find hitting in direct with Bashileos is what your main win is then you can run three.&nbsp;</p><p>I recommend keeping some dice on hand to track the number of times you've increased your monsters by 200 as I often found myself with 4 to 5 on board and it helps to keep track which increment of 200 you're at because the two Big Boys are quick effects that activate before the damage step and the others activate after damage calculation.</p><p>Another strategy is to use Orpis to get Skyler or Meteoragon into the grave and summon them with War Rock Spirit as they have no built in easy summon effect like the others. Despite playing this deck a fair bit I still can't decide on the ratios of Mountains, Spirit, and Dignity and the traps. If you're going against a combo deck with lots of monster effects run more Dignity since its not a once per turn. If they also blow up your stuff a lot during the main phase maybe run more Big Blows. You can take out Twin Twisters if they're not running back row but some of my game wins were disrupting backrow and hitting in for game. It can also facilitate a Warrior to grave for Spirit.</p><p>The side deck really is just an ongoing ratio tester. I've never actually purused making it into a proper side deck. (I play on a very small budget)&nbsp;</p><p>Quaking Mirror Force can be swapped out for anything but I've found it really good if my opponent actualy makes a board stronger than mine I flip them all face down and attack into them on the next turn so the opponent can't activate any grave effects (or effects in general since they're face down) they might have before they end their turn.</p><p>I haven't faced any of the newer decks/threats with this deck since I haven't used it in a while and I play in a very casual format where no one uses cards over 20$ so I have no clue how well this deck runs against stuff like that.</p><p>Final notes, the extra deck is more of a situational thing that you restort to in desperation. (the link monster is more there just for that 500 ATK boos in a pinch and I rarely use anyone but Gandiva or Excalibur for big damage) Or that's at least how I found it. War Rocks really like each other being on board and hit hard with their own effects (and ATK) as is so I rarely find myself going into the extra deck. Probably another reason why I lose so much but I play on a tight budget so this is what I use. A very cheap deck and fun to play if you like going to war. Yugioh does feel less about the battle phase and more of a build up the board for one hit kill so maybe it's out of date. If you have any modern success with it I'd love to hear it in the comments.&nbsp;</p>"

Time Wizard of Tomorrow,"<p>So, you might have heard of ""Time Wizard of Tomorrow"", where you need to guess the coin call right in order to blast your opponent. Should you do it wrong, you will be dead but what if I told you that you can win either way with a crafty setup? Let's find out!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/AY8cf7shk6Q"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Plant five plants to opposing side with ""Black Garden"", which will be replaced with bigger monsters thanks to ""Mystic Box"" and ""Monster Reborn"". After that, activate ""Lair of Darkness"" and make sure Dugares is in your GY.</p><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to have Primal Seed setup ready. As long as you don't banish Ancient and Librarian by accident via Chaos Emperor, you will be fine.</p><p>3) After you have Link Summoned Saryuja, Special Summon ""Fusion Parasite"", letting you Fusion Summon. Use Parasite + Saryuja as materials and place it on Main Monster Zone (MMZ).</p><p>4) If you have Swirl + Ghost in-hand, activate Swirl to Fusion Summon Oracle by using Swirl + Ghost as materials in-hand and place it on Extra Monster Zone (EMZ). Also, activate ""Forbidden Dress"" on Oracle to not let it be destroyed. You will see why eventually.</p><p>5) Since Swirl + Ghost were sent to GY thanks to what you did in #4, revive them with ""Monster Reborn"" in addition to Formula. With Formula converted into DARK monster thanks to ""Lair of Darkness"" active in #1, you have 3 x Level 2 DARK monsters. It means you can bring forth Number 43 by using them as materials. Also, activate Number 43 to equip Dugares to not let Number 43 be destroyed. You will see why later on.</p><p>6) Time to fill both sides with beefy monsters because ""Time Wizard of Tomorrow"" can deal equal to half the total original ATK of destroyed face-up monsters upon trigger. You can see the picture as reference below but I'll also take notes as well:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/VHkAg9s.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>Monsters were revived and given to opposing side with ""Monster Reborn"" and ""Mystic Box"", respectively, by replacing plants.</li><li>Here is the maximum possible damage output. Mind you, any changes done by Saryuja/Garden and alike doesn't count, seen in the description of ""Time Wizard of Tomorrow"":<ul><li>Opponent = 2800 + 2400 + 2200 + 2100 + 2200 = 11700</li><li>You = 3000 + 2500 + 2000 + 2000 = 9500</li><li>Total = (11700 + 9500) / 2 = 10600 &gt;&gt;&gt; Lethal!</li></ul></li><li>Make sure you revive monsters illustrated above, if you play 2 x Upstart Goblin cards. These are all of highest ATK monsters you have in your arsenal but if you go second and your opponent places monsters higher than 2000 ATK, just keep them.</li></ul><p>7) Finally, activate ""Time Wizard of Tomorrow"". So, here are two possible outcomes of coin flip:</p><ul><li>If you have guessed right, you can inflict lethal damage.</li><li>If you have guessed wrong, you would have taken damage, had there not been Oracle and Number 43 without any protection done in #4 and #5. You see, when you would take damage, Oracle heals you with same amount. With Number 43 around, fortunately, you can inflict same amount of heal as damage for the FTK!</li></ul><p>8) Congratulations, you win the game either way!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Fusion Parasite"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""D/D Swirl Slime"" can be found within ""Cross-Dimensional Contracts"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Lair of Darkness"" can be found within ""Rulers of Darkness"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

This is a suggestion as to what his deck might have looked like in Season 1 of Arc-V. It assumes he made the entire Invasion: Vengeance predaplant lineup early, but was otherwise limited to older cards to fill in gaps.</p><p>World Carrotweight Champion is in the side deck as an option for the future, once it was printed. Mystic Tomato, Lonefire Blossom, and Evil Thorn fit in with his dark plants well, and help get material on the board. The Dark - Hex Sealed Fusion is fusion filler that fits thematically, but would be phased out because it's a nonbo with Starving Venom's ""On Fusion Summon"" effect. Double Summon and Fusion Sage would both be helpful for Yuri's Starving Venom Turbo strategy.</p>"

[I understand this since a lot of people use this site for Master Duel so no matches really] Most decks (yes some do) but most are only a few attributes and even multi attribute decks there are usually specific monsters in those that are problematic. So, that's what the side deck is for. The first duel will be a wash if your not typed up right but if you change out you might stand a chance. Let's be honest, this deck as a pure form is bad and if you play it you're not playing to win every game. Either way, if you do type it right you can disrupt your opponent by actually stealing monsters with your Charmers and further stealing with the link versions.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not sure if there's much else to talk about... the three extra Extra Deck monsters are just one's I had in my collection to fill the 15. Feel free to slim down or expand as you see fit. Nothing in here is set in stone per se but I definitely encourage you making it in a specific set of Attributes first. The most trouble I have when playing in my own casual eviroment is Earth, Dark, Light, and Wind so those are the main deck ones I chose. (Well, I picked wind more because they have the best Spiritual Art in my opinon Water is a close second) Also, yes, I'm on a very tight budget for Yu-Gi-Oh so most of the cards you see here are from the Structure deck or other easily accessed sources from one point in time. I did not go out of my way to buy anything for this deck except the link monsters because for some reason none of those were included in the structure deck???</p><p>Final notes, Unpossessed is KEY to this deck's survival. I only own 2 copies so I don't know if three is better or if it clogs you up. Your charmers being able to survive battle and steal will make your opponent waste monster/card destruction effects on your face down monsters even when you bait them with an attribute that can't steal (well, depends on the opponent) but if you have Awakening of the Possesed they have to hit that first etc etc...</p><p>If you're a fellow Charmers Enjoyer, Good Luck!</p>"

Lotus+Wanghu,"<p>Greetings! In this deck, we will FTK the opponent with ""Trickstar Black Catbat"" featuring ""Samsara Lotus"" alongside a crafty setup. Before we start, check these options before/during the game and change them as shown, which matters later on:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Self-Chain &gt;&gt;&gt; On</p><p>- Card Position &gt;&gt;&gt; Manual</p><p>- Activation Order Settings &gt;&gt;&gt; On</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/nq6R0qveWTQ"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><em>(Now, let the show begin!)</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When you Link Summon Saryuja, make sure at least two adjacent arrows (""Bottom-Left and Bottom"" or ""Bottom and Bottom-Right"") Saryuja point to are free. Plan your summons with Panda accordingly and don't forget to play ""Into the Void"" in advance, which is needed to send Samsara to GY.</p><p>2) Place both Pendulum Monsters on Zones and try to perform a Pendulum Summon...</p><ul><li>While doing so, place Lilybell on where Saryuja points to and reserve a spot next to Lilybell, which will be spared for ""Supreme King Dragon"". This is why you have to make sure at least two adjacent Main Monster Zones (MMZ) are free, explained in #1.</li><li>If there are still empty MMZ, fill them with any monster except Samsara but bring forth Wanghu as last one. The aim is to not destroy any monster by accident with Wanghu but don't forget to reserve a spot for Supreme.</li></ul><p>3) Fusion Summon Supreme by using Bufolicula + Triantis as materials by activating Bufolicula. Then, place Supreme next to Lilybell and activate Supreme to copycat Lilybell...</p><ul><li>If you don't have Supreme or fear the fact that Supreme might be banned one day, you need to Pendulum Summon another Lilybell. When you are done with Pendulum Summon, destroy both Pendulum Zones with ""Twin Twisters"", seen in ""Side Deck"". Reason behind is that Samsara can be Special Summoned at your End Phase in Attack Position, only if you don't control any Spell/Trap cards, which is what Bufolica somewhat does it anyways.</li></ul><p>4) You have two Trickstar monsters. Yes, changing name with Supreme counts. So, Link Summon Catbat with these two and jump to End Phase.</p><p>5) If the button at the lower-right corner of the screen is either ""ON"" or ""Auto"", activate ""Into the Void"", which delivers Samsara to GY. Then, change these options in-game to not waste any time with manual labor...</p><ul><li>Self-Chain &gt;&gt;&gt; On</li><li>Card Position &gt;&gt;&gt; Auto</li><li>Activation Order Settings &gt;&gt;&gt; Off</li></ul><p>6) Now, you can revive Samsara with a single button and Wanghu can destroy it in an instant. Since the only spot Samsara can go is where Catbat points to, you can deal 200 damage until your opponent is dead...</p><ul><li>When the game is over, feel free to revert into your default options or keep them. It's up to your preferences.</li></ul><p>7) Congratulations, you win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom"" can be found within ""Indomitable Knights"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Flipping+Samsara+Lantron+Wanghu,"<p>Hi there! Time to flip the mirror of terror to reflect havoc upon your enemies. Before we start, check these options before/during the game and change them as shown, which matters later on:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Self-Chain &gt;&gt;&gt; On</p><p>- Card Position &gt;&gt;&gt; Manual</p><p>- Activation Order Settings &gt;&gt;&gt; On</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/2RgJRNq5P1s"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) At one point, activate ""Dream Mirror of Terror"" and pass it to your opponent with ""Land Flipping"". Also, if you go second and your opponent's side of battlefield is full, spare one with Ravenous.</p><p>2) When you have three Main Monster Zones (MMZ) free alongside Ravenous/Baronne being present, place Pendulum Monsters on Zones and try to perform a Pendulum Summon...</p><ul><li>You only need to Pendulum Summon three monsters, which are Lantron &gt;&gt;&gt; Phantasos &gt;&gt;&gt; Wanghu. Bring them forth in explained order because you don't want to destroy anything by accident with Wanghu.</li><li>Mind you, you have to place Guitariss first. Otherwise, Momoncarpet will detonate itself.&nbsp;If you don't want to bother with it, replace Momoncarpet with Magister and have ""Twin Twisters"" with you, seen in ""Side Deck"". Then, destroy both Zones with ""Twin Twisters"", when you are done with Pendulum Summon.</li></ul><p>3) Provided that you have played ""Into the Void"" in advance, destroy Guitariss with Ravenous/Baronne. Next, pass Phantasos to opposing side with ""Shien's Spy"" and jump into End Phase.</p><p>4) If the button at the lower-right corner of the screen is either ""ON"" or ""Auto"", activate ""Into the Void"", which delivers Samsara to GY. Then, change these options in-game to not waste any time with manual labor...</p><ul><li>Self-Chain &gt;&gt;&gt; On</li><li>Card Position &gt;&gt;&gt; Auto</li><li>Activation Order Settings &gt;&gt;&gt; Off</li></ul><p>5) Now, you can revive Samsara with a single button and Wanghu can destroy it in an instant. Normally, with Mirror and Phantasos at opposing side, you would have taken damage. However, Lantron reflects said damage right back at your opponent. Repeat the revival of Samsara, while reflecting 300 damage each time, until your opponent is dead...</p><ul><li>When the game is over, feel free to revert into your default options or keep them. It's up to your preferences.</li></ul><p>6) Congratulations, you win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Dream Mirror of Terror"" can be found within ""Interdimensional Interlopers"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Samsara Lotus"" + ""King Tiger Wanghu"" + ""Land Flipping"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 120 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 630 SR and 120 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

And now, we can do the same in Masterduel since the latest pack makes all the important pieces in the strategy available!<br /><br />Combining Bystial with Runick, another amazing advantage engine, you get an extremely competent meta strategy that will quickly outpace your opponents! Piloted correctly and methodically, Bystial Runick will win you games vs. the top decks of the metagame, especially since Bystial hard counters decks like Branded, Dragonlink and Labyrinth!</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">This deck may be straightforward, but it rewards good decision making since boards and gamestates are determined by the pilot's skill and resource management.

Even though it's powerful, it isn't needed for the strategy. <br /></span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">As the name implies, Bystial Runick is mainly composed of the two archetypes.&nbsp;<br /><strong><br /></strong></span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>BYSTIAL </strong>part of the deck actually just isn't Bystial, it represents the Albaz ""synchro"" cards as well such as Cartesia, Aluber, and of course, Quem! Bystials offer their level 6 bodies for Synchro summons, mostly for Baronne or Dis Pater. Combined with the Fusion monsters summoned by Runick spells (level 2 Hugin and level 4 Geri), level 6 and level 10 synchro monsters from your extra deck toolbox are easily accessible. Bystials also form a compact but effect resource loop when Branded Regained + Beast are on the field, forming an incredible amount of advatage for the pilot in both bodies on the field and cards in hand. Bystials are so incredibly powerful. Being a ""D.D. Crow"" for lights/darks, a giant 2500ATK body and free level 6 bodies for summon fodder is incredible! When your opponent is out of resources, the sheer amount of Bystials + level 10 synchro bosses can wait one turn on a full board to OTK your opponent - one of the few Runick variants to do so.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>RUNICK </strong>offers the main win condition of this deck by banishing your opponent's deck. Runick spells also break opponent's boards fairly well when played correctly in tandem with the other archetypes, especially Bystials. Runick offers solid defensive options, with Hugin protecting against destruction effects while Geri dissuades the opponent from attacking. Constantly drawing up to three cards per turn is pretty bonkers too, easily allowing the pilot to outpace the opponent with the amount of resources they have.</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>Duality </strong>is also included in this deck. The card offers Hugin (its target is Allvain) a way to dodge targeting negation like Imperm or Veiler. Duality can also turn a level 6 Bystial into a light tuner (its target is Malong). An added bonus is that when Malong reaches the GY, it can return a face-up card to the hand! Finally, Duality can recycle 1 light and 1 dark card in the GY for a draw, which additional recursion and resource advantage. The card isn't needed (you can save on 90 UR!) in this deck, but it greatly benefits the strategy.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></div><div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></div><div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">The strategy of Bystial Runick is to control/banish your opponent's cards until they surrender or deck-out. In certain situations, you can also enter the battle phase and OTK your opponent. The ridiculous resource advantage and control options each archetype gives the duelist should win them the duel in most circumstances. An additional benefit to using a lot of Bystials is that is hardcounters various common strategies onf Masterduel ladder like Branded, Labyrinth and Tearlaments.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">There is no particular combo line that this strategy uses. Mostly, this deck just summons Hugin to start off with the Runick portion of the deck. The presence Hugin then allows the special summons of Spright monsters so you can full combo. Bystials are not particularly ""needed,"" but if you draw into Lubellion, Magnamhut and Branded Regained, it grants you massive resources, interruptions and free bodies on the field.&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">Normal summoning Quem to dump to GY Bystial Aluber is typically the opening play. Summoning Cartesia to fuse into Granguinol is also another line of play, since Granguinol can send Luluwalilith to summon Quem from deck, or it's level 8 body can be used as Synchro material for Chaos Angel. Typically, a level 6 Bystial + Cartesia/Quem (level 4 tuners) can make your level 10 Synchro of choice.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">The deck's endboard is varies, but the duelist may end on a mix of level 10 Synchro boss monsters (Typically Baronne), and with one or both of the Bystial continuous spell or traps.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Since this is a toolbox control strategy, the use of each card is unique and situational - after Hugin -&gt; Bystial combo, the duel is typically non-linear. Instead, the game is dependent on the pilot's decision-making, resource advantage skills and knowledge of the specific match-up. If played to it's best potential, this deck can defeat opponents going first and second, even through many interruptions.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">With the unique control each archetype offers and the draw 3-4+ every turn, your opponent should wither away while you snowball card advantage to victory.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</span></div></div><div style=""margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><div style=""margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></div><div style=""margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><ul style=""text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;""><li class=""elementToProof"" style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Similarly to Sky Striker, this is a toolbox control resource deck. It has a high skill ceiling since it factors in a player's decision making, resource management and match-up knowledge. Practice makes perfect with the deck!</span></li><li class=""elementToProof"" style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Duality isn't needed in this deck, but it provides a way for Hugin to dodge interruption (like an imperm or veiler), or for your Bystial to turn into a tuner + bounce (Malong).</li><li class=""elementToProof"" style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Both Bystials and Runick form great body blockers to defend your lifepoints if it comes down to it.</span></li><li class=""elementToProof"" style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Bystials are excellent when breaking boards, beating down small monsters and baiting interruption. You can enter battle phase to clear your opponent's board with 2500ATK beatsticks and continue your Runick plays during battlephase or main phase 2!&nbsp;</span></li><li class=""elementToProof"" style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">This deck can generate so many bodies on board that it can easily OTK your opponent. If you feel your opponent cannot withstand your attack and they're out of resources, try to intentionally hold back from using Runick cards so you can enter the battle phase to finish them off!</span></li><li class=""elementToProof"" style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Remember, if a card is on the Extra Monster Zone, you cannot summon the defensive Runick fusions Hugin and Geri! Summon your Fusion and Synchro monsters in the Main Monster Zones rather than the Extra Monster Zone!</span></li><li class=""elementToProof"" style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Hugin's search effect for Runick Fountain isn't once per turn. If you can spare the cards, you can still search for Runick Fountain a second time! This makes Hugin ideal bait for your opponent's interruption.&nbsp;</span></li><li class=""elementToProof"" style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If your opponent Maxx ""C,""'s you, stop summoning and don't take the maxx c challenge! It's not worth giving your opponent more resources when you're righting a resource war. You can simply summon with 1 monster and leave it at that, since you can always summon your Runick or Bystial monsters during your opponent's turn!</span></li></ul></div><div style=""margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Ending on a multiple interruption board with 6+ cards in hand makes you feel like the richest duelist ever! The Bystial Runick toolbox control gameplay is extremely fun and rewarding as well, since every game feels like winning a hard-fought battle utilizing a mastermind's tactician's decision making combined with a strategist's logistical mastery. Games tend to be long winded and grindy, with the win condition on both sides focused on resources rather than life points.&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"" style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The cool thing about Runick is that it's from the ""first person view"" so it feels like you're fighting alongside your monsters (kind of like when you summon allies in Skyrim)! Imagine that - you're now an integral main character of the Branded storyline. With your tactical decision making and careful management of battlefield resources, will you emerge victorious in your very own Branded saga?&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, I will leave you with the copypasta derived from the recent YCS Champ who piloted this deck to victory, Joshua Schmidt - <em>""OMG yes I love Quem!

Panda+Arcana Force+Numeron Network,"<p>Good day to you! If you are looking at this deck, that means you must be interested in Numeron decks. Generally speaking, C1 is mostly used as emergency rather than burst, where you can banish all monsters and burst damage is low, if only XYZ s banished were Numerons. What if I told you that burst damage can go high only with your cards, ranging up to 10k, and you can do all in one turn thanks to Panda and Arcana? If you are still curious, keep reading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ys52VJIbciM"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When you have 3 x Level 1 dudes in your GY, Link Summon Saryuja. Then, play first ""Tri-Wight"" to revive them and overlay into ""Number 1"" by using 3 x Level 1 dudes as materials.</p><p>2) Special Summon Gale with Saryuja. Activate Gale twice by paying 6000 LP in total to send ""Neo Galaxy-Eyes"" XYZ monsters to GY. Then, overlay into C1 via ""Number 1"".</p><p>3) C1 was sent to Banish Zone (BZ), ready to blow up next turn. Fuel C1 with explosives by sending ""Number 1"" and ""Neo Galaxy-Eyes"" to BZ with ""Soul Release"".</p><p>4) After placing ""Light Barrier"", activate second ""Tri-Wight"". Then, reveal Arcana to bring forth ""Angel O1"", which allows you to Tribute Summon Arcana. When Arcana hits the board, choose the outcome as&nbsp;<strong>heads</strong> to skip your opponent's turn.</p><p>5) Activate ""Numeron Network"" and end your turn. To skip your opponent's turn, send the remaining Level 1 dudes to GY. On your Standby Phase of next turn, activate C1 to deal 4500 + 4500 + 1000 = 10000 damage in total for the OTK...</p><ul><li>Technically, the XYZ monster with highest ATK value is ""Galaxy Destroyer"" with 5000 ATK, seen in ""Side Deck"". However, they are UR to craft and can be only found in ""Legacy Pack"". Since I don't have them, I had to cut 1 x Upstart Goblin and replace XYZ fellas with ""Neo Galaxy-Eyes"" monsters, which are SR. If you have at least 2 x Galaxy Destroyer cards, definitely add them alongside 1 x Upstart Goblin instead.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Neo Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon"" can be collected by purchasing ""Rage of Cipher"" deck. 30 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Arcana Force XXI - The World"" + ""Light Barrier"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Gale Dogra"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Numeron Network"" + ""Number C1"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"" can be found within ""Nebula Cyclone"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 630 SR and 120 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Griffin can Special Summon a Gusto from Deck if it is sent from hand or GY. And this effect is a hard once per turn. Out of nowhere, we just have a Gusto with an &ldquo;If&rdquo; clause that is hard once per turn which is so strange to me.

Still a casual deck though!,"<p>I've tried to make Gate Guardian as viable as possible for Masteduel ladder, but try as I might, the deck is still casual. It may steal a game or two (especially if the opponent doesn't read cards) but usually it gets outclassed and beaten. <br /><br />I'm not going to make an in-depth guide for this deck since it's really basic to play and it's fairly weak. Basically, try to summon Gate Guardians Combined by sending to GY or placing on field Suijin, Kazejin and Sanga. From there, you try to beat your opponent down with giant boss monsters that always float backwards to their more basic forms. Once you got the big three in rotation in the banished pile, GY and field, you have a good grind game to beat your opponent down with.<br /><br />There are no supplemental engines with this version of the deck, so I tried to stuff in as many staples as possible so the deck can play in it's ""pure"" form. <br /><br />GLHF Duelists, and Happy New Year! May we have another amazing year of Yugioh!</p>"

Also, there will be a text of what is in the deck for those who just want to skip to the list.</p><p>The Breakdown&nbsp;<br /><br />For the main monsters I have most of the Amazoness monsters that you will see a lot of people play 1x Queen, 3x Princess, 3x War Chief, 2x of each one Sliver and Gold, 2x Spiritualist, 1x Baby Tiger. These are the monsters you will see most decks have and with good reason since you Princess and War Chief you have these two being your main searchers thoughout the deck this can be for anything from Monsters, Spells and Traps form the deck to either the hand or field, Spiritualist to bring back a trap or spell and get a fusion card ready, these cards not being part of the Amazoness archetype aka normal poly and fusion sub. From the older support I have Swords Woman still a good effect after all this time, Paladin and Sage you could take these two out but I would just use them for XYZ summon more than anything else but Sage effect could still be good? For the XYZ monster #41 I think is a good monster that you can XYZ summon into but you could use a different monster for here either like Tornado Dragon, Castel Sky Blaster etc.<br /><br /></p><p>I added in two Kaiju monsters and there spell card interrupted Kaiju Slumber I feel like you need a ""modern dark hole"" to get ride of some monsters that could be a pain in the ass to deal with and well from what I seen Kaiju's are a good form of monster removal if you still need your normal summon but you could switch these cards out for something like Lava Golem, Ra Sphere Mode, or Nibiru.&nbsp; For the hand traps I feel like Ash is always good to have in&nbsp; most decks since the effects are generic that they work for the next one I think you could switch out Ghost Bell for either something like D.D Crow,&nbsp; Skull Meister, or Bystial Druiswurm but this can change since Druiswurm depending on format for me I like Ghost Bell while it is hard once pre turn I do like how it stops effects from the grave effects beside called by the grave you could switch out Ghost Bell for something else.<br /><br />For the Goblindbergh I would say that I only use this as a way to have a monster form of ""double summon"" I say it in this way is because if you read the effect of the card you can only select one level 4 monster and lower and depending on what you get with this opening hand you could use it in that way after you have used your normal summons for example lets say I have 5 cards in my hand Amazoness Village,&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiritualist,&nbsp; Goblindbergh, Warchief and Princess&nbsp; and how I would use this card is the following after this.</p><p>If your going 2nd<br /><br />1. play village</p><p>2. activate Spiritualist, bounce back village when Spiritualist, search for either poly or sub fusion<br /><br />3. activate village, then summon warchief and place a trap card down and now you have two monsters down</p><p>4. now either you can go in fusion monsters or use Goblin card summon it and then you could bring out Princess use its effects to search for another card</p><p>5. then after all of that you could use&nbsp; Princess effect discard Goblin and then summon out Queen.<br /><br />This is one example of how you could use this card as an opening hand while its not perfect but its an idea or so.<br /><br /></p><p>Main Deck:</p><p>Amazoness Queen x1</p><p>Amazoness Golden Whip Master x2</p><p>Amazoness War Chief x3</p><p>Amazoness Paladin x1</p><p>Amazoness Swords Woman x1</p><p>Amazoness Sage x1</p><p>Goblindbergh x3</p><p>Amazoness Silver Sword Master x2</p><p>Amazoness Princess x3</p><p>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring x2</p><p>Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion x2</p><p>Amazoness Spiritualist x2</p><p>Amazoness Baby Tiger x1</p><p>Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju x1</p><p>Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju x1</p><p>Harpie's Feather Duster x1</p><p>Polymerization x1</p><p>Fusion Substitute x2</p><p>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber x1</p><p>Called by the Grave x1</p><p>Amazoness Call x3</p><p>Amazoness Secret Arts x3</p><p>Amazoness Heirloom x1</p><p>Amazoness Village x1</p><p>Infinite Impermanence x3</p><p>Amazoness Hall x1</p><p>Amazoness Hot Spring x1</p><p>Amazoness Onslaught x1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Extra Deck:</p><p>Amazoness Augusta x2</p><p>Amazoness Pet Liger King x2</p><p>Amazoness Empress x2</p><p>Amazoness Pet Liger x1</p><p>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder x1</p><p>Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir x1</p><p>Underworld Goddess of the Closed World x1</p><p>Saryuja Skull Dread x1</p><p>Knightmare Unicorn x1</p><p>Knightmare Phoenix x1</p><p>I:P Masquerena x1</p><p>Cross-Sheep x1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Side Deck:</p><p>Nibiru, the Primal Being x3</p><p>Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon x1</p><p>Tornado Dragon x1</p><p>Sky Cavalry Centaurea x1</p><p>Lightning Storm x2</p><p>Twin Twisters x3</p><p>Amazoness Willpower x1</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

On turn 2, main phase 1, turn I:P and Verte into Avramax or if you need more disruption to your opponents board...go into Unicorn and watch a quick surrender, unless they don't read that Naturia Beast isn't once per turn or that Avramax is untargetable, can't be destroyed and has to be attacked into.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall a fun deck, getting a slight power boost. Plenty of ways to play and certain cards like Rescue Cat don't have to be played or in place of other options. I like running sekka's light as not many decks can do that...sure not playing called by the grave hurts when facing a Maxx C, but sometimes you can come close to decking the opponent out if they don't have a way to stop your numerous special summons this deck can muster.&nbsp;</p>"

It's because you can cheat out Fusion Monsters as many times as you can with <a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Telekinetic_Charging_Cell"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Telekinetic Charging Cell</strong></a> and&nbsp;<a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Brain_Research_Lab"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Brain Research Lab</strong></a> applied, provided you have changed the&nbsp;<strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>of Cyber-Stein to&nbsp;<strong>Psychic</strong> via <a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Reprodocus"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Reprodocus</strong></a> and alike, which was pretty easy to do and was abused in <a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Lyrilusc_-_Independent_Nightingale"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale</strong></a> FTK decks. Now, imagine Cyber-Stein with more balanced version as Flip Monster. This is where ""Summoner of Illusions"" comes in and I had to pick this card because no way I'll spend 30 SR and 30 UR, just to craft Fusion Materials for Dragoon, namely Dogma and Plasma. Anyways, with the background history given, we can start analyzing how to FTK with Dragoon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-BEiS_nnY4"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) At one point, plant a flower to opposing side with ""Black Garden"", if you go first. Then, destroy ""Black Garden"" with Ravenous and replace the rose with Jizukiru.</p><p>2) You need to activate ""Chain Summoning"" to gain two more Normal Summons. Fortunately, you can decide how to do...</p><ul><li>Any Spell &gt;&gt;&gt; Ravenous to destroy Garden &gt;&gt;&gt; CS (This should be your primary method.)</li><li>Integrator &gt;&gt;&gt; Stardust &gt;&gt;&gt; CS (Done in this video.)</li><li>Librarian &gt;&gt;&gt; Quick-Play Spell &gt;&gt;&gt; CS</li><li>Librarian &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula/Martial/Accel &gt;&gt;&gt; CS</li></ul><p>3) Set your opponent's LP to 3000 with Linewalker. Then, set ""Summoner of Illusions"" and flip it with ""Book of Taiyou"" to activate Illusions. Feel free to tribute any monster, including Illusions.</p><p>4) You have cheated out Dragoon without using Fusion Materials. Simply activate Dragoon and target Jizukiru to win the game! Be mindful of any ATK modifications, which is why we had to destroy ""Black Garden"".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Destiny End Dragoon"" can be found within ""Shrouded Heroes"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Brewed it myself. I figured the Runick cards would work well as extenders/tech cards and didnt need fountain. The Generaider core is consistant and hits really hard. It allows for strong boards and combos building Rank 9 XYZ monsters with strong effects. It has fantastic grind game and hardly bricks. The Draconnet line is a 1 card combo that gets Ib, this searches ""World Legacy Mostrosity"", this paired with a Runick card to summon Geri makes ""Shenshen"" which acts as a perfect bridge for ""Monstrosity"". ""Munin"" prevents ""Justicia"" from bricking your hand, allowing it to function as a Normal Summon. Each ""Runick"" spell is quite strong doubling as a form of interaction to stop your opponent or play through their board. Though they mainly serve as extenders. ""Sauravis"" is a fantastic tech card. Negating an effect that targets your monster is stupid strong. In the comp I shut down many ""vailer"" 's and ""Imperm."" 's with it. It basicaly forces your opponent to have ""Nib."" or ""Ash"" to stop your combo. Even still ""Nib."" isn't always useful against this Deck.

Why did Konami think that the best way of excluding Speedroids from their search/summon targets being that you would be limited to non-WIND ""roid"" monsters? It's baffling to me that they decided to go this route because Vehicroids literally have WIND monsters in their archetype, 2 of them being their best Main Deck monsters.&nbsp;<strong>Dragonroid</strong> discards itself from hand to either search a non-WIND roid monster or give you a <strong>Magical Meltdown</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>Branded Lost</strong>-type Continuous Effect for the rest of the turn for your Fusion Summons. And it discarding itself puts a Machine in GY for&nbsp;<strong>Mixeroid</strong>, the other incredible WIND Vehicroid. It tributs a Machine to Special Summon a non-WIND roid from Deck and you can halve your Life Points and banish it and any number of Machine monsters from your GY to Special Summon a roid Fusion Monster with the same Level as the number of Machine monsters you banished to activate this effect, ignoring its Summoning Conditions and destroying it during the End Phase. Dear lord, I wish that I could play Dragonroid to search for Mixeroid in this Deck, but I can't because of that restriction. Just put ""except a ""Speedroid"" monster"" like an ""except ""Frog the Jam"""" type of situation. Eitherway, the Level 9 monster we are taking a look at today is&nbsp;<strong>Super Vehicroid - Stealth Union</strong> which is a Level 9 EARTH Machine Fusion Monster that requires&nbsp;<strong>Truckroid</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Expressroid</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Drillroid</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Stealthroid</strong> as Fusion Material and it has an atrociously bad effect. There is no way that I am hard-summoning this card with its actual Fusion Materials, so the only other option would be to use Mixeroid's GY effect to banish it and 8 other Machines from GY to cheat Stealth Union out from the Extra Deck. Off the top of my mind, the Deck that puts a lot of Machines into the GY is Superheavy Samurai, so that is what we are using to dump Machines into GY for Mixeroid's effect. And an added bonus of using Superheavy Samurai to do this is that you can make&nbsp;<strong>Ib the World Chalice Justiciar</strong> as well to search for&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>, so that means you don't have to hard draw it.&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">I actually had the idea for this Deck a couple of months ago, but since Ib wasn't unbanned at the time, you were limited to like a 4 or 5-card combo to get Stealth Union out onto the field and have Monstrosity to go through with your Prediction Princess combo. Since that was a flop, I thought about using&nbsp;<strong>Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</strong> to Summon a&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Token</strong> to your opponent's field and use&nbsp;<strong>Super Vehicroid - Mobile Base</strong> to target that and get Mixeroid out from the Deck. Or maybe even do some kind of&nbsp;<strong>Geonator Transverser</strong> combo to get a monster with over 3600 onto your opponent's field for Mobile Base to get Stealth Union straight from the Extra Deck then. But that was too complicated, so I went back to my original idea which proved to be much better. The combo that ended up working for me is&nbsp;<strong>Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi</strong>, a Level 1 or Level 4 non-Tuner Superheavy Samurai monster, and&nbsp;<strong>Mixeroid</strong>. Let's say that our Level 1 or 4 non-Tuner SHS is <strong>Superheavy Samurai Soulhorns</strong>. Scale Wakaushi and use its Pend Effect to Scale <strong>Superheavy Samurai Monk Big Benkei</strong> from Deck and Summon Wakaushi from Scale. Benkei's Pend Effect adds&nbsp;<strong>Superheavy Samurai Soulgaia Booster</strong> from Deck. Equip Soulhorns and Soulgaia Booster to Wakaushi and Special Summon both of them. Synchro Soulhorns and Wakaushi into Ib the World Chalice Justiciar and use her effect to search for&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>. Normal Summon Mixeroid and use its effect to tribute itself for&nbsp;<strong>Steamroid&nbsp;</strong>from Deck. Xyz Soulgaia Booster and Steamroid into&nbsp;<strong>Gear Gigant X&nbsp;</strong>which detaches 1 and adds&nbsp;<strong>Superheavy Samurai Soulpiercer</strong> from Deck to hand. Pendulum Summon Soulpiercer and Synchro it with Ib to make&nbsp;<strong>Superheavy Samurai Beast Kyubi</strong>. Soulpiercer's GY effect adds&nbsp;<strong>Superheavy Samurai Bike</strong> from Deck. Send Bike to GY to add another Soulpiercer from Deck to hand. Equip Soulpiercer to SHS Beast Kyubi. Link SHS Beast Kyubi and Gear Gigant into&nbsp;<strong>Sky Striker Ace - Camellia</strong>. Soulpiercer adds a Wakaushi from Deck to hand. Link Camellia into <strong>Sky Strike Ace - Kagari</strong>. We now count our Machines in GY: 1 <strong>Superheavy Samurai Soulhorns</strong>, 1 <strong>Superheavy Samurai Soulgaia Booster</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Superheavy Samurai Soulpiercer</strong>, 1 <strong>Superheavy Samurai Motorbike</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Superheavy Samurai Beast Kyubi</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Mixeroid</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Steamroid</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Gear Gigant X</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Sky Striker Ace - Camellia</strong>. That's 10 Machine monsters, so we can now banish Miceroid and 8 other Machines from GY to Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Super Vehicroid - Stealth Union</strong> from Extra Deck ignoring it Summoning Conditions. Activate Monstrosity targeting Stealth Union and Special Summon 2 Level 9's with a different Type and Attribute than it from Deck but with different names. We are playing&nbsp;<strong>Winged Kuriboh LV9</strong>, <strong>Big Whale</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Steelswarm Longhorn</strong> for targets. Could there have been alternative plays we could've done in that combo to perhaps end something else in addition to our Prediction Princess plays? Yes, you could've searched&nbsp;<strong>Superheavy Samurai Stealthy</strong> off of Motorbike and Special Summon it, Linking it and Gear Gigant into Camellia which keeps Kyubi on our field for another Level 9 on field to perhaps go for a Rank 9 play in&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> as a part of our endboard. We could've Summoned&nbsp;<strong>Cloudcastle</strong> instead of Kyubi which is a Level 9 target that gets Bibliomuse from Deck with Monstrosity, meaning that you could go into it instead of making Stealth Union. I hate this Deck. Get it away from me. I never want to look at a Vehicroid monster again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Before I get into the monsters, I want to talk about the Level 9 Monstrosity targets I am playing in this Deck:&nbsp;<strong>Winged Kuriboh LV9</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Big Whale</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Steelswarm Longhorn</strong>. Winged Kuriboh LV9 isn't too bad of a Level 9 monster to build a Prediction Princess Deck around. I already have a Winged Kuriboh Prediction Princess Decklist I am planning to put up, but I am just tweaking at it a bit right now. Big Whale has an effect on Tribute Summon. We are never going to be using that effect, nor are we using it for anything else. Big Whale doesn't have an archetype surrounding it, and the generic Fish support doesn't do enough for me to contemplate making a Big Whale Prediction Princess Deck. If I wanted to make a Fish-Type Prediction Princess Deck, I'd go with&nbsp;<strong>Super Ancient Deepsea King Coelacanth</strong> which is just a better enabler for you to go into both Ib and Synchro 9's, multiple of them for that fact. As for Longhorn, Steelswarm is a Tribute Summon archetype. I am not about that at all, especially since Iswarm and Steelswarm don't have searchers. But the good news is that you can play Steelswarm Longhorn in Dark World Prediction Princess since&nbsp;<strong>Lucent, Netherlord of Dark World&nbsp;</strong>can get it straight from Deck. You just can't play the&nbsp;<strong>Archfiend Palabyrinth&nbsp;</strong>stuff since Longhorn isn't an Archfiend, but it still works to a degree in place of&nbsp;<strong>Annihilator Archfiend</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">For the Main Deck Monsters: 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotrei</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotreith</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, and 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">.

We are using Monk Benkei only for its Pendulum Effect which is if you control a SHS monster, you can add a SHS Soul monster from Deck to hand. We are always using this effect to get something like Soulgaia Booster or Soulpiercer if we need a Level 4 non-Tuner for our combo or getting Soulhorns if we need a Level 1 non-Tuner. Wakaushi&rsquo;s Pend Effect is that if you have no Spell/Traps in your GY, you can place a SHS Pend Monster except itself from Deck in your Pend Zone and Special Summon Wakaushi from its scale. And the only one of its monster effects that we are using is Wakaushi being able to scale itself from face-up Extra Deck if it is used as Synchro Material and sent there. Soulgaia Booster targets a SHS monster you control and equips itself from hand or field to that monster, and if it is equipped to a monster by its own effect, you can Special Summon it. Its other effects are not exactly relevant as we are just using this card as a Level 4 non-Tuner we are able to Summon. Soulpiercer also targets a SHS you control to equip itself from hand or field to that monster, and if it is sent from field to GY, you can add a SHS monster from Deck to hand other than itself. This effect is not once per turn. Soulhorns also targets a SHS you control and equips itself from hand or field to it, and while it is equipped by its own effect, you can Special Summon it. Motorbike can discard itself if you have no Spell/Traps in GY to add a Superheavy Samurai monster from Deck to hand except itself. It&rsquo;s other effect allows you to target a Machine you control to increase its Level by 2, but we aren&rsquo;t exactly Synchro comboing like you would normally in SHS, so this isn&rsquo;t relevant. Stealthy is an inherent Special Summon from hand if you have no Spell/Traps in your GY once per turn. And since it is a Level 1 monster, it can also meet your Level 1 non-Tuner requirement. Also, if you have no Spell/Traps in GY, you can Quick Effect Tribute it to target a Spell/Trap in your opponent&rsquo;s GY and set it to your field but banish it when it leaves the field. This effect will rarely come up, but supposedly if your opponent Imperms you and you already have a Level 1 non-Tuner other than Stealthy in rotation, you can use this to get another piece of interruption for yourself. </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Gizmek Makami, the Ferocious Fanged Fortress</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> which you would usually Pendulum Summon in this Deck if you really need to use its effect.

This attempts to use more Magistus cards combined with unforseen interactions to elevate the floor of the magistus deck. This version of the list is able to steal games against the top of the meta of TCG, which is a position that Magistus has never been in.</p><p>Of course, this isn't a pure build that some of you may have liked to see (with Rilliona + Magistus spells). Currently, all the magistus spells have little effective use and/or require to much setup to be anywhere close to valuable. In the future, we may get support (OCGStories) that make Rilliona easier to slot in, but I strive to make the baseline Magistus deck as strong as possible, which brings us to this decklist here. There is a lot of room for customization in this list, so feel free to tinker as you see fit.</p><p>Card List:</p><p>Hand-Traps/Board Breakers:</p><p>3x Fenrir</p><p>3x Ash Blossom</p><p>2x Droll and Lock Bird</p><p>1x Effect Veiler</p><p>1x Called by the Grave</p><p>3x Infinite Impermanece</p><p>Note: The Ratios for Droll/Veiler are due to the ability of witch to search them out. In a lot of hands, you will have more then enough for the combo (especially without opp interaction), so you can search these for added disruption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Engine:</p><p>3x Endymion</p><p>3x Imesty</p><p>3x Zoroa</p><p>1x Witch of the Black Forest</p><p>1x Maximus</p><p>2x Nadir Servant</p><p>3x King's Sarcophagus</p><p>Note: Ratios for Nadir/Maximus is due to the prevelance of Droll in the format and the general value of Maximus in the hand. Maximus is a very good extender as another body and doesn't lose as hard to droll if hard drawn. Since we already run Zombie Vampire as a way to each of our engines, I didn't personally find value in maxing out Nadir, however these ratios are customizable to yourself.</p><p>Extenders:</p><p>2x Magicians' Souls</p><p>1x Nefarious Archfiend Eater of Nefariousness &lt;- Not an activated effect to SS itself, so it works with witch</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Basic End Board:</p><p>Possessed Partnerships + I:P</p><p>Best End Board: (In a lot of games w/ no interruption you will be able to get here. I'm not including hand traps in either board as they depend on the mills or draws in the turn).</p><p>Savage, I:P, Possessed Partnerships, Cartesia, Fleur</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Close the first Banisher with ""Book of Moon"" and adjust the levels of new monsters to 2 with ""Star Changer"".</p><p>4) With ""Primal Seed"" loop, fetch every spell from Banish Zone (BZ) to your hand if you can but at least 10 shall be sufficient except combo pieces.</p><p>5) When you have found all spells, here is your checklist as to which belongs where...</p><ul><li>BZ: ""Book of Moon"" + ""Mystik Wok"" (If these aren't in BZ, use ""Monster Reborn"" and target both spells on revived target.)</li><li>Set: ""Primal Seed"" + ""Book of Taiyou"" + ""Stoic Challenge"" + ""Time Thief Hack"" + ""Contract with the Void""</li></ul><p>6) With monsters present in #3, XYZ Summon Plump. Afterwards, play ""Contract with the Void"" to send all spells you have from your hand to GY and start feeding your cat, which should include ""Purrely Delicious Memory"".</p><p>7) Open up Banisher from #3 with ""Book of Taiyou"" to start ""Primal Seed"" loop, again. Reason is that the ability of Plump isn't hard once per turn. So, you can reset Plump with Book spells and it can be well fed.</p><p>8) When there is nothing more to feed your cat, activate ""Stoic Challenge"" + ""Time Thief Hack"" on Plump. Alongside ""Purrely Delicious Memory"", Plump should have 600 + 300 + 300 = 1200 ATK per XYZ material.</p><p>9) Finally, activate ""Mystik Wok"" on Plump. Choose its ATK and let Number 43 convert healing into reflecting damage for massive FTK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Stoic Challenge"" can be found within ""Blazing Warriors"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Lantron+Rotator+Eclipse,"<p>Greetings! Here, I'm going to show you how to FTK with ""Princess of Tsurugi"" alongside flipper cards. Let me show you how.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) At one point, discard both Tsurugis with Ravenous and have at least two plants placed to opposing side with ""Black Garden"". Then, Special Summon Lantron with Saryuja.</p><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to have ""Primal Seed"" loop active.</p><p>3) Revive both Tsurugis with ""Monster Reborn"" and pass them to opponent with ""Mystic Box"". Then, set any spells but ""Primal Seed"" + ""Card Rotator"" + ""Book of Lunar Eclipse"" while reserving a spot for ""Primal Seed"" loop.</p><p>4) First, play ""Book of Lunar Eclipse"" to close both Tsurugis. Next, play ""Card Rotator"" to open both Tsurugis. Normally, you would take damage from Tsurugis but thanks to Lantron, you can reflect said damage.</p><p>5) Repeat what was explained in #4 until your opponent is dead...</p><ul><li>If you can't play ""Card Rotator"", play ""Pot of Avarice"" to be able to use ""Card Rotator"" 5 more additional times. Just be mindful of how many cards you have in your Main Deck, in order to play ""Pot of Avarice"" and draw monsters with ""Into the Void"" and ""Allure of Darkness"".</li><li>If you don't want to bother with it, feel free to add ""Pot of Generosity"", found in ""Side Deck"". To be honest, there is no need to, as the damage output can go up to 5000 in total. Thus, you only need three monsters in your hand for ""Card Rotator"" to close the game.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Book of Lunar Eclipse"" can be found within ""Beastly Claws of Terror"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 180 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Let's see...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/l1ily1wrq9o"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When Maple is present, choose either <strong>FIRE</strong> for Baseball Kid or <strong>DARK</strong> for Ohm as <strong>Attribute.&nbsp;</strong>You can take a look at other Attribute changers in ""Side Deck"" but to be honest, Maple is the best and very easy to setup.</p><p>2) Depending on your pick in #1, Special Summon either Baseball Kid or Ohm with Saryuja. Know that you can cut one of them, I just wanted to include both for showcase...</p><ul><li>If you don't have Saryuja, either use ""Trismagistus"" or ""Double Summon"", which can be found in ""Side Deck"".</li></ul><p>3) Play ""One for One"" to send Telefon to GY and Special Summon the other one in Attack Position...</p><ul><li>Alternatively, ""Monster Reborn"" shall do the trick, if you have discarded both Telefons with Ravenous. Check it out in ""Side Deck"".</li></ul><p>4) With Ohm/Kid and Telefon around, you can cycle Telefons to deal infinite damage. After you have activated the ability of 1st Telefon and Special Summoned 2nd one in Attack Position, you can deliver 1st one to GY with Ohm/Kid to deal some damage. Repeat this process back and forth between 1st and 2nd Telefon alongside Ohm/Kid until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Ultimate Baseball Kid"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 570 SR and 90 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Black Garden + Clockwork Night,"<p>Hello and welcome to another guide, where I will be explaining how to burn your opponent down with ""Cyber Summon Blaster"". Let's get into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/s1DTIBIbfD4"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When you have exactly four cards in Main Deck and a Spellcaster monster in addition to four random ones present onboard, Link Summon Saryuja by using four random ones as materials. Don't use Spellcaster by accident.</p><p>2) Activate Saryuja and first shuffle 2 x Blaster cards, then anything but combo pieces. Therefore, whenever you activate ""The Dark Magicians"" (TDM), it will be guaranteed you can draw Blaster cards for sure.</p><p>3) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon ""Black Luster Soldier"" (BLS) with its ability to have ""Primal Seed"" loop active.</p><p>4) Special Summon ""Fusion Parasite"" with Saryuja, which lets you Fusion Summon TDM by using Parasite + Spellcaster as materials.</p><p>5) Activate first ""Black Garden"" and pass it to opponent with ""Land Flipping"". Then, activate second ""Black Garden"" and don't forget to draw first Blaster, which was set up in #2.</p><p>6) After playing ""Clockwork Night"", you can play ""Acid Rain"" but make sure you have ""Monster Reborn"" (MR) in your hand. Reason is that if you can't revive BLS with MR, you can't keep ""Primal Seed"" engine running. Then, revive TDM for another time with MR to draw second Blaster.</p><p>7) By reviving BLS and other monsters with MR, both Black Gardens will flourish your opponent's board with roses. Meanwhile, Blaster cards are going to burn your opponent to death. Just don't forget to reset everything with ""Acid Rain"" and always have ""Monster Reborn"" in-hand to keep going.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spiral Spear Strike"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""The Dark Magicians"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Fusion Parasite"" + ""Land Flipping"" + ""Cyber Summon Blaster"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 150 SR and 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 660 SR and 270 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Whirlwind Weasel&rsquo;s Flip Effect triggers to lock your opponent out from activating Spell or Trap Cards for the rest of the turn. And Deus-X, while it doesn&rsquo;t trigger, since it was flipped face-up, negates all activated monster effects on your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field while it is face-up. Is there anything different you could&rsquo;ve done to produce a different result with what you had? Yes, but I will explain those things when I get to the individual cards. However, I think that this is definitely a big step up from what Ham Prediction Princess used to look like. Ib being able to search Monstrosity is just so good for Prediction Princess. Unlike Generaider, Monstrosity access is practically necessary for your Ritual searches through Herald and Aggregator as well as Bibliomuse access. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">For the Main Deck monsters: 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotrei</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotreith</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, and 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">.

Tarotrei is your main enabler for your Flip Monsters and not Tarotreith because Tarotrei is the one flipping Tarotreith up in the first place which facilitates the rest of your Flips. Tarotrei has a Quick Effect that lets you target a monster on field and change it to face-up Attack Position if it is in face-down Defense or change it to face-down Defense Position if it is face-up on the field. And during your End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from your hand or GY in face-down Defense Position. Tarotreith is a Ritual Flip Monster who must be either Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned from hand or GY by the effect of Prediction Princess Tarotrei during your End Phase.

So, during your opponent&rsquo;s Standby Phase, you can use an effect like Underworld Ritual of Prediction&rsquo;s GY effect or Tarotreith&rsquo;s effect to get this from Deck to give Tarotrei and Tarotreith targeting and destruction protection. Not only that, but you can trigger her Flip Effect again to search for a Prediction Princess monster and a Ritual Spell from Deck which can help you either go for lethal or help you rebuild your board on the following turn. So, instead of going for Pot of the Forbidden and filling up your last remaining Monster Zone with Pot, you can Summon Bibliomuse instead if you don&rsquo;t value the draw 2 or hand rip. 2 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Deus-X Krawler</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> and 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Pot of the Forbidden</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">.

And if it is destroyed while on field field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it from Deck, which coincidentally gets you to either Tarotrei or Tarotreith in this Deck.

I am really back and forth on Pot of the Forbidden. For the most part, it is not necessary in a Prediction Princess Deck. You could play it for a different flavor of Flip Monster Effect, but it&rsquo;s not necessary or really that good. The draw 2 is overshadowed by Bibliomuse searching a Prediction Princess and Ritual Spell. The Giant Trunade effect doesn&rsquo;t really work in a world where Battle Traps aren&rsquo;t around that much, or even at all. Sure it can help you get rid of floodgates and sure it can clear your opponent&rsquo;s backrow if you flip Pot on your opponent&rsquo;s turn after they set all of them, but you would be better off going blind into your opponent&rsquo;s turn with Deus-X to negate activated monster effects.

Despite not having the Engine the Volcanic Core makes up for it in terms or power and aggression. Opening Trooper gives u a instant line to Emperor and burn of 1k to give you a early start to the duel. After your done with the volcanic plays you can go into the Fire King cards. If you open sanctuary or island then you already have a line to Garunix as you can pop Trooper or Rimfire (Its effect will still trigger alongside Garunix's but would be Chain Link 1) to add Garunix to hand. These lead to plays like having a Emperor and Garunix on the field with a possible Sanctuary and Island. Emperor is a level 8 which allows you to go into Rank 8 plays if you are going 2nd or Emperor and Garunix on field with a Barong popped in the GY to get you a Kirin on the next SP. This deck is still in testing but after recent duels at a couple locals and only losing one match out of 6 it has a lot of potential for budget players</p>

They constantly summon more link material to the field so that the duelist can link climb during their plays. x3 Parallel Exceed is included since it makes an easy rank 4 as long as you have a link zone on field, which is typically Alembertian so it can search Circular and you can full combo from there. x2 Cynet Mining is included to search any Cyberse monster. <br /></span></div><div style=""font-size: medium; margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri,Helvetica,sans-serif; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""font-size: medium; margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri,Helvetica,sans-serif; margin: 0px;""><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"" style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri,Helvetica,sans-serif; margin: 0px;"">Since the strategy is extremely consistent, a large portion of the deck is composed of <strong>STAPLE </strong>cards. </span>First, the mandatory ""Maxx C"" package is included to counter the ever dominant card of Masterduel's meta - there exists 8 cards that counter the insect, that being x3 Ash Blossom, x2 Called By, x1 Crossout, and x2 Psy-Frame Gear Gamma. x3 Small World is included since it searches every card in the deck!

This deck features many one card starters, and ways to search your 1-card starter (2 level 4s -&gt; Alembertian -&gt; Mathmech Circular). Even if this deck is interrupted, this strategy has so many extenders that it can shrug off weaker handtraps with ease. Cyberse Mathmech can also OTK on a dime with an Accesscode Talker that can attack twice (totalling 8600ATK!) with as little as one card if allowed to fully combo! </span><br /></span></div><div style=""font-size: medium; margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""font-size: medium; margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"">The main combo of Cyberse Mathmech revolve around it's key card - Mathmech Circular (think about this card as this deck's ""Branded Fusion"" or ""Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage""). 1 circular leads to 3 omni-negates, multiple removals, 1 handloop and follow-up/GY set-up for next turn!</span></div><div style=""font-size: medium; margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-size: medium; margin: 0px; text-align: start; color: #000000;""><span class=""ContentPasted4"" style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri,Helvetica,sans-serif; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><div style=""font-size: medium; margin: 0px; text-align: start; color: #000000;""><span class=""ContentPasted4"" style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri,Helvetica,sans-serif; margin: 0px;"">Mathmech Circular&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; background-color: #ffffff;"">=</span><span class=""ContentPasted4"" style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;<em>Set Mathmech Superfactorial (Summons Laplacian which is non-targeting removal of monster, S/T, and handloops 1 card + 1 omni-negate if made with Diameter), 8000ATK Firewall Dragon Darkfluid Terahertz (2 omni-negates by sending Desavewurm and Mereologic Aggregator to GY) + follow-up.</em></span></div><ol style=""font-size: medium; text-align: start; list-style-type: decimal; color: #000000;"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_331""><li style=""font-family: Calibri,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><span class=""ContentPasted4"" style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Circular's effect in hand to summon itself by sending to GY Sigma.</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><span class=""ContentPasted4"" style=""margin: 0px;"">Summon Sigma's effect in GY to summon itself.</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><span class=""ContentPasted4"" style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Circular's trigger effect to search for Superfactorial from deck.

If you feel like you've been interrupted too much or you hand isn't optimal, you can end off on Heatsoul, or Heatsoul + Transcode, depending on your situation. Opponents typically prevent you from turning on the ""Mathmech"" part of the interruption online like stopping you from searching Superfactorial or preventing/banishing Mathmech monsters in the GY. In those scenarios, variations of the Heatsoul, Transcode and Terahertz set-up are still very good.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;"">Going second Cyberse Mathmech, attempts to handtrap the opponent to simplify their game state.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;"">The amount of momentum that Circular and any extenders that the strategy gives the duelist should allow them to create Accesscode with 3-4 pops coupled with Update Jammer's double attack.&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;"">Alternatively, Terahertz can be created and summoned to the Extra Monster Zone.

They need those zones empty to use their effects! Also, certain monsters enjoy being co-linked with Transcode for additional protection from targeting effects - keep this in mind when building your board!</li><li style=""font-family: Calibri,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"">If you get Maxx ""C""'d and you have no cards to counter it, you either end your turn or you finish off your opponent immediately.

Adding on top generic Cyberse support to enable the strategy even further with extenders and consistency makes the deck even more potent, leaving it capable of plowing through established boards with engine alone.

It will be shocking for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/CnT0IE6ij_M"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Throughout the game, discard Coltwing+Generator with Ravenous and send Number 13 to GY.</p><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to setup your Primal Seed loop. As long as you don't banish Number 13 and/or Generator with Chaos Emperor by accident, all is well.</p><p>3) Revive Number 13 with ""Monster Reborn"" and overlay into Number 43 with ""Rank-Up-Magic Launch"". Place Number 43 on Extra Monster Zone (EMZ). Then, revive Coltwing with ""Monster Reborn"" and replace it with a token by playing ""Vertical Landing"". By reviving Coltwing another time with ""Monster Reborn"", it should generate two more tokens.</p><p>4) The current level of Coltwing is based on the sum of level of tokens and original level of Coltwing. This is addition, which is actually done only by tokens, not setting its level to fixed amount. Therefore, by playing ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" on Coltwing, its level will increase with respect to level of tokens. Reason is that you will also increase the level of tokens. Here is the process:</p><ul><li>At first, the level of Coltwing will be level 13 &gt;&gt;&gt; Coltwing (4) + Token (3) + Token (3) + Token (3)</li><li>Galaxy Queen's Light &gt;&gt;&gt; Target Coltwing (level 13) &gt;&gt;&gt; Tokens will be level 13</li><li>New calculation = Token (13) + Token (13) + Token (13) + Coltwing (4) = Coltwing (43)</li></ul><p>5) Repeat the step explained in #4, by targeting only on Coltwing and nothing else.</p><p>6) When you think it's enough or you couldn't play ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" due to limits, get rid of a token with ""Offerings to the Doomed"" and revive Generator with ""Monster Reborn"".</p><p>7) Activate Generator and choose Chaos Emperor. Since Chaos Emperor has very high level value, you will gain a lot of LP, with multiples of 100 per level in mind. Thanks to Number 43, you can convert the LP you have gained into damage and direct it to your opponent for the FTK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Don't destroy Panda/Chaos by accident.</p><p>4) Play ""Tri-Wight"" to revive 3 x Level 1 dudes, one of which has to be Tuner. Then, Synchro Summon Maple with Panda + 3 x Level 1 dudes and place Maple on EMZ. Choose <strong>WATER&nbsp;</strong>as&nbsp;<strong>Attribute.</strong></p><p>5) Place ""Zombie World"" and 3 x ""Everliving Underworld Cannon"" (EUC) cards. Then, play ""Tri-Wight"" for another time. Doesn't matter which monsters you are going to bring forth.</p><p>6) 3 x EUC cards have dealt 3 x 800 = 2400 damage in total. To repeat this step, you can Special Summon Poseidra by tributing three little dudes. Thus, all Spells and Traps will be returned to hand and EUC were reset. You can destroy Poseidra with Offerings because its ability can also trigger even in GY and it's not hard once per turn, fortunately.</p><p>7) Repeat what was explained in #5 alongside placing ME-PSY-YA to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop and #6 until opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Zombie World"" can be collected by purchasing ""Immortal Glory"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Poseidra, the Atlantean Dragon"" can be found within ""Forgotten City Dwellers"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Most opening hands will have 2-3 lines of play going first.</p><p>1 Line of play probability: 99.06%</p><p>2 Lines of play probability: 90.7%</p><p>3 Lines of play probability: 64.59%</p><p>Going second You'll open 3 lines of play 80.28% of the time allowing you to play through boards with ease.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For mill probability optimization you have the following (these stats go up dramatically if you search out planet or kings sarc prior to milling, or if you open the cards that do not have mill effects):</p><p>hitting 1 effect off of milling 3: 90.19%</p><p>hitting 2 effects off of milling 3: 53.85%&nbsp;</p><p>hitting 2 effects off of milling 6: 92.93%</p><p>hitting 3 effects off of milling 6: 71.73%</p><p>For going first your goal is to set up a rulkallos, grapha or toad prior to your 5th summon, then go for a zombie vampire play to set up mills, and then focus on creating a hand and board with lots of interaction (sulliek/metanoise on board, tear kash in hand (or toad on board with tear kash in grave), hapi on board if possible). Try to keep all 3 tear names in your deck to extend further on the opponents turn. Creating a winda on the opponents turn can be devastating. Depending on the opponents deck making abyss dweller turn 1 can be an incredibly potent move.&nbsp;</p><p>For going second, side out winda for guardian chimera and grapha for TY-PHON. Droplet and super poly can be used over cards that are better going first (night sword serpent, terraforming (weak to droll), trivikarma (weak to droll), wraitsoth (weak to droll))to improve specific matchups. Side both against cintureon, super poly against most fire decks, and super poly against most fusion decks aswell. You can also use heartbeat for field/continuous spell dependant decks, and cryme for going first or against decks with lots of bystials. Gamaciel can be used to beat out decks where super poly is not as potent. Gamaciel could even be replaced with lava golem or sphere mode as the normal summon is not always relevant in this deck. Gamaciel could even be replaced with something like chaos hunter or imperial iron wall, to soften the hardest matchups which are typically kashtira and bystial heavy decks. Floo and vanquish soul seem like hard matchups on paper but you can out-gas them fairly easily just by having 2-3 lines of play. If you get shifter'd and they are going first youre typically okay as you can play on their turn using scream, traps, and quick effects. If you're going first do whatever you can to survive to your second turn and maintain a line of play.&nbsp;</p>"

I might seem crazy playing only 1 Airbellum and Darksoul for Rescue Cat, but playing 2 copies of each doubles the chances of you actually drawing it, so my ingenious biology major brain tells me to play just the single copy of each and just not draw them. It's that easy. Faultroll cannot be Normal Summoned/Set and must be Special Summoned from hand by controlling 2 or more face-up X-Saber monsters and cannot be Special Summoned by other ways. And as a soft once per turn, he can Special Summon a Level 4 or lower X-Saber monster from your GY. No clue why he has this Summoning Condition/Restriction, but it isn&rsquo;t too bad of a downside. Faultroll is still a very good X-Saber card. Darksoul has an effect that activates during the End Phase which adds an X-Saber monster from Deck to hand if it was sent from your field to the GY this turn. I mean, sure. I guess we could get another Faultroll for next turn, if we can actually summon it next turn. Airbellum&rsquo;s effect really does not matter as we are just using it as a Level 3 Tuner monster. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">For the Spell/Traps: 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Pot of Prosperity</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Instant Fusion</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> for </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Master of Ham</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Underworld Ritual of Prediction</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can banish it from the GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess monster from your Deck face-down. 2 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Ritual</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> which only RItual Summons Prediction Princess Tarotrei and you can banish it from GY except the turn it was sent there to search for a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster. 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Pre-Preparation of Rites</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">.

Don't rely on drawing ponix first turn, most of firekings can search out and destroy ponix or search sanctuary itself. Use the resonators but don't get attached, they are fodder just like ash, whom you can bring back from grave only with book of life(its a double whammy, ymmv) to then tune with kirin or any 4star to make ancient fairy dragon that then summons another resonator or fire king.

Survival Instinct + Rebirth Judgment,"<p>Hi! Here, the objective is to FTK the opponent with ""Number 43"" thanks to&nbsp;<strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>adjustments coming from ""Rebirth Judgment"", where ""Survival Instinct"" also plays key role. Let's get into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FR_05VGG9hw"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Link Summon Saryuja when you have exactly 4 cards in Main Deck. Activate Saryuja to shuffle 3 cards and choose Traps as first two choices to ensure you will always draw them, which also matters for ""The Dark Magicians"" (TDM).</p><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop.</p><p>3) Special Summon ""Fusion Parasite"" with Saryuja, which lets you Fusion Summon TDM by using Parasite + Spellcaster as materials. Activate TDM to draw your first Trap and enable it. To reset TDM for another time, send it to GY with ""Self-Mummification"" and revive with ""Monster Reborn"" afterwards.</p><p>4) If you have XYZ Summoned Number 13 and sent it to GY, you can revive it with ""Monster Reborn"". Then, overlay into Number 43 with ""Rank-Up-Magic Launch"" and send to GY with ""Self-Mummification"". Do it another time for 2nd copy of Number 43 and revive both Number 43 monsters with ""Monster Reborn"".</p><p>5) Send all monsters from your hand to GY with ""Contract with the Void"". Then, deliver all monsters but Chaos Emperor + 2 x Number 43 to GY with ""Self-Mummification"", if any.</p><p>6) What you did in #5 was more fuel for ""Survival Instict"". After activating ""Rebirth Judgment"" and choosing&nbsp;<strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>as&nbsp;<strong>Dinosaur,&nbsp;</strong>you can follow it up with ""Survival Instict"". Banish all of your monsters in GY to gain lots of LP. With both Number 43 monsters present, they will convert life into death for your opponent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Rebirth Judgment"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""The Dark Magicians"" can be collected by purchasing ""Cybernetic Successor"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Fusion Parasite"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 510 SR and 210 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

This Deck turns out to be a Yugi classic which actually works like a well rounded Strategy. It's also a very fun Deck which you don't see to much in Master Duels High Ranks.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned sometimes already now you can also delete the Slifer Focus and instead use <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=11020863"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/11020863.jpg"" data-card=""11020863"" data-name=""Royal Straight Slasher"">Royal Straight Slasher</span></a> or you are crazy and use both (Bricks like... but with enough outside support it may work). Slifer will always be my favourite of the egyptian gods and I'm glad he found his home in this Musketeer Strategy.</p><p>If you like Slifer, Poker Cards or Yugi in general and want to play a fun Deck try it, you won't regret it^^ It's also quite the good one since you can aim for Platinum League and higher with this one easily.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""box-sizing: border-box;

About a month ago, I have <a href=""/deck/graceful-soul-407823"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>won</strong></a> with&nbsp;<strong>Relay Soul&nbsp;</strong>and decided to do it again with a different setup: A dancer Jinzo, who would have thought :D</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsxN4lwK6GY"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Discard Banisher with Ravenous. Then, place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. As long as you don't banish Ancient/Banisher with Chaos Emperor by accident, all is well.</p><p>2) Destroy Saryuja with ""Offerings to the Doomed"" and clear at least 3 x Main Monster Zones (MMZ), which will be utilized for Trishula. Then, revive Ancient + Level 1 Tuner + Level 1 Non-Tuner and Synchro Summon Trishula with those three.</p><p>3) Activate Trishula to deplete your opponent's resources by banishing anything from their hand + GY + field, which is extremely beneficial if you go second. Repeat this procedure with ""De-Synchro"" until there is nothing your opponent has.</p><p>4) Revive materials of Trishula and tribute them for Plasma. Then, revive Ancient + Martial/Shamisen with ""Monster Reborn"" and Synchro Summon Baronne. Place it on Extra Monster Zone (EMZ).</p><p>5) Revive Cthugua + Martial/Shamisen with ""Monster Reborn"" but before you Synchro Summon Salamander with said monsters, play ""Pot of Avarice"" once by targeting 5 x Main Deck monsters. Then, give your opponent Jinzo + Relay Soul with ""Gold Moon Coin"" and set Primal Seed + Drop Off + Crackdown. Finally, you can bring forth Salamander to not deck out easily.</p><p>6) Revive ""Banisher"" with ""Monster Reborn"" and destroy ME-PSY-YA with Baronne. Now, everything will be banished instead of just Spell/Trap cards. End your turn but don't forget to set ""Primal Seed"" as well.</p><p>7) On your opponent's Draw Phase, activate ""Drop Off"". If needed, negate whatever your opponent can activate with Baronne in response to ""Drop Off"", just in case.</p><p>8) If your opponent sets ""Relay Soul"", here is how to win:</p><ul><li>Your opponent concedes, which can happen most of the time even before all of that, especially while depleting your opponent's resources with Trishula done in #3.</li><li>Your opponent doesn't use anything given to them. In that case, attack directly for the win. Also, repeat using Drop Off, which was explained in #7. You can also revive a monster with Reborn and destroy it with Offerings to not draw any cards, although there is no need to thanks to Salamander refilling your deck, done in #5.</li><li>Your opponent activates ""Relay Soul"" and Special Summons Jinzo. Rather than being lame and destroying Jinzo with Offerings/Baronne, activate ""Crackdown"" on Jinzo for coolness factor. Let me explain why...<ol><li>Jinzo has the ability of negating Trap cards and you can't activate Trap cards.</li><li>However, Plasma was here before Jinzo, which can be able to negate opponent's monster effects. One-sided&nbsp;<strong><a href=""/card/skill-drain-6952"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Skill Drain,</a> </strong>in a nutshell.</li><li>Jinzo can't negate ""Crackdown"" while under being negated by Plasma. So, ""Crackdown"" can steal Jinzo, even though it shouldn't.</li><li>Jinzo is on your side, meaning the negation effect coming from Plasma has been lifted. However, now Jinzo can negate ""Crackdown"", so it can be passed to the opponent automatically.</li><li>What was explained in #3 and #4 is going to happen back and forth, while Jinzo is switching sides. Since this loop is infinite, game decides to find the culprit and end this madness by killing it, which is ""Jinzo"".</li></ol></li></ul><p>9) Congratulations, you have <strong>won</strong>&nbsp;with Relay Soul!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Lavalval Salamander"" can be found within ""Combatants of Flame"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"" can be found within ""Glacial Seal"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Destiny HERO - Plasma"" can be found within ""Shrouded Heroes"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Jinzo"" + ""Relay Soul"" + ""Drop Off"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 150 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 270 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

I'm only using cards that are good going second and going for the OTK. Nibiru is included as a Crossout Designator option. Crossout at 3 mostly to counter hand-traps. Magileine at 3 to bait out hand traps and because it's a one card OTK. Kumongous at 3 because on top of what it's good for, it's also a strong earth monster to revive with the Vernusylphs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kashtira Fenrir deserves special mention; it's a high attack power monster you can special summon to banish one card from the field, and it searches another copy of itself to your hand, which can be used as discard fodder. It's an excellent card in this deck that can be used to help extend your OTK attempt. It also serves as bait for hand traps if your opponent thinks you're using a Kashtira deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Otherwise standard ratios. Still tinkering around with the extra deck and side deck. I welcome constructive criticism.</p>"
