Then, Special Summon Hiro with Saryuja but only if you have up to 3 x MD monsters, including Hiro. Also, although not mandatory, place Baronne on Main Monster Zone (MMZ).</p><p>2) Clear at least 2 x MMZ with Ravenous/Baronne/Raigeki. Then, set all Traps and end your turn. During your opponent's Draw Phase, activate these Traps in order explained below:</p><ol><li>Powerful Rebirth &gt;&gt;&gt; Wattfox</li><li>Reverse Reuse &gt;&gt;&gt; MJ #2 as face-down</li><li>Give and Take &gt;&gt;&gt; Wanghu</li><li>All-Out Attacks</li></ol><p>3) What is going to happen is that Wanghu destroys Wattfox, which shuts down anything your opponent can try to break you, including hand-traps. Then, via All-Out Attacks, MJ #2 will flip face-up and you can start milling your opponent. While your Traps are resolving, feel free to negate one thing your opponent can activate in response to them with Baronne.</p><p>4) After your job is done with Traps, MJ #2 is going to excavate three monsters, which are MJ #2 + Hiro + Wanghu. Should it come to that, place these monsters in order below and know that if you have two more Main Deck monsters, place them as last:</p><ol><li>MJ #2</li><li>Hiro</li><li>Wanghu</li></ol><p>5) Now, your opponent draws 3 cards each time Hiro has been activated.

It is a condensed ball of every problem Yugioh boomers and other card game players will lie about on Twitter. Usually, this is just nonsense, but in our case, it is a guide. Run down the timer with your combos, throw out stupid staples, and make a million negates.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Be the reason someone quits master duel.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">So here&rsquo;s my modern-day deck list for 60 6 samurai. It&rsquo;s very straightforward, you&rsquo;re playing 3 of every six samurai monster that can spam out other six samurai monsters or special summon themselves for free. 3 Kizaru, 3 Grandmaster, 3 Great Shogun Shien, and 3 Kageki.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">We&rsquo;re also running 3 Mizuho and 3 Shinai. Each one of these special summons themself from their hand if you control the other. This matters since they&rsquo;re searchable from secret Six Samurai Kizaru. Even more so since this deck&rsquo;s best 2 extenders are rank 3.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This gets us into a larger point of strategy. Counter generation. Six Samurai as a deck revolve around generating bushido counters every time a Six Samurai monster is summoned. Gateway of the Six Samurai let&rsquo;s us search for a Six Samurai monster for every 4 counters anywhere. But it only generates 2 counters for each summon. This means we either need multiple counter-generating cards or we can use extenders to turn every 2 monsters into a different 2 monsters and some counters.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For example. 2 levels 3&rsquo;s go into M-X Saber invoker which goes into kizaru and a search. Or islolde into hatsune. Going two for 2.5 lets the deck deal with heavy costs and negs that come with link spamming and starting combos.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I&rsquo;ll also mention here the three great shogun shien. It&rsquo;s a hard floodgate of an opponent&rsquo;s spells and traps that summons itself for free. In the TCG I&rsquo;d be a bit more hesitant about running it, but in Master Duel's janky best-of-one format it&rsquo;s so much stronger than it has any right to be.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This list makes use of several powerful engines. Most notable is the Kashtira engine. It&rsquo;s a simple tool that gets us disruption removal and free attack thanks to the field spell.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">But even more interesting is the zodiac engine. Zodiac Barrage has no restrictions or real cost so At its most basic it pulls out an extra material for a link monster or just an extra disruption with Zoodiac Drident. But more interestingly we can use zodiac barrage to destroy six samurai fuma to trigger her effect.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>So it ends up being a plus one. Fuma is also searchable thanks to Isolde two tales of the noble knights or literally any six samurai searcher.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Zodiac Barrage and Kashtiras contribute to what put this deck head and shoulders above my early iterations. Not only is it a stupid wombo combo deck, but you have tools to play going second.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The extra deck is very straightforward. Let&rsquo;s split it into extenders and end board.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">We have the before-mentioned extenders of mx saber invoker and Isolde but let me explain the other 3. Battle Shogun of the Six Samurai is a searcher for Gateway of the Six Samurai. He does take as discard and doesn&rsquo;t lead to any further plays on his own so he has to be used either in specific 3-4 card combos or after we&rsquo;ve done some setup with Isolde and M-X Saber Invoker. Basically, unless you're guaranteed to have follow up don&rsquo;t make him.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Skull Dread Saryuja is a bread and butter extender. Especially since most of this deck is extenders and 1-card engines. Drawing 4 is crazy and with some extra searches, thanks to Isolde, Gateway and Kizaru the put-back 3 cost doesn&rsquo;t hurt.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Leviar is an extender&rsquo;s extender. If we have already used mx saber invoker and Isolde to make Hatsume we can then follow up the hatsume skill with a leviair. To keep the loops going. It&rsquo;s very overkill, but does sustain some otherwise suboptimal starts.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For our end boards, we have a large chunk dedicated to generic link spam. IP Masquerna lets us benefit from leaving out materials. Knightmare Gryphon is a monster effect negate floodgate. Appollosa is just 4 monster negates. And Underworld Goddess is a out to problematic monsters and an extra target for I:P.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For XYZ&rsquo;s we have Abyss Dweller and Bagooska. Bagooska is a simple backup plan. Abyss Dweller is an anti-graveyard floodgate. Master Duel being a best-of-one format makes this awkward to use. Since you kinda just gotta feel it.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Naturia Beast and six samurai shien are our spell negates. Of course, Naturia Beast is a much better play but we need access to Shien&rsquo;s Squire to get it. This means we have to go through a limited number of good but not guaranteed options to get it from the deck. Much more often we&rsquo;ll go for shi en who&rsquo;s only 1 spell or trap negate.</p>"

Today's Level 9 monster we are taking a look at is&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 009&nbsp;</strong>which is a Level 9 EARTH Machine monster whereas its effect could matter less. I should've come to realization of what a Deskbot Prediction Princess Deck should be much sooner, but at the time, I was thinking ""Deskbot 009 is an EARTH monster, this is not going to work,"" like a dumbdumb and I completely forgot that&nbsp;<strong>Machine Duplication&nbsp;</strong>exists. You see, every Deskbot monster has 500 ATK/DEF and they each have their own ways of increasing their ATK/DEF to very large amounts. They are practically begging you to use Machine Duplication with them. And the Deskbot cards actually make getting to 009 extremely easy, specifically&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 003</strong> does. On Normal Summon, 003 can Special Summon a Deskbot monster from Deck, except for itself, which can immediately get a 009 onto the field. There you go. End of story. Now just activate Machine Duplication for 2 more copies of 009 from Deck, and now you've got yourself Rank 9 access and an additional Level 9 monster to boot. So all you really need for combo is&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 003</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Machine Duplication</strong>. Now, we are playing&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</strong> and&nbsp;3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which we can use for Bibliomuse access through Summoning Kaku for free (by Linking 003 into&nbsp;<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong>), but we don't exactly need to rely on it. And if we don't draw Monstrosity or Machine Dupe, we can just use 009 and Kaku as Rank 9 access. You could instead play a <strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong> package with&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> but I like Bibliomuse access more.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">For the monsters: 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei is a Quick Effect to flip a monster face-up or face-down and during the End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down. Tarotreith can either be Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei&rsquo;s End Phase effect. On flip, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from your Deck face-down and she can Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters either face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from GY face-down if she was tributed and sent there. On flip, she can add a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand, and while she&rsquo;s face-up on field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent&rsquo;s effects. For our Flips, we have 2 <strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it from Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</strong> which can Special Summoned from hand if there is a monster in the Extra Monster Zone. This is extremely easy to do in this Deck with you being able to Link off a Normal Summoned&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 003</strong> for a&nbsp;<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong>. Also, you can target a face-up monster in the EMZ and equip it and when this card destroys a monster by battle, you can Special Summon a monster card that is equipped to it. Kaku is good for just getting a Level 9 onto the field, but it can also act as removal in some applications as well. And on top of both of those things, it makes for a good Small World bridge due to its Type and Attribute. 3&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 009</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Deskbot 003</strong>. 009 is just a Level 9 monster that we can easily access through 003 and Machine Dupe. 003 can Special Summon a Deskbot straight from Deck on Normal Summon. Both have 500 ATK which means that they can both be targeted by&nbsp;<strong>Machine Duplication</strong> and because Machine Dupe is not a once per turn, if you draw more than one, you can dupe 009 first for Rank 9 plays and then dupe 003 for Link plays. 3&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald</strong> which sends a Fairy from Deck or Extra Deck to GY to increase its Level by the Level of the sent monster. And because it has 500 ATK and is a LIGHT Fairy, it makes as a good way to bridge to 003. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can also banish it from GY during the Standby Phase in order to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. 3&nbsp;<strong>Small World</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which can either Special Summon a Level 9 from hand or target a Level 9 you control and Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from Deck with a different Type and Attribute than it but with different names. 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Machine Duplication</strong> which targets a Machine monster you control with 500 or less ATK and Special Summons up to 2 monsters from Deck with the same name as that monster.
