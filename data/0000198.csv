Released back in <em>The Lost Millennium</em>, this group of cards features seemingly random cards that are combined into one group by their support naming the following monsters: ""<a data-name=""Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter"">Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Monk Fighter"">Monk Fighter</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Master Monk"">Master Monk</a>"". They feature almost no strategy to begin with, but since they do still function as a card series I tinkered a little bit with them to come up with the following build.</p> <p>The monster line-up is as follows: Two ""<a data-name=""Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter"">Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter</a>"", three ""<a data-name=""Monk Fighter"">Monk Fighter</a>"" and three ""<a data-name=""Master Monk"">Master Monk</a>"" are basically required to make this deck a ""Monk"" deck, so there is little explanation necessary here. Two copies of ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"" can fetch both ""<a data-name=""Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter"">Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Evilswarm Heliotrope"">Evilswarm Heliotrope</a>"" as the biggest Rock-type Normal monster with Level 4 I could find. An ""Adamancipator"" engine consisting of three ""<a data-name=""Adamancipator Seeker"">Adamancipator Seeker</a>"" and three ""<a data-name=""Adamancipator Analyzer"">Adamancipator Analyzer</a>"" give the deck much needed speed and consistency and can make something out of the fact that ""<a data-name=""Monk Fighter"">Monk Fighter</a>"" is a Rock-type monster. Also, three ""<a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>"" are in the Main Deck to both clear the opposing board if they get too summon-heavy, but also function with another card in the deck.</p> <p>The backrow can be filled with three copies of ""<a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>"", which can also search for ""<a data-name=""Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter"">Chu-Ske the Mouse Fighter</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Evilswarm Heliotrope"">Evilswarm Heliotrope</a>"" like ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"" does, two ""<a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" to work with the graveyard and to gain more swarming, tempo, etc., three copies of ""<a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>"" to get around the fact that the ""Monk"" monsters have abysmal stats but still need to destroy monsters in battle, and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Legendary Black Belt"">Legendary Black Belt</a>"", which is kind of a win condition in this deck (albeit a bad one, but we are talking ""Monks"" here) and can potentially run over an opposing ""Nibiru Token"" for sizeable damage if ""<a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>"" is also involved. The Traps are three ""<a data-name=""Armory Call"">Armory Call</a>"" for Equip card consistency and a potential surprise for the opponent when they attack your monsters and you equip them with ""Moon Mirror Shield"" during their turn, three ""Lost Wind"" for being a lifesaver in this deck with effect negation and ATK halving, and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Lone Wolf"">Lone Wolf</a>"" for lackluster protection for one ""Monk"" monster. The Extra Deck does not need that much attention in my opinion, aside from ""<a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a>"" which is one of your searchers; the rest really only works as nice options to have in certain situations, but is certainly not necessary due to the gimmicky and casual nature of the deck in question.</p> <p>Would I recommend playing a ""Monk"" deck in 2021? No, absolutely not. There is little the deck can work against and with barely any synergy or strategy given by the series, it is certainly a gimmick from the past that I simply wanted to feature the deck for documentation purposes.

Here’s my attempt for working with them.  Rabbit and worm drake will work for turboing out king of the feral imps, it also can set up two worms in the graveyard for victory (who’s the main win con for this build), worm drake is a actually a reptile so it’s also unintentionally part of the archetype.  A little controversial is that I play 3 worm queen, normally people play one but I chose to do three because it summons from the deck.  I added Ogdoabyss for one reason, W nebula meteorite which summons a level 7 or higher light reptile which Ogdoabyss apparently fits the bill for.  Any other questions can be answered, Worms don’t have much potential but sometimes casual players rage so hard when victory is flipped."

Alongside Slifer, Obelisk received a new Structure Deck that supports its playstyle and allows to be summoned a bit faster than before, as well as adding a search option.  Rules are the same as always: It must be a 40-card Main Deck with any cards on the Extra Deck, where the Extra Deck must feature at least 30+ cards from the selected Structure Deck.  Starting up, we have the main star of the deck: <strong>Obelisk the Tormentor</strong>. A Level 10 DIVINE Divine-Beast monster with 4000 ATK/DEF, that requires 3 tributes to be Normal Summoned, neither player can activate cards or effects during its Normal Summon and said Normal Summon can't be negated, also it is sent to the GY during the End Phase if it was Special Summoned instead. It cannot be targeted by card effects (including your own) and you can tribute 2 monsters to destroy all monsters your opponent controls but Obelisk can't attack that turn. Obelisk is the only one of the 3 Egyptian God monsters that has a baseline ATK/DEF and a very solid one, even if Slifer and Ra can get bigger with the proper setup. You run it at 3 since the new support actually makes him easy to summon and it can be searched with <strong>Gizmek Makami, the Ferocious Fanged Fortress</strong> (If it is Normal or Special Summoned, you can discard 1 monster to add 1 monster from your Deck to your hand whose ATK equals its DEF).  For the new support, <strong>Soul Crossing</strong> is also featured in this Deck. <strong>Soul Crossing</strong> is a Quick-Play Spell that during the Main Phase allows you to Tribute Summon 1 Divine-Beast monster by tributing monsters from both sides of the field, but you can only activate 1 effect for the rest of the turn if you used at least 1 monster from your opponent's field, unless that effect is from a Divine-Beast monster. Is a big board wipe that can stop a combo if played at the right time and it isn't stopped and gives you a large body on the field.  Another card that is also featured in the Slifer Deck but didn't used is <strong>Divine Evolution</strong>. This is a Normal Spell that, without targeting (due to Obelisk's effect) can choose either a Divine-Beast monster or a ""The Wicked"" monster that is not already under the effects of <strong>Divine Evolution</strong> and grant it the following effects: <ul>  	<li>+1000 ATK/DEF</li>  	<li>Its activated effects and effect activations can't be negated. (If you got confused by the text, it means that effects they have in the moment they are played and effects they have while face-up on the field can't be negated).</li>  	<li>When the selected monster attacks: You can make your opponent send 1 monster they control to the GY of their choice.</li> </ul> Another support card used here is <strong>Angel O1</strong>. Is a Level 1 LIGHT Fairy monster that can be Special Summoned from the hand by revealing a level 7 or higher monster in your hand. And while on the field, if it was Special Summoned, you can Tribute Summon 1 Level 7 or higher monster in addition to your Normal Summon/Set. Is a free monster that can be used as Tribute Fodder, Link Fodder, Synchro Material; there's no reason to not run it. 3 can be risky to fulfill its Summoning Condition, but 2 has worked well with me.  Lastly, we have Obelisk's signature attack: <strong>Fist of Fate</strong>. A Quick-Play Spell that can only be activated if you control the original <strong>Obelisk the Tormentor</strong> on the field. Without targeting, it lets you choose an Effect Monster your opponent controls and negates its effects to then destroy it and then, for the rest of the turn, cards with that name have their effects negated for the rest of the turn. In addition to all this, if this card was activated on the Main Phase (yours or your opponents), it can destroy all Spells/Traps your opponent controls. On one card that requires some setup, you have removal and full lockdown on the effects of 1 monster for the rest of the turn as well as being a Quick-Play <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster.</strong>  And that's all from the stuff of the Extra Deck. As for the outside support, I used the following: <ul>  	<li>Deskbot Engine: Since this Deck has no use for the Extra Deck, unlike the Slifer version that could use <strong>Egyptian God Slime</strong>, I added an Deskbot Engine to have a pair of negates as well as drawing at least 4 cards on the first turn. The Main Combo is explained here: https://youtu.be/MO5UdLHT-Qo . However, is possible to end with <strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong> instead of <strong>Naturia Beast</strong>. The choice is yours.</li>  	<li><strong>Mound of the Bound Creator</strong>: added 1 copy, you to give a little more protection to Obelisk.</li> </ul> And that's it for this version of the Triple Structure Deck Challenge for the Egyptian God Deck: Obelisk the Tormentor. Honestly, both this deck and the Slifer one is pretty fun to play with and while both have their pros and cons, I hope you enjoy testing them out and tweaking them to your liking.  While I did have the setback that make this deck unable to be posted earlier, I do have ready the next 2 entries for the series; those will be the 2 upcoming Structure Decks: Cyber Style (Cyber Dragons and Cyberdarks) and Lost Sanctuary (The Agent/Hyperion).  Until then, thanks for reading this wall of text."

Some research I did when building the deck and wanted to share.</strong>  Qliphort debuted on November of 2014 in The New Challengers, the second set of the Pendulum era, and saw quick competitive success thanks to the sheer power of their boss monster Towers and it's consistency tools. Their second wave of support came on January 2015 in Secrets of Eternity, giving them among other things Monolith for draw power and Skybase as a secondary boss monster. The November 2015 forbidden and limited list (TCG) saw the limitation of Scout and <a data-name=""Saqlifice"">Saqlifice</a> alongside the banning of Towers, knocking the deck out of the meta for good. The trap Qlife's End was released on November 2016 (TCG) in Invasion: Vengeance, as a way to turbo out Skybase. The release of Link monsters, which don't have a level/rank and therefore bypass the immunity of Qliphorts, meant that Towers could be unbanned in February of 2018 (TCG); that month Qlis also received on Extreme Force their own Link monster in Genius, a Link 2 that provides negation and generates advantage when making big Pendulum plays. Extreme Force would be, as of today, the last time that the deck, which also has all their cards unlimited now, received direct support, meaning that they are still stuck on a sea of Link meta decks and staples that force them to depend on floodgates to even have a chance at victory.  <strong>Debut and support over the years...</strong> <table>  <tr> <td><img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//2/22/NECH-BoosterEN.png"" alt=""2014"" width=""94"" height=""166"" /></td> <td><img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//3/38/SECE-BoosterEN.png"" alt="""" width=""94"" height=""166"" /></td> <td><img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/5/56/INOV-BoosterEN.png/257px-INOV-BoosterEN.png"" alt="""" width=""93"" height=""166"" /></td> <td><img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/0/0f/EXFO-BoosterEN.png/257px-EXFO-BoosterEN.png"" alt="""" width=""94"" height=""166"" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td>2014: 1 effect mons., 5 pendulums, 2 spells (1 field and 1 equip) and 2 traps</td> <td>2015: 1 effect mons., 3 pendulums and 1 trap</td> <td>2016: 1 trap (Trap monster)</td> <td>2018: 1 link</td> </tr>  </table> <strong>New to Qliphorts? What they do</strong> <ul>  	<li>All of their pendulum effect monsters have the ability to normal summon themselves without tribute, but in doing so their level becomes 4 and their ATK 1800, this also happens when they are special/pendulum summoned. They are also all unaffected by the activated effects of monsters with a lower level or rank than their own.</li>  	<li> However, you want to save your normal summon to properly tribute summon them so they get their original levels and therefore increase their immunity, they will also get their unique effects, some from being tributed using Qli monsters, others for being tributed. You can facilitate tribute summons by pendulum summoning or getting an extra normal summon via <a data-name=""Laser Qlip"">Laser Qlip</a>.</li>  	<li>Their boss monsters, the Apoqliphorts, can only be tribute summoned, and they need 3 Qlis as tributes. Their immunity goes beyond their high level, as they are also unaffected by spells and traps.</li> </ul> <strong>The strategy...</strong> <ul>  	<li>To stun: As if Qlis weren't weak enough to backrow hate... Modern iterations of the deck run counter traps and floodgates in the form of traps such as <a data-name=""Summon Limit"">Summon Limit</a> and sometimes even monsters as well like <a data-name=""Vanity's Ruler"">Vanity's Ruler</a> as it doesn't hurt it's playstyle too much and keeps their arch nemesis (Links) at bay.</li>  	<li>To beatdown (And stun at the same time): continuing with the trap line up, <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> and <a data-name=""Re-Qliate"">Re-Qliate</a> (Which can be searched by <a data-name=""Qliphort Scout"">Scout</a> so you only need to run one) are able to hurt the opponent and let Qlis go into the good ol' Skill Drain Beatdown mode, getting their original ATK values ready for combat. Another great and classic tool for beatdown this deck has access to is <a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a> which can close out games fast.</li>  	<li> Ol' reliable Towers: I know that <a data-name=""Apoqliphort Towers"">Towers</a> isn't as strong as it once was, but I'm the type of player that always wants to build up towards a certain board or boss, so the simple path of pay 800 LP with Scout to search out <a data-name=""Qlife's End"">Qlife's End</a>, pay 800 more next turn to get Towers (Or <a data-name=""Apoqliphort Skybase"">Skybase</a> if I sided it in in order to avoid my opponent building up their grave with Towers' effect) and summon said Towers with the Qlife's End I set last turn is a path I'm glad to take most of the time.</li> </ul> <strong>Some techs not every Qliphort list runs...</strong> <ul>  	<li>Limiter Removal: Those that take the more stun route tend to avoid this card but as I said earlier I like it for giving more ways to do beatdown.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Performapal Trampolynx"">Performapal Trampolynx</a>: Allows you to get 2 searches with Scout's soft once per turn effect, also it feels good to play this one because I avoid playing more copies of <a data-name=""Qliphort Monolith"">Monolith</a> and <a data-name=""Qliphort Stealth"">Stealth</a> just because they have a scale of 1, as Trampolynx has a scale of 4 which is still perfectly fine for Qlis.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Ballista Squad"">Ballista Squad</a>: Make your opponent extend and then punish them by combining this with <a data-name=""Qliphort Carrier"">Carrier</a> or <a data-name=""Qliphort Helix"">Helix</a> in order to make you go even in card advantage while interrupting them, as both of the Qlis I just mentioned don't have their effects restricted to being tributed for a tribute summon.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Machina Metalcruncher"">Machina Metalcruncher</a>: At the cost of your normal summon you can get your hands on Scout if really needed and a body that benefits from the same Skill Drain effects as the rest of your monster line up.</li> </ul> <strong>Final considerations...</strong>  Those techs aren't some magic hidden combo I came up with that nobody else found yet, you can take them out if you don't like them. Also, staples like Ash and Pot can easily go up to 3 if that makes you more comfortable. Lastly, the side and extra deck (With the exception of Genius) are up to the particular player, obviously you need a big extra deck to fuel <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a> or <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Extravagance</a> if you decide to run them, but you can play anything, some good generic rank 4s and Link2/3s will do, it doesn't matter that much cause you will be locked to only special summoning Qlis most of the time. Okay so hear me out, how about a 3000 ATK Link 2 that requires not 2 Qliphorts but 2 Apoqliphorts and is inmune to everything Links included to give Qlis a somewhat fair boss monster to build up to? No?! No? Okay then, bye and thanks for your time."

Tested with much of old meta deck e work great, for example won easy vs Dark Magician, Blue-Eyes, Blue-Eyes Ritual, won very easy vs no meta ex.. Dragunity, Mathmech.  Can fight and win vs ABC, Altergeist, fight much vs Dogmatika and can won but is hard vs Dragun of Red-Eyes pure deck.  Despia don't have much cards for now, but the 90% of despia cards are very good cards, this deck is hard to use because all the cards have 2 o 3 effect, don't is easy remember all effects, but is linear how to use, if u play the 1st times with a program, this will help you how to play and remember the effects.  A good power up for this deck is the fusion ""The first Darklord"", for example if u fusion this card with ""Dramaturgia of Despia"", ""Dark Honest"" and another card, u will have summoned also ""Dramaturgia of Despia"" for this effect, after effect of ""The first Darklord"" for summon ""Dark Honest"", effect of ""Dark Honest"" and this card came back in hand, and much other.. have much combo this deck.  This deck have much 8 stars cards, so, when u can summon for FTK attack ""Number 97: Draglubion"", effect and summon ""Number 100: Numerion Dragon"", effect and win, or summon ""Number 38.."" for protect from 1st magic opponenet effect ect..  Don't forget the very good fusion cards ""Masquarade, the Grimsongleam Dragon"" beause is -600 lp for every opponet card and auto reborn when u want and the fusion ""Despia Quaretis"" make opponent monsters to 0 ATK and add or special summon a card..  Vs much decks is the combo ""Fusion Deployment"" for summon ""Fallen of Albaz"" and fusion summon with 1 opponent monster and 2x of ""Super Polymerization"" for fusion summon with opponents monster (simila Dogmatika style).  My note is that very better to have 3x of ""Effect veiler"" and don't use 3x of ""Despian Comedy"" because the ""Effect Veiler"" work always, 2nd in light and u can fusion summon with it.  With this cards, some times you can fusion summon also ""Mudragon of the swamp"" for change the attribute of all the cards and continue summon or in dark if u have ""Dark Honest"" in hand.  3x of royal decree is very important vs decks how ""Dark Magician"", Altergheist etc.. and is also a good card for send in GY with the others effect.  The card ""Albion the shrouded Dragon"" is a very good card for +1 in hand or special summon if u need of 8 stars in field.  I hope you will like, for me is good deck this, yes need of fix.. for extra deck of sure, but tested much and i have used 1 time only the extra deck vs the 2nd game vs Dragun of Red-Eyes deck and i won (with fortune) 2-1, for the others games, never used the extra deck.."

Amen to that. Cards like Firewall Dragon, Crystron Halqifibrax, Borreload Savage dragon and Dragoon are destroying the game. Decks are supposed to be build on chemistry, not just putting some additional cards in the deck to make same, slightly worse combos than top tier decks.  With last thought i build my own version of more or less pure agent fairy deck. This deck performs better than i expected, you have your hand traps in heralds, sauravis(which you get off of herald of the arc light) and called by the grave. It is pretty consistent, even if the hand looks 'bricking awesome' you can end on celestial nightlord parsath and krystia :)  By any means you always try to trigger the effect of Venus.  This can be done:  -summon earth, search venus, activate neptune --&gt; summon venus , activate effect ---&gt; shine balls --&gt; moon --&gt; majesty hyperion to the grave --&gt; banish neptune to summon majesty hyperion --&gt; THIS IS HOW YOU GET SANCTUARY TO THE HAND.  -summon Master flare hyperion and sent venus to the grave --&gt; do what you can  NEVER use 'the sacred water in the sky' for activating sanctuary, always bring missing agent to the hand. for sanctuary search  you have neptune  Most of the time you end your turn (and im not kiddig) with: celestial knightlord parshath, kristya, herald of the arc light, majesty hyperion  Sometimes, this means if you have master hyperion in your openning hand or somehow manage to summon any other level 8 monster during your plays, before you summon kristya, you summon it and make number 38: hope..  --&gt; than they cant attack you herald of the arc light and you have 1 more negate.  And sometimes you will just end on something less, but i feel very good about this deck.  &nbsp;  ps. dont mind the side deck, i don't use one because i never play tournaments"

Actually let me start by saying this is NOT my current build! In fact, you can hardly call this a build of any kind. Now that that's out of the way, here why I'm uploading this now:</span> <ol>  	<li><span>This was one of my earliest deckbuilds and it was horrid. I wanted to spam out Water monsters as much as I could, wanting to end on Moulinglacia, Toadally Awesome and Bubble Reef all at the same time. This is more of an ode to my journey as a duelist, taking a trip down memory lane to one of the first decks I brought to locals. Fun fact I won against Striker with this abomination. To 95% it was because my opponent summoned their almost 9k ATK Nibiru in ATK position for me but a win's a win. That was the only match this deck has ever won. So here I am, wanting to share this with y'all.</span></li>  	<li><span>I'm hungry. Like, really hungry. I'm the last one still in the office, there's nothing to do and my shift doesn't end for another hour. So I'm trying make time pass by writing this guide (on how not to build a deck) and drown out the sound of my growling stomach by hitting the keyboard as hard as I can.</span></li> </ol> <span>Let's break this down step by step, shall we?</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The Main Deck:</span>  I'm glad I only played two Moulinglacia, that way I didn't draw that card as much as I could've, which is good since handlooping is the quickest way to lose a friend or two. I gotta say, my Marincess ratios weren't as bad as I thought. I no longer played Snow and while I'm still on the fence on 3 Pascalus, I at least played both Blue Tang and Sea Horse at three, proving I at least had the mental capacity of 15 year old. I don't know why I played only one Battle Ocean, not because it's wrong but because I don't think I knew it was right.  My secret tech, the spicy flavor I was so proud of was my singular Fishborg Launcher. I had 9 cards to discard the card, which I would then summon back from the GY by milling the top card. I had to mill a Water monser but that shouldn't have been a problem, right. Right? Wrong! I dunno why but all I remember is milling spells for days with this card.  Besides that I just played a few extenders which to be fair wouldn't be bad and at least I should've consistently ended on the Marincess Link bosses but you my friend are forgetting one thing. You play how you build. If your deckbuilding' crap chances are you play like it, too. So take it from the guy who thought Almiraj into Secure Gardna in a non-Invoked deck was a good alternative board to end on since he saw someone ending like that in a video once (non voluntarily of course), I sucked, hard.  &nbsp;  <span>The Extra Deck:</span>  I was surprised about this one. The ratio's aren't perfect and there's a lot I would change nowadays but for starter, that looks way better than what I was expecting. There's really not much else to say, it's a bad, yet functioning Extra Deck.  &nbsp;  <span>The Side Deck:</span>  What's frustrating me the most is that this deck could've been genuienly decent had I swapped half of my side deck for my main deck. Seven handtraps, backrow removal and two solemns would've been much better than Abyssteus into Abysspyke by going minus 2 (Unless of course I drew the Fishborg Launcher, in which case it was a minus 2 plus I got to mill a spell). Dogoran was the only Kaiju I had available and it wasn't for another year that I got myself my third and final Ash Blossom.  &nbsp;  <span>The teaching moment:</span>  So what's to take from this? Originally I was thinking something along the lines of not buying cards without proper playtesting but honestly, you can't expect people to get it from the start. Maybe all these tech cards were 20 euros down the drain but I tried my best and improved over time. Instead here's what I think I learned: Listen to others. Don't take everything at face value but I after my opponent stomped my 0-2 with Invoked Mekk-Knights he looked over my cards and told me to cut a bunch of stuff. Back then I thought he didn't know what he was talking about, after all, all these Water monsters would get my to Toad and Bubble Reef and Moulinglacia! But in retrospect, he was right. So instead of telling him that these cards served a purpose I could ask him why he was thinking I shouldn't play them. Again, it's okay to be of a different opinion but then be open, start a (healthy) discussion and genuinely listen. Maybe I would've realised the deck wasn't good this was, probably not but after playing this game for a longer time I really came around to appreciate the different takes people have on decks. Whether that's slapping Five-Headed Link Dragon into your Dragonmaid deck as a lot of decks struggle to out it, playing Flame Bufferlo instead of Lady Debug in Salamangreats (not that that's much of a controversy anymore) or playing Lyriluscs pure with a Nervall even thought people may consider it just bad Bird Up.  In the end, the diversity is what pushes new ideas forwards, inspires deckbuilding and promoted discussion. There's something awesome about people trying out things differently, trying to make a deck their own. These changes can be small and seem insignificant or change the deck's playing style altogether. Originally I thought about making a three part upload for three different Marincess decks. One focused on the r4nk engine, one about handtraps and one about traps but then I scraped the idea as I wasn't happy with how the decks turned out when build solely focused on a single aspect. However, the reason I wanted to do this was to show how different the same deck can be, how an archetype can be interpreted in so many different ways, suited to a person's own liking. So if there's anything to take away from this deck profile (please let it not be the deck) it's that I believe deckbuilding is non-linear and that we can all learn from each other.  Well, I'm off in three minutes and the rain has cleared and the hunger has persisted so I'll end it here and wish y'all the best."

You are equipped with santa claws' to have a very handy kaiju like effect and the combination of negates such as dark bribes and recalls alongside the battle faders should keep you alive to the point where appropriate can be activated. After using appropriate's effect once after activation the rest is cake. Players should note, not all draw cards can activate appropriate's effect like dark world dealing and upstart goblin, the most common method to activate it would be with the dark bribes and such as well as book of eclipse and most other draw cards in the deck. Once the engine is running, keep an eye out on your deck as you are just as likely to deck out if you do not destroy the appropriate with the MST or use pot of avarice to refill the deck. While you are making your opponent burn through cards, the shaddol engine should easily be able to floodgate monsters or focus attacks if you ever happen to be low on draw power. This deck can be slow at first, but appropriate is so powerful that just a couple uses of it and you will be unstoppable!"

I dare you.,"Good day everyone. For this version of the <strong>Triple Structure Deck Challenge</strong>, is the turn on the bat for the <strong>Cyber Style’s Successor Structure Deck</strong>, one of the upcoming structure decks. Due to some of the cards still not available (and recently having a product delay), there’s a small change some of the cards featured here won’t appear on the website. At the end of the typical wall of text I’ll place the decklist and card ratios.  With that said, the rules are the same as always: A 40-card Main Deck where 30+ cards must form part of the selected Structure Deck. The Extra Deck is free to edit. With that said, let’s begin.  <strong> </strong>  <strong>Archetype analysis</strong>  This Structure Deck is designed in order to feature both archetypes played in the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX anime by Zane Truesdale (also known as Hell Kaiser) by implementing a combination of the <strong>Cyber/Cyber Dragon </strong>archetype with the <strong>Cyberdark</strong> archetype.  <strong>Cyber/Cyber Dragons</strong>  The first archetype, <strong>Cyber/Cyber Dragons</strong>, consists of two main things: constant Special Summoning and searching of LIGHT/DARK Machine and Dragon monsters and pure damage output. Almost all of the archetype is added to the Structure Deck, however I’ll only list, with an asterisk, which new cards were played and why, as well as how many copies of it:  <strong>*Attachment Cybern</strong>: Part of the new support, is a Level 3 LIGHT Dragon monster that can equip itself to a Dragon or Machine “Cyber” monster and grant it 600 ATK while equipped. If it is sent to the GY while equipped to a monster, it can Special Summon any other Machine or Dragon “Cyber” monster from the GY. It can be equipped from the hand or targeted by the Cyberdark monsters when they are summoned, making them 3000 Attackers. You could try running more than 1, but for the sake of making a 40-card Deck, I played only one.  <strong>**Cybernetic Horizon</strong>: This Spell card is both a “Cyber” and “Cyberdark” Spell card, so it can be searched by Core or Claw. You can send 2 Dragon/Machine “Cyber” monsters with different attributes (they have a lot of attributes since it works with any “Cyber” monster that is a Dragon or Machine, but most of the time it will be a LIGHT and a DARK), 1 from the hand and 1 from the Deck; add 1 Dragon/Machine “Cyber” monster from your Deck to the hand, if you do, send 1 Machine “Cyber” Fusion monster from the Extra Deck to the GY. Also, you’re locked to only Machine monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn. The Extra Deck mill effect is in order to turbo one of the materials for the Fusion Summon of their new boss monster, or just send a target for <strong>Cyberdarkness Dragon</strong> to pick-up and then be tributed for the new boss monster. Did I mention is also a search card and GY setup for both archetypes? Run 2 or 3.  <strong>*Eternal Cyber</strong>: Is a Quick-Play Spell card that targets 1 Machine “Cyber” Fusion monster in the GY and either Special Summons it or returns it to the Extra Deck. It can also banish itself from the GY to protect a Machine “Cyber” Fusion monster to be destroyed once. Is overall good protection and reviving, only limited by their conditions to be activated.  <strong>Cyberdark</strong>  Now let’s talk of the second archetype, <strong>Cyberdark</strong>, which received a bit more love with the new support. Cyberdark consists of DARK Level 3 Dragons and Level 4 Machine monsters. The Level 3 Dragon monsters, <strong>Cyberdark Cannon</strong> and <strong>Cyberdark Claw</strong> both have three effects: one by discarding it, another while being equipped to a monster and a third one when they are sent to the GY while equipped to a monster.  <strong>Cyberdark Cannon:</strong>  Discard: Add 1 Machine “Cyberdark” monster from the Deck to the hand.  As an equip: During damage calculation, if the equipped monster battles: send 1 monster from the Deck to the GY.  Sent to the GY as an equip: Draw 1 card.  <strong>Cyberdark Claw:</strong>  Discard: Add 1 “Cyberdark” Spell/Trap from the Deck to the hand.  As an equip: During damage calculation, if the equipped monster battles: send 1 monster from the Extra Deck to the GY.  Sent to the GY as an equip: Target a “Cyberdark” monster in your GY and add it to your hand.  The Level 4 Machines, <strong>Cyberdark Horn</strong>, <strong>Cyberdark Keel</strong> and <strong>Cyberdark Edge</strong> share the same 2 effects: if they are Normal Summoned, they can target 1 Level 3 or lower Dragon monster in your GY and equip it to gain ATK equal to its original ATK. Also, they can destroy the equipped monster instead of themselves. Each one of the have a unique effect: Horn deals piercing damage, Keel burns for 300 damage if it destroys a monster in battle and Edge can attack directly, but any damage dealt by the attack is halved.  They had only two Spell cards: <strong>Cyberdark Impact!,</strong> a Spell card that allows the Fusion of <strong>Cyberdark Dragon</strong>, one of their Fusion monsters, by shuffling Horn, Keel &amp; Edge from the hand, field and/or GY into the Deck. Their other Spell card, and is honestly kinda good, is <strong>Cyberdark Inferno</strong>. Is a Field Spell that makes your opponent unable to target or destroy with effects “Cyberdark” monsters you control that have a monster equipped. You can target 1 “Cyberdark” monster on the field and return it to the hand to immediately Normal Summon 1 “Cyberdark” monster. At last, if it is destroyed by the opponent: you can add 1 “<strong>Polymerization</strong>” or 1 “Fusion” Spell card from the Deck to the hand.  They have 2 Fusion monsters: <strong>Cyberdark Dragon</strong>, that uses the Horn, Edge &amp; Keel as materials. If it is Special Summoned, it can equip 1 Dragon monster from your GY to it and it gains ATK equal to its original ATK. It also gains 100 ATK for each monster in your GY and if it were destoyed by battle, it can destoy the equipped monster instead. The bigger one is <strong>Cyberdarkness Dragon</strong>, that requires any 5 “Cyberdark” monsters. If it is Special Summon, it can equip 1 Dragon or Machine monster to the GY on it and it gains ATK equal to its original ATK. When your opponent activates a card or effect, as a Quick Effect, it can send 1 card equipped to it to negate the activation and destroy that card.  As for the new support, we have:  <strong>***Cyberdark Chimera: </strong>Is a Level 4 Machine with 800 ATK/2100 DEF (this will be important later). It has 3 effects: You can discard 1 Spell/Trap; add 1 “<strong>Power Bond</strong>” from your Deck to your hand but you’re locked into Dragon or Machine “Cyber” monsters for the rest of the turn. If you activated the first effect this turn, the next Fusion Summon you do can also use materials from the GY by banishing the materials. If it is sent to the GY, by any means, send 1 “Cyberdark” monster from the Deck to the GY with a different name of the current “Cyberdark” monsters there. Since is a Level 4 Machine, it can be searched by Cannon; its 2100 DEF can make it summonable by <strong>Cyber Dragon Nachster</strong>, in which Nachster can easily trigger both effects; and can search “<strong>Power Bond</strong>” and temporally make it a “<strong>Overload Fusion</strong>”, while preparing the GY for said Fusion Summon. Running 3 is pretty good.  <strong>**Cyberdark World: </strong>Is a Continuous Spell card that adds 1 “Cyberdark” monster from the Deck to the hand when activated, but with different name with the “Cyberdark” monsters in the GY. It also gives “Cyberdark” monsters an additional Normal Summon and they can equip monsters from the opponent’s GY if they are appropriate for the effect. It’s honestly good for pure-ish Cyberdarks, but in this case it can help to search Cannon and use Cannon’s effect to search Chimera.  <strong>**Cyberdark Invasion: </strong>Is a Continuous Trap card that can activate 1 of 2 effects: you can target 1 “Cyberdark” monster you control and equip it 1 Dragon or Machine monster from either GY that gives 1000 ATK to it; OR you can send 1 Equip Card you control equipped to a Machine monster to the GY and destroy 1 card your opponent controls, without targeting. Is pretty good in a pure Cyberdark build and it has it uses when combined with <strong>Attachment Cybern</strong> (1600 ATK boost), Cannon or Claw for milling, <strong>Leng Ling</strong> for double attacking or just stealing a monster from your opponent’s GY.  <strong>**Cyberdark End Dragon: </strong>But is now time to talk about the big boss, the great kahuna, their newest boss monster <strong>Cyberdark End Dragon</strong>. Is a massive Level 12 DARK Machine Fusion monster with 5000 ATK/3800 DEF that can be summoned by 2 ways: Fuse <strong>Cyberdark Dragon</strong> and <strong>Cyber End Dragon</strong> OR Tribute 1 Level 10 or lower “Cyberdark” Fusion monster that is equipped with “<strong>Cyber End Dragon</strong>”. It’s unaffected by your opponent activated effects. It can equip 1 monster from either GY to itself; and if he is equipped with an Equip Card, it can declare attacks equal to the number of Equip Cards equipped in it. Is large, surprisingly easy to summon with some combos and unless your opponent summons something as big or more, he might not be able to remove it off the field, maybe a Kaiju though.  <strong> </strong>  <strong>Extra Deck &amp; Side Deck</strong>  In the Extra Deck, not only it features the monsters listed here, I mostly filled it with more Cyber Dragon related monsters to play, those being: <strong>Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</strong>, <strong>Cyber Twin Dragon</strong>, <strong>Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</strong>, <strong>Cyber Dragon Nova</strong>, <strong>Cyber Dragon Infinity</strong> &amp; <strong>Cyber Dragon Sieger</strong>. I also added one <strong>Predaplant Verte Anaconda</strong> to activate either <strong>Overload Fusion</strong> or <strong>Cyberload Fusion</strong> from the deck.  In the Side Deck, I added cards that will definitely be the reason people will actually by this deck, if the recipe remains the same once it goes overseas. Those being <strong>Lightning Storm, Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju </strong>and<strong> Infinite Impermanence</strong>.  <strong> </strong>  <strong>Tips</strong>  And here go some tips to boost this deck:  <strong>Dogmatika package</strong>: 3 copies of <strong>Nadir Servant</strong> and <strong>Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</strong> and 1 copy of <strong>Dogmatika Maximus</strong> can help in thinning your Extra Deck and setting up the materials for <strong>Overload Fusion</strong> or a Chimera-boosted Fusion Summon with <strong>Power Bond</strong>; although you must wait a few turns due to Dogmatika’s restrictions.  <strong>Chaos monsters</strong>: <strong>Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning</strong>, <strong>Chaos Valkyria</strong> and <strong>The Chaos Creator</strong> are good monsters to play with since this deck runs mostly LIGHT and DARK monsters and banishing them can be improve the usage of <strong>Cyberload Fusion</strong>.  And that should be it. The Main Deck for this version of the challenge is 100% cards from the Structure Deck, while the only extra additions where on the Extra and Side Deck. It is strong and pretty consistent whether you play pure Cyber Dragons, pure Cyberdarks (it’s finally possible thanks to this support) or mixing both; so if you want to start playing Yu-Gi-Oh! with a rather strong Deck, I recommend trying this one.  The next recipe, uploaded later today or tomorrow (this time I will deliver, deck is on final stages of testing and script is almost ready), will be about the Lost Sanctuary Structure Deck, which was just fully announced a few days ago. As always, thanks for reading this wall of text.  &nbsp;  <strong>Decklist</strong>  <strong>Monsters (22):</strong>  3x Cyber Dragon  3x Cyberdark Chimera  1x Cyberdark Keel  1x Cyberdark Horn  1x Cyberdark Edge  2x Cyberdark Cannon  1x Attachment Cybern  3x Cyberdark Cannon  3x Cyber Dragon Core  3x Cyber Dragon Nachster  1x Cyber Dragon Herz  &nbsp;  <strong>Spells (16):</strong>  2x Overload Fusion  2x Power Bond  3x Cyber Emergency  3x Cybernetic Horizon  1x Cyberdark Impact!  1x Eternal Cyber  1x Cyberload Fusion  2x Cyberdark World  1x Cyberdark Inferno  &nbsp;  <strong>Traps (2):</strong>  2x Cyberdark Invasion  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck (15):</strong>  2x Cyberdark End Dragon  2x Cyber End Dragon  1x Cyberdarkness Dragon  1x Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon  1x Chimeratech Overdragon  1x Cyber Twin Dragon  2x Cyberdark Dragon  1x Chimeratech Rampage Dragon  1x Cyber Dragon Nova  1x Cyber Dragon Infinity  1x Cyber Dragon Sieger  1x Predaplant Verte Anaconda  &nbsp;  <strong>Side Deck (15):</strong>  2x Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju  1x Leng Ling  1x Cyber Eternity Dragon  3x Lightning Storm  2x Limiter Removal  3x Infinite Impermanence  2x Cybernetic Overflow  1x Cyber Network"

This decklist is pretty much the deck that I'm using and find success with at the time.  Ok let's start with the basic combo:  Hand: Alpha, Zeta and Delta.  Combo:  SS Alpha tributing Zeta.  Add Benten through Alpha's eff.  Tribute Benten to summon Zeta.  Zeta eff to add Meteonis Drytron.  Benten eff to add Manju (cause he is a fairy for some reason).  NS Manju and use eff to add Phul.  XYZ both Alpha and Zeta to XYZS Mu-Beta and use eff to send Gamma from deck to GY.  Use Meteonis Dryton to RS Phul, removing 1 meterial from Mu-Beta in the proccess.  Phul eff to get Benten from GY, to make Phul's LVL to go to 6.  Use Phul's eff to tribute Benten to RS from deck Ophiel.  Eff Benten (cause she was tributed) to add Idaten from deck.  Eff Ophiel to add either Bethor or Och from deck (depends on the rest of your hand).  Eff Ophiel to RS Idaten, tributing Ophiel and Manju.  Eff Idaten to add Meteonis Drytron from GY.  XYZ the LVL 6 Phul and the Idaten to XYZS Ptolemy (trust me here).  Detach a meterial to activate eff of Ptolemy to add Benten from GY (detach Idaten here).  Eff Gamma tribute Benten to summon.  Eff Gamma to SS a Drytron from GY.  Eff Benten to add Herald of Ultimateness.  Activate Meteonis Drytron to remove the 2nd meterial form Mu-Beta to RS Idaten.  You get back Meteonis Drytron from Idaten eff.  XYZS a random rank 1 monster (I'm using Lyrilusc-Recital Starling cause I'm broke).  Activate Meteonis Drytron to RS Benten from GY using Delta from hand as meterial.  Activate Benten to add Eva from deck.  Activate Delta to draw a card (reaviling a ritual monster).  Eff Meteonis Drytron from GY to reduce Mu-Beta's attack to add back the Meteonis Drytron from GY.  XYZS Utopic Future using the random RANK1 and Mu-Beta.  Activate Meteonis Drytron to RS Herald of Ultimateness.  And that's the basic combo of this deck. Next turn you can just loop Idaten to make Herald have 6K attack and RS Bethor to boardwipe your opponent's field. And the way to do this is :  Tribute Idaten from field (or Bethor from hand) to SS Gamma (if he is a meterial of Utopic Future just LS a link2) and this triggers Idaten's 2nd eff to boost all rituals by 1K  Then reduce a Drytron's attack by 1K to add Meteonis Drytron.  Then loop the Idaten another 3 times.  And in the end just RS Bethor to boardwipe.  You have enough DMG to win at this point.  That's the only combo that isn't played in a normal Drytron and it's pretty fun."

Rules of the challenge are the same as always: The Main Deck must be a 40-card Deck that uses at least 30+ cards that belong to the Structure Deck card list, with free control over the design of the Extra Deck.  &nbsp;  <strong>Archetype analysis</strong>  Despite technically covering two archetypes in this Structure Deck, similarly to the Cyber Style Deck, the main focus of the deck is around the “<strong>The Agent</strong>” archetype.  “<strong>The Agent</strong>” archetype consists of LIGHT and DARK Fairy monsters that most of them have either an additional effect or one of their effects is “boosted” when “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” is face-up on the field.  Before talking about Agents, let’s quickly talk about the Sanctuary. <strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong> is a rather old Field Spell card which only effect is to reduce to 0 any battle damage taken to the controller of a Fairy monster. In other words, if either you control a Fairy monster and it battles, you take no damage from that battle. Same goes for your opponent since this card benefits both. Many cards were released over the passage of time that revolved around playing it, for example having an omni-negate that only worked while that card was face-up (<strong>Divine Punishment</strong>) and a specific searcher (<strong>Zeradias, Herald of Heaven</strong>). Eventually, and including its new support, more cards where added that would treat themselves as “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” while face-up and brought additional and more useful effects; but it has proven to is still useful to run it at 3 alongside the alternatives.  Now we move to talk about the Agents. Since one of their themes is to represent the solar system, I’ll describe both current and new Agent monsters in order of the planets; but I’ll start with the Sun due to obvious reasons:  <strong>**Master Hyperion</strong> (The Sun): Before the new support from this Deck, <strong>Master Hyperion</strong> was the boss monster for the “The Agent” archetype, and a very memorable one if you happened to play some of the Yu-Gi-Oh! videogames and dueled against Kotori Mizuki/Tori Meadows. Is a Level 8 LIGHT Fairy with 2700 ATK/ 2100 DEF that can also be Special Summoned from the hand by banishing 1 “<strong>The Agent</strong>” monster in the hand, field or GY. It can banish 1 Fairy monster in your GY to target and destroy 1 card on the field. If “Sanctuary” is on the field, this effect can be used twice. Very handy removal, easy Special Summon, is a large body, multiple copies can be summoned and its effect is a soft once-per-turn, so it can be reused if your GY can pay the cost. A very good card in my opinion.  <strong>*Majesty Hyperion (new support):</strong> This is one of the new monsters added that, in my opinion due to its artwork, I think it represents a Solar Eclipse, idk. Is quite literally a counterpart to <strong>Master Hyperion</strong>, being DARK instead of LIGHT, its stats are flipped (2100 ATK/ 2700 DEF) and his effect being banishing 1 card from either player’s GY instead of destroying 1 card on the field. However, they share the condition that if “Sanctuary” is up, this effect can be used twice per turn. His unique thing is that in comparison to <strong>Master Hyperion</strong>, this one can also be Special Summoned from the GY with the same condition and his banish effect also works when “Sanctuary” is in the GY. That’s why I only run 1, since it can keep bringing himself back a lot of times.  <strong>The Agent of Wisdom – Mercury</strong>: Is a Level 4 LIGHT Fairy that during your Standby Phase, if you controlled this face-up card and had no cards in your hand at the end of the opponent’s last End Phase: Draw 1 card. Do I need to elaborate why this card is very slow to play and it isn’t played at all? Moving on.  <strong>***The Agent of Creation – Venus</strong>: This one is a card that had a lot of history in the game. Is a Level 3 LIGHT Fairy that, not once per turn, you can pay 500 LP to Special Summon 1 “<strong>Mystical Shine Ball</strong>” (a Level 2 LIGHT Fairy Normal monster with 500 ATK/DEF) from your hand or Deck. She and Mercury are the only card in this archetype that doesn’t have an interaction with “Sanctuary”, however that never stopped Venus from being played due to her good effect. While at first her effect looks underwhelming back in the day even through the monsters could be used as Ritual or Tribute Fodder, it was during the Synchro and Xyz era that Venus started to show its true potential, especially if paired with <strong>Archlord Kristya</strong>. During the Link era, however, this effect is really strong; as getting literally free link materials for just 500 LP is something some meta decks would die for, and this Deck has good targets for it. Definitely run her.  <strong>***The Agent of Mystery – Earth</strong>: Is a Level 2 LIGHT Fairy Tuner monster that when Normal Summoned, you can add 1 “The Agent” monster from the Deck to the hand. If “Sanctuary” is live, you can add 1 “<strong>Master Hyperion</strong>” instead. You run 3 of him due to being your main searcher and has a good level for a Tuner, even though he isn’t the main Tuner of the Deck. Also, the new support can directly search it.  <strong>**Guard of the Agents – Moon (new support)</strong>: This is the new support I just talked about. Is a Link-2 LIGHT Fairy with 1800 ATK, requires 2 Fairy monsters and points right and bottom-right. If it is Link Summoned, you can send 1 “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” or 1 card that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” in its text from the Deck to the GY. If “Sanctuary” is up, you can add 1 “<strong>The Agent of Mystery - Earth</strong>” from the Deck or GY to the hand instead. Also, you can Tribute 1 Fairy monster to target and destroy 1 card your opponent controls. Is a pretty good monster, it can be turbo-ed with a single Venus, offers a bit of removal and its generic. Run it.  <strong>*The Agent of Force – Mars</strong>: This one is funny. Is a Level 3 LIGHT Fairy with 0 ATK/DEF. If “Sanctuary” is up, and your LP is higher than your opponents, it gains ATK/DEF equal to the LP difference. This one has some OTK decks built around it, but the main reason its run at 1 is because the new boss monster can copy his effects.  <strong>**The Agent of Miracles – Jupiter</strong>: He has 2 soft once-per-turn effects. His normal effect allows him to banish 1 “The Agent” monster in the GY to target 1 face-up LIGHT Fairy monster you control and give it an 800 ATK boost. If “Sanctuary” is up, you can discard 1 Fairy monster to select one of your banished LIGHT Fairy monsters and Special Summon it. It has a pretty good recovery effect, giving that this archetype loves to banish their monsters and the ATK boost can sometimes help to run over some big targets; and as the same case with Mars, his effects can be copied to build more field presence.  <strong>The Agent of Judgement – Saturn:</strong> Is a Level 6 LIGHT Fairy monster which effect only works if “Sanctuary” is live. If your LP are higher than your opponents, you can tribute it to inflict damage equal to the difference; but you cannot conduct your Battle Phase that turn to activate it. While kind of unreliable, the new boss monster can copy its effect and maybe do that last bit of damage to end the duel, but the fact that it stops your Battle Phase means you have to use it in a turn you didn’t attacked. Not the “Cowboy for game” you expected.  <strong>**The Agent of Entropy – Uranus:</strong> This is actually the main Tuner of the Deck. Is a Level 5 DARK Fairy that can Special Summon itself from the hand is “Sanctuary” is up. Once per turn, it can send 1 “The Agent” monster from the Deck to the GY to copy its level. Is a free level-changing Tuner monster if “Sanctuary” is up and can setup the GY for more plays, while preparing itself for Synchro plays. Running 2 is fine since you could brick if you don’t open with “Sanctuary”.  <strong>***The Agent of Life – Neptune (new support):</strong> This is new support, meaning it has some good and kinda bloated effects to benefit the archetype it belongs. Is a Level 1 LIGHT Fairy with 0 ATK/600 DEF. You can discard it to Special Summon 1 “The Agent” monster from the hand or GY, OR 1 “Hyperion” monster if “Sanctuary” is up or in the GY and that monster can’t be tributed until the end of the opponent’s next turn. If it is banished, by any means, you can add 1 “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” from the Deck to the hand. Its effect can cheat out your monsters, it searches your homeland while doing regular plays with Agents and it can be searched by Cupid Pitch’s GY effect, as well as many cards added to this Deck. Running 3 is very optimal.  <strong>**The Executor of Hades – Pluto (new support)</strong>: Another new monster, this being a generic Level 5 DARK Fairy Synchro Tuner monster with 2300 ATK/0 DEF. It can banish 1 monster (anyone) from your GY to target 1 Effect monster on the field and flip it to face-down Defense Position. If “Sanctuary” is on the field or GY, this becomes a Quick Effect. Also, you can banish this card from the GY to add 1 “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” from the Deck or GY to the hand. Offers good disruption, and since it is a Synchro Tuner monster, it can be summoned during your opponent’s turn with <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax’s</strong> effect. It’s recommended to run it.  <strong>**Master Flare Hyperion (new support)</strong>: This is the new boss monster for the “The Agent” archetype, being a Level 10 LIGHT Fairy with 3200 ATK/2600 DEF that requires 1 Tuner and 1+ non-Tuner Fairy monsters. It can send 1 “The Agent” monster or one monster that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” in its name from your hand, Deck or Extra Deck to the GY to copy its name and effects for the rest of the turn. When your opponent activates a card or effect, as a Quick Effect, you can banish 1 Fairy monster from your field or GY to target 1 card on the field and banish it. It can copy very good effects since it also target monsters related to “Sanctuary” (<strong>Archlord Zerato</strong> and <strong>Neo-Parshath, the Sky Paladin</strong> are their best targets outside of Agents) and offers pretty good disruption, setup and presence when copying the right effects. A very fitting boss monster for this archetype.  Now, let’s talk about the new backrow:  <strong>***The Sacred Water of the Sky (new support):</strong> Is a Spell card that allows you to either activate 1 “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” directly from the Deck OR add 1 monster that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” in its text. If “Sanctuary” was up, you can also gain 500 LP for each “Hyperion” and “The Agent” monster you control. If a monster that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” in its text would be destroyed by battle, you can banish this card from the GY instead. Is a searcher for most of your archetype and your homeland, as well as healing your LP and protecting your monsters from battle destruction. Run 3 to boost consistency.  <strong>**Chorus in the Sky</strong>: This is a Spell Card that by paying 1000 LP you can target 1 Fairy monster in your GY and add it to the hand. If “Sanctuary” is live, you can also add 1 of your banished monsters that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” or 1 “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” that is banished. It offers a bit of recycling for the deck, due to the massive self-banishing it does. You can run 1 if you want, but 2 is also fine.  <strong>***Lost Sanctuary:</strong> Is a Continuous Trap card that when activated, you can set 1 Spell/Trap from the Deck that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” on its text; also, it is treated as “Sanctuary” while face-up on the field or in the GY. Lastly, you can banish 1 Fairy monster to target 1 Effect Monster your opponent controls and negate its effects for the rest of the turn. While a bit slow due to being a Trap, this is also a 3-of since is basically a backrow searcher and provides effect negation. And if you want to protect it somehow, <strong>The Sanctum of Parshath</strong> makes all Set Spells/Traps on the field undestructible and untargetable.  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck &amp; Side Deck</strong>  Besides the new Synchro monsters and Link monster, I added some cards that supports the Deck:  <strong>Synchro monsters</strong>: <strong>Angel of Zera</strong> is a Level 8 Synchro that can Special Summon itself during the Standby Phase if it was banished the turn before and it gains 100 ATK for each banished card of your opponents. I added for having a rather good beater that can be used as effect fodder without worries. <strong>Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</strong> is another Level 8 Synchro that on Synchro Summon excavates the top 5 cards of the Deck and add 1 excavated LIGHT or DARK monster, and the rest of the cards are milled. Also, it can bring itself back from the GY by banishing 1 LIGHT and 1 DARK monster from the hand or GY. Is a really good searcher, that also offers a large body and GY setup. <strong>Cupid Pitch</strong> is a Level 4 Synchro Tuner that when Synchro Summoned can increase or reduce its Level equal to the Level of the Tuner used for its Summon. Gains 400 ATK times its level. If it is used for a Synchro Summoned, it inflicts 100 damage times the Level of the summoned Synchro, and if you did, you can add 1 Level 8 or lower monster with 600 DEF from the Deck to your hand, which its only target in this deck is “Neptune”. Is kind of useful and it can also be brought with Halqifibrax’s effect.  <strong>Xyz Monsters:</strong> <strong>Sky Cavalry Centaurea</strong> is brought using the <strong>Mystical Shine Balls</strong> or “Earth”, and it’s mainly used to bring <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS – Sky Thunder</strong> and wipe the board. Since this deck runs a fair share of Level 8’s, I also added <strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong> for Spell negation and battle protection.  <strong>Link monsters:</strong> The Structure Deck also adds <strong>Celestial Knightlord Parshath</strong> to search 1 “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” or 1 card that lists “<strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>” from the Deck to the hand. Also, if another Fairy monster you control is sent to the GY, you can banish 1 Fairy monster from the GY to Special Summon another Fairy monster from the hand which Level is higher that the banished monster. <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax</strong> is added only to cheat out “Pluto” or <strong>Cupid Pitch</strong>.  As for the Side Deck, I mostly put cards that could aid the Deck: <strong>Archlord Zerato</strong> and <strong>Neo-Parshath, the Sky Paladin</strong> to give better targets to <strong>Master Flare Hyperion</strong>; <strong>Athena</strong>, <strong>Hecatrice</strong> and <strong>Vallhalla, Hall of the Fallen</strong> to Special Summon Fairy monsters; a set of Counter Trap cards to be recycled with <strong>The Sanctum of Parshath</strong> and <strong>Gren Maju Da Eiza</strong> to dealing the killing blow if the duels goes into late game.  &nbsp;  And that would be it for this decklist. For the next two entries, I decided to select one of the older Structure Decks and one of the more recent ones. And by doing so, the next entries for the Triple Structure Deck Challenge will be 2002’s <strong>Starter Deck: Kaiba</strong> and the <strong>Overlay Universe Structure Deck</strong>, which revolves around <strong>Number 39: Utopia</strong>. Until then, thanks for reading this wall of text; and I’ll leave the decklist down below if it doesn’t appear on the website.  &nbsp;  <strong>Main Deck:</strong>  <strong>Monsters (23):</strong>  3x Mystical Shine Ball  1x Archlord Kristya  2x Master Hyperion  1x Majesty Hyperion  2x The Agent of Entropy – Uranus  2x Zeradias, Herald of Heaven  2x The Agent of Miracles – Jupiter  3x The Agent of Creation – Venus  1x The Agent of Force – Mars  3x The Agent of Mystery – Earth  3x The Agent of Life – Neptune  &nbsp;  <strong>Spells (13):</strong>  1x Raigeki  1x Harpie’s Feather Duster  3x The Sacred Water of the Sky  1x Reasoning  2x Chorus in the Sky  2x The Sanctum of Parshath  3x The Sanctuary in the Sky  &nbsp;  <strong>Traps (4):</strong>  3x Lost Sanctuary  1x Divine Punishment  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck (15):</strong>  2x Master Flare Hyperion  1x Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon  1x Angel of Zera  2x The Executor of Hades – Pluto  1x Cupid Pitch  1x Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS – Sky Thunder  1x Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy  1x Sky Cavalry Centaurea  2x Celestial Knightlord Parshath  2x Guard of the Agents – Moon  1x Crystron Halqifibrax  &nbsp;  <strong>Side Deck (15):</strong>  1x Archlord Zerato  1x Athena  1x Neo-Parshath, the Sky Paladin  3x Hecatrice  1x Gren Maju Da Eiza  3x Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen  2x Solemn Judgment  2x Rebirth of Parshath  1x Divine Punishment"

Win rate is probably about 30% just owing to whether you get the few necessary cards to win.  &nbsp;  This deck has virtually no counter play capabilities in favor of trying to max out the chance of doing the FTK, so if the opponent goes first and manages to throw a couple of monsters out, you're probably already done for. You can try throwing in some lightning storms if you want to counteract this; just be careful not to brick yourself with too many counters.  &nbsp;  The side deck is just full of random cards that didn't make the cut in my mind, though tri-wight has high potential, just doesn't come out consistently.  &nbsp;  For those unaware, the FTK is to send a bunch of spell cards to the graveyard. Use Shien's Spy to give your opponent True Exodia. Then use Treasure Panda to bring out the 4 pieces of exodia in the deck and a link-2 monster. Use Treasue Panda and the Link-2 to make Knightmare Unicorn, then use it's effect on itself. And with that, you win via the effect of True Exodia. Sounds simple, but is really just pure RNG."
