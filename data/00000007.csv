Moving into the 2020 Format you'll need to edit the overall game plan and expect a big of a more awkward start. You need to rely on the trap cards a bit more in order to defend yourself during your opponent's turn. With Lady Debug at 3 the main deck's consistency is even stronger than before, its kind of crazy; you now have 8 copies of gazelle! Despite losing Stallio this deck still is incredibly powerful and really consistent. If konami wanted to kill this deck they should've followed Thanos's advice and go for the head (Gazelle)"

Time Thieves are an archetype debuting in Soul Fusion, boasting cool L4 monsters and an interesting Xyz to swing around. Sadly, at the time it was more of a splash engine that couldn't really function without outside support. With the arrival of Ignition Assault, however, a new slew of clock cleaners popped up and brought plenty more to mess up people's decks with card swiping and bouncebacks.  It's more of a slow-paced archetype, I feel, but that doesn't mean it's without its strong points. With the addition of cards from both Phantom Knights and Danger!, it's a force to be reckoned with. So without further ado, the deck of many turned heads awaits. <h2>New Monsters</h2> One of the best cards to have Turn 1 with this deck is <a data-name=""Time Thief Regulator"">Time Thief Regulator</a>. When this cute robo-pooch is the only monster on your field, Tributing it lands you two free Time Thief monsters with different names from the deck. It's extra well-boding if you get Startup in the same hand, since you can Special Summon it and save your Normal Summon for another good Xyz material monster.  A prime target for the bow-wow's benefit comes in the form of <a data-name=""Time Thief Winder"">Time Thief Winder</a>. Normal or Special Summoning the handsome blighter grants a Candina-esque effect that searches any Time Thief card from the main deck, whether it's a monster or backrow. Its effect from the hand is just as good, as you can bring it out just by detaching a material from an Xyz monster you control. Overall, a great card to have at three and try and revive whenever possible.  <a data-name=""Time Thief Bezel Ship"">Time Thief Bezel Ship</a> makes headlines with its ability to revive itself from the grave by detaching a material from an Xyz monster you control, much like Winder. Do bear in mind that if you simply have it sent to the grave by itself through Links or other methods, however, it'll be banished and unable to use. So it's best to use it as future Xyz material afterwards, so you can continue to recycle it as you please. That's not to say its Quick Effect isn't also useful, since it Tributes itself to attach a card from your opponent's graveyard to a Time Thief Xyz you control. This effect is similar to another card we'll get to later, so do keep a lookout.  Last but not least as far as the main deck Thieves is <a data-name=""Time Thief Chronocorder"">Time Thief Chronocorder</a>. First glance might have you tilt your head and wonder why this is worth play, but looking into it, you'll find that it can revive itself should your Time Thief Xyz leave the field by a card effect, including its own, and also Tribute itself to have your opponent take battle damage they would've inflicted to you the Battle Phase you sent it away. It's another card that's banished if revived from the GY this way, so Tribute it in dire situations like when a super powerful tool would whittle you down by a large margin, otherwise use it for future Xyz material much like Bezel Ship.  &nbsp;  <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a> acts as a free summon should you control another Phantom Knights monster. Upon banishing it from the grave, you can add a Phantom Knights backrow card from your deck to your hand, like Shade, Fog, or Rank-Up. It and another new monster acts as prime material for a very certain Xyz that comes in surprising handy, so keep on the lookout for it.  That very monster is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a>. Its power up effect is more of a bonus, but what really sells it is the ability to let Silent Boots summon itself for free and banishing it from the grave pretty much acts as a Candina, letting you search for any The Phantom Knights card in your deck, not just a backrow. Note the ""The"" part in it, as Fog Blade can't be searched this way unlike Silent Boots.  <a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a> replaces Foolish Burial from the previous build, as the mere summon lets you send a DARK monster from your deck to the grave. This will allow you to get to the beneficial effects of Ancient Cloak or Time Thief Bezel Ship much easier, not to mention it's a Level 4 monster, making it an applicable Xyz material for  <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>, Perpetua, or any of your other go-to Xyz monsters.  The Danger! monsters of the deck act as a way to both gain quick, easy material for Xyz and Links, as well as to generate card advantage. This is in part by the fact that these cards can summon themselves and draw a card right afterward, and this effect isn't once-per-turn for any of the monsters listed.  The first of which would be <a data-name=""Danger! Mothman!"">Danger! Mothman!</a>. Being one of the two L4's of these particular kinds of monsters, its discard effect allows you to draw one and then discard one, which can let you get off the GY effects of monsters like Bezel Ship and Silent Boots should they be in your hand. Don't get discouraged too much if it gets discarded when you try to summon it, however. Because if you have this next monster in your hand, you won't have to worry too much.  <a data-name=""Danger! Chupacabra!"">Danger! Chupacabra!</a> is another L4 who discards to revive a Danger! from the grave, other than itself. This way you can bring back Mothman! for further Xyz summons or any of the others for Links as well.  Another great monster of this kind if your wallet can take it is <a data-name=""Danger!? Jackalope?"">Danger!? Jackalope?</a>. Its discard effect allows you to Special Summon a Danger! right from the deck. It also makes for a fine R3 material considering if you have Phantom Knights both on the field and in the grave.  And that brings us to the one Limited monster of this variety, <a data-name=""Danger! Nessie!"">Danger! Nessie!</a>. Its discard warrants a search for any Danger! monster from your deck. In the case of this monster and Jackalope?, you'll want to discard those as soon as possible, favorably with Mothman! or Chupacabra! if possible. <h2>Spells/Traps</h2> Starting things off is actually a card that actually requires non-specific cards to get its mileage out of. Since your Main Deck is pretty much all DARK monsters, <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> is used to get a draw 2 in exchange for a DARK monster you might not necessarily need in your hand at a given point. Use this to, well, draw extra cards you may need or try and bait an Ash Blossom so your Time Thief Regulator isn't the one on the receiving end of it.  <a data-name=""Time Thief Startup"">Time Thief Startup</a> is a pretty cool card to have Turn 1, letting you Special Summon a Time Thief from your hand for free. Its second effect in the GY is miles better, as it banishes itself to attach one each of a Time Thief monster, spell, and trap from your grave to a Time Thief Xyz monster you control. After putting it to use Turn 1, if at all, you're likely best off using it as an attachment from the deck or discarding with a Danger!.  <a data-name=""Time Thief Hack"">Time Thief Hack</a> is a Continuous Spell protecting your Xyz monsters the turn they're summoned, but its secondary effect is worth more mention. This effect lets you target an Xyz monster you control to power it up by 300 ATK times its materials. And should at least one of those materials belong to your opponent, boom. Direct attack.  <a data-name=""Time Thief Flyback"">Time Thief Flyback</a> attaches a Time Thief card from the deck to your Time Thief Xyz monster straightaway, most often another Flyback for the bounceback effect. Though it also banishes itself from the grave to employ the Bezel Ship-esque effect of attaching a card from your opponent's grave to your Xyz monster. Another card that's primarily for attaching from the deck, but not too shabby on the field or the grave either.  <a data-name=""Time Thief Retrograde"">Time Thief Retrograde</a> is the real cream of the crop, especially since it can be searched with Winder. Should you control a Time Thief Xyz, you can negate an opponent's Spell or Trap and attach it to that monster as material, setting up respective card detachment effects and swiping even more materials.  With <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a> off the banlist at last, Xyz decks among this caliber can truly shine now. Being a card you can activate at a moment's notice or during your opponent's turn, it shifts any material-less DARK Xyz you control into a much more powerful form. Sadly, Outer Entity Azathot is still banned, so not as powerful plays can really come through. Luckily, that doesn't mean this card is devastated. You can still do things like, say, morph your Break Sword into a Redoer or Perpetua or, even better, make a Dark Rebellion into a Dark Requiem, the added attachment effect of Launch making it able to get off its effect instantly with 3000 ATK to swing around.  <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> joins Retrograde's side as a reliable negation/disruption to add to the deck's power. Not only that, but in the GY, it banishes itself to Special Summon a Phantom Knight from there. So effectively, you could say, bring out a used Break Sword to Rank Up into a Redoer or Perpetua or set up another use of Silent Boots. A surefire card to run three of.  <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a> is a must to search using Silent Boots or Ancient Cloak, and a great card to start your first turn with. If you have no traps in your grave, you can activate it the turn you set it, bringing it to your field as a L4 DARK monster, so it's perfect to use for this deck's boss monster to get that bounceback effect off fine and dandy. And speaking of... <h2>Extra Deck Monsters</h2> The indisputable boss monster of the deck is none other than the Akira the 3rd of Yu-Gi-Oh!, <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>. This versatile young scamp attaches a card from the top of your opponent's deck every Standby Phase, and that fuels its crazy detaching effect. With a monster, it banishes itself until the End Phase to protect itself from harmful effects and destruction, so be sure to detach other kinds of cards from it to get their effects off, too. Detaching a spell lets you draw a card, simple enough. But by detaching a trap, you'll achieve a non-targeting bounceback of any face-up card on your opponent's field, including one of their seemingly indomitable monsters. And to add insult to injury, if it's a main deck card you returned during your opponent's turn, during your Standby Phase you get to attach the card you returned. I can't tell you how many times I narrowly escaped danger with this guy and paid back with my own crazy play.  Next comes Redoer's sweet, sassy counterpart, <a data-name=""Time Thief Perpetua"">Time Thief Perpetua</a>. This ever-helpful, defensive cutie bears two great effects: one to detach a material to revive a Time Thief from the grave -- including Redoer -- , and another to attach a Time Thief card from your deck to any Xyz monster you control, not just Redoer, to use as material. And it's a Quick Effect, too. So for free, you get to restock the materials of your powerful Xyz monsters you need to get into shape to power up your plays.  <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> makes for another generic material R4 that can go in a long way. Bearing an effect you can activate at any time on any turn, you detach one to prevent your opponent from activating card effects in the grave. This way, you won't have to worry about the effects of cards like Doomking Balerdroch, Destiny HERO Malicious, or the Shaddoll main deck monsters giving you much trouble.  <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> is an easy-to-summon walking MST, bearing a Quick Effect that detaches a material to pop any backrow on the field. Not much else to say, though it's joined by another windy companion.  <a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a> might not be the most powerful Xyz monster in terms of attack, but its effect can come in clutch if used just right. Detaching one material at a time acts as a <a data-name=""Paleozoic Canadia"">Paleozoic Canadia</a> of sorts, only lacking the ability to activate on your opponent's turn, to set a monster they control face-down. Detach two at once, and it shuffles it into the deck instead.  <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a> is a sort of ""if all else fails"" monster when you desperately need to stall out some powerful monsters from your opponent for a while. In defense, it forces all your opponent's monsters into defense and prevents them from activating their trigger effects, so it's definitely worthwhile if you're in need of a turn or two to gather resources without worry that the turn they would have used to utterly end you will have already passed.  <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Break Sword"">The Phantom Knights of Break Sword</a> is surprisingly powerful in the right hands. More often than not, you'll be using its effect to pop itself and one of your opponent's cards at the same time. The former may sound dumb, but it actually revives two Phantom Knights (which are most likely the Silent Boots and Ancient Cloak it was likely used to summon) and amps up their levels by one, letting you then go into a new Rank 4 to continue your plays.  <a data-name=""Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon"">Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon</a> is mostly used as a beatstick for a quick smack, given its ability to halve and gain a monster's attack by detaching its two materials. That'd be run-of-the-mill and pretty arbitrary if we weren't also running the aforementioned Rank-Up quick play, which upgrades it into <a data-name=""Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon"">Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon</a>, a far more powerful and useful form. So long as Rebellion is still attached to it, you can either snatch the whole of an opponent's monster's ATK for itself or negate the activation of another monster's effect to destroy it and revive an Xyz monster from the grave. I wouldn't fret about keeping good materials on it, though. So long as <a data-name=""Time Thief Perpetua"">Time Thief Perpetua</a> is on the field, its own quick effect can help keep attaching Time Thief cards for it to use if your deck is supplied with them.  Meanwhile on the side of <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Blaze Falcon"">Raidraptor - Blaze Falcon</a>, it acts as another RUM Launch target for either a Redoer or Perpetua fresh out of material and you need something to keep its use going. You'll want to bring it out on your turn in ATK, as it can attack directly while it has material. And once it inflicts damage whilst doing so, it lets you pop an opponent's Special Summoned monster free. Otherwise, you can detach a material if this isn't possible to pretty much Raigeki all your opponent's Special Summoned monsters and burn for 500 each.  Your typical Link setup consists of cards like <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> for deck returns and possible additional draws, <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> for backrow popping, and <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> for being able to summon these during your opponent's turn, surprise them with their respective effects, and protect them from card effects. You can also use <a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a> to power up all your DARK monsters while also making sure LIGHT monsters are on the weaker side, as well as adding a DARK monster from your grave to your hand when it's destroyed. This especially works if you're having Redoer attack directly using Hack's effect, just a heads-up. Other than that, a little <a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a> can go a long way in terms of whittling down your opponent's offenses. <h2>Side Deck</h2> The side deck I've included goes into some options if certain cards aren't your thing and some would work better than others. <a data-name=""Danger!? Tsuchinoko?"">Danger!? Tsuchinoko?</a> goes on the field whether you summon it successfully or discard it, while <a data-name=""Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite"">Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite</a> is a great card to easily bring out, especially with stuff like Armageddon Knight to support it.  Also along for the ride is <a data-name=""Bujinki Ahashima"">Bujinki Ahashima</a>, a Link that lets you summon two monsters of the same level from the hand and grave, then immediately Xyz summon with both. It also pops a backrow your opponent controls should an Xyz monster it points to detach a material for its effect. Might not be the best option, but you could say it has its place.  The Utopia Engine is available as well, consisting of your summoning order of <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a>, <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a>, and <a data-name=""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"">Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</a>, as well as their respective power-up spell <a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a>. It's a reliable beatstick package, if not an overkill one, that can easily scale some high power walls. <h2>Notable Combos</h2> <h4>1. Hand: Time Thief Regulator</h4> <ul>  	<li>Summon Regulator with a Normal Summon or Startup, then tribute to summon any pair combination of Winder, Bezel Ship, or Chronocorder.</li>  	<li>Xyz Summon Redoer from the Extra Deck to start the card-snatching journey. If Winder is in hand, you can detach a material from Redoer to summon it for free; especially good if you only used Bezel Ship and Chronocorder, as you can then detach Bezel Ship to summon it back and set up future Xyz summons.</li>  	<li>At any point when Winder is summoned, search for Retrograde or another Time Thief card that is beneficial to discard for a Danger! monster summon, such as Flyback, Startup, Bezel Ship, or Chronocorder.</li>  	<li>After getting two more L4 monsters out, Xyz for Perpetua and activate her Quick Effect to attach Time Thief Flyback to Redoer for free, setting up his bounceback effect later.</li>  	<li>Set Retrograde and pass the turn.</li>  	<li>During opponent's turns, continue to attach Time Thief cards to Redoer using Perpetua, who can also re-summon other Time Thieves from GY and set up more searches and Xyz Summons, as well as attach cards from your opponent's deck with Redoer's Standby Phase effect.</li> </ul> <h4>2. Hand: The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak/Shade Brigandine and Silent Boots</h4> <ul>  	<li>Normal Summon Ancient Cloak, allowing you to Special Summon Silent Boots. If Shade Brigandine is in hand, summon it first, then Silent Boots, and try to summon another L3, like Ancient Cloak or Danger!? Jackalope? after another Phantom Knight is in the GY.</li>  	<li>Xyz Summon The Phantom Knights of Break Sword, and activate its effect to destroy itself and any card your opponent controls.</li>  	<li>Upon destruction, activate Break Sword's secondary effect to summon Ancient Cloak and Silent Boots from GY. Make sure Ancient Cloak is in Attack Position.</li>  	<li>If possible, summon another L4 monster, like a Danger! or a Time Thief under the effect of Startup or if you used Bezel Ship's GY effect while Break Sword was on the field.</li>  	<li>Xyz Summon Redoer, then activate Ancient Cloak's effect to grant Redoer 800 extra ATK and swap itself to Defense.</li>  	<li>Xyz Summon for Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon and use its effect to detach both its materials to sap an opposing monster's ATK.</li>  	<li>When both are in GY, banish Ancient Cloak to search for Rank-Up Magic Launch and banish Silent Boots to search for Fog Blade, setting both and passing the turn.</li>  	<li>During your opponent's Main Phase, activate Magic Launch on your Rebellion to make Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon, potentially negating a monster effect of your opponent, getting rid of said monster, and summoning an Xyz from your GY, such as Break Sword for a potential Link Summon.</li> </ul> <h4>3. Hand: Armageddon Knight</h4> <ul>  	<li>Normal Summon Armageddon Knight, whose effect will proc and allow you to send either Silent Boots or Ancient Cloak to the GY.</li>  	<li>Banish said Silent Boots or Ancient Cloak from the grave to add Shade Brigandine to your hand.</li>  	<li>Set Shade Brigandine, then immediately activate it to Special Summon itself from the backrow as a L4 monster, if you've made sure no traps were in your grave.</li>  	<li>Use Armageddon Knight and Shade Brigandine for the overlay of Redoer.

Use it's effect to special summon deskbot 002 so then it can add anything you need to your hand. I mostly add the field spell so I can shuffle to get the cards I want.  You can get super quant on the field with Number 27 Dreadnought Dreadnoid's effect.

The point is to know what type monsters use opponent (if you start game you dont knowe that, if you second np). And use ""Archnemesis Eschatos"" for Lockdown oponents. We use ""dark world dealings"", card destruction or ""Danger! Mothman!"" second effect to know type opponent monsters. Late as standard in this deck type. Add, draw, SS loop use ""Saryuja Skull Dread"" and ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" to draw more. We summon and  use  Link and when we draw ""Archnemesis Eschatos"" we use hise effect. Before we'll probably  we need use too Reprodocus link effect.       If opponent uses for example decks (Hero, Salamngret, Altergeist, Orcust, Cyber Dragon, Zombie, Abc, D/D/D, Fluffal... is completely lock. And we are use Virus traps, with good hand we take opponent spells and traps.  Going second: add, draw, SS loop use knightmare link to clean the field.

Repair Plant is searchable through Cyber Dragon Core which is also our 1 card starter making it is the best card in this deck, I will explain the combo.  Normal summon Core, search Repair Plant, ss Almiraj (making Repair Plant online), use Repair Plant search Galaxy Soldier, ss Soldier search another one, ss another Soldier (we need 2 light monster fodder in total), overlay both Soldier ss Cyber Dragon Nova, use Nova ss Core from GY, ss Cyber Dragon Infinity, link off Almiraj and Core for Verte Anaconda on another extra zone, use Verte send Red-Eyes Fusion (for Dragun negation+monster pops+burn) or Overload Fusion (if you have 2 Cyber Dragon monsters in GY for Rampage multiple atk+backrow pops+dumps Cyber Dragon monsters to GY).  Cyber Dragon lineup: 1 Cyber Dragon (great going second, discard fodder), 3 Core (best card, main starter, searches Cyber spell), 1 Herz (discard fodder, recycle/search Cyber Dragon), 1 Revsystem (extender), 3 Emergency (searches Core or other Cyber Dragon monsters), 1 Repair Plant (searchable from Core, searches Galaxy Soldier, Photon Orbital, or any Cyber Dragon monsters). The monsters are all contact fusion material which means free removal.  Galaxy Photon lineup: They mainly act as extenders (except Galaxy Soldier which is our main combo). 1 Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon (rank 8 play centered around this card), 1 Afterglow Dragon, 1 Galaxy Knight, 1 Galaxy Braver, 1-2 Photon Thrasher (free monster), 1 Photon Vanisher (free+plus, searches Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon), 1-2 Orbital (Galaxy and Photon monster searcher), Galaxy Wizard (searches Galaxy and Photon card; backup plan when you only have 1 fodder for Galaxy Soldier; ss Soldier search Wizard, normal summon Wizard, use Wizard tribute and search Galaxy Expedition, use expedition ss Soldier for Infinity or lv8 if you have another lv8 extender), 1 Galaxy Expedition (high lv extender), 1 Galaxy Zero (revives Galaxy/Photon for extender or XYZ rank-up).  Fusion lineup: Vanilla Red-Eyes and DM (Dragun material), 2 Red-Eyes Fusion (just in case it is drawn), 1 Magicalized Fusion (free Dragun), 1 Overload Fusion (for Rampage play backrow pops + multiple atk OTK). The fusion spells are all searchable by Verte.  Complementary cards: handtraps (preferably light), RotA (searches the Photons which are free ss monsters), Monster Reborn (extender, revives your boss monsters or for XYZ rank-up), Cosmic Cyclone (banishes backrow).  Extra deck: Self explanatory.  Side deck: Matchup specific.  Pros: Great going first or second, first turn board have both negations and pops, big monsters, can play through single target/negation handtraps but the board will end only with Dragun, fusion (contact too) and XYZ dont need link marker anymore in MR5.  Cons: Possible bricking with many big level monsters, contact fusing in MR5 only works with mostly link/pendulum monster, hard facing Cyber Dragon mirror."

I do believe this deck is very powerful in its own right considering that colossus did just get banned. but fear not! because I believe that this deck can be the solution to thunder dragons for the time being until they get new support. this deck uses some spicier tech in the deck to accommodate for the loss of colossus. the idea of the deck is more of what I like to call ""Titan Control"". meaning that this is a more control style deck rather than just an OTK central build that everyone is trying to go for. the idea of the deck is to summon titan first turn using ""anaconda"", and once you do that you will have other cards in your hand or some number of cards to help you control the board. be sure to not overextend as it can be a mistake that some people can make when playing this deck(remember the goal is to get titian out first turn). once you get titan out the first turn, you are set to make your plays for next turn because your opponents will assume that titan will automatically be a threat and will have to use up there resources to remove it from the board. anyway, have fun with this deck and leave a like for more updates to the deck."

Monstrosity will help with the bricky hands seeing as you can just drop them straight out on board (it being quick play is also pretty spicy), but with the banning of IB there's no way to actually serach this out now making it less consistent, but it's still to good of an anti brick to not want it I feel. There's also Generaider Boss Quest so you can return and search, but with the only other search being Mardel you can't hope to rely on that either. Loptr is a great addition to the deck, as he can tribute himself to bring out any of your giants, you could possibly slot in Condemned Witch instead of Lilith if you  wanna go balls deep into summoning Loptr, they both serve a similar role so it's personal choice (Lilith guarantees you a field spell or Impermanence whereas Witch nets you a Generaider) and as seeing that the normal summon isn't that important in the deck because of the field spell you can afford to drop em in most situations.  The Boss you wanna get out first is either Hoarr or Utgard, but preferably Hoarr as he can negate anything once a turn and his discard effect isn't awful either depending on matchup, but Utgards' banish anything effect is nothing to laugh at either. After you have those 2 out though it's whatever works in the situation you're in. Mardel searches ANY generaider card when she's summoned from anywhere which is nice, Hela can bring em back from the grave (she can tribute herself for the effect too) so I feel having em both as a 1 of is justifiable.  The Invoked package speaks for itself really, adds more consistency to the deck as a whole giving you more plays. So there's not much to be said about it, pretty bog standard.  &nbsp;"

With Crusadias underrated special summoning ability, and Rokket one","So when I make these deck uploads - a lot of people ask me ""Why?"". Well, if no-one else is going to make 6 negate combo's after a control-supporting banlist than who will?! For today's quirky amalgamation of cards; I decided I would mix in one of, in my opinion, the most underrated link-climb decks with the iconic deck of yugioh VRAINS' favourite villain. Crusadia Rokket's have surprisingly impressed me over the coming days: I've managed to somehow make a decent board while having card advantage (all using an OTK-centered archetype). So with that being said - let me explain..  The main strategy, and idea, behind starting off the combo is making your generic Guardragon combo: Spatha into Elpy, Elpy into Red MD, etc. What you want to do however, is instead of making Saryuja, make Apollousa. This will be your first negate. Then you want to combo-off with Striker Dragon and using him, get out your infamous Borreload Savage. A third combo you can do - is pitch your Galactic Spiral Dragon and bring it back. Then you can simply use its effect with something like Crusadia Draco, and make your Number 38. The rest of course relies on how well you draw - which with this deck tends to be pretty well.  Alongside these three - you can end on cards like Hieratic Seal and Avramax - for that added protection. I decided to run Sanaphond mainly because of fear that Orcust will still be a thing - but it rarely came up in play-testing so I'd advise you cut it for something better in general - or just something you prefer to play. I'd also at one point considered playing Needlefiber - but it seemed to bricky and inconsistent towards my ideal combo. You can easily pull off the same effect with just your Rokket Tracer.  In general: this deck is about a 7.9/10 - only with the fact that this new format definitely promotes Control over Combo. Still it's an original take on the Crusadia deck and seems consistent and fun to play with. There is definitely room for improvement and I encourage you to look into bringing out the decks full potential.

I used a deck based off of Jessie's deck from GX that I got ","This deck is definitely a work in progress but it is built around quick summoning a lot of monsters making for an easy setup that can give you Blue-Eyes White Dragon, Rainbow Dragon, and Rainbow Dark Dragon very quickly. Try to start with Crystal Conclave and any Crystal Beast (other than Pegasus). When it is destroyed in battle, Sapphire Pegasus can be used to quickly bring out another beast. When you draw another Conclave, destroy the one on the field to bring Pegasus to your hand. Set Conclave and summon Pegasus to summon another beast. Destroy Conclave once more to get Pegasus into your hand, then bring it out again to summon another Crystal Beast. The goal here is to quickly get out as many Crystal Beasts as possible. Use Torrential Tribute to send them to the graveyard and use Maiden, Master, or White Stone to get a Blue-Eyes out after. When all the types of Crystal Beasts are in the graveyard, you can summon Rainbow Dragon (ideally summon both). Use Advance Darkness and get remove them from play to summon Rainbow Dark Dragon. Deep-Eyes makes a good backup since it gains power based on dragons in the graveyard. I have not gotten to use it too much yet so it will likely have bugs to work out. It may work very well with cards like Stardust Dragon and other dragon synchros."

One good combo is to use booster dragon or borreload dragon<span>  <span>to point to zones to put your elpy and pisty. I also sided super-poly to take advantage of the three borreload furious dragon as you can use your opponents DARK dragon monsters (which aren't exactly rare.) I also sided E-HERO core, which admittedly is weird. But, its no surprise that HERO decks are going to be incredibly good in the formats to come. And using your opponents E-HEROs as fusion material for core will be good for disrupting your opponents plays. (If you want to play another generic hero like sunrise that is fine and incourged.)</span></span>"

Up to Upstart, up to 3 Solemn Judgement, made room for a second Eternity. I'm down one land search in the maindeck, and running a Terraforming over Demise of the Land. Demise is good if you know you're going first, but pulling a spellbook to the hand might be more useful. You don't need the extra deck - you can make Crowley or Linkuriboh, maybe I:P into Unicorn if you want, though really you're trying to just get to a Jowgen lock. There's also the Relinquished monsters, since Droll is big against us and is #1 hand trap right now. Still couldn't find room main. Monster Reborn comes in as a way to make Priestess or Thousand-Eyes in the matchups where Thousand-Eyes is really good. Set Rotation is for field spell decks, notably other Mystic Mine decks and dinos. Droll is for SPYRAL. Evenly Matched and Raigeki are to help break boards, still useful against SPYRAL but just good when you know you're going second. I feel like the one Raigeki is still worth it, just for retaining value in a protracted game. Matched is also our answer to back-row. Kycoo is for Orcust, anything that banishes monsters or recurs monsters from the GY. Dark Ruler No More also helps against SPYRAL while just generally being a strong card, and helps combo with Jowgen. Instant Fusion is mostly for all the Droll, but doubles as removal. Notably, both of the creatures it summons are Spellcasters, meaning you can use Spellbook of Life to get 1 negate off of Millennium-Eyes or lock boards up with Thousand-Eyes. Secret Village is less useful than it was when Skystriker was everywhere, but it's still a good way to lock people down/trip people up.

Its a trap heavy deck with 2 Xyz Monsters. They have 2 effects. The first is the trap effect the other effect has all Paleozoic traps. When a Trap activates they can be special summoned from the graveyard but the opponent can chain to the trap a other card and the Paleo not comes to the field. All Paleozoic Monsters are unaffectet against Monstereffects and there are normal monsters (not the 2 Xyz). Anomalocaris is the bossmonster of this archetype. It needs 3+ Level 2 monster and in either turn it can detach 1 Material to pop a card on the field. When a trap comes to the grave from our side he can mill the top card our deck and when its a trap we can add it. When not it comes in the grave. This effect goes only when it has a trap as a xyz material. Opabinia allows us to use our Paleozoic traps from our hand. And when this good boi has a Trap as a Material he can detach one material to search 1 Paleozoic Trap.

The best possible hand one could get with this deck would be:  Going First :  Prank Kids Dropsies, Prank Kids Lampsies, Magical Meltdown, Ash Blossom , Solemn Judgment.  If you are in a 40 min tournamant and they dont disrupt at all, You can win slowly on time and control the match.  .....  I will write a bit more soon.  &nbsp;"

Jack A' Booran","Just a pure list for Mayakashi without any engine shenanigans, about as basic as you could get while still being playable in current year. The goal is still to get to Hajun or die trying, then do the typical synchro ladder with Dakki. Can either go first or second, though going first is generally safer because of the inherent inability of Mayakashi to play through disruption, as well as all of the quick-effect revival cards that need to be set/summoned first. I opted not to include Yuki-Onna the Absolute Zero Mayakashi as I wanted this list to be realistic to make IRL and who knows when she's hitting the TCG, but once she's imported you should make space for her in the extra deck if you can help it."

Their effect is generic so it allows several gameplans, here I propose a control oriented build. The gameplan will be to maximize the excavating effects of our monsters to summon generic rock monsters and synchro monsters with good control effects when seting a backrow.  &nbsp;  The main deck monsters separates into 2 ccategories : the tuners that special summon themselves to excavate cards and speciel summon monsters amongst them, and the non-tuners that trigger effects when summoned by Adamatia monster's effects. The tuner monsters are the basis of the deck's strategy : they share the effect of excavating the top 5 cards of the deck to special summon a level 4 or lower non-tuner rock monster that was revealed, and can speciel summon themselves by different ways (Adamatia Analyser summons itself if only the opponent controls a monster, Adamatia Seeker summons itself if we control another Adamatia monster and Adamatia Researcher summons itself if we control another rock monster). The other Adamatia monsters shares the effect of sending back any synchro monster of their attribute from the field or graveyard to the extra deck to go back to the top of the deck, and trigger an effect if summoned by an Adamatia monster effect : Leonite can send an Adamatia monster from the hand/graveyard to the top of the deck, Raptite send a rock monster from the hand/graveyard to the top of the deck and Dragite is a 1 card draw. The non-tuner monsters are important to constantly recycle ressources and are an alternative way to place a specific monster on top of the deck so we are sure to special summon it later. The cycling effect is generic so we can recycle monsters like Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon.  To complete this engine we have Koa'ki Meiru Guardian and Koa'ki Meiru Wall that are targets for the adamatia tuner's effect and can negate respectively monsters and spells effect activation. Gigantes is an extender that opens plays on Granite Loyalist to unlock mediocre hands and can break backrows in some specific configurations.  Lastly Ash Blossom pairs with Infinite Impermanence to restrain opponent's play and allow easier OTKs when going second, and can also backup our boards when going first.  &nbsp;  The spell and trap package of the archetype is quite good and polyvalent. First Adamatia Laputite is a field spell that boost all rock monsters to create a fair number of beatsticks and make our boards harder to break (a simple Koa'ki Meiru monster go to 2400 Atk), and has the usefull ability to take 5 Adamatia cards of the deck and place them on top in any order so we can have access to all our cards folowing the situations. Adamatia Sign is a generic reborn for rock monsters that is not once per turn, and can place any Adamatia monster of the deck on it's top if reborning an Adamatia monster. Adamatia Resonance is a counter trap that handles a monster effect and Adamatia Relieve tributes x Adamatia monsters to destroy x+1 cards on the field, being a good disruption effect against many decks.  Lastly Pot Of Avarice is an alternative way to recycle specific cards of the graveyard and draw 2 cards, to search out backrow cards/hand traps after we made our board. It's also an excllent card to start a grind game if the opponent broke our board.  &nbsp;  The extra deck Adamatia monsters also have a shared excavating effect : Raptite excavates thee top 5 cards to special summon any rock monster revealed, Leonite takes 1 revealed Adamatia card to the hand and Dragite bounces x or less cards to the hand, w being the numbr of rock monsters revealed. Adamatia Rise Dragite is a great OTK generator that can get rid of annoying monsters and backrow simultaneously. They also have a quick effect that triggers during the opponent's turn if a monster of their attribute is in our graveyard (mostly the non-tuner Adamatia monsters) : Raptite banishes 1 card from the opponent's graveyard, Leonite reborns a rock monster (usefull to bring back Koa'ki Meiru monsters) and Dragite is a spell/trap negation. Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon and Dragon Ogre Deity Of Tenyi are easy to summon and consist on monster effect negation / banishing disruption that can also highly pressure boards during battlephases.  Granite Loyalist and Abyss Dweller are easy to summon xyz4 monsters, the first can search out any rock monster to unlock bricky hands or extend boards and the second locks the opponent's graveyard to backup our final board, being a stop to specific decks.  The link package is generic. Salamangreat Almiraj is a destruction protection and is also a fire type monster that is easy to summon that enables the quick effect of Adamatia Rise Leonite. Knightmare Phoenix and Unicorn can especially handle backrow cards to OTK if we go second or grind the game in some specific configurations, and Borreload Dragon is a way to bypass annoying monsters like Avramax. Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess is a good grind game option to prevent monster effects that triggers during the battle phase and push OTKs.  &nbsp;  The side deck :  It's designed to enhance going second match ups, so first twin Twisters and Red Reboot destroys backrow, the second card being able to completely shut down trap relevant decks like Altergeist and Subterror.  Mind control steals monsters to handle powerfull monsters like Apollousa or at least force out négations, and Super Polymerization can neutralize boards of decks that are out of range of Nibiru. Nibiru is a stop to almost all combo decks when used at the right timing, and opens easy OTKs with Adamatia Rise Dragite.  Lastly Dinowrestler Pankratops is a free special summon that heavily pressure boards of control decks like Subterror and Altergeist with it's quick effect.  &nbsp;"

You always want to go first to set up if at all possible. Generally turn 1 won't be too eventful as you're basically counting on your opponent to mess up and either trigger a floating effect or walk into the field spell. As the duel progresses it's typically very easy to access links thanks to the ability of Krawlers to swarm and access to cards like Worm Bait, and many other link options exist if you're willing to spend more (e.g. Knightmares, Avramax, Borrelsword, etc.). The side deck in this case is primarily alternative tech choices, different potential backrow and other cards you may decide to run by preference rather than an actual side deck."

Qliphorts were one of the first &amp; strongest Pendulum based archetypes to come out in 2014. In an era where synchros &amp; xyz's ran things, Qli stepped in and shut them down. And with MR5 unlocking those strategies once again, look to these marvelous machines to do so once more. 'Towers' may not be the big dog anymore with links running around, but team him up with 'Skybase' and even they are in trouble. Speaking of links, 2018's 'Genius' solved the pendulum handicap for them, allowing them to go off like before.

You run the eight hand traps to stop your opponent from getting a board, then you typically want to Synchro summon with the Blackwings and generate enough damage to defeat the opponent. However, there is going first potential with the extra deck as well. Normally Blackwings suffer from a lack of quick effects that you can use during the opponents turn to disrupt making it hard to stop the opponent with just hand traps if you even draw them; nbut with I:P Masquerena you can link climb into Knightmare unicorn during their turn and bounce a troublesome card to the hand. You can also make Borreload  Savage Dragon when you go first as well which is a great negating monster. The reason these expensive monsters must be run is because Simoon the Poison Wind ( Your main Combo starter) locks you into dark extra deck monsters, so these are the best you could make going first if you want to maximize your plays. The main brick of the deck is of course Mare Mare but it is essential to Mare Mare for closing games. It is very easy for Blackwings to make Yazi evil of the yang zing and he not only pops a card on the field but also summons Mare Mare which turns into Borrelsword. If you do happen to brick Mare Mare, Twin Twisters is a great card that can help discard it from your hand. Mare Mare can later be shuffled back into the deck with Pot of Avarice which opens up the option to do the Yazi play again and lets you draw two cards as well. There are more draw power cards besides Avarice like Allure of darkness and Upstart Goblin which are meant to help make the deck more consistent. Black Whirlwind lets you add Monsters to your hand so it is sort of draw power but is more of a combo starter as it lets you pick which Blackwings you need to start Synchro Summoning. Foolish Burial is an extender which is meant to send Steam or Zephyros to the graveyard so you can use their effects for whatever situation you are currently in. Twin twisters is just a generic backrow removal which is also useful for discarding Mare Mare, Steam the Cloak, and Zephyros the Elite if you happen to have them in your hand. The rest of the deck is the Blackwing engine which is used mainly to Synchro summon, however some Blackwings like Gale the whirlwind have decent effects. I have searched long for a better blackwing deck then the one I built but I believe this is the most consistent and powerful version that is currently available until Raidraptor Wise strix comes to the TCG. Thank you for Viewing my deck list and I hope you have a good time playing it if you do happen to try it out for yourself. If you have any suggestions on how I can improve the deck feel free to message me your ideas, I am always open to improving my favorite deck. Once again, Thank you!"

With the ","Okay. What. The. Hell?! After months of ridiculing Time Thief players for thinking this deck could one day be good - Konami release Time Thief Perpetua; a card <em>so</em> good and <em>so</em> irritating to play against, that I might actually consider playing this deck. When I day-dreamed about what Rank 4 Toolbox what become relevant in 20202, I would've never guessed that Redoer, pass.dek would be a top competitor. So, with embarrassment and overwhelming excitement - I bring to you, Lunalight Time Thief..  A good starting point would most likely be: the engines. I'd like to think of this concoction of cards as a Tesla Cybertruck: It has an unnecessary amount of mechanics, and on announcement was ridiculed by everyone. However, like its metaphorical counterpart, people have warmed up to it and it turned out to be pretty cool in concept and fun....to the person playing it. In my opinion, the Lunalight engine is way to underrated to not be used in this build. Opening Tiger is like being a kid in a candy shop - minus the candy, the shop, or the fact that you're a grown man playing a children's card game. You basically run 9 copies of it - so not opening him is just simply bad luck. For the Danger! engine, you want to max out on the level 4's - as this is a R4nk toolbox deck after all.  Mothman comes up the most, so I'd recommend maxing out on him - especially in a 60 card deck. The time thief engine is pretty self-explanatory. Your best normal summon is Kaleido Chick, but when you somehow don't manage to open it (despite having like 12 copies of it), you want to go into regulator and use its effect for a free rank 4.  Your ideal board would be Redoer, Perpetua and Flyback (that is assuming you cant make things like I:P into Apollousa on your opponents turn). But what happens if you don't open the right cards to extend into your monsters? Well, I run a small, 3-card Raidraptor engine to unclog your hand and get enough monsters to make a redoer. The combo is as follows: make Force Strix, use its effect to search the Lanius, special summon him and make Wise Strix, his effect special zephyros, get another monster on board and make Redoer then banish itself, special Zeph by setting a S/T and returning it - make I:P and then on your opponents special back Redoer and link him away into Unicorn. This is a weak, but optimal hand if you open practically unplayable.  To end off, the side deck. The side deck with this build isnt really match-up based -  it's just preference wise. I'd suggest you side the Utopia Double package after game 1 if you know you're going second. The extra deck is pretty tight but if you know you're going second then you can easily just otk and get the match win. I'd also side Castel, because he's a generic rank 4 with a spin ability. Armageddon knight was a card that I originally ran, but its more of a side card or just optional. Obviously, if you open it then you plus a lot - but it wastes your normal for a simple pitch 1 which isn't quite so optimal. In short it's a situational card - so use it wisely. I've seen people run Dragun and F0 dragon in side - but the problem is you don't really make F0 with this deck - as the main rank 4's you are making turn 1 are Perpetua and Redoer. So it's a -2 in the extra that you really need. Dragun is slightly better in my opinion, but with this build; you already run 6 garnets and adding two more could make it even more bricky - which is really crucial in a sixty-card build.  Overall: this build is a hefty 8.7/10. This is one of the better builds out there - and ends on a lot of negates fast, especially with the new support. The deck is nice on paper and on the field - which helps it be one of my favourite so far. I've spent effort making this deck and hopefully you'll enjoy using it to crush your opponents dreams as you silently whisper for the 6th time 'Redoer effect'. Thanks a lot to my sensei and friend, Yumi, for teaching me how to use this deck and telling me all these great combos of his. Big shoutout to him!"

Contains all the best ""go 2nd"" tools available (except for Lightning Storm, as I wanted to keep it budget friendly or Evenly Matched because it's a shame to waste this deck's OTK potential). The side deck focuses on backrow-decks, as well as powerful threats (3 x Gameciel) and the biggest weakness of the deck... going first (3 x Reclusia). Although, going first sometimes results in awkward hands that cannot summon a single monster, the inclusion of World Legacy's Secrets and Invoked Caliga gives the deck a good defencive option in a lot of cases.

It keeps getting consistent tops?! Oh uh...as I was saying, Salamangreat are still one of the toughest control decks out there! One thing you might notice that is slightly odd, the ratios just dont add up! Your previous one-of traps are now played at 3, and your falcons, peacocks and dogs are all at 2 now. Well, with Miragestallio sadly gone - you cannot simply search out your level 4's. So you play the next best thing and main two copies of Dante. With the fact that we now run a mill card in the deck - you want to play the enslaved two ratio, in order to still be able to search after your monster has been milled.  Two new cards that you might find are Solemn Strike, and Armored Bitron. Armored Bitron is a fairly new card that was announced - and allows you to special summon any cyberse monster from your deck - except its effects are negated. You run this card as a means of setting up strong boards after you make your combo turn 1. The reason its strictly a turn 2 card, is because it locks you out of summoning Dante for the rest of the turn. So you primarily use him to have monsters for Avramax. And of course - the solemn package is simply extra trap card disruption to promote your opponent scooping.  In conclusion, Salamangreat is far from dead. With this list - the deck has very strong capabilities. In times of adversity - people tend to triumph the most. I think Miragestallio getting banned was important for the deck - but it can manage quite well without it. This is by far the meta deck got hurt the least - and you can tell due to its incredible boards! Like a phoenix, we must rise from the ashes - or in this case like a fox. Or a falcon. Or even a jaguar. And maybe an armadillo as well. And..you get the point. Our spicy, furry friends are not going anywhere just yet - Konami will have to simply try harder...."

Yugioh DM season 1 and season 4 focused on Mai's Harpie cards and she essentially used a Harpie themed anime deck in season 4 when she was controlled by Dartz.  Mai received new support for her deck 2 years ago in the Yugioh Set Legendary Duelists: Sister Of The Rose which included strong new support for her harpie character deck.

Uses the Zaborg self-pop strategy. ,"Gishki is one of my favourite Yu-Gi-Oh Archetypes for its history: it used to be notorious for FTKs, Hand Loops and generally degenerate strategies. The way these happened also had a very large effect on card design in general; the implementation of Once per Turn Clauses and forcing Anti-Search tech cards to be printed. On top of all this, it was a big part of Duel Terminal lore and still gets stuff relating to that today: look at the new Shaddoll Support! These days it's somehow still got things it can do, although it is quite gimmicky in general. This deck aims to OTK the opponent in...a rather elaborate way.  My deck uses Gishki Zielgigas primarily, so it's important to understand what he does. He'll give you a free card - and a free non-targeting send to the deck if you draw a Gishki Monster - in exchange for 1000 LP. Given Gishki Aquamirror can bring him back to the hand if there's a Ritual in the grave, using a Zielgigas to summon another is a very reliable strategy: with enough ways to get the Aquamirror back, this can be an effective loop until you have only 1000 LP left.  The aim of the deck is to abuse the hell out of this, digging through the deck for as many extenders as possible. This can be done through Salvage to get Shadow and Vision to loop, Surface for a free summon (Vision into Link plays), Avarice or Moray of Greed for draws, Impcantations for a free Zielgigas summon, and more. There are tons of resources the deck burns through to build a small but powerful board. Once the loop is finished and 2 Zielgigas are on the board, you can either attack with them and go into Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max to burn for game, or use Number 35: Ravenous Tarantula to boost your attack to an upwards of 10k and instantly win.  The new banlist was very important for this deck, as it banned Thunder Dragon Colossus, the greatest threat to the deck. It also brought back Pot of Avarice which is extremely abusable due to the graveyard getting stacked with monsters very quickly. In terms of recent sets, the release of Marincess Coral Anenome and Clotheep (although the latter has yet to be imported to the TCG) also gave the archetype much-needed extenders to combos, further bolstering its potential to keep going during a loop. <strong>Until Clotheep is released in the TCG, replace it with Borreload Dragon and Sky Cavalry Centaurea. </strong>These cards help the deck in removal, although they are definitely not as helpful.  As a side strategy, I've got Zaborg, the Mega Monarch, in my deck. Using this and sending Elder Entity N'Tss, Toadally Awesome and Herald of the Arc Light to the grave gives a humongous plus in card economy. With this, you get more than enough resources to loop and then even make a board. The best way to dump him on the board is with multiple Zielgigas on the field while Aquamirror is in the grave, or after using some Impcantations.  In the case that Zaborg is either unavailable or you don't feel there's a good situation for the self-pop, there are alternative Normal Summons; <ul>  	<li>Deep Sea Diva enables you to end on a Herald to force banishes, although this card can be cut for alternate cards.</li>  	<li>Beautunaful Princess brings out Gishki Abyss for a search, this can be used with One For One for a virtually free search.</li>  	<li>Gishki Abyss searches the entire archetype, most notably Gishki Shadow and Vision who can start the Zielgigas Loop.</li>  	<li>Gishki Beast can bring back a Gishki, which is useful during a loop. <ul>  	<li>Abyss for a search, and then a Link play.</li>  	<li>Shadow for a Rank 4 play, you can use Abyss Dweller or Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir through this. He can also help squeeze out a Zielgigas</li>  	<li>Vision is worse than both of these in terms of Extra Deck plays but can help squeeze out another Zielgigas.</li>  	<li>All of these can bring out the new Clotheep, who greatly assists in loops due to being able to Draw 2 and then discard Rituals for Aquamirror or Vision to use with Surface. This also enables Marincess Coral Anenome, who can bring back Abyss for another search, although you can't use your Rank 10s after.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Zaborg can also be removed in exchange for Vanity's Ruler, another powerful 2-tribute monster who can win games on its own due to locking the opponent out of Special Summons. Side decking it is valid, but it's not always necessary.  The deck does have flaws, especially in that going second is pretty much all it can do. The deck lacks any protection whatsoever, and while it can play through negates if it opens well (in fact it can easily go through 2 or 3 in some cases), having your key cards removed is common. This is why I define the deck as blind second, as a Gishki board is one of the most fragile in the game. You can use Mound of the Bound Creator to protect Zielgigas, but two pops are all it takes to oust that. Droll &amp; Lock Bird is also devastating to the deck, causing the draw loop to come to a swift end. As a result, Called by the Grave an imperative side deck card. If you want something to stop yourself from getting screwed over by going first, it is fine to add Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora into the Extra Deck.  In terms of matchups, I'm not entirely sure as the format has basically been reset. In a general sense, the deck does well against any that doesn't; <ul>  	<li>Lock you out of Special Summons (Summon Limit is a common ""you can scoop now"", True Draco carries it frequently too which doesn't help)</li>  	<li>Have a ton of removal (Dinosaurs tend to mow the deck down in this department, but going second usually makes this part less of an issue)</li>  	<li>Pile on more than 3ish negates (Pendulum opening well is a big problem here)</li>  	<li>Prevent Searching (Thunder Dragon Colossus is banned so this is pretty much a non-issue now)</li> </ul> What, that's a good bunch of decks? Well, I never said this was gonna be very meta relevant. I do think it's a Rogue Deck, but I am a touch optimistic. Gishki does very well against decks with large boards and little recovery, as Zielgigas can just wipe away any dangerous cards with good draw luck. It can play through a good few negates if it opens well (although some hands can be virtually unusable in the face of multiple negates), which makes this strength much better. It is very, very capable of OTKing an unprepared opponent.  &nbsp;"

Works in MR 4 and MR 5. ,"I was inspired for this deck by a Youtube video called ""<strong>Earth Toolbox 2019</strong>"". It featured a going 1st deck with different earth-engines to stun the opponent.  I thought about some more cards, that could fit into this deck and ended up on a going 2nd strategie with some changes to the original deckbuild. Ofc this is no competetive deck, but for Rogue matchups it works pretty well.  With the latest Banlist I had to make some changes. Brillant Fusion got banned and Pankratops got limited.  I just cutted the Brillant engine and added two Linkslayer inetead of the Pankratops  Here is a description of the engins and support cards:  <strong>Rock-Engine:</strong> One good winning condition is the <strong>Block Dragon</strong>, that searches us two lvl-4 rock-monsters to go into <strong>Utopia Double</strong>. As targets i choose 3 <strong>Gigantes</strong> and one <strong>The Rock Spirit</strong>, because they can be specialed easily.  <strong>Insect-Engine:</strong> The main reason for this is <strong>Gokipole</strong>, that can search and special a normal insect monster and remove one Monster from the field without targeting or destroying. To trigger its effect, we got mill cards, i.e. <strong>Resonance Insect</strong>, wich can also search <strong>Kaijus</strong> or <strong>Doom Dozer</strong>. So we got one more removal and XYZ/Link-Material.  <strong>Combo Starter/Extender:</strong> <strong>Mathmatician</strong> and <strong>Rescue Rabit</strong> are good normal summons that start our combos. We can enable the Insect-engine by milling <strong>Gokipole</strong>, get extenders like <strong>Dotscaper</strong> or <strong>Glow-up Bulb</strong> into the graveyard or just go into a Rank 4. <strong>Gallis</strong> is a free potential special summon and can mill more combo pieces.  Going-2nd-cards: <strong>Pankratops</strong> and <strong>Kaijus</strong> to remove opponents monsters. Linkslayer is also a free Special summon, Cyberse-type for the <strong>Curious</strong> and can destroy your opponents spells/traps.  <strong>Spells:</strong> These are combo starter/extender. <strong>Kaiju Slumber</strong> is a removal and search tool and <strong>Double or Nothing</strong> is needed for winning with <strong>Utopia Double</strong>.  <strong>Extra Deck:</strong> Can be chanced depending on the opponent or meta. <strong>Curious</strong> is an important combo piece to mill specific cards. <strong>Saryuja</strong> can be used to draw more cards while using weak monsters for the link summon. <strong>Bagooska</strong> is a nice Going-1st card. <strong>Granite</strong> can search our Block Dragon and became more imprtant, because the Brillant Fusion is banned now.  You can add any Rank 4 or Link-monster you want. Here are some examples: <strong>Borrelsword Dragon</strong> works perfectly in this, but its a bit more expensive. <strong>Abyss Dweller</strong> can be an easy win, depending on the matchup. <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> is a good interuption in your opponents turn, but also a non-budget-card."

Get out Dark Magical Circle and a way to recur Dark Magician in order to beat interrupt your opponent, clear the field, and eventually beat them down with the Emo Mage.  In order to protect your back row based strategy we have, even more back row. Judgement can be used to negate everything, crack down can steal important monsters, and secret village stops that all so annoying twin twister and lightning storm.  To get to your play we have a lot of draw cards, ranging from the spell book engine, allure of darkness, and metalfoes fusion along with the normal draws of Magicians' soul and soul servant to make sure you have your play makers.  Through testing the deck did have an issue though, it lack the ability to take out big untargetable boss monsters. As a non meta example we have something like Blue Eyes Chaos Max Dragon, since it have 4000 attack you can't beat it over with your main strat, since it's untargetable you can't banish it. So what's the out? In the main you would have 2 options, kaiju or borrelsword. These help beat over such troubling issues for the decks that can bring out those types of beasts. When going against decks specializing in this sort of boss the side deck includes cards such as Dark Ruler No More, and Super Poly to get rid of them.  Some choices that many be questioned is the inclusion of Destrudo as well as the synchro monsters.  While Destrudo himself has little synergy with the deck his ability to make the deck go beyond what it is already capable of can not be ignored. He can easily be used to fusion summon out Dragon knight to protect your back row and then go into a lv 7 synchro, be it either Arcanite to destroy cards or F.A. Dawn Dragster to negate cards the next turn. If these play are not an option and he ends up as a brick he will at least always serve as a target for allure of darkness."

I didn't count while playing with it on YGOPR","You will want to go first with this deck, but you can still get a pretty decent game when going second.  I made an example of a simple 2 card combo with this deck: https://youtu.be/RbjRPsH28m8 Of course, you can do a lot better with more cards, this is just a demonstration of the basic combo.  Going First: You should go after putting Plasma, Sunrise and Absolute Zero on the field and, if possible, set a Mask Change so you can replace the Absolute Zero with Acid (most times it's only possible if you have it on your opening hand, but some times you will be able to keep your normal summon for later and use Liquidman to summon Shadow Mist from the GY), cleaning the opponent's field when you need (if you don't get Mask Change, remember you still have Sunrise to protect your Plasma from an attack or even to banish your own Absolute Zero so the opponent won't have any monsters left, but please, avoid doing that second option). Depending on your hand, you won't be able to do that, but if that's the case, try going after putting Plasma and Dark Law, this way your opponent probably will only get rid of one of them by battling, which means you would survive the 2nd turn and can try to OTK on the 3rd, or they will totally brick, which most times means a win.  Going Second: You should go after putting Malicious Bane and Sunrise on the field, and, if the opponent has some really problematic monster effects, you should put Plasma too. Now you should decide if you are either going to clean the field with Malicious Bane or if you will go after Absolute Zero (if you have Mask Change, you will probably want to use Absolute Zero, since when you summon Acid you will also get rid of the opponent's spells). If your opponent has a deck that focuses on the GY, Absolute Zero probably won't be an option, since you will want to get Dark Law on the field too. If you are facing a monster that's unaffected by card effects and can't be destroyed, go after Trinity and Honest, deal the most damage you can, and if the opponent survives, try replacing Trinity with anything more useful for the next turns.  I like this profile the way it is and honestly, I think it shouldn't be changed, but here are some cards that can be changed: Ultra Polymerization, Monster Reborn, 1 of the 2 Sunrises (I run 2 because sometimes it can help assure that you will trigger its effect when attacked, but you still can change it with something else), Blast (but I DO recommend you to at least put it on the side deck, it can help you a lot when playing against Mystic Mine) and Core. You shouldn't change anything else.  Since many people make this mistake, here is a reminder: This is a combo deck, so you shall not put any hand traps on it. Having hand traps on this deck will increase the chances of you getting a bricked hand, also, this deck does have the power to OTK even if the opponent makes his perfect play (except if on a mirror match or against Mystic Mine since they both will block your game, but still, no hand traps)."

Uni-Zombie, Gozuki gives you fast access to everything you need. In theory you have 8 ways of getting Zombie World on the field. 3 Copies, Terra forming, Banshee, Uni-Zombie, Gozuki, Foolish Burial. Danger! allows for faster access to these cards and graveyard set-up. If a Zombie world is placed use any searcher to get Glow up in the graveyard to trigger its effect. The extra deck and most other cards are just for interruption and breaking boards. Superpoly is a great removal again with Zombie World. Vampire Sucker in theory, too. But most of the time use it to draw cards. Mezuki not been a once per turn allows for great swarming if the graveyard is properly filled. Staples can variate if preferred. My first deck list post, therefore it won't be the best but maybe you will like it."

Fortune Lady Every, Slacker Magician and Downerd Magician are in the Extra deck. The spells/traps in the deck are mostly for Fortune Lady cards with a few cards for Earthbound Immortal Aslla piscu. With the cards Sunny Pixie, Solitaire Magician and Fortune Lady Past the Xyz summoning of Slacker Magician and Downerd Magician is easier. The Xyz monster Slacker Magician gives a strong defence, where Downerd Magician can follow up with a strong offence. The more important spell/trap cards are Future Visions which can trigger Fortune Lady light's ability to special summon a Fortune Lady monster from your deck and Inherited Fortune which can special summon stronger Fortune Lady monsters. Tribute summoning Fortune Lady Water for Fortune Lady Dark is a good combo, where after destroying a monster can special summon Fortune Lady Water and allow you to draw two cards. The spells Time Passage and Synchro Boost are important early on for keeping Fortune Lady monsters alive, so they can gain strength during your standby phases. All the monsters are spellcasters, except for Earthbound Immortal Aslla Piscu, so cards like Solidarity, Yami and Dwimmered Path are good.

Gozaburo Kaiba is the crazy stepfather of Seto Kaiba. In the Virtual World Arc in season 3 of Yugioh Duel Monsters Gozaburo and Kaiba had a legendary grudge match and Gozaburo used a Exodia Necross Deck combined with elements from his Chess piece match against Kaiba. Gozaburo full deck wasn't shown, he only played a few cards so i used my own creativity and pulled from the new Exodia Support Yugioh Set Legendary Decks 2 to help build the deck. My anime themed character decks are NOT meant for Yugioh Official Tournament play, fun play only. The link below shows the legendary duel between Gozaburo Kaiba and Seto Kaiba so you can see why Gozaburo Kaiba's deck is built the way it is.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I7yu-B2_Bw&amp;t=75s  &nbsp;"

Oh boy, here we go. Using the popular Scrap engine, not only it can trigger the Meklord Emperor or search it, the board will end on a legit setup like Topologic Bomber with Gizmek Orochi in GY which also can trigger the Meklord Emperor. I will explain the Scrap setup combo.  Before starting, it is the best to search Emperor Wisel or place Meklord Fortress first. Your best card and main starter is Scrap Recycler. Normal summon Recycler, send O-Lion/Gizmek (prefer O-Lion so you dont have to pay Gizmek cost), link summon Wyvern, ss Recycler destroy Recycler, ss Golem destroy Fortress, search Emperor Wisel through Fortress destruction, ss Recycler using Golem, send Gizmek via Recycler again, link off Golem+Recycler+Wyvern for Bomber.  The rest of the cards are handtraps, extenders, or breaking board cards. MST/Twin can trigger Fortress. Phantazmay, Chaos Hunter, and Gizmek can be summoned during opponent's turn which if they destroy it with card effect, we can ss Emperor Wisel from hand.

Plus, the Grand Championship arc takes place right after Waking the Dragon arc. So, it is possible that Yugi had the cards he used in the GC arc during the events of Waking the Dragon.

You are guaranteed to end on six negates, if not more - and since card li","So we're nearing to the end of the month now - and that made me think, which doesn't happen quite often. As I lay on my mattress, I pondered over what new and interesting list I could make. What new, never-ever seen before strategy I could come up with in order to end January with a bang! So that's why today: we are making a deck that's been played for over 10 years! Infernity is one of the first ever decks that allowed you to end on crazy boards, using the same three cards over and over. They are in many people eyes the best archetype to come out of 5ds - understandably enough. It can end on crazy boards like borreload savage, two-three infernity barrier, one infernity break &amp; a 4-counter apollousa. And that is just with a simple hand. Open godly and you're guaranteed to get a solid 8 negates on board. Don't believe me? Then try this build out yourself and see exactly what I mean. So without wasting any more valuable time - here's the list:  If you have been living under a rock for roughly all of 2012 - Infernity is a deck centred around not-having card advantage..? Most of the infernity monsters truly pop-off when you don't have any cards in hand. This is crucial in the combo - meaning you want to get rid of your cards as fast as you can. That  is mostly why we run a 9 card danger engine. Saryuja really saves this deck - meaning you go into him as much as possible. Think of him as a magical mallet on Crack...down - if you don't open well enough, just keep resetting your hand until you do! The main cards you need for the combo are Avenger, Archfiend and Necromancer. What you essentially want to do is just keep bringing them back and slowly setting up negates. Before you consider setting up backrow, always see if you can create a Borreload Savage and Void-Ogre Dragon. If you play your cards - and know roughly what you're doing - this will be achievable with most hands. After you've used up your Infernity Launch, the way you get them back is Infernity Mirage. You should usually try and use his effect as much as possible - but once you've ran out of way to play him, you should do what you do best and synchro into Hundred Eyes Dragon. This allows you to keep spamming the effect of Mirage even after you cannot use him. Once you have used Infernity Archfiend's effect to the point where there are no more zones available for your trap disruptions - you can simply tune off the Necromancer and Avenger into Herald of arc light.  Besides that - there's not much to say about this build. It does it's job well and can play through some tough situations. You can side out Thousand-Eyes Restrict if you want to, as I mainly run it for situational filler and for the Clotheep combo that you sometimes opt for. This deck is a hard 8.7/10. It's very rare that you'll see this deck brick, and you can usually end on some crazy boards, but if you open incredibly poorly or simply don't have the knowledge to pilot this deck - you're in for an irritating time. This deck has been relevant for a while - and I can see why. Kalin is to this day one of the best characters introduced - and has an archetype that can practically achieve anything. I can see this deck being rogue for a long, <em>long, </em>time..."

Happ,"First off I'd like to congratulate Gabriel Netz for winning the WCQ Folkestone event. He played well and ran a rather <em>unusual </em>deck that seemed to work outstandingly well. The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch coming off the banlist was a huge and undoubtedly grave mistake on Konami's part - but hey, if more cool decks utilize it such as Lunalights for example - then who knows. Back to the subject at hand, for today's deck I have prepared a spicy and slightly different Train deck profile. I'd like to thank the man himself Thomas for managing to top with the deck despite one of its powerful engines being, to put it nicely, absolutely <em>slaughtered </em>by the banlist. My variation of the deck draws heavy inspiration from the deck itself - so there are a few similarities in that sense. Without further ado, here is my Choo Choo turbo deck:  Sky Striker was a very prominent engine in its prime time. Heck - Sky Striker Orcust made all of Top 8 at a YCS at one point. The reason it was so beneficial to <em>this</em> deck however, was the fact that it allowed a solid game plan going first - and opened up combos for OTK'ing turn 2. But, all is well as the deck has now been optimised to open your OTK no matter what the hand. To elaborate; Rank 10 Trains have always been able to break boards - but in today's newly developed meta, board breaking decks like Cyber Dragon have gotten a heavy boost. Many decks try to make a good board going first, allowing trains to establish enough damage for lethal almost every time. 42 cards may seem cloggy for a deck that wants to OTK, but since I run the Toon Package - the deck can technically be shortened to 39-38 cards. The toon package is also good for breaking boards. Many people usually set up an Apollousa in order to shut off monster effects. Since Megafleet isn't specific to just Cyber Dragon - you can use Toon Cyber Dragon to contact with use with an opponent's monster; giving you a free level 10 monster that can be used with Pegasus for your OTK, along with one your opponent's negates being gone. We also run Kaijus in this deck - meaning that if your opponent sets up a pesky monster that prevents you from summoning like Vanity's Fiend - you can simply get rid of it with a Jizukiru.  Other than that: the extra deck is pretty standard. The only thing that is set in stone are the Xyz ratios. Most of the link monsters are simply there to ensure your OTK: Pentestag, Underclock Taker, etc. A good card to consider running would be Landscaper Goldilocks. As of right now I can't really tell what the ratios or advantages of it are, but it is a free level 10 EARTH machine that allows you to nuke your opponent board.  In conclusion, I'd rate this a nice 8.4/10. It's very simple to pull off and doesn't take much skill - but can definitely pack-a-punch if needed. It's interesting to see if and how this deck will play in the upcoming format. It can be surprising at times - and is probably one of the first decks I know that can easily run a under 15 card extra deck and still top an event. Hopefully we'll see more decks like these come out on top - and hopefully our lord and savior Thomas will pull through and make a name for trains and rank 10's in general. It's definitely a surprise for your opponent when they see your deck - which can be helpful at times. The only things that are really holding this deck down, in my opinion, are stuff like going 1st and possibly wasting a handtrap on a card you don't know. Every deck has its flaws but I think that this build will surely see a lot more play to come in the future..."

First of all, this Deck can only uses his full combo potentioal when you go second.  Your main goal/stradegy with this deck is to wipe your opponents field with cards like Frightfur Tiger/Kraken, than summon Sabre-Tooth out of it, to finally hit your opponent with an full OTK combo.  Like for example, a good combo would be, to summon Kraken, destroy a monster, summon Sabre-Tooth out of it, special summon Kraken again, destroy another Monser if you will/need, use that one Sabre-Tooth to fusion another Sabre-Tooth out of it and than, for the finishing blow (when needed), summon a Frightfur Wolf with Frightfur Fusion with all the monster in your GY to let him attack multiple times, so that you opponet don't have a chance to survive this.  Nibiru is in there to hinder your opponent to make an ""to good"" board in his Main Phase, while Super Poly deals with those nasty untargetalbe/indestructable cards, which Fluffals have sort of an problem with. Called by the grave is in there to prevent Hand-Traps and helps your combos/searches to get through."

The main goal of the deck is to get out the three key players of the Extra Deck as quickly as possible: Aromaseraphy Jasmine, <span>Aromaseraphy Sweet Majoram, and Aromaseraphy Rosemary. We will go over the Main Deck, Extra Deck, and Side Deck to see what each card does and how this deck essentially works.</span>  <strong>MAIN DECK MONSTERS</strong>  <strong>Aromage Jasmine</strong>  One of the many Aromage Plant cards in this archetype, Jasmine serves as an important starter for the deck. Even with a measly 100 attack (ATK) points, this card's main strength is to get advantage from your LP gain. When you gain LP, Jasmine lets you draw a card, an instant +1 in hand advantage. Not just this, but you have more LP than the opponent, Jasmine allows an additional normal summon of a Plant monster for the turn, allowing you to pop off with their plays. We run three of Jasmine to make sure we can get as much card advantage as possible.  <strong>Aromage Laurier</strong>  Another important card that helps you gain advantage is Laurier. While you have more LP than the opponent, Laurier can Special Summon itself, a +1 in field presence. When it leaves the field, you gain 500 LP, which can trigger all Aromage monsters on the field, including Aromage Jasmine. We run this at three to get this advantage.  <strong><span>Aromaseraphy </span> Angelica </strong>  This is our turner for the deck. Unfortunately, nothing special happens when you summon this card; that is reserved for cards like Aromage Jasmine. So what do you do with this card? Simple. If you have an Aromage monster with ATK points in your Graveyard (GY), you can discard this card to gain LP equal to that monster's ATK. You can actually activate this card during your opponent's turn, so you can devastate your opponent with Aromages on your field. Not just this, but while it is in the GY, you can just bring it back to the field for free (while the you have higher LP and an Aromage on field). Sadly, it banishes itself from the field if you use this effect, so we run three. So, be efficient with your Angelicas! (We don't run Angelica at three because of this effect; it's a really good card. That's why.)  <strong>Aromage Rosemary/Aromage Majoram</strong>  This section covers two combo pieces. Essentially, these are the pawns of our deck, and the others are like rooks or bishops. First, Rosemary is not important for its effect but rather to special summon its Extra Deck counterpart, Aromaseraphy Rosemary.  Majoram is the same. One changes battle positions, and the other banishes cards from your opponents GY. Although Majoram has the better effect, it is a level 5. How unfortunate. Not much said can be said about these cards, so we run them at 1. Of course, we don't run them at 2 or 3 because we can run the risk of them getting banished. We are just that amazing.  <strong>Evil Thorn</strong>  Now we go to the staples of our deck. Yes, Jasmine is a good starter card, but Evil Thorn just trumps her in every aspect of the word. When it tributes itself, 300 LP are inflicted to your opponent. Already, you have higher LP than your opponent. The Aromage gods are pleased. Not just this, but you can Special Summon two copies of this card from your deck. You are now set up to Special Summon Aromaseraphy Jamsine. Congradulations. Always get to this card. It's a must. This card's only weakness is if you have two or three in your hand. Most unfortunate. Other than that, this card is the safe haven of the deck.  <strong>Lonefire Blossom</strong>  Lonefire Blossom, Tour Guide from the Underworld, and Deep Sea Diva. What do these three cards have in common? Exactly. They're generic. Lonefire Blossom is in a sense the king of Plant staples, aside from Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio. You get any Plant from your deck for free. Having three of this is undisputable.  <strong>Cactus Bouncer</strong>  This card is better for the middle or near end portion of the game when you have your board set up already. This card acts like a walking Vanity's Emptiness, only that it doesn't destroy itself when a card goes to the GY. This card is a one-of. Even if it's a great card that stops the opponent from Special Summoning, it doesn't make advantage. You can run two or three if you like, but one is a good number for this card to be at.  <strong>Glow-Up Bulb</strong>  The god of tuners. The OCG was right to ban this. It Special Summons itself from the GY by milling a card from the Main Deck! But we are not running Crystron Needlefiber in this deck, are we? No way. We are trying to keep this deck as fair as possible (aside from Cactus Bouncer and Naturia Beast). This is a one-of.  <strong>Spore</strong>  This is not as good as Glow-Up Bulb, but it Special Summons itself from the GY as well, just by banishing another Plant for the GY. We run this at one because of it's once per Duel effect and its sheer circumstantial use.  <strong>MAIN DECK SPELLS</strong>  <strong>Aroma Garden</strong>  Other than Laurier, these archetype based cards can help you gain LP for your Aromage cards to benefit from. One of these is Aroma Garden.  Not only do you gain 500 LP and have your Aromages gain 500 ATK/Defense (DEF), but whenever one of your Aromages is destroyed and sent to the GY, you gain 1000 LP. This is certainly a beneficial card and a three-of.  <strong>Aroma Gardening</strong>  This card is all not to different from Garden. You gain 1000 LP like Garden, but it's when you summon an Aroma monster. And even when your time seems dire and you can't seem to get going in your combo, Gardening protects you from a battle. When your opponent declares an attack while you have less LP, Gardening summons an Aroma from the Deck. The 1000 LP effect still triggers from this, making this a very useful card. A three-of is this card, too.  <strong>Cauldron of the Old Man</strong>  While not an Aroma card, this continuous Spell gives you 500 LP with every counter it has. As long as your opponent doesn't have something like Twin Twisters, you can keep this card on the field to gain as much LP as this card's counters can give. As for the burn effect, it doesn't exist. Just ignore it. We run this at three, but you can switch it for other cards if you want.  <strong>Super Solar Nutrient</strong>  Time for the spicy tech. Thanks to Duel Links, this card has become popularized for how it can be used to get Plant monsters, including Evil Thorn. THAT'S RIGHT! Just as long as you tribute a level (LVL) 1 or 2 Plant monster, like Aromage Jasmine, you can dig for any Plant monster whose level is less than or equal to the monster you tribute +3. This is a three-of. It is such an amazing tech card.  <strong>Called by the Grave</strong>  Now you listen to me. You, the player, are playing a combo deck. What does this mean? Any hand trap (that's a monster) can just ruin your combo in a heartbeat, like Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. How do we prevent this? Called by the Grave. This is at three for obvious reasons.  <strong>One for One/Terraforming/Monster Reborn</strong>  Three staples are here to fill in space. One for One gets Evil Thorn, Terraforming gets Garden, and Monster Reborn gets a monster from either player's GY. Plain and simple. Exchange these for other cards if you so please.  <strong>MAIN DECK TRAPS</strong>  <strong>Blessed Winds/Humid Winds</strong>  We run these two traps because they can be searched off of Aromaseraphy Sweet Majoram. We will get to her later. Blessed is the more important one, since you can send a plant from your hand/field to the GY  OR  shuffle a plant from your GY to the Deck to gain 500 LP  as well as  pay 1000 LP to Special Summon any Aroma from the GY to your side of the field. Humid searches an Aroma card for 1000 LP and gives you 500 LP if you are losing in the LP fight. We run these at 1. We don't run Dried Winds because that card is highly dependent and sucky.  <strong>EXTRA DECK</strong>  <strong>Aromaseraphy Jasmine</strong>  This is where the magic happens. Jasmine is truly our juggernaut of the deck, and possibly can be compared to Sweet Majoram in terms of awesomeness. After using Evil Thorn to summon this card, you have the power to protect your PLANT monsters as long as your LP are higher than your opponents. Not only this, but when you tribute a monster Jasmine points do, you can dig up for any Plant monster. Eat your heart out, Lonefire Blossom! Also, when you gain LP, search for a Plant monster. It's generic stature make this card a 2-3 of, but we run this at 3 to capture its full potential.  <strong>Aromaseraphy Sweet Majoram</strong>  This is possibly the heart and soul of the deck, other than Aromaseraphy Jasmine and Evil Thorn. When she is Synchro Summoned, you search Blessed or Humid (usually you want to get Blessed). If you have more LP, your opponent cant target your Plant monsters. If that isn't awesome enough, if you gain LP, you pop a card on your opponent's field. Simple, yet effective. Despite this card's awesomeness, we run two to leave room for generic synchro monsters.  <strong>Aromaseraphy Rosemary</strong>  Although not as profound as Sweet Majoram or Jasmine, Aromaseraphy Rosemary can still be effective by negating a face-up card when you gain LP. She also gives your Aroma monsters 500 ATK/DEF to make sure they are harder to beat in battle. With this, and the two other key players, you are bound to have a pretty strong board.  <strong>Generic Synchros/Links</strong>  The rest of the Extra Deck is filled with cards that don't really fit with our combo and just here because they are easy/beneficial to make. Since the effects and reasons for these cards are self-explanatory, they don't get their own section. They are just really effective and versatile cards that many people put in their decks as placeholders or offensive playmakers.  <strong>SIDE DECK</strong>  <strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>  Although a combo deck itself, Aromas might meet their match with another of their own, such as @Ignister or D/D/D. Nibiru is a three-of in the Side Deck to prevent these combo decks from getting a lot of advantage.  <strong>Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood</strong>  Some or many Aroma players have this card in the Main Deck, which is understandable. It fits with the Aroma gimmick. However, in many of my match-ups, this card just sits in my hand. I never really had a good time to activate its effect, but maybe I'm just bad at timing. You can play this card if you want, but I still am debating whether I should keep this card or not. We leave this card at three in the Side Deck for the time being.  <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>  This card is amazing to counter Stun and backrow heavy decks, such as Guru Control and Altergeists. Red Reboot going to one devastated me because I feared Altergeists moving to the meta and becoming competitive. I never have good match-ups with them, and I always get squashed. We have this card at three to counter these types of decks.  <strong>Twin Twisters</strong>  This is another card that destroys backrow decks or bait out counter traps, such as Salamangreat Roar. It also pitches a card that can float in the GY, like Glow-Up Bulb. I might move this to the Main Deck, but we leave this card at three in the Side Deck.  <strong>Infinite Impermanence </strong>  Say your opponent hits Infinite Impermanence on your Aromage Jasmine. Well I say fight fire with fire. This card will always be a good card going second, and we run this card at three in the Side Deck to commemorate its awesomeness.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Using <em>Magicians' Souls</em> you can send the Weather Painter spells or traps either in your hand or on the field to the graveyard to draw 2 cards. If you control <em>Weather Painter Cloud</em> when this effect happens, and you send canvases on the field to the grave; <em>you can immediately get those canvas' (or any other in your grave if you'd like) back</em> - <strong><em>making Souls a free +1 or +2 gain in card advantage</em>. </strong>  In addition to that, Souls can also help worse Painter hands by putting a free body onto the field, which in a pinch can be used to tribute for <em>Aurora</em> if you have no other better options available to get a Canvas on the field - or as link material for one of the <em>Topologics</em> or <em>Borrelsword</em>.  <em>Pot of Extravagance</em> is also there for additional draw power in cases where you don't see Souls. The two sometimes tend to clash since you can't use both in the same turn, but the extra boosted consistency you get is, in my opinion, worth it since chances are you may not see 1 of your 3 Souls in your opening hand. Or alternatively you can pitch the Extravagance with Souls when needed. Having both is nice, but if you had to choose one - Souls is by far the better singular option in this deck. Feel free to run 3 of whatever handtrap suits you if you'd like to replace Extravagance.  <em>Apprentice Illusion Magician</em> is the usual garnet. If drawn it serves the same purpose on field as souls for being potential tribute fodder for Aurora when need, or as link material.  The rest of the deck is pretty straightforward: <em>Imperial Order</em> shuts down spells, <em>Anti-Spell</em> for a pseudo Imperial Order (and can be used well in tandem with <em>Rain Canvas</em> for continued freezing of said spells), <em>Rivalry of Warlords</em> because other than Souls all the main deck monsters are Fairy (and works pretty dang well against decks with more than once monster type like <strong><em>Spyral</em></strong>), <em>Evenly Matched</em> because this deck can struggle against established boards going second, and <em>Skill Drain</em> because universal monster effect negation that rarely applies to yourself because Painters banish themselves for cost is very, very useful.  Side deck is pretty standard. <em>Niberu</em> and <em>Gadarla</em> for going second removal (any kaiju is fine, but I like it for dealing with the occasional anti-meta Barrior of the Storm Winds lockdown decks). Twin Twisters for backrow removal -Lightning Storm also works, but I'm not a fan of it's restrictions (or the price tag). <em>Drowning Mirror Force</em> for secondary removal since your painters banish for cost and can leave you open for direct attack a lot. <em>Aurora Pattern</em> works well against decks that like to do a lot of individual searching, and is highly searchable and accessible itself which means no more than 1 is needed. <em>Dimensional Fissure</em> and <em>Macro Cosmos</em> to prevent your opponent from abusing their graveyards. And <em>Unending Nightmare</em> as it's non once per turn face up backrow destruction works very well against control based decks - True Dracos and Altergeist especially."

With the number of different stall cards available in the deck, dream clown can usually get off at least one effect kill most of the time.

Introduction</strong>  <strong>II. Strategy</strong>  <strong>III. Matchups</strong>  <strong>IV. Advices, grinding and so</strong>  <span><strong>I. Introduction</strong></span>  Wait, Pure Kaiju really exists? Well, if i´m making this of course they do, but... They work alone? Surprisingly yes, and very well to say the least, and you may be asking... How can someone be so cruel to make this kind of Deck? Well, me, and maybe you will want to try it you little sadist.  <span><strong>II. Strategy</strong></span>  Yes, i know the Introduction thing was pretty short but i don´t think this kind of Deck needs a long introduction, anyways, first of all, yes, the Deck has strategy, but not the kind of in-game strategy you may be thinking, , althrough it has a pretty simple PlayStyle (which isn´t the same thing as Strategy.) the part where it get complex is at the Mind Games, and no, tributing your opponent´s monsters can be annoying, but they can overrun you easily if you don´t intimidate them, how you do so? Well, playing Mind Games is hard, and even more when playing in Online, anyways, some basic examples of Mind Gaming is constantly checking your set cards, counting your opponent summon out loud and so on, also, and getting away from Mind Games this is the part where you just dump all the Strategy and Mind Games and have Luck, what i´m reffering to? I´m reffering to going first, you better hope you draw into Fairy Tail - Luna, Super Polymerization and/or some Handtraps, Luna can be a somewhat decent interruption during your opponent´s turn (Also remember to always activate Luna´s search effect to bait Ash, because her bounce effect can be Ashed since it sends from Deck to GY.) Super Polymerization explains by itself and Ash Blossom and/or Nibiru can win you certain Matchups, and talking about Matchups...  <span><strong>III. Matchups</strong></span>  Surprisingly enough, the Deck has a decent Matchup against a lot of Deck (Although is pretty obvious why...) It can also play around a lot of negates and Handtraps (Since most of them don´t hurt the Deck in any way.) also i´m gonna put Handtraps and some generic cards played in the format (Although they may be pretty outdated.) regardless this section is called <strong>Matchups </strong>and no <strong>Matchups and random cards</strong>...  Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - Use Luna´s first effect to bait Ash since Ashing Slumber can hurt you severely (Either it´s summon effect or it´s search effect (Although remember that if Slumber is negated you can activate another copy of it.).) Kyoutou, although a decent Ash bait you almost never get to activate it (I´m considering to cut it out entirely.)  D.D. Crow - Similar to Ash it stops Slumber effect (Although they have to chain it to Slumber being sent to GY and not his activation.) otherwise useless.  Effect Veiler/Infinite Impermanence - Since Denko Sekka and Luna are the only important Normal Summons (Since you almost never get to activate your Kaiju effects.) they normally get veilered/impermanenced , if you really need the Luna´s search effect (Although you normally don´t) you can Chain Block it with her own effect (Only works going second btw.) If you´re playing against some Set 6 pass Deck they will normally Veiler/Impermanence Sekka (Although Control/Stun Players have the magical ability called ""cartearse"" here in Argentina to always draw outs to Sekka if you draw her.) otherwise, also useless.  Evenly Matched - Since the only out to Evenly is Red Reboot (Which got limited for some reason...) You need to be very careful with all your Sets, if you´re unlucky and have to choose between Luna and Super Poly always choose Super Poly (Unless your current Matchup is Super Poly inmune) but normally if they´re Anti-Super Poly they´re extremely Normal Summon dependant (Doesn´t apply to Dracos  or Pendulums btw.)  Some other cards that my annoy you are Lancea, Droll &amp; Lock Bird and similar cards, anyways and going with Matchups...  Subterror - Kaiju Guru, also you´re Floodgate inmune since TCBOO doesn´t affect you at all (And you can only have 1 Kaiju in the field at the time.) The Solemn Package becomes pretty useless after you get your Kaiju, Subterror Clash Battle can annoy you a bit with all the flipping and that but Jizukiru and/or Thunder King can take care of that.  Altergeist - A pretty hard Matchup (And pretty prominent sadly.) If you are unlucky enough to play against this Deck you will need to remove their Multifaker and/or Meluseek as fast as possible since Meluseek can become a horrible problem by herself, the best thing you can do is try to Outgrind them (Although that is pretty hard by itself.) or Run a lot (A lot.) of Spell/Trap removal, they will also force you to go first if you get to win the first game and the Side Deck has few to zero outs to their field (The deck was pretty rushed so the Side Deck can be pretty wonky.)  SPYRAL - Just like almost all combo wombo Decks it is extremely vulnerable to your Kaijus, i mean, if you get to draw into Jizukiru or Thunder King you only need to Kaiju Sleeper (Since it can´t be destroyed by card effects when equipped with GEAR (Forgot his name :p.).) if you don´t, you Kaiju Sleeper (Again) and Slumber them, from there they will have almost no recovery options, When they force you to go first just side all your Sekka´s copies off and all your Nibiru copies in, some Anti-SPYRAL techs should do the job.  Lunalight Time Thief - IDK if this is considered a Tier 1 Deck but i´ll put it here regardless, It´s pretty funny when in Game 1 your opponent makes Dweller and they activate his effect only to get Kaijued a few second later, Imperial Order isn´t <strong>that</strong> of a threat to this Deck at all and Nightmare can be easily run over, IDK if most Lunalight Time Thief End Boards have Spell/Trap negation at all (From my experience they usually don´t.) but if they don´t just Slumber they away (Obviously i´m talking as if you had it, you aren´t gonna draw it every single game.) as almost every Deck in this list they will make you go First in second Duel, also from my experience if you activate Luna´s effect when they summon Kaleido Chick it will hinder them for the rest of the turn<a data-name=""."">.</a>  Salamangreat - Another somewhat easy Matchup for you, since their End Boards have become a lot weaker since Miragestallio ban you can easily disrupt them going First or Second, Luna (Yes, i´m mentioning this card in almost all Matchups advices but is in fact your only decent Normal Summon.) can bounce whatever they Summon and leave them with an open field (Fun Fact: Luna´s effect isn´t HOPT.) Cosmic Cyclone Salamangreat Sanctuary and hinder they grind ability a lot, (Always save Ash for Gazelle, his Lavalval Chain style effect is more important than ever.) If you ask me, i don´t think Salamangreats will be the Tier 1 that won almost all Continentals ever again.  Orcust - Are Orcust still META? Well, i don´t know, but they´re still as annoying as they were Pre-Banlist, as you can´t really Outgrind them (Since the Deck doesn´t have an actual Grind.) you will need to hinder their plays to a level where they can´t play anymore, try to banish Knightmare/Golem (You might wanna add D.D. Crow for this) and/or Ash Recycler (Ogre on Scrap Wyvern helps a lot.)  True Draco - As well as Orcust, they received big hits but are still alive, they´re one of the easiest Matchups since most of their Floodgates don´t work on you and their access to most of these is really limited now, and luckily it doesn´t matter what version of Draco they´re playing, if you duel Draco Hakai/Unchained just ""outgrind"" them until they burn out all of their Unchained, after that is just a matter of time, if they play Pure Dracos then do the same and wait until they burn all of their Spell/Traps and since you don´t normally activate effects they don´t get to search almost anything at all.  Pendulums - For this Matchup you will want to Side out Sekka, hope you draw into Super Poly or some Kaijus, Luna can get rid of Jackal King (IDK if he negated Monster Effects or it was Mighty Master or if you couldn´t target it at all.)  <span><strong>IV. Advices, grinding and so</strong></span>  The other part was long uh? Well, i though it was necessary (Also i love writing :v.) finally, lets talk about the Deck ""Grind"" game, but you may be thinking... Why grind in quotes? Well, if you playtest the Deck a bit you will understand that it only gives you the sensation of grinding, why? Well, it burns resources <strong>so</strong> slowly that it seems like a White Star, it burns so slowly that it seems that will never burn out, and in fact, is pretty hard to run out of Kaijus, but in reality, you never get to recycle your Kaijus (And Luna´s effect is looping, not recycling.) If you get a card that can recycle the Kaijus (Gonna add Pot of Avarice later.) then it will help a lot! And talking about advices...  Always end your turn with atleast 1 card in your hand, why? When your opponent knows that he is playing against a Pure Kaiju Deck they will go and try to OTK you, because although it seems logical to say that Kaijus are the Boss Monsters, the true Boss is fear, the fact that whatever board they make (Unless they end on Diabolos.) will get tributed will make them go for and OTK (Sorry for repeating what i say.) burning their resources to avoid the Kaijus, in fact, you should use that for your advantage, if they try to kill you and don´t accomplish that they will have a lot of cards in their GY, slowly grinding them out for what they have left.  That sums all things you should know about this deck, and although they were only 2 advices i couldn´t think in any more of then.  PD: Sorry if i have bad English, i´m not a native speaker."

Record ratio of this competitve deck.  -Salamangreat: 2 Wins/2 Losses (Debatable) -Thunder Dragons: 3 Wins (Beaten/or Surrender) -Altergeist: 4 Wins (Beaten) -DANGER!: 3 Wins (Beaten/or Surrender) -Trickstar: 3 Wins (Surrender) -SPYRALS: 3 Wins (Surrender) -Exodia Stall: 2 Wins (Surrender) -Chain Burn Stall: 4 Wins (Surrender) -Darklords: 2 Wins (Surrender) -Blackwings: 3 Wins (Surrender) -Blue Eyes: 2 Wins (Beaten) -Orcust: 5 Wins (Beaten/or Surrender) -Red Eyes/Dragun: 4 Wins (Beaten/or Surrender) -Dinos: 2 Wins (Surrender) -Cyber Dragons: 2 Wins (Beaten/or Surrender) -Zombie World: 3 Wins (Surrender) -Destiny/Elemental/Masked Heroes: 6 Wins (Surrender) -Sky Strikers: N/A (Has Not Dueled Yet) -Other: 25 Wins (Beaten/or Surrender)  The strategy set-up is easy and simple to understand. Dont need to break it down. Thoroughly I been testing it out and made this deck competitive enough to be played in the metagame. Do not switch out anything unless its for an alternative/replacement tech.  TECH: Shared Ride can replace Soul Servant. Magician Navigation could replace Illusion Magic but I would not recommend it. Super Polymerization could/can replace Timaeus, depending on your preference choice. Crack down could be replaced by Brain Control but its not needed in my honest opinion. Solemn Judgment could be replaced with any negate cards of your preference choice.  SIDE NOTE: DECK CAN COMPETE AND THIS IS BASICALLY A REUPLOAD BUT UPDATED WITH BETTER CARDS.

This deck can also abuse Super Polymerization, which makes it better against aggro decks, it also uses Instant Fusion as a enabler for a quick Dragostapelia.  There is an easy combo that starts with only one Ophrys Scorpio and another monster on hand, which leads to Winda Lock, Special Darlingtonia via Ophrys, add Instant Fusion, make Cherubini, then go for Winda via Instant Fusion.  The Predaplant core itself is kinda heavy but Consistent, with 3 Ophrys and 3 Lonefire you have a Consistency ratio of around 55%, not counting the triple Predapractice.

A single Union Hangar can easily be a board with ABC + Infinity. Super cons","Both Cyber Dragon and ABC parts are light machine, with the new card Malefactors' Command, you can extend to ABC from Cyber Dragon starter while maintaining consistent summoning of Cyber Dragon Infinity. Not only that, thanks to Union Driver, now you can turn one Union Hangar into ABC + Infinity (only works in MR5, TCG will be in MR5 once we got all the cards). I will explain the Hangar route.  Activate Hangar, add A or B, normal summon A/B, equip Driver via Hangar, use Driver equip A/B (you need both A &amp; B on the field), ss the equip, link off both to Union Carrier, use B search C, use A recycle B (now you have 2 light machine in hand, B &amp; C), use Carrier equip Photon Orbital, use Orbital search Galaxy Soldier, ss Soldier using B/C as fodder, search another Soldier using previous one, ss second Soldier using B/C as fodder, now you have 2 lv5 + Carrier + ABC parts in GY just from one Hangar.  Other route is using Malefactor if you dont have Hangar but it needs more extender/fodder and also needs practice how to get the most advantage of it. In summary, your best card is Hangar followed by A/B + Malefactor. The Cyber Dragon lineup is just for contact fusing or extender/fodder.  Card to think of: Gizmek Yata (great lv 5 light machine extender, but limits you from summoning other type), Gold/Silver Gadget (great for link/rank4 play, but fragile with Impermanence/Veiler), Transmodify (good card esp with Gizmek Yata, but eats too much resource and space in the deck), Danger! (easy Union Carrier and increasing consistency, but still a gamble and the monster is not light machine for Malefactor or Soldier fodder), Pot of Avarice (great card, but dead in early turn).  Pros: Super consistent with Infinity negation and ABC disruption/recurrence with minimal resource makes it arguably tied with Salamangreat, can run multiple handtraps/removals.  Cons: Nibiru, Dark Ruler No More, Megafleet, and etc are a scary threat, Hangar combo doesnt work in MR4.  PS: Union Hangar combo thanks to <span class=""username-2b1r56 username-3gJmXY"">Nighthawk</span><span class=""discriminator-xUhQkU"">#5409 @Discord </span>"

One with the power to rival the Egyptian Gods themselves.,"<span>A friend of mine wanted to try and get back into the game and wanted to play ancient gears, so I started trying to build a list for him. This is what I have found to be the most effective 40 card deck in my time testing. This is not designed to be a competitive deck, but is rather meant to be fun at a casual level and fun to play.</span>  <span>This deck, much like other OTK decks, is designed to go second. The goal of the deck is to get out Chaos Ancient Gear Giant, or Megaton Ancient Gear Golem, as quick as possible.</span>  <span>This is the most optimal hand for going First or Second. Depending on which will change some things</span> <ul>  	<li><span>If you start with one Gadget + Anchor Drill + Wyvern</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Normal Summon Gadget (either one works) -&gt; Special Summon Anchor Drill -&gt; Special summon Wyvern -&gt; Search -&gt;</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Search Fortress -&gt; Activate Fortress -&gt; Link 2 (Anchor Drill + Wyvern) -&gt; Ballistic Shooter -&gt; Search -&gt;</span> <ul>  	<li><span> Search Geartown -&gt; Activate Gear Town -&gt; Effect of Ballistic Shooter (Your opponent must control a face up monster that can be targeted by monsters) -&gt; Pop Geartown -&gt; Special Summon from deck -&gt;</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Special Summon Reactor Dragon</span> <ul>  	<li><span>End of chain</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Special Summon Hunting Hound -&gt; Effect of Hunting Hound -&gt; Fusion Summon -&gt;</span> <ul>  	<li><span>If you went first Fusion Summon Megaton</span> <ul>  	<li><span>End of chain</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>if you went second Fusion Summon Chaos Giant</span> <ul>  	<li><span>End of Chain</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Special Summon Gear Frame -&gt; Discard 1 Card to Search -&gt;</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Search Ancient Gear Golem -&gt; Surrender because you misclicked </span></li>  	<li><span> Search Ancient Gear Fusion -&gt; Fusion Summon if you have stuff in hand</span> <ul>  	<li><span>End of Chain</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <span> </span>  <span>Why is X Card Run At X Number:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Super Express Bullet Train - He is a free summon that lets you recover one card from your graveyard at the end of your turn, which has the ability to trigger the effect of box giving you free access to one of your infinitrack monsters for graveyard set up. You can link him away for Ballistic Shooter or Platinum Gadget if you need more gears.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2 because it can brick if you have nothing to summon, or only have gadgets.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon - Big boy that can be special summoned</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 2 because the only reason to summon him is because you want to special summon a bigger fusion, or for discard fodder for Gear Frame. He tends to brick a bit so it may be better to take him down to one.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Golem - You need him for some of the fusions and if you manage to tribute summon him using (weather through Urgent Schedule or the effect of Geartown to make it one tribute) you can fusion summon from your deck using Ancient Gear Fusion.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 2 since he can be used as discard fodder for Gear Frame or if you get to summon him off the effect of Howitzer or Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Tunneller - Pot of Avarice is at one and this guy is searchable.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run two, but three could also be good if you don't want to run Trencher. He can be summoned by sending an earth machine monster you control (which is almost anything that isn't in the extra deck or a gadget) that can be sent to the graveyard as link fodder for either Ballistic Shooter or Platinum Gadget for free summons/ searches. You can then use him to recycle your graveyard full of fusion materials then draw cards which can give you that one card you need to win.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Trencher - He is another target for Box and if he is in the grave you can summon back Anchor Drill for a free summon from the hand.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 1. You only want to see him when he is needed, plus he is searchable off box or you can summon him with Urgent Schedule with Anchor Drill to conserve your normal summon.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Anchor Drill - Free summon if he is normal or special summoned.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 3. Earth machine that lets you special summon another earth machine (Of any level) which can be used for link fodder for Ballistic Shooter or Platinum Gadget. He is also searchable off of Box and can be brought out with Urgent Schedule.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Wyvern - The one that searches.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 3. While you have to put in a little work to summon him, he gives you free access to any card you could possibly want that has to do with the archetype aside from Geartown. He searches box which lets him search for anything that isn't a spell or Gadget. He also gets around monster effects to beat over Eater Of Millions. He can be summoned off of Urgent Scedule as well. You can't go wrong with this card. Just avoid using your normal summon on him if you can as there are better options for that.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Gold + Silver Gadget - Free summon of another level 4 or lower monster in your hand.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2 of each. It hurts to see any more than 2 of them at any given time. They aren't earth which prevents them from being usable with Urgent Schedule and can't be summoned off of Anchor Drill. They require your normal summon to use them at all. But they can help with starting off your plays and can be somewhat annoying to your opponent if they try to run them over, only to be walled by a never ending waterfall of gears. Be careful about timing though for their effects.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Frame - Search the brick or the fusion spell</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2, may bump down to 1. He is searchable off of Box and lets you search the fusion spell while setting up your graveyard. The problem is there isn't an easy way to get him on the board without popping Geartown or Fortress. He is also another Ancient Gear monster that can be used as fusion material. He can also search the Golem. If you are unable to afford Ancient Gear Fusion then only run 1.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Box - Searchable searcher that searches when searched</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 2 or 3. I thought he would be a brick at first, but he ended up being way better than I thought he would be. While you do need to use the effect of Wyvern or Ballistic Shooter he more than makes up for it by letting you search out Tunneller, Trencher, Anchor Drill, or Gear Frame. This gives you easy access to the Infinitrack cards whenever you need. He is also discard fodder for Gear Frame, and is a free summon for the Lv 5 Infinitrack monsters in a pinch or for the link summon of Ballistic Shooter and Platinum Gadget.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Hunting Hound - The one that lets you play around Anti-Spell Fragrance</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2, run more or less as needed. While he can be used to cowboy for game in time. What he is really great for is allowing you to get around things that would stop you from fusion summoning. Needs to be on the field to use this effect, but there are a good amount of ways to do that without normal summoning. </span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Overload Fusion - Summons the boss monster or the one that burns for 1000</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2. It's a good card that can be great in a pinch. Fusion summoning from your graveyard is always great. While this card is strong, you need to save it for the final push. If you use it too early then you could empty out your graveyard of Ancient Gear Monsters preventing you from using the effect of Tunneller. It also only lets you summon dark machine fusion monsters which limits you to only Chaos Giant and Howitzer.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Iron Draw - Pot of greed with restrictions</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. It is really situational, but it can help near the end of the turn when you get out the fusion and link monster of your choice. It can let you get more spell cards ready for next turn.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Catapult - Galaxy Cyclone but only on face up cards you control that lets you summon any Ancient gear, then lets you do the same again but summon a token instead.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. This card is great if you have the targets right away. This card can only be used if you control no monsters and requires you to destroy a face up card you control (Geartown or Fortress) then summon ANY Ancient Gear monster. Including Golem. If used on Geartown or Fortress this is two free summons. It also has a graveyard effect that lets you banish it to pop a face up card you control (Geartown or Fortress) to summon a token. If used on Geartown or Fortress it's a free summon and a token that is an earth machine. The problem is you need to have no monsters and one of those two cards already on the board. It has its benefits but is too hard to use.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Fusion - It's like Polymerization but more expensive</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Use any number you want. It's an archetype fusion spell that is searchable from Wyvern and Gear Frame. It has a neat effect if you can get out Ancient Gear Golem, but if you are confident enough to normal summon Ancient Gear Golem you won't even need to fusion summon. It without a doubt is a great inclusion, but don't worry if you can't afford it.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Terraforming - Its a 3rd Geartown that makes this essentially a 39 card deck.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 1 because that's the law. It makes Geartown even more searchable and is deck thinning.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Urgent Schedule - This card is only really usable going second. But it can save you easily.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 3 because 4 is illegal. This is a free two monster from your deck that doesn't require a normal summon. Plus if it is destroyed while face down you get to  search Super Express Bullet Train. How I would recommend to use it would be: </span> <ul>  	<li><span>For the level 4 or lower summon any of the earth monsters. It really doesn't matter which so long as you leave Box in the deck. I would most likely summon Wyvern. But be careful not to activate its effect as it is a hard once per turn</span></li>  	<li><span>For the level 5 or higher depends a lot on the current game state. If you have one card you want in your graveyard such as Box or Wyvern summon Super Express Bullet Train to return it to the had at the end of the turn he was sent there. Want to recover your extra deck or main deck, summon Tunneller for a pot of avarice in the graveyard. Want one more ancient gear for a fusion summon, use Reactor Dragon.</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Fortress - They can't Super Poly you now.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run 3. It protects your Ancient Gear monsters from being targeted or destroyed by card effects. Most Ancient Gear monsters already have some sort of protection from spell and traps that is only limited to the battle phase, but this turns your Boss monsters into nearly impenetrable walls. This card can also be popped in order to summon an ancient gear from your hand or graveyard allowing you to search with Wyvern without using your normal summon.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Geartown - The field spell</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2. This card lest you summon Ancient Gear Monsters for one less tribute. This means you only need one monster to perish so you can summon the Golem. The real reason you run it is to pop it with cards like Ballistic Shooter or Ancient Gear Catapult in order to summon any Ancient Gear monster from your deck, except Golem. This allows you to get a free search off Wyvern while conserving your normal summon, or to get Gear Frame on board to get the fusion spell. While you could run more, I prefer to run deck thinning options like Terraforming in order to keep this deck to 40 cards. Plus being searchable by the the link monster makes it so I almost never need to see it in my opening hand.</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <span> </span>  <span>Extra Deck Monsters:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Barricadeborg Blocker - Retrieve your cards.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. He lets you recover Geartown or Fortress from your graveyard. Just remember he does this at the end of the turn.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Ballistic Shooter - The link that searches the field spell and more</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Run at least 2. He can be summoned using any of the Ancient Gear or Infinitrack monsters. Its weird arrows also allow you to summon this to the zone a link monster points to and still have 2 extra monster zones. He also has the ability to search any Ancient Gear card or Geartown, making him already more useful than Wyvern. On top of this you can pop a face up spell /trap card you control (Geartown or Fortress) in order to make the attack and defense of one of your opponent's monsters become 0 allowing you to pierce with some of the fusions such as Chaos Giant massive damage. You can run more if you want, but I never needed him more than 2 times a game.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Platinum Gadget - Hate to leave him on board but he is nice to have.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. The Gadgets have a problem of getting stuck in my hand or on the field, and he is an easy way to solve both problems. He lets you summon a Lv 4 or lower machine monster from your hand letting you summon another Gadget for even more special summons. Him only requiring 2 machine monsters to summon means you can get rid of any gadgets stuck on your board. It also floats into more Gadgets if you hate yourself or your opponent allowing you to survive a full Valkyrie board.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Phoenix and Unicorn - If you don't use these you are in for a Knightmare.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>1 of each. Unicorn is a spin and Phoenix can get rid of spell and traps. They have generic summoning requirements letting you get rid of your gadgets.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Gear Gigant X - Rank 4 machine</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. It searches level 4 or lower machines while setting up the graveyard. This allows you to use the effect of Box. He is also an earth machine allowing you to summon Ballistic Shooter or the Lv 5 Infinitrack monsters.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Cyber Dragon Nova - The thing that you use to summon Cyber Dragon Infinity</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. It lets you summon Cyber Dragon Infinity. Plus if your opponent forgets what it does you can summon Chaos Giant for free.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Cyber Dragon Infinity - Its a machine deck that runs Lv 5 monsters</span> <ul>  	<li><span>It's a machine deck that runs Lv 5 monsters. Omni-negate + absorbing monsters is too good not to run.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Howitzer - Just burn your opponent and they won't read it.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2. It's by far the easiest of the Ancient Gear fusion monsters to summon, it burns for 1000 points, and if your opponent doesn't read it they will just crash into it allowing you to summon any Ancient Gear from your deck. This includes Golem as its effect bypasses the summoning requirement.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Megaton Ancient Gear Golem - Howitzer but for card effects.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. This has the summoning requirement of only 3 Ancient Gear monsters and has a 3300 body. If you use your two Golems it will be able to attack 2 times during the battle phase. On top of this it has the outstanding ability to summon Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem when it leaves the field because of an opponent's card effect. With its massive body most players will try to remove it using a Unicorn, or will find some way to banish it. A fun combo with this is to have a Megaton Golem on your field at the end of your turn while you have Fortress on your field and watch as your opponent spins it with Unicorn only to be surprised by a 4400 untargetable wall that is Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem staring them down.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem - Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon but for Ancient Gear Golem.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 1. As stated earlier you can easily summon this off the effect of Megaton. Its summoning requirement just requires that you have one Ancient Gear Golem and two other Ancient Gear monsters making it only slightly harder to get out than Megaton. It does piercing and prevents battle spells/traps. Not to mention the fact that it floats into an Ancient Gear Golem so long as it is destroyed.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Chaos Ancient Gear Giant - It's like Ultimate Conductor Tyranno but a machine</span> <ul>  	<li><span>I run 2. He is the big daddy of the deck. His massive 4500 make most decks struggle to even touch him. He does piercing making you think twice about summoning monsters in defense mode. On top of all this, he can attack all of your opponent's monsters. While he is hard to get out you can use cards there are plenty of ways to search out Ancient Gear monsters to use as fodder for him using cards like Box and Wyvern it's not too hard to get them in hand where you can use the fusion spell or Hunting Hound to summon him. He is also dark allowing you to summon him with Overload Fusion. He even stops your opponent's monster effects during the battle phase, meaning no worrying about Shaddolls. </span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <span> </span>  <span>Cheaper Alternatives For Cards:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Fusion - You can always run polymerization instead. If you do this then you may want to take out or at least reduce the amount of Gear Frames to 1 since they will only search for a brick.</span></li>  	<li><span>Ancient Gear Ballistic Shooter - You can try running more copies of Gear Gigant X or Platinum Gadget, but you should still run at least one copy of him.</span></li> </ul> <span> </span>  <span>Other Fun Fun Cards To Try:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Limiter Removal - Make number bigger.</span></li>  	<li><span>True King Of All Calamities - You already have Infinitrack cards to do it, so it could be fun to try out.</span></li> </ul> <span> </span>  <span>Improvements To Make:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Add some hand traps to prevent cards like Droll or Ash from ending your turn right away.</span></li>  	<li><span>Run cards to disrupt the opponent rather than just furthering your own plays.</span></li>  	<li><span>Find more earth machine support to mess around with. I toyed with Deskbots but gave up a little quick on them.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Side deck contains some fun cards, or replacements for expensive ones."

Now with the new support it can be pretty annoying.  This deck is pretty consistent and can put down a few negates first turn and can easily OTK going second. Also lot of hand traps so you can negate stuff going second. It works better for MR2020 but in this format is also works really well.  I recommend switching Borreload for Apollousa if you have one, but I don't :("

Most of the monsters have the ability to bring themselves or other monsters back from the graveyard creating recurring nightmares for the opponent. The Spirit of the Pharoh is great for hoarding the field with Xyz material and necro fusion is great to get Sea Monster of Theseus out to make synchro summoning much easier. The deck is designed to move quickly and spread the zombie sickness until the opponent joins the hoard!

GOAT Format focuses on a slow, older style of play: using pre-errata and","Okay. This is hilariously fun. I am <em>obviously</em> not a GOAT format player - to clarify - but going back to how older yugioh was played is quite refreshing to say the least. Most turns consists of set 3 pass - and non-archetypal flipping decks were actually a valid thing. It was also really fun seeing old cards back in play - and realising how broken they truly are as well as why they are never coming back. It is definitely engaging and allows you to see how yugioh was back in the day were your whole deck was one-of's. So with me and my fangirling out the way: here's a not-so-brief layout on everything you need to know about this deck - with a few extra steps in between.  So the way GOAT works is rather different to modern day yugioh. There are two different sides to the game-style: Pre-Exarion and Post-Exarion. This literally means if a deck was made before or after the release of Exarion Universe. The deck I've created is definitely one of - if not the most - popular Pre-Exarion lists there are. Goat Control is a fun way of abusing the old banlist to its fullest and manipulating Relinquished as well as Metamorphosis in order to keep card advantage above your opponent. This is shown in the rather strange extra deck - consisting of random level targets - used in order to get more powerful monsters on board. Jinzo was a card heavily played at the time, that's why I have Last Warrior to go along with Snatch Steal. Once he hits the board its basically GG.  A good two card combo for this deck is Magician of Faith and Delinquent Duo. If you open these two cards you can quickly hand loop your opponent for 4 without using any resources. Its pretty efficient and tends to win you games straight off. This isn't to mention that you can also open Tsukuyomi to once again hand loop your opponent for another two next turn again. This combo is pretty efficient and actually quite awesome if you pull it off. Other than that the main strategy is to obviously abuse Relinquished as much as possible and keep. On. Sucking....no homo. Manju of the Ten Thousand hands is a good way of enabling this - as its fearful 1400 attack plays well with his search effect. Black Luster Soldier is also a powerhouse to play through. If you manage to drop him and you're coincidentally playing the right match-up, its simply game over from there. This deck can truly break boards like its nothing.  For today - we're completely disregarding the natural way of things. Overall: GOAT Format is a good hard 9.7/10. I've seen some shade being thrown at the community - similar to Genwunners in Pokemon - but I think the playerbase is being slightly disregarded as of late. In my opinion, they aren't as irritating as people may think and are pretty generic. They're just like regular players - but towards a less fast-paced gamemode. The format and rules themselves are both unique and refreshing, allowing you to revisit your past and play yugioh how it once was - slow. It's a cool way of relaxing, and sitting back from your usual 5 minute spyral combos as a means of relaxing your mind and doing the thing you love (obviously being ̶s̶u̶c̶k̶i̶n̶g̶  playing yugioh). While probably not anytime soon, I'll definitely revisit this format on my page and try to do something different with it. For now though, this is what I got..."

The strategy for this deck is to get the cry havoc and heart of the underdog combo, how you do this is using the spell cards I put in and cat of ill omen. one you get this combo out you can fill your side of the field with red dragon synchro monsters. You do this by drawing a normal monster which is the only type of monster in the deck, then you start constantly drawing cards until you get a spell or trap card. With cry of havoc you can banish a card to special summon a monster, when your monster is in the graveyard you can start the loop by banishing a card to summon another card then normal summon another monster after that synchro summon your first monster to special summon 2 more monsters which then you use to synchro summon another and so forth. By the time your done with your summonings you should have your boss card out which should be the strongest monster and then gg."

Interrupted Kaiju Slumber can be used to give you a strong Kaiju while giving your opponent a weaker one, while also destroying your Unchained monsters and summoning more of them from the deck.  &nbsp;  After doing the above combo, you can summon Unchained Soul of Disaster or Rage, and use their effects to get rid of the opponent's Kaiju and do a Link Summon. I just named this deck ""GODZIRRA!"" because I could not think of any better names. If anyone here has better ideas on what to name this deck, let me know in the comments."

Set up insane Orcust boards - without harp horror - and enjoy t","Is Orcust truly gone? No. Will it be meta? Probably not. With the recent-ish banlist hitting and effectively slaughtering most meta decks - people have had to adapt and change their playstyle in order to still be able to deal out powerful blows. Orcust were one of the decks that got hit pretty badly - with their main combo starter being straight up banned. However, many people have found that with the new Rank-Up-Magic spell being unbanned - you can quite simply and easily make True King of All Calamities. With a little tweaking the deck can be good as new - so that's why I present; RUM Orcust..  To start off our deck analysis: we will split the three engines so that we get a better understanding of the different combos in place. The first engine - or set of cards rather -  is obviously the Orcust package. Our main opener has now become Knightmare and World Wand meaning you want to resolve them as much as possible. I've included Gizmek Orochi and the two Dark Warriors into this category as they are there to start up your orcust cards. Next, we run a rather decent Danger! engine. You obviously want to run the classic Nessie, Jackalope and Tsuchinoko - however I also run two Mothman and one Chupacabra for consistency and bodies on board. They help out well with discarding your unwanted cards and freeing up your hand. Finally I run the Scrap and Co. engine. The reason I run it is clearly pitching - but it can also end you on a Galatea + full combo for an added disruption if you somehow can't make Calamities. Since Harp Horror has been sent to the shadow realm, you now run O-Lion and Jet Synchron as your targets for making Scrap Wyvern. You do run the extra Garnets on the side - them of course being Scrap Golem and Silent Boots - but that's why the Dangers! are there.  The main concept is getting Dingirsu and Cymbal Skeleton in grave - and making Cherubini. This is made simpler with the Danger! engine and the Scrap engine as they both have many level 3's that you could go for. Going second - you can still make VFD without really trying. Just make sure you have PK RUM in hand and just perform a standard Orcust combo after. Once you pop a card with Ding's effect - you now have a rank 8 without material on board. Simply pass - and chain the Rank-Up on activation of any spell, trap or summon. Although watch out for Super Polymerization - that can kill boards. Finally, you have the standard I:P combo alongside Unicorn and the two Topologics. You can always go into this if you're having trouble making Calamities - and it still can win you games.  To conclude: this deck is a mediocre 7/10. As much as it pains me to say - the banlist did a lot for this deck, and not in a positive way. I doubt this deck will become meta in this format - but right now we're in that state of limbo where Konami hasn't revealed which direction the Ultimate Banlist will take us. Maybe Harp will come back at 1 - maybe it will completely be unbanned. Maybe it will be left in the dust for an eternity to come - nobody knows. As of now, this is most likely the optimalest way of playing Orcust: but quite frankly,  not the strongest its been..."

For this reason we play x3 copies of <strong>Relinquished</strong> and x3 copies of  <strong>Black Illusion Ritual</strong> to ritual summon it. <strong>Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</strong> can search one of these two when summoned and can be immediately tributed after we use its effect to summon <strong>Relinquished</strong>. <strong>Sangan</strong> can also search for one copy of <strong>Relinquished</strong> from the deck when sent to the Graveyard.  We main x2 of  <strong>Tsukuyomi</strong> to flip face-down our <strong>Relinquished</strong> so that the monster stolen in the previous turn is sent to the graveyard and we are able to steal another one. It can also be helpful to remove problematic cards (Jinzo, Monarchs, Blade Knight, Thousand-Eyes Restrict etc.) or to flip face-down one of our flip-effect monsters,  <strong>Morphing Jar</strong> or  <strong>Magician of Faith, </strong>or our own <strong>Thousand-Eyes Restrict</strong>, which can be summoned using <strong>Metamoprhosis</strong> on <strong>Relinquished</strong>, <strong>Magician of Faith</strong>, <strong>Sinister Serpent </strong>or one of the <strong>Scapegoat</strong> token. <strong>Book of Moon</strong> serves the same purposes as <strong>Tsukuyomi</strong> but can also be used during the opponent's turn when needed.  Other support cards included in the deck are: <ul>  	<li><strong>Lava Golem</strong>: can be used to remove two monsters from the opponent field and then we can steal it with <strong>Relinquished</strong>, boosting its attack to 3000</li>  	<li><strong>Swords of Revealing Light</strong>: can help to stall for a few turns</li>  	<li><strong>Giant Trunade</strong>: can be used to clear the fields from dangerous trap cards, can bring back to the opponent's hand a monster stolen by <strong>Relinquished</strong> (or our <strong>Swords of Revealing Light</strong> when you draw them together)</li>  	<li><strong>Threatening Roar</strong>: prevents OTK and does not remove monsters on the field, helpful when we are ready to summon <strong>Relinquished</strong> in the next turn, even more helpful if we have <strong>Lava Golem</strong> in hand</li>  	<li><strong>Spell Shield Type-8</strong>: free negate for when the opponent uses <strong>Book of Moon</strong>, <strong>Nobleman of Crossout</strong>, <strong>Snatch Steal</strong> or <strong>Metamorphosis</strong>. Especially helpful when we have <strong>Relinquished</strong> or <strong>Thousand-Eyes Restrict </strong>on the field since people like to use <strong>Book of Moon</strong> on them</li> </ul> The rest of the cards in the deck are staples of the format with a <strong>Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning</strong> since we play a decent number of <span>LIGHT and DARK m</span>onsters.  &nbsp;"

Generally speaking, this deck can evolve during the game into several bosses, each of them having specific traits accordingly to what you're facing.

I played Zombies because I told Burrito I would play them if I could not top the previous cup and I couldn't. They were really popular when I first started playing Trinity but lost it's power since. I haven't played them back then because I was trying to be a hipster but I have played against it and also watched some replays so it was fine.  What tech choices did you play? Absorouter and Rokket Synchron. Many people were playing it I think (?). It really feels bad to play but also really rewarding when you can actually use it. I have considered siding them out often but usually did not. There is also Danger Bigfoot which is the best discard fodder :3. Nothing unusual really, the list is very similar to Burrito's and he knows what he is doing.  How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward?  All the good S/T Hate and it still is not enough right? Pendulum is also a deck. Zombies are actually pretty refined at this point being an old deck. All the combos, all the gimmicks. What changed is the players in tournaments mostly and they were not ready to out Vampire Fraulein I guess. I don't think I will play this deck again anytime soon so I don't really know how it's going to adapt the meta but it certainly will."

OCG only for this one folks. Sorry. We've got special summoning from the hand. We've got special summoning from the deck. 1 Card XYZ Monsters galore - easy Rank 4s and 5s. Some matchups you want to go first, set up some negates or good disruption. Toadal Abyss was the working name of the deck, we're using Bahamut to cheat out TA, then locking people out of their graveyard with Dweller. We've also got Evenly Matched, for those matchups where you can tear down boards AND set up high quality negates. Some hands like going second, some first. Don't fret over a coin toss, just get the job done with whatever tool you need to do it. 1 spicy Raigeki because it actually seems plausibly good in a deck like this. Impermanence because it can put you over the top, and is good going first and second.  Cutter Shark is the engine the entire deck revolves around. It gives you a free special summon of any of your fishy friends, right out of the deck. 1 card XYZ monster. Its buddy, Lantern Shark, lets you make another special summon from the hand (in a deck that was already running Goldfish) and it also counts as a level 5 monsters for making XYZ summons. These do lock you out of other types of summons on the turn you use them, which is relevant. Then there's the Tuna! Tuna is a level 1 fish support - when its summoned it turns into any of your other fishies! So that's broken. Double Fin Shark is also a powerful card in its own right - he pulls a fish out of the bin when you normal him. On its own, its another 1 card XYZ summon, but it can easily extend further than that. Its effect also turns on White Stingrays tuner ability, meaning its easy to search for the synchro material to make White Aura Whale, a reasonable threat that wipes boards and can help close out games. Did I mention we're wiping the board? Because we're wiping the board. Stingray doubles as a cheap special summon, and a way to fill the bin to get value out of normaling Double Fin. Then there's Silent Angler, which is just Bubbleman on Steroids. Real MVP there, always useful. Plus Royal Fish so tuna can be a tuner!  For traps, it's just the good stuff. ;) There's the obligatory Upstart, a Monster Reborn, which again can easily turn into multiple special summons, as well as Instant Fusion for Restrict Shenanigans and easy level 4s, One for One to find Tuna, and 2 Sea Lord's Amulet, which protects all of our water monster from destruction by card effects for 3 turns. These are amazing, but terrible in numbers generally, so 2 seems about right, 1 might be reasonable. Then there's 3 Pot of Desires. I haven't figured out exactly WHY Pot of Desires is better in some builds than others. Obviously it goes poorly for decks searching for one ofs. But in a deck like this I felt I needed the greed, and none of our singles overlap, and thankfully I think it works.  In the toolbox, I have the aforementioned Bahamut Shark and Abyss Dweller. There's also Silent Honor Ark, more useful here than Castel thanks to the water theme (for example, attack bonuses, protection, ability to link away). Good removal is good. I thought Diagusto Emeral was banned when I first built this deck but he's not. It gives the deck some much needed longevity, and it can actually help in 2 pot games to keep from decking out. Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark is here because it has a cool name. Oh, also it's a backup way to resurrect restrict monsters from the extra deck. And a beater. Oh and it's battle protection too. In a deck like this, where it can easily be gaining 1000 attack and reducing the opponent's attack by 1000... it falls short of commonly used toolbox beaters, but it gets all the fringe benefits of being a water monster. Then we have a couple level 5s, to take advantage of that powerful shark core. Valiant Shark Lancer is extremely good removal - two spell speed 2 pops on any monster, and an effect that gains you value if your other water XYZ monsters get destroyed while it's on the field. Plus, it's another reasonable beater. It does require you to run it beside other water XYZ monsters, but that shouldn't be a problem. A removal magnet that removes 2 things? Not bad. Then we have Artifact Durendal. It lets us set up more ""negates"", and while it can interfere with the Amulets, it can also help fix our hand to maybe get some free special summons and solve some of those problem games.  Sideboard is crap.  Made some changes. Trying Left-Arm/Right Arm fish with more graveyard enablers."

The Quant field spell also requires a discard cost to make an easy Xyz monster from a Quant you have on the field, allowing you to trigger Dangers or Trick Clown for bonus value (and the discard cost pays for itself if you have the Quant Link on the field offering a draw 1 for every new Quant Xyz summon). And Phantazmay, on top of being a potent hand trap against any deck relying on Links, can also set up for your Rank 7 Xyz, and activate discard/GY effects.</span>  <span>If you really want to flex on your opponent, you can potentially summon Dugares and Gossip Shadow together, use Gossip Shadow's effect to attach itself and its material to Dugares, use the GY effect of Overlay Booster to boost Dugares with an extra 2500 ATK, then use Dugares' effect to double its own ATK to a hefty 7400. This combo isn't remotely practical, but that's not really the point, is it?</span> <p><span><b>Getting Familiar with the Super Quant Archetype</b></span></p> &lt;!--more--&gt;  <span>If you've stumbled across this and are curious but have no experience with the Super Quant series of cards, here's a quick crash course:</span>  <span>The archetype mainly consists of a set of main deck monsters that have a corresponding extra deck monster: the pilots and the mechs (or Rangers and Zords if you prefer). <strong>Blue = 3, Green = 4, Red = 5, White = 7</strong>. Each pilot (the ""Layer"" monsters) have an effect when they hit the field, and another when they hit the graveyard; an easy trick for keeping this effects straight in your head is to remember <strong>Blue = deck, Green = hand, Red = Graveyard</strong>, with White being something of a wildcard.</span> <ul>  	<li><span><span><strong>Blue</strong></span><strong> - </strong><strong> </strong>Field: add Quant from deck to hand | GY: shuffle Quant(s) from GY to deck</span></li>  	<li><span><strong><span><span>Green</span> -</span></strong><span> Field: summon  Quant from hand | GY: discard Quant to draw</span> </span></li>  	<li><span><span><strong><span>Red</span></strong></span><strong><span> - </span></strong><span>Field: add Quant from GY to hand | GY: summon Quant from GY</span></span></li> </ul> <span>White Layer is a wildcard that can send any Quant monster from your deck to the GY to copy its level and attribute, and when White Layer is sent to the GY, you can add an Alphan to your hand. Alphan is something of a wildcard of its own (it can make all of your monsters, including itself, match the level of one of your Quant monsters for easy Xyz plays), and is often the single most impactful card in the deck with its tribute effect that takes 3 Quant monsters from your deck, summons 1, and puts the other 2 in the GY (letting you activate all corresponding effects in the process).</span>  <span>The Xyz monsters (with ranks that match the levels of the pilots with the corresponding attribute/color) also all act similar to one another. They all require material to attack, they can all add Quant monsters to themselves as material, and their detach abilities become quick effects when they have their corresponding pilot attached as material. Blue destroys back row, Green flips face down (Book of Moon), Red destroys monsters, and White negates monster effects.</span> <p><span><strong>Getting the most out of your Alphan</strong></span></p> <span>Alphan is probably the single most impactful card in this entire deck, so understanding how to effectively use Alphan is key. Since the addition of Super Quantum White Layer, you now have an additional means for searching out Alphan, and a choice to make when activating Alphan's tribute effect (as know you get to choose which 3 of the 4 monsters to reveal from your deck, whereas before your 3 choices were the only 3 choices).</span> <ul>  	<li><span><em>Always</em> choose Red. 1/3: Red gets summoned and you get to Alphan, 1 of the other 2 that just went to the GY, or any other Quants that were in there before to your hand; 2/3 Red goes to the GY meaning you'll get to summon 2 monsters off of Alphan's effect instead of just the 1.</span></li>  	<li><span>You almost always want to choose White as well. Alphan makes this deck fly, and if White lands in the GY, you get an Alphan in your hand (something you definitely want). If White gets summoned, his effect lets you send <em>another</em> Quant monster from deck to GY, meaning you get to choose 1 of the 2 GY effects that didn't activate as a result of Alphan to go ahead and activate anyway</span></li>  	<li><span>Whether or not you choose Green generally comes down to what's in your hand.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>If you've got another Quant monster in hand, choosing Green will 1/3: let you summon whatever's in your hand, or 2/3: let you discard that monster to draw a card (and activate its GY effect if you haven't already).</span></li>  	<li><span>If you've got Quant spells/traps you don't particularly need in your hand, choosing Green will 2/3: let you discard one to draw a new card, but if you don't also have a Quant monster in hand, you run the 1/3 risk of having no target to summon.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>If your deck only has 1 copy of any of the Quant monsters left in it, choosing Blue is a good idea. 2/3: Blue will go to the GY allowing you to recycle Quant monsters, allowing you to make sure your deck always has enough to keep Alphan's effect live; 1/3: Blue will let you search for a field spell when summoned, or a White Layer to special summon by sending Blue to the GY (activating the recycle effect you wanted in the first place). Even if there are no White layer's left to search, you can often just make an Xyz and detach blue, or use Blue as link material to trigger the recycle. <em>It's important to always keep a full set of Quants in your deck to keep Alphan live</em>.</span></li> </ul> <span>Even though Alphan is amazing, you generally shouldn't search for Alphan when summoning Blue. If Alphan is what you want (unless you also want to make a rank 3), its generally better to search for White who can then be special summoned (either by using the Blue you just summoned, or a Quant from your hand); White can then send another copy of White to the GY and <em>then</em> you can search for Alphan off of White's GY effect. On the topic of White's GY effect, you can add an Alphan to hand from deck <em>or GY</em>, and just as its good to always keep 1 of each Quant in your deck to keep Alphan's effect live, its good to leave 1 Alphan in your deck to keep One for One live.</span>"

It has a high potential. If you guys are tired with meta deck or some deck you like are too expensive like ,"Before, I played counter fairy, it did worked well. However, gradually, a lot of competitive decks come up, and their recovery are crazy. And because of the new ban list, I have to find another ways.  I found that generaider is a great deck, this deck needs only the field to have the monster. However there are some cards in OCG that haven't come out yet.  Therefore, Generaider has no negation on opponents.  Consequently, I mix the counter fairy with generaider. This deck is 100% fun and crazy af.  Pros: -going first is the best, You don't care nibiru or any hand trap, we have alot counter trap and interupted card.  -We can search counter trap through the parsath monster and this deck is level 9 which means you can make true king of all calamities.  - We have negation, destroy card, banish card,  easy to summon big monster from deck or hand or graveyard, power of search or draw card.  -Your opponent rarely can get through.  Cons: -Going second is not great at all. You dont wanna see any big monster in you hand, especially the parshath monster and dovelgus.  -If your opponent has card that can destroy spell trap like twin twister or cosmic or sleeper( spyral), or salamagreat(trap). we almost lost that game.  -This deck dont have much handtrap and cannot OTK.  -If your opponent kaiju, we fuked up.  -It does brick sometimes.  &nbsp;  Solution: I have side a lot of type card to get through this.  Nibiru, lava golem, evenly match.  Especially, I side unending nightmare to fight against some hard match-up like subterror, altergeist, and other decks that use field spell, or continuous spell/trap  Waking the dragon is essential to fight back some decks that have cards destroy spell trap like twins twister, cosmic and even lightning storm.  Finally, Hope you enjoy this deck while playing. Thank you for take a look.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

You should start first and setup your Herald of Perfection/Ultimateness on the board(Ultimateness is more powerfull but leaves you hand emptier so you can't use the effect as much. Be wise)  If you can't, then stall with Time Maiden and Timelords until you have a better play.  There is a specific play that you may be able to use sometimes. You need Time Maiden, 1 Timelord and the Celestial spell(to special summon 1 timelord). You use Time Majden to add Michion to your hand and summon him and the other timelord (mainly Metaion) and attack with both. Using Michions effect to take 4000 LP from your opponent and during main phase 2 you can summon Superdreadnaught Gustav Max and deal an extra 2000 damage for a huge 6000+damage turn.  I think i can't explain this deck with words so you should just try it for yourself  &nbsp;"

During your first turn you should be able to summon True King of All Calamities and Toadally Awesome, which is pretty good against all decks of the format. Mermail Abyssalacia is also a great card, because by discarding 1 water monster, which can be infantry, so you'll destroy a card your opponent controls, makes you have a big mermail monster in your hand for continue playing the next turn. So, the turn 1 combo is Abyssalacia equipped with Mizuchi (searched by Megalo); True King of All Calamities or Bahamut Shark + Toadally Awesome. I play 3 called by the grave just because this deck is weak to ash on Deep Sea Diva. Another useful combo is making Avramax using Masquerena, because I:P makes Avramax indestructible, and you'll have a 3000 ATK monster on the field that can't be targeted or destroyed by your opponent's card effects, and that gains ATK when it's attacked or it's attacking.

This deck will fully utilize it's potential with Speedroids to asse,"<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/L0ZiIYA.jpg"" alt=""image"" />  Unpopular strategy of Invoked made viable with Speedroid. A combo deck that can stun with Barrier Statue of Stormwinds while having Invoked toolboxes and recurrence with possible synchro plays for breaking board thanks to Speedroid. <strong>The combo is Aleister + tuner/Parallel Exceed/Terrortop</strong>. The Terrortop route basically summoning itself + Taketomborg and normal summon Aleister and make Simorgh via Harpie link, then Invocation for Raidjin. Parallel Exceed route is just summoning Almiraj and u get free 2 copies Parallel Exceeds which are wind for Harpie link.  The tuner route takes longer and creates more advantage. It is similar to OCG Needlefiber (Halqifibrax in TCG) turbo for Releaser Dragun. Make Needlefiber using Aleister + tuner, ss O-Lion, link off Needlefiber for Linkross, use Linkross summon 2 tokens, tune O-Lion + 1 token for Martial Metal Marcher, use Martial chain O-lion, ss O-Lion ss Mecha Phantom Beast Token, tune Martial + another lv1 token for Speedroid Puzzle (for another Speedroid recovery), link off Puzzle + Mecha Phantom Beast Token for Harpie Conductor, link off Conductor + Linkross for Simorgh, use Invocation, ss Raidjin using GY material (use wind monster that cant be recycled). Any Speedroid extender can help to synchro while establishing the same board.  Also pay attention to cards' restriction on their effect like on the Speedroids and Wynn wind searcher.  Cards to think of: <a data-name=""Old Entity Hastorr"">Old Entity Hastorr</a> (replace Puzzle, can steal monster combined with @Ignister Wind Pegasus), another Invoked fusion monsters (extra deck is tight, you can replace some), Crystal Wing (kinda not easy to make cus only via Charge Warrior + O-Lion), Fast Dragon (the negation only for extra deck monster, can be put in depends on you), Droll &amp; Lock Bird (great wind handtrap but not a tuner)."

Here's a recipe of mine for a fun and strong deck.  I like Fluffals as they are powerful enough to wipe out enemy LP in one turn, but they usually can't compete in a long duel, nor they can counter.  Adding Heroes will strengthen their forces without changing play style, enhancing the Polymerization search and graveyard playing.  Use basic Toy Vendor combo, recycle Polymerization spells with field spell, fill the graveyard with Monster Gate and Destiny Hero Malicious!  Beware: you will run out of cards quickly!

Very good for locals. (Tier 2-3),"Hi everybody! I've been testing this deck for a long time now and I thought it would be a good idea to share this build with other people. This is by far the deck list that has given me the best results. It's not a meta deck by any means, but it is definitely a good deck choice for your locals or even to steal a couple of wins at a regional.  &nbsp;  The Main Deck in my opinion is close to perfection. I'll give you the reasoning behind each card choice:  Monsters: 12  3 Commandant: Terraforming with legs. Playing 3 copies is mandatory.  2 Spiritualist: Awesome and needed to fusion summon. I play Duality and Demise, so I don't always want nor need to go for a fusion summon.  2 Spy: Perfect ratio. This card is ridiculously good. I'm suprised some people don't play it anymore. Huge defense, amazing synergy with Headman and it allows you to have extra presence on the board, which is always good in this deck.  I resolve it most of the time.  1 Descendant. Still a very solid card. Good synergy with Headman and Rite of Spirit.  1 Headman. Speak of the devil! Mandatory, at least at 1. I don't like it at 2. It is searchable and I never wanna see it turn 1.  3 Ash: Too good going first or second. Demise is at 1 now, so this handrap helps you more than it affects you.  I don't like Heretic. It is a good card, but I can't stand the fact that it doesn't have good synergy with supernaturalist nor with super polymerization (unless you have it in your hand). I guess you could add one to the deck, but to me it is pointless.  &nbsp;  Spells: 16  3 Necrovalley: Heart and soul of the deck. Needless to talk about it.  3 Throne: Rota or Double Summon for Gravekeepers. Again, nothing left to say here.  3 Royal Tribute: Amazing card! If you go 1st: Activate Necrovalley, activate this card, game 2. This will happen very frequently, unless your opponent plays a heavy backrow deck or you go second. I strongly recommend you playing this in the main deck and not the side deck. With 3 copies plus 7 draw spells, you will see Royal Trubute quite often. There are some instances in which you can still use it going second. Worth playing it in the Main Deck in my opinion.  3 Pot of Desires: Some people hate this card here. I totally love it! Having that plus 1 in hand can be so useful. Rarely I banish key cards when paying the cost. I guess you could just play two if you hate it that much, but it is definitely a good card.  3 Duality: I used to play 2. Now I have to play it at 3 since demise went to 1. It is an excelent card in your first hand. It allows you to quickly access to an additional card that you might be needing. Again, you don't always require to go for the fusion summon, even less XYZ plays. A set Gravekeeper plus a solid backrow and necrovalley is most of the time more than enough.  1 Card of Demise: Still awesome! Play it... please!  These are my 7 draw spells. Of course, if I had money I would play pot of extravagance. It is still way too expensive for me. If you can have access to it, consider making some changes to the ratios. I would go 2 desires. 2 extravagance, 2 duality and 1 demise maybe. It is important to mention that for this deck, 7-8 drawing spells is a reasonable ratio. Remember, it is essential to get Necrovalley in your first hand, and even thought you play ""9 copies"" of the card (commandant and throne), sometimes it can be difficult to get it if you don't have the right drawing spell.  Observation: In case you were wondering about Hidden Temples, it is a great card and it can completely shut down most decks. The problem is the requirements. If you lose Necrovalley or your Gravekeeper, you lose this card. It is searchable by Supernaturalist, but I wouldn't play it at more than 1. Feel free to experiment with it a little bit if you want, but in my case, when I tested it it was quite often a dead card in my hand.  Trap cards: 12  1 Imperial Tombs: Amazing card. I used to play it at 2, but I realized 1 was better. I did it because of the requirements, similar to Hidden Temples. If you lose either Necrovalley or your Gravekeepers, or if you are unable to get either of the 2 in your first hand, this card is totally dead. However, it doesn't leave the field if you set it. Having 1 copy is worth it.  1 Necrovalley Temple: I used to underestimate this card. Really good! It protects your Necrovalley and it surprises your opponent reducing their attack points. Searchable. 1 is totally fine.  1 Rite of spirit: Your monster reborn. Good interaction with Headman.  3 Solemn Strike: Counter trap. Speed 3. Really good!  3 Solemn Judgement: Mandatory! With Lightning Storm and Evenly Matched in the format, you need this!  3 Crackdown: This card is extremely powerful. I don't regret adding this card to the deck. Stealing your opponent's monsters can completely prevent them from going for their combos and at the same time stoping them from attacking you directly. Love the card!  &nbsp;  The Extra Deck, as you can see, includes Super Poly targets mostly. These are in my opinion the best ones. You can always make some changes depending on then players at your locals. (I wish the Trishula Fusion wasn't just a Jump promo). I play a couple of XYZ monsters. Again, this is up to you. Those are the ones I like the most. The reason why I play the Beat cop from the underworld is because I needed a generic link two for my Crackdown targets. You could play the other generic links such us the Knightmares, but I decided not to play them because of the discard cost. All my Gravekeepers are level 4, except Headman (which is meant for fusion summon and in some instances for a Descendant target), so my XYZs are easy to summon.  &nbsp;  The Side Deck, again depends of your local scene. Evenly matched is busted, Twin twister is mandatory in my opinion and Dark bribe for me is amazing in order to stop my opponent's Evenly matched or Lightning Storm. The rest of the cards depend on you. It is worth mentioning that I moved Super Poly to my Side Deck because many guys at my locals are no longer playing dark mosnters or have decided to move to backrow decks. If you still feel like it, you can have it in your main deck and perhaps take out your Ash Blossoms. I don't know. It's up to you.  &nbsp;  The reason why I decided to share this deck with you is because 1) I absolutely love the deck. 2) I have tested it several times with very good results. Of course, feel free to either disagree with some of my choices or maybe recommend other options. I hope this can help some of you Gravekeeper lovers. Enjoy the deck! ;)"

This version of the deck varies from the standard variation of the zombie strategy by not just being a control deck but also being good at combos.  The deck has a few decent starters, gozuki, Uni-zombie, sharinui solitaire, and Armageddon knight all help to get your grave yard dumping started.  A high ratio of Danger monsters are used for draw power, combos, and getting cards out of the hand that you want in the grave.  Destiny hero malicious is involved as he is easy to dump into the grave and can help be a nice combo extender.  Droll and lock is replacing ash as it is just better for the new format, with so many decks searching so many times the one search negate of ash blossom is not enough, so instead of stopping one search, let that one be the only search they get.  Now for the big bois, Doomking Balerdroc, and Jack-o-bolan (and a secret third option). These cards can effectively say no to may of your opponents plays by straight up negating the effect, banishing a combo piece, or stealing the combo piece before it can do it's thing. With these card on field it can be almost unfair to go against as many of the deck that can out zombies stop being able to since they can't reach their combos. For those making their own deck there is a third option to consider, Hela generaider boss of doom. She can tribute zombie monsters on your field to special summon a zombie with a different name from your graveyard, her plus Jack-o-bolan can steal your opponents monsters to then tribute them off banishing them in the process while also grabbing combo pieces from your grave or extra deck monsters that were already defeated. I personally do not run her as I had a hard time finding a place in this variant of the deck but she is an option.  Extra deck time  Omega just refreshes all of your combo pieces back to grave or brings back a doomking that probably got called by the graved. With Omega you can just continue using resources as much as you really want.  Vampire sucker is free draws basically and can helped get more cards in hand to get to your hand traps or super poly. She also has a nice effect to tribute your opponents cards to summon a zombie (you don't know how fun it is to tribute a super quantal mech king great magnus to summon a card to your field).  Number 60 really just helps you finish off the game that turn if you need to  Abyss dweller does abyss dweller things  Borrelsword and Red eyes otk  the rest are pretty self explanatory"

Not sure if optimized but i,"Ok, the main goal is to summon Dark Strike Fighter and Coltwing + 3 tokens then change the levels of all the tokens to 13 and finally activate DSF ability on a level 43 Coltwing dealing 8600 damage in 1 turn.  To do this the deck has a bunch of tools, the easiest way to do it is by special summoning a mon ( hack worm, UDai-&gt;Cyber Falcon and others) and summoning O-Lion. With those 2 make Needlefiber, bring from the deck Warbluran and use O-Lion ability to SS a token. Then you can LinkS Auroradon from NFiber and the token, use SynchroS Dark Strike Fighter with Warbluran and 2 tokens and finally use Auroradon ability, tributing itself and a token to bring Coltwing from the Deck. You end up with 3 level 3 Tokens, Level 13 Coltwing and DSF.  There are other ways to pull it off but honestly I'm unable to precisely recall them all (or analyze the deck, I barely know what I'm doing), but with speedroid shenaningans it's surprisingly more consistent to reach the winning board state than what you may think. The biggest problem of the deck are the spells, ideally you get Galaxy Queen's Light on your hand,but  if you don't, there are some drawing spells to help and if you are lucky, you might even find a Star Light, Star Bright - Resonance Device combo. Those 2 spell cards are the only other way to change the levels of the tokens, if you can't get any of the Level changing spells, then you are dead, because the deck doesn't have a contingency plan.  This is my first deck and it's probably very poorly optimized I invite evryone to try and see if there are better ways to pull it off. I can see it evolving in 2 ways: Increase the consistency of the FTK, find a way to put good use to the tokens and tuners with the FTK as ""Backup""."

However, with the times' progressing signs, there are also options to fusion and link summon while going against Top Tier Meta. Personally, it got me either on or very near the top 100 leaderboards on a popular online simulator website for <span>Yu-Gi-Oh! </span><span>So I know this deck packs a powerful punch if you know what you are doing on certain moves. I'm a firm believer that rogue non-meta decks can not only compete on their own but also destroy meta decks to keep your opponent guessing.</span></span> <ul>  	<li><span>It would help if you preferred to go second because:</span></li> </ul> <p><span>1.) Most effect monsters in this deck have the effect of ""If your opponent controls a monster and you control no monsters, you can special summon this card.""</span></p> <p><span>2.) You can One-Turn-Kill with the ""Number 39: Utopia Double"" strategy. Minimum: You get a boosted 10,000 ATK or higher ""Number 39: Utopia"") by attacking into an opponent's attack mode monster, if and only if the opponent's monster has 2000 attack points or less (10000 ATK utopia minus 2000 ATK monster equals 8000 damage). It means you won when your opponent has 8000 life points or less. There are some support cards for Utopia in this deck to give other power boosts, protection, and other fun shenanigans. You can power up Utopia as well as getting different variants of him on the field.</span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>The Clownblade Performage Engine includes cards such as ""Performage Trick Clown,"" ""Heroic Challenger - Thousand Blades,"" ""Performage Damage Juggler,"" and ""Performage Hat Tricker."" The Clownblade engine alone provides Level 4 monsters to spam, block any battle damage from opponent attacks, and block any burn effect damage. </span></li>  	<li><span>You can even pendulum summon as well.</span></li>  	<li><span>All other cards are tech and staples.</span></li>  	<li><span>Side deck punishes spamming or certain game mechanics.</span></li>  	<li><span>Some cards are in the deck for fun (Such as using the Melodious cards).</span></li> </ul> <p><span> 1. ) For example, you can use the fusion spell card, ""Ostinato,"" to special summon ""Schuberta the Melodious Maestra."" By the effect of <span>""Ostinato,"" that monster </span><span>gets destroyed by the End Phase. Then you special summon ""Aria the Melodious Diva"" and ""Elegy the Melodious Diva"" from your Deck. </span></span></p> <p><span><span>Above is a formidable defensive board lock where your Melodious monsters</span><em> cannot be targeted and cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects</em><span>. There are few options to beat this board lock move. Your opponent can s</span><em>en</em><em>d (without targeting)</em><span> those cards to the graveyard or banish zone, </span><em>not targeting</em><span> with card effects, such as ""Super Polymerization,"" <em>tributing with the Kaiju monsters archetype</em>, or </span><em>negating all card effects on the field</em><span>, such as ""Skill Drain."" </span></span></p> <p><span>""Ostinato"" uses cards from deck or hand. You can send more fodder Melodious cards to the graveyard to make the entire deck more consistent to make other moves without using Melodious cards.</span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>Another fun thing is to run ""Neos Fusion"" to disrupt the field. Rainbow Neos works very well with the Utopia OTK.</span></li>  	<li><span>Some other cards, such as field spells and other spells/traps, are situational. This deck composes of spellcasters, fairies, and warriors.</span></li>  	<li><span>I run the Egyptian God cards for fun. Why not since I can spam out monsters fast? </span></li>  	<li><span>You can link summon.</span></li>  	<li><span>You can still run it for Master Rule 4 or Master Rule 5.</span></li> </ul> <span>Remember, if you believe in the heart of the cards, and you need a deck that can fit almost all situations, you should try out the deck. It's fun and competitive!</span>"

CONTROL{no summon}very consistent,"Hi guys ! With the good ovation if my previous decks, im back with another cool deck This deck is very easy to play! The strategy is to not let your opponent Summon monsters. Also in this deck That i've build, you must save your  Normal summon till u get one of The combo pieces that i will explain Later First thing: you can replace <a data-name=""double summon"">double summon</a> <a data-name=""Lightning storm"">Lightning storm</a> Thou it depends on how you play it  strategy: we have 3 ace monsters here  3 copies of each that make them 9  The aces are:  <a data-name=""ARCHLORD KRISTYA"">ARCHLORD KRISTYA</a>  <a data-name=""VANITY'S FIEND"">VANITY'S FIEND</a>  <a data-name=""VANITY'S RULER"">VANITY'S RULER</a>  this ace monsters stop player(s) to special summon, and since they attack are mid-high  Its very hard to beat them without special summons.  You must use your danger! Cards to get atleast 2 monsters on the field(for tribute summon)and use them to draw constantly to finally get one of those ace monsters. And then normal summon the ace monster. As i mentioned earlier , save your normal summon til you get a ace monster.  Also if you didnt get any of them, there is a card that might help you ;  <a data-name=""Phantom skyblaster"">Phantom skyblaster</a> --&gt; normal summon this guy only when u got sure u wont get any ace monsters,and if you do this card makes some tokens, then link them away to <a data-name=""SARYUJA"">SARYUJA</a> ,and if you get lucky you will draw archlord kristya [ the good thing about kristya is that it can be special summoned, unlike the vanity guys, so it can be special summoned by saryuja]  Please like and comment on this post if you like it and let me know if you want more deck profile .  LOVE YOU GUYS-meta slayer  &lt;!--more--&gt;"

Didn't exactly stop me from admiring his odd antics, not to mention getting weirdly interested in his archetype and somehow fitting something around it for this day and age.  Before you lies a Red-Eyes deck featuring a combination of various Red-Eyes monsters, Gemini monsters, arguably the best Red-Eyes Fusion monster aside from the one that's basically an auto-win, and a certain Link monster that's likely inevitably going to cost a fortune upon coming stateside. It's more of a fun and casual sort of deck, though it is fun to take up against certain big boy decks and enact some beatdown there.  &nbsp; <h2>Monsters</h2> <a data-name=""Red-Eyes B. Dragon"">Red-Eyes B. Dragon</a>, the one, the only. The much less revered (and reprinted/supported) counterpart to the one Dragon Normal monster Konami just loves to milk dry. I don't necessarily hold it against you for playing either, I personally feel some of the few notable Blue-Eyes cards include Alternative and Chaos MAX. Still, this red guy's one job is pretty much fodder for certain special summons and even a certain other kind of card that we'll get to later. The main one in question is...  A very big part of the deck in one way or another, <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Alternative Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Alternative Black Dragon</a>. This card is basically a free summon provided other Red-Eyes monsters are in your hand. Any one will do. Regardless of level or type, so long as ""Red-Eyes"" is in the name, feel free to use it to bring this guy out. More often than not, you'll likely Link or Xyz it away into something better, but on the rare occasion it's destroyed thanks to your opponent's efforts, you get to Special Summon a Red-Eyes monster from the grave. If it just so happens to be Red-Eyes B. Dragon, its ATK doubles to act as a pretty good beatstick to get around certain situations. You'll likely go for some of the more powerful ones instead, however. Speaking of...  Though not really a strong monster on its own, <a data-name=""Black Metal Dragon"">Black Metal Dragon</a> is one of the monsters to help tie the deck together. It can be easily brought out with <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>, otherwise you can equip it to a Red-Eyes monster to give it 600 extra ATK. Its second effect is arguably better, though. By sending it from the field to the grave, for example, by the effect of this deck's boss monster or by using it for a Link Summon like <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> (who pretty much solely exists in this deck for this exact purpose) or the other really good Link in this deck, it lets you search any Red-Eyes card from your deck, including a monster or backrow, essentially acting as a Candina or Time Thief Winder for the deck.  <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Wyvern"">Red-Eyes Wyvern</a> is a monster that's really only good in the grave, which it can easily be sent to by the effect of Insight or Alternative. Once there, if you didn't perform a Normal Summon during your turn, you get to banish it and Special Summon a Red-Eyes monster from the grave. Once again, any monster with the two specific words in its name will do, so no need to be picky.  <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Retro Dragon"">Red-Eyes Retro Dragon</a> makes for a surprisingly good handtrap in a way. Should any Red-Eyes monster, or monsters, of yours at L7 or below be destroyed your opponent's attack or card effect and hits the grave that way, you Special Summon Retro Dragon in defense from your hand, then revive all the Red-Eyes monsters destroyed by that attack or effect from the grave like nothing happened to them. Can you say, ""Retro Dragon's first effect: Bites the Flame!"" Yeah, erm, I'm going to hell for that Jojoke, aren't I?  Despite being a Fiend, <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Archfiend of Lightning"">Red-Eyes Archfiend of Lightning</a> couldn't fit this deck better. It's a beefy monster that normally requires one tribute to bring out at 2500 ATK, but c'mon. This is 2020, do you really see people outside of True Draco or Ancient Gear Tribute summoning anymore? No, no, you're gonna bring this out with any of your Red-Eyes supporting cards or effects! And once you do, you can likely normal summon it to achieve the wonderful effect of essentially unleashing a Raigeki upon your opponent's monsters if their DEF is lower than Archfiend's ATK. It almost feels like stealing, but man is it satisfying to nuke some monsters that would swarm you otherwise.  <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon</a> is another Gemini, with the exception being it can be used for effects that specifically call for a L7 Red-Eyes in the place of B. Dragon. That's not to say its effect once Gemini'd isn't trash, though. Battling with it period will almost always net you a free 2400 damage against your opponent come the end of the Battle Phase, just enough to chip them off in some cases.  <a data-name=""Meteor Dragon Red-Eyes Impact"">Meteor Dragon Red-Eyes Impact</a>'s effect basically defends all your other Red-Eyes monsters from destruction while on the field, even though it's mostly just fodder for another really good Extra Deck monster you might bring out now and again.  Arguably one of the best Dragons in the deck is none other than the so-good-it's-limited <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a>. By banishing a Dragon that's already done its job, it Special Summons to the field and revives a Dragon from your grave once per turn. Geez, this deck can really revive is key components easily, huh? Not much else to say, just a really good card for these kinds of decks to run.  &nbsp;  The next two monsters are primarily used for fusion material of this deck's boss monster, and they can be swapped out with any of the Warriors in the Side Deck to support your tastes. These are just two I personally enjoy for their individual utilities.  &nbsp;  <a data-name=""Phoenix Gearfried"">Phoenix Gearfried</a>, on his own, may just seem like another unnecessary support card for a card that got like, only so many clutch moments in the anime. But believe me when I say after it's been revived and Gemini'd, its ability to revive Geminis in the GY upon activation of an opponent's Spell, and as far as I can tell it's not a once-per-turn thing. It can also come in clutch in tandem with this deck's boss monster while it has cards equipped, letting you counter your opponent's backrow that targets monsters. Surprisingly useful, at least in my eyes.  You might also be wondering, ""Chupi, now why in the heck are you running <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Blazeman"">Elemental HERO Blazeman</a> in this deck if you've already made your own personalized deck profile of HEROes long ago?"", at least initially. Not only does it make for good material, but when it's revived from the grave upon your boss monster's destruction, you get to add <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> to your hand, just in case you need an extra fusion card for stuff you don't necessarily wanna pay LP with or have to wait after setting for the right moment to snipe some of your foe's monsters to make your own. You can forego this and add in another copy of say, Twin Twisters or Lost Wind, but I kinda like the added utility of this monster particularly.  The other Warrior materials you could use, <a data-name=""A/D Changer"">A/D Changer</a>, <a data-name=""Amazoness Swords Woman"">Amazoness Swords Woman</a>, <a data-name=""Fortress Warrior"">Fortress Warrior</a>, <a data-name=""Big Shield Gardna"">Big Shield Gardna</a>, <a data-name=""Guardian of Felgrand"">Guardian of Felgrand</a>, and all of them all have their respective niches, so you can go ahead and swap those in if you'd like. <h2>Spells/Traps</h2> <a data-name=""Cards of the Red Stone"">Cards of the Red Stone</a> immediately stands out among the spells of the deck, and is pretty much the reason to run a bunch of L7 Red-Eyes monsters. Using it and subsequently discarding one of these monsters lets you draw twice, then optionally send a second L7 Red-Eyes to the grave. In a way, it's like a <a data-name=""Destiny Draw"">Destiny Draw</a> and <a data-name=""Dragon Shrine"">Dragon Shrine</a> rolled into one.  <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Insight"">Red-Eyes Insight</a> is a must-run-at-three. Not only does it let you send any Red-Eyes card from your hand or deck to the grave, setting up their grave-reliant effects later on, but it also lets you search for any Red-Eyes backrow you want. Any one. Take your pick, aside from the dedicated fusion card if you still want to have your important summons take place and subsequently the boss monster, who I keep foreshadowing and playing the pronoun game with for some reason.  <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> makes the deck what it is, letting you send cards from your hand, deck, or field to bring out a big nasty Dragon that really tears up the scene. Keep in mind that you can only set if you should choose to activate it from your hand, which I really dunno if you'll be doing all that much. Just let that one special Link I also keep foreshadowing do the job and you'll be good to go.  <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Spirit"">Red-Eyes Spirit</a> acts as a second and third Monster Reborn for your Red-Eyes monsters, once again any of them. A revival that can be searched with a card that also sets up its respective archetype's grave effects. Now how about that?  <a data-name=""Return of the Red-Eyes"">Return of the Red-Eyes</a> is surprisingly good, where simply if you control a Red-Eyes monster, you can revive any Normal monster, period, from your grave, including the Geminis, which you'll most often be summoning with it. Say hello to Archfiend and Gearfried once more, and you can activate it during either turn! A great way to keep your resources coming back for more. Even if your opponent destroys it, though, its use doesn't end there, as upon destruction it basically becomes a Red-Eyes Spirit, letting you bring back another Red-Eyes monster. You'll only really need to run one, given all the other revival stuff in the deck. Still, it's the gift that keeps on giving.  &nbsp; <h2>Extra Deck</h2> Ah yes, finally. I get to bring up that one boss monster. Without further ado...  <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"">Red-Eyes Slash Dragon</a> easily makes the deck what it is. Requiring relatively generic material to bring out, its nifty 2800 ATK becomes 3000 once any of your Red-Eyes monsters attack. Heck, as long as you've got warriors in your grave and Red-Eyes left to attack with, you can keep on equipping and powering up with Warriors to bring from the grave to keep the muscle going. But wait, its second effect is even better. If your opponent has the gall to try and target any card you control with their own card or effect, you can send a Warrior or Black Metal Dragon to counter and really show them who's boss. And even if Slash is destroyed, you get to Special summon whatever Warrior was attached to it upon destruction. All around, very good to have on your side.  <a data-name=""Meteor Black Comet Dragon"">Meteor Black Comet Dragon </a>is another fusion brought out by Red-Eyes Fusion, this one packing a mighty high ATK stat and an effect that Foolish Burial's a Red-Eyes and burns for its original ATK afterwards. Furthermore, if it's sent to the grave from the monster zone, you get to revive a Normal monster a la Return of the Red-Eyes just like that.  I don't suppose you'll be bringing out Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon all that much, but it's definitely got its use. Protected from destructive card effects while it has material, it also burns for 500 every time your opponent activates a card or effect. Also during either turn, you can detach a material to revive a Red-Eyes Normal monster. Man, what is it with this deck and revival of Normal monsters? <p class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack"">Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack</a> is another R7 Xyz that's out and about for the effect of bringing about two tokens for free you can either use for this card's destruction effect or for additional Link summons and such. Not really much else to say, just a good niche to fill.</p> Another useful niche is filled by <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>. This one essentially lets you gain control of one of your opponent's monsters without too much a drawback. Only real restriction on this card is that it requires two L7's to bring out, but you can't really complain since Alternative and other revivals for your L7's are things.  The one big Link monster in the deck is <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>. Not only can it make a monster DARK and set up different kinds of Super Poly plays, but by paying 2000 LP, you can send a Polymerization or Fusion card to the grave to copy it. Keep in mind that while sending Red-Eyes Fusion, you can still bring out its monster despite the fact you've already summoned the turn, but after that point you just can't summon again for the rest of the turn.  The other monsters in the deck are mostly your <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> targets, like First of the Dragons, Starving Venom Fusion Dragon, Predaplant Dragostapelia, Mudragon of the Swamp, etc. and etc. Good for getting rid of your opponent's powerful tools and coming back with your own, as the card is known for.  &nbsp;  All in all, I've grown to admire Red-Eyes and this particular build I've put together. Hopefully you find it just as fun to wave around as I did. If you've got any tips on how I can improve the deck, say, in the choice of Gemini monsters or Warrior material for Slash Dragon, do let me know in the comments below and I'll try and take it to heart as best I can. 'Till then, as far as who let you in on this particular thing, fuggedaboudit."

What can you ask more?!","A cheap, fun and solid deck, what can you ask more?!  This version is really versatile and can go first with card like Bagooska and Abyss Dweller but it shines going second with a good R4NK Toolbox and your insect desruptions.  The side deck is still on work as it is a bit expensive but the core of the deck is really budget as you can build it all with 50$ and top locals (someone recently got regional tops with a version of this).  It's good especially for OTKs but it do well in grind games too with resource cycling and Kaijus even in game 2 and 3.  In Master Rule 5 with all the XYZ Spam you'll do in Main Phase 2 it will be even better.  Have fun!"

I'm open for ","Most psy-frames deck consist in putting Psy-frame Circuit and Lamda in the field turn 1 and go from there. I wanted something else.  Just 2 Drivers and 1 Multi-threader, for more consistency. Pankratops it's just a really good card, 2600 ATK so you can try destroy something in BP and then blow it up to destroy something else and you get the field empty to activate the Frame-gears.  Cardcar D to even more consistency. A good normal summon that gives draw power and leaves the field empty.  Cyberse Gadget, Witch of the Black Forest and Summoner Monk are the Lvl 4 monsters to go to Time Thief Redoer, Psychic monster that can trigger Lambda's effect, it can banish itself for and empty field and use the Frame-gears, and is a good monster in general.  Summoner Monk is viable, the deck has 16 spell cards. Witch of the Black Forest effect can search the Frame-gears, Pankratops, Cyberse Gadget and Cardcar D. Only one Ash Blossom, the deck already has plenty of hand traps.  Lambda's materials to link summon make it perfect to use mind control in the deck. Only 1 Psychic Feel Zone, to not brick with multiple copies. Mystic Mine, a card that some decks still have problems with and it gives you some time.  Because Psy-Frame Overload banish itself from the GY, you can play PK Shane Brigandine as a level 4 monster for Redoer. By playing that Metaverse is no longer an option.  Sky Striker Widow Anchor, good card and with 15 other spell cards sometimes it can use the second effect and you get another material for Lambda."

Welcome to the only deck that can consistently set up negates without the use of a Normal Summon. Crus,"Servant to 1 - big deal! Electrumite gone - he was holding me back! Master Rule 2020 - who cares?! Pendulum is a deck that will, sadly, never die out. Good luck to all the Trif Gaming haters! With it's incredible power to completely shut off your opponent, and still OTK the next turn, there's no wonder that decks like Endymion make it to PPG feature matches (or even YCS top eights!). That's why I think it would be an appropriate time to show-off my Endymion build and prove to everyone just how powerful this deck can be - provided you read every wall of text that each card has to offer.  Something that first surprised me when making this adapted version of pendulum: is the Spellbook engine. It was always something prominent in the deck, but it has managed to expand now due to the constant need of getting counters on board. I've seen a lot of builds opt. for two Magician of Prophecy - which works just fine! However, since this deck is kind of tight on space, one is all I recommend you play. The reason behind this is that you always want to make Crowley before setting up your final board - this is easily achievable so don't sweat it. What he allows you to do is search out either one of your three Spellbook cards, so pray your opponent misses the Knowledge. If, for some odd reason, you manage to get the knowledge in hand but you don't have any targets - you run an Aleister the Invoker of Madness. He's can be used as a pitch-target, but he's also just a generic link-2 (which comes in handy way more often than you think).  People feared that the deck was dead due to Servant's sorrowful slandering that the banlist brought. But that's simply not the case. There are a plethora of ways to get him into your hand: albeit situational or not. Cards like Abductor, Mythical Institution, Spell Power Mastery and even hard-drawing the card itself are all a way to ensure you open full combo with the card. Speaking of Abductor - pendulum summoning him is no longer something necessarily bad. As we all know, SPYRAL is a deck roaming around the metagame recently, and so people are playing handtrap galore. Notably of course, Droll &amp; Lock bird. As I said my friends - reading the biblical scriptures that are pendulum cards could save you games. Thanks to that little bit of bottom text on the cards effect - you can search your Droll &amp; Lock bird straight from the deck if you have enough Spell Counters. Try Sleeper-ing that Michael State!  Overall: this deck is outstanding! It's interesting to see how a deck morphs due to the conditions it is in. I tried drawing some inspiration from other duelists playstyles, because there's simply so many ways of playing pendulum. In my opinion this deck is a 9.8/10. It can rely on its negates with ease - and never really falls flat when your board is broken. All it takes is drawing that one Chronograph Sorcerer and bam! You have another free negate on board plus a 2000 attack beatstick/fodder. Jackal King outs Nibiru. Secret Village outs spell-heavy decks. Mighty Master negates traps. Reflection spins problematic cards. There's simply so many things you can do with a deck this versatile! I'll definitely be trying it out in real life, and hopefully you take a shot at playing it too! Daddy Trif would be proud..."

Eldlich is brand new Spell and Trap-heavy archetype introduced in the Secret Slayers set. It's based on the myth of The Golden City - known famously as El Dorado. However, this isn't your standard Zombie Control-type deck. These new set of cards revolve around keeping card advantage: and getting as many cards as you possibly can to the grave in order to keep on plussing. So with my semi-brief synopsis out of the way - here's the card-by-card;  Now before any of you bat an eye and simply click away, this deck definitely has potential. There are many ways you could play this  - and it's all unique to the person (to some extent). The actual archetype itself can be split into three sub-categories: Eldlixir, Golden land, None of The Above. The thing that makes Eldlich stand out from other decks is its functions. Every card in the archetype besides Cursed El Dorlando can only function if the main monster is on board. This is a simple feat to overcome, as Eldorichie can special summon himself off-of his own effect. As for each category: the only thing you really have to note is each specific effect the cards have. Eldlixir of Red Splatter and Black Awakening both special summon a zombie monster; one from the hand or deck, the other from the graveyard. When they are banished, they can set a Golden Land card directly to your field. This is very dependant on your situation as, again, there are more than one type of Golden Land card. One of them is an archetype-specific Infernity Barrier - that in summary - gives you a free negate. The rest are all continuous trap-monsters. The ideal thing about the Eldlixir cards is they're non-specifications. You can easily end boards such as Vampire Sucker, Jack-O-Bolan, Eldorichie and a Balerdroch in grave for your opponent turn. Many people have started running Pot of Extravagance in the main deck: but I believe Magicians' Souls is simply more optimal in this situation. You a) get a free monster that, in tandem with Zombie World, becomes fodder for Vampire Sucker b) allows you a free draw 2 for the cost of spell/traps c) lets you use said spell/traps for more extending. The aim is always have advantage in hand-size but also board presence. You rarely use the extra deck - so I've sort-of tailored it to my preference. If you wish to change feel free to do so. The only cards I'd recommend keeping are Vampire Sucker at 3, Needlefiber and PSY-Framelord Omega.  Overall: this deck is a 8.1/10 for now. We are <em>very</em> early into its release so it's hard to tell how this deck will face under the format. For now - I can see it doing rather alright. Definitely a considerable opponent in the rogue tier. It introduces a weird, but somehow refreshing way of playing zombies and - at least in my opinion - is the best one out of the Slayer Three so far. The only major downside is El Dorlando and Adelantado being unsearchable. Perhaps if their name was changed, this deck would be more of a honourable foe. Nonetheless, I hope we will get more quirky archetypes like these in the future. I'd like to see the direction Konami will take us..."

Surely, this TeleDad Orcust is not as consistent as Junk Orcust, but it allows for more aggressive plays with DaD. I've decided to use Stardust Dragon as my Synchro monster, which is the classic choice for TeleDad, as it gives you a little more protection. Other viable choices are Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend for a nuke-play and Borreload Savage Dragon if you plan to use emergency teleport in later game states, when you already have linkmonsters in your graveyard. Of course, you could also play multiple synchro monsters, but I've found that Extra Deck space is too sparce for that.  This deck has two perfect starting hands:  1: Dark Grepher; D-HERO Malicious; Emergency Teleport; Dark armed Dragon; Orcust Cymbal Skeleton. This Hand lets you go into a Dingirsu with one XYZ-                    Material, a Stardust Dragon, a Dark Armed Dragon and a D-HERO Malicious on your field in your first turn. So two proctections, three bodies and the Malicious can      be used for a link play in your next turn. Personally, I recommend destroying one or more of your opponents cards with DaD first and then linking the DaD, Stardust      Dragon and Malicious into a BLS - Soldier of Chaos in your second turn.  2: Orcust Brass Bombard; Orcust Cymbal Skeleton; Orcust Knightmare; Dark Grepher; The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch. This Hand lets you set up your      field for a True King of all Calamities summon in your opponents turn, which will lock them out of their Monster effects.  But as is common with Orcust Decks, most hands will let you end your turn on atleast a Dingirsu with one XYZ-material.  I've set up the side deck to deal with most currently relevant decks.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

With the first release of the Time Thief archetype and them being common I thought I'll collect them anyways. At this moment I had no idea what to do because there wasn't a Lv.3 monster for E-Tele.  About two weeks ago with the IGAS Set release (new Time Thiefs!) another interesting archetype appeared - Plunder Patroll! I like vikings and their artwork is kinda cute so I started collecting them. And with them relying on a permanent trap card I guessed this is pretty balanced and could be the stuff for interesting duels.  The Invoked archetype is something I learned to love while playing Duel Links. So I decided to open some booster and give it a try. Maybe this will change because way back in 2014 I played a Spirit deck with generic Lv.4 support when xyz ""swarming"" was still a thing (which will be again with Master Rule 5 I guess), so the Invoked will make room for some old friends like Kagetokage.  So I have this old Spirit Deck of mine in mind, collected the Lv.4 Time Thief cards (and their spell/trap support) and apparently the Plunder Patroll Main deck monsters are also Lv.4 - it struck me like lightning and the deck idea was born. I brought them all together and spiced them with some modern Lv.4 support like Perfomages (and other stuff you can take a look at in my deck list).  And this is where you guys come in - I would like to thank you in advance for your comments and ideas about this moment of insanity of mine, because I want to cap the card count around 40. Hint: in my oppinion Redoer is still boss of this deck."

One deck was the Advanced Crystal Beasts Deck and the other one was a Sacred Beasts Deck very similar to the one Kagemaru used against Jaden except with additional Sacred Beast Support. This one is based on the Sacred Beast deck she used while controlling Jesse Anderson. Yubel received new support for her Sacred Beasts Anime Deck and i incorporated the new support into this deck.

Behemoths, Oh ya.","This is a deck I've been testing that focuses on more the behemoths and bricking less with them.  Your main starts are either Hidden City + Guru or Archer due to their ability to get a big boy to your hand or straight to the field. A few wild support cards I found to be pretty hand is Burst Rebirth, Trap Trick, and Pot of Forbidden (PoF). Rebirth allows you send a behemoth or pot to the grave and get it back at 2k LP which is steep yes, but the amount of times I had this card face down to revive like Ultra, PoF, or Umaster flipped games for me. Trap trick allows to search almost all the traps in the deck. PoF is a strong flip card that can be sent by Glacier or Succession and revived with Rebirth is a good start to turns or stopping plays if your opponent doesn't plan for it, but it is a major brick in the hand."

A sort of complicated combo toolbox, where the goal is to loop through Saryuja, ending on big board states that differ depending on the matchup.  So for starters, we have some interaction. 2 Ash, 2 Crow, 2 Droll, and 3 Called. I like this split, since there is incidental value in Droll's attribute and Crow's type, and with Saryuja the deck can often pick and keep the right-hand trap for the situation.  For the maindeck engine we have 3 Seyfert as well as Black Dragon and White Dragon. It's basically a one card link 2 on the low end, and they can also serve as extenders in games where Saryuja summon REDM.  For Rokkets we have 3 Tracer, 2 each of Magnarokket and Silverrokket, and a Recharger, which can be an amazing extender in some games, working as a virtual Monster Reborn for an extra REDM effect. Absorouters come with the package, they're free special summons, Sangans, and graveyard effects that search. Very useful card, which makes a lot of the boss monster possible, particularly Borreload Savage.  Black Metal Dragon is a Sangan for Darkness Metal, very useful for being another 1 card link 2 (low-end). Sometimes this can be an extender, when you're summoning REDM off of Saryuja and using Espy to start your Black Dragon/White Dragon loop by finding Seyfert.  Destrudo is obligatory, its a free dragon Special Summon, the only graveyard dragon worth talking about that can be lower than level 4 easily, life points don't matter. This card makes things possible.  Tempest is an interesting one. It searches REDM with Droll, which is relevant. It also helps make rank 8 Xyz Monsters, puts easy damage on the table, and works as a fairly generic link extender too.  Chaos Dragon Levianeer gives us a way to snipe hands, and also make rank 8 Xyz. The deck is mostly dark dragons with some light, so the best 2 effects are on the table here.  Galactic Spiral Dragon makes rank 8s easily, and is another easy cheap extender, particularly good out of the graveyard.  For Spells we have one Boot Sector Launch and one Dragon Ravine. You could run 2 Boot Sector Launch, but it feels bricky to me with all the searching. If you do run a third Striker to search it - you still often need 2 to full combo.  Dragon Shrine and Foolish Burial pitch Dragons into the bin. Super useful cards, my favourite play is to pitch Absorouter Dragon to search, then banish it for White Dragon. But these are super useful for making Titanic Galaxy, or even just pitching Destrudo.  Boot Sector Launch is a clear 3 of. It's a special summon out of the deck, with a lot of relevant targets (mostly Tracer) and very few (no) relevant restrictions. There's also a single Dragon Ravine, basically a searchable Foolish Burial.  Dragon's Mirror, the card I always forget about. This card is a one-card Pankratops that you can play going first, that also works as a combo extender out of the GY, and is bigger and a Dragon. Borreload Furious needs to see way more play IMO.  Lastly, we have 1 Monster Reborn. Low-end this card is worse than the Guardragon spell, but can still be relevant for getting you rolling. But its real place is to extend Darkness Metal combos.  I've already gushed about Borreload Furious Dragon, but it bears repeating - the card is powerful. Sometimes just being that extra special summon + a summon out the GY lets you end on some pretty insane boardstates out of otherwise low-end hands, and its also just a beefier Pankratops on the low end.  Borreload Savage is our Omni-Negate of choice. It's nice making him with two monsters. Remember, in most situations you should be holding onto Tracer to fire him off and make this at the last minute or near to it.  I've swapped Dingirsu out for Draco Berserker. The deck needs a good generic level 8 Synchro for low end plays, and I've found myself A) making Number 38 easily once I learned the loops, and B) making Number 38 more often. Dingirsu is good, space is just tight.  Number 38 looks to be the best Dragon Rank 8 Xyz, which becomes relevant thanks to Pisty and Elpy. It lets us set up boards that are resistant to Super Poly, since you can end on mostly Light Monsters and still feel pretty good about yourself. It's another Omni-Negate, which with tight play (and a couple extenders) can be put up beside Borroload Savage. You can also believably play around Nibiru with this card and others, and negate Evenly and Lightning Storm, meaning we're worried about Dark Ruler explicitly and not a lot else. I added this card just to cover the deck's niche weaknesses, and so far it's easier to summon than I expected.  For Links we have 2 Striker, 1 Romulus, to search field spells. You're often using both of these field spells on the same turn, but you're also surprisingly often shuffling them back into the deck with Saryuja, (basically, given all the searching) to use the increased hand size to find extenders or keep hand traps. Romulus CAN special summon monsters when you link climb Pisty and Elpy under it - while it's usually better to hold back, the ability to link them away after firing off Rokket Tracer (or even use them as Synchro or Xyz material still) does come up. The card is a headache for decision making, but it is very good. Usually, just keep the D.D. Crow or Tracer in your hand.  Saryuja is basically what the deck is built around. Just having that level of card selection makes it easy to put up the right lines of interaction for the right matchup, and you can blindfire him and feel pretty good about hitting a level 4 monster or Quick Launch. Pisty and Elpy are essential to this engine - all of these arrows work really well. You can resurrect this with REDM to make easy Link-4s.  We'd be running Borrelsword anyways, for the OTK potential, but it's worth noting its arrows are well placed for Pisty and Elpy loops out of Romulus and Striker Dragon. That's basically all Striker is here for, he's a good emergency link-3 that's easy to make and helps clear your board up to help make better states, and gives us outs in multiple situations. Also, the negation effect is super good occasionally.  Borreload Dragon is a good way to snipe Monsters with protection, not all protection, but enough, and a beastly boss monster. Being harder to remove than Borrelsword actually makes it the go-to going first, especially since its ability becomes non-targeting sending to the GY with Magnarokket (both do this). This might actually be the cut for Borrelend Dragon when it comes to the TCG, sad to say. But maybe not. The card is good.  Unchained Abomination is more Spell-Speed 2 removal, and is particularly relevant in back-row matchups, but is also notable for just being an easy-to-make advantage engine.  Hieratic Seal is super easy to make, and offers one line of interaction on its own, plus fodder for your Borrel boss monsters to do their thing. It also make Abomination triggers easily (by searching Tracer), alongside non-targeting sending, and stealing, and beating over, and oh-so many destruction effects... If you get lucky you might even have some hand traps, and if you play it right you'll have a field spell when you need one.  I like this deck.  No Apollousa, because she's not dark or a dragon. Every time I try her I find her almost impossible to summon.  I'm trying Upstart Goblin in a flex slot, since I like running 39 cards more than 1 special summon (I think)."

The new supports for Machina making it interesting to play and experiment. This deck focusing on the control aspect of the archetype while having big beaters. Not only Inspector Boarder is a great stun/floodgate (whatever the term is), it also fulfills the requirement of Machina Overdrive to summon other Machina from deck, notably Machina Citadel (or Colonel).  No more explanation needed as it is a backrow heavy control deck with typical set 5 pass, but there is some interaction that you need to pay attention to. You can summon Machina Fortress from hand/GY even if you have Boarder face-up, Machina Overdrive can both use Boarder as fodder or recycle it from GY/banished, Machina Air Raider and Irradiator cant summon monster with higher level than the fodder they used (cant summon Citadel if theyre using themselves as fodder), also both cant be summoned while Boarder is face-up, Machina Reformation best target is Irradiator + Megaform as it can fetch Citadel from deck  (doesnt draw, so it goes well with Extravagance)."

Most monsters have rather high attack power and you are capable of doing all summons although pendulum summoning maybe difficult. It has some very unique but powerful card combos and prides itself on its level 8 monsters. It includes odd-eyes dragons and very mainstream magic and trap cards that prove useful in most if not all situations. It's an over all powerful deck that is made to crush your opponent with overwhelming force no matter how low your life points are.

You want to prioritize turbo'ing Abyss Dweller ASAP because Dweller is so powerful. The hand traps should give you an edge to block most decks' extension. Pyro Phoenix is now viable since Dingirsu isn't EVERYWHERE in the meta. If you do happen to come across Orcust, dont make Pyro. Linguriboh is your answer to Evenly Matched however it does turn on Super Poly, so use it with caution. Sanctum engine breaks all the combo decks and will force them to scoop since you can set up so much, go +3 or more and just shut them down."

The deck gains an additional amount of power with Unchained Abomination, when you trigger your Rokkets effects you get to pop an additional card on the field. The deck has been built in a way to give you a variety of different ways to reach 4 Dragon monsters and start your combo but the best version of this sees you open Rokket Tracer, Quick Launch and Absorouter Dragon in the opening hand. <ul>  	<li>Normal Summon Rokket Tracer</li>  	<li>Activate Quick Launch</li>  	<li>Chain Tracer to the activation of this effect</li>  	<li>Special Summon Silverrokket Dragon from the deck</li>  	<li>Special another Rokket (it doesn't matter, so long as it's not Magnarokket)</li>  	<li>Special Summon Absorouter Dragon from your hand.</li>  	<li>Link Absorouter and one of your Rokkets into Galaxy Satellite Dragon</li>  	<li>Search Rokket Recharger off of Absorouter's Effect</li>  	<li>Link the two remaining Rokkets into Guardragon Elpy and Pisty.</li>  	<li>Activate Pisty to summon a Rokket from the GY.

Link Keeper of the Shrine, Quadborrel Dragon and the other Rokket that isn't Silverrokket into Borreload Dragon.</li>  	<li>Activate Borreload's Effect on Silverrokket and chain Silverrokket to banish one of your opponent's extra deck monsters.</li>  	<li>Link Dillingerous Dragon and Galaxy Satellite Dragon into Unchained Abomination.</li>  	<li>During the End Phase, summon a Magnarokket from deck.</li>  	<li>During your opponent's turn you can now send one of their monsters to the graveyard and disrupt their strategy in the process.</li> </ul> If you had an additional Rokket in hand when you revive Tracer, you can use Boot Sector Launch to summon Tracer and the Rokket and synchro into Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend but this tactic would only really be any good with Borreload Savage Dragon instead."

I know many people may disagree, but the deck still has powerful capabilities. All it needs is a bit of tweaking and","To be honest - I don't know why that many people hated Striker. Sure its drawing to its second year of being meta since its release, and yes, it was prevalent even as an engine in many decks. But the deck basically did nothing wrong! Okay - it did make Striker Orcust take up all 8 spots in a YCS top cut, and maybe it was the reason people began siding specific cards against the deck but...that doesn't mean they did something wrong right? Sky Striker is and, will be, one of Yugioh's best engines. Not only was the deck an absolute powerhouse by itself - it fueled the ever-popular Striker Orcust in its prime time not too long ago. But can it uphold it's reputation even after its key card was banned? Yes. That's why I'd like to present; Pure Sky Striker (post January 2020 banlist).  When a deck's playstyle is ruined - people often revert to how they originally played, as that is the most optimal way now that something is gone. That's why I, and a lot of others, have decided to run Darkest Diabolos. For those of you unaware to its purpose - Diabolos is a 3000 attack beatstick that can reoccur itself if a DARK attribute monster is tributed. Since you always use Raye to start your combos, what's better than to get more fodder along with her. This lord of the lair can easily be used as tribute for ningirsu or most likely Sieg. Think about it this way: 1 Striker Card Destroyed = Free Sieg.  Sieg can also be summoned of off the newly released, Sky Striker Ace - Roze. This card does - in concept - the same thing as Diabolos, just worded differently. If you summon a Sky Striker monster - you get to summon out Roze. It's that simple. The final and by far biggest change, is the addition of Pot of MBT....oh sorry, Pot of Extravagance. Engage (rest in peace) was our only way of searching and drawing. Now that it's gone: people have been trying to find alternative ways to continue plussing. Luckily for us - we can now max out on each of our link monsters, meaning there is no fear in banishing a copy. Along with that, another pot has been thrown in the mix. To balance out our extra deck - Pot of Avarice prevents us from burning out resources too quickly. Yes you have to draw it - but when you do the odds will shift drastically in your favour.  Overall: I'd give this deck a 8.1/10. It definitely took a hit from the banlist - but that doesn't stop it from being viable. Do I think it is dead? No. I myself even believe that Konami will release support for the deck. Although, probably not any time soon. The build itself is solid, and I don't feel like there's much to change about it. The only reason this analysis was so short is that Striker has cookie-cutter combos. It has been doing the same thing for the past 2 years and many people are getting tired of it. But I feel that the deck isn't dead just yet - and neither is any other..."

I've removed the two Tsuchinokos for three Apprentice Illusionist Magicians, so it is possible to choose what to discard, granting more secure combo extensions. The A.I.M. alongside D-Hero Malicious, also is a level 6 monster, enabling Krebons to synchro with it fot the newly added Borreload-Savage Dragon.  The one-of Mathematician also is a newcomer to this deck. I was opting for two or three, but I wanted to keep in both, Destrudo and Gizmek Orochi as combo extenders, rather than having more combo starters, as in my opinion, Orcust has enough of them, even Orcustrated Return can be a combo starter under the right circumstances, which are plentiful in this deck.  Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion also can act as a potential combo starter, milling three cards from the top of your deck, each time that a card is added from your deck to your graveyard, and letting you move a card of your choice from your Deck to your Graveyard every turn, without any restrictions on what that card can be.  Barricadeborg Blocker also lets you discard any card each turn, even when you do not have any Continuous- or FIeldspell in your graveyard, as the discard is a cost. The add from graveyard to hand effect will simply not resolve then. As Barricadeborg Blocker also is a Dark Machine Monster, you can summon him in a turn in which you have used Orcust-Crescendo.  Elsewhise, the usual Orcust strategies will work as always."

Consistent Borrelend + Savage + ","I was building dragon link with Orcust before, but since harp was banned, extending to Orcust is now very difficult. So I come with another gameplan, because Verte is like a new Knightmare Mermaid, means you can have it as plan B or C if your combo fails. Super consistent setup with many different extenders (so it doesnt matter if it hard once per turn since we're running many different ones). Combo is like regular dragon link, with little modification, like if we're playing in MR4, we need to pay attention for link marker for Dragun and Savage (summoning Savage first, then summoning link monster in another extra zone so we can open up for Verte then Dragun). Borrelend is also can target Silverrokket to snipe opponent Super Poly target like Starving Venom, Dragostapelia, @Ignister Golem, or even their primary extra deck monster.  You may ask, why <a data-name=""Chamber Dragonmaid"">Chamber Dragonmaid</a>? The answer is it's your second <a data-name=""Seyfert"">Seyfert</a>, making us playing 6 starters. Chamber searches Hospitality on summon (both normal or ss, so can work with Gateway Dragon, even better than normal summoning Seyfert and tributing itself), link off Chamber for Striker Dragon, use Hospitality ss Chamber from GY, and now you have free link 2 (Romulus or Beat Cop if locked into dark because Rokket Synchron or Tracer). Basic end board is to have Borrelend + Savage and/or Dragun depends on our hands. We play minimal Rokket monsters because the recovery aspect (follow up play) is relying on Dragun as we can easily summon the second one using Magicalized Fusion (searchable from Verte, a generic link 2) and Borrelend is a disruption by itself, no need to target a Rokket monster to disrupt.  Dragon's Mirror used to summon Borreload Furious as it can act as disruption or extender and even reviving our godly link 5 Borrelend (cant activate its effect, but we still have the passives like protection and atking all monsters each). I was playing Destrudo but changed it to Tempest, Dragon Ruler beacuse Verte needs a 2k LP therefore making you left with 2k LP after using both, even non OTK deck can kill you easily (can play Galactic Spiral Dragon too).  Pros: Ultra consistent board with backup plan if playing through handtraps, multiple negations, hard hitters with protection, Dragun can pop 2 non targeting destruction, can follow up with great play even after they break our board.  Cons: Still has no prevention to Kaijus, Sphere Mode, Lava Golem, Santa Claws etc. Sometimes opponent has multiple Super Poly target in their extra deck."

However if you don't draw good cards you will be in serious trouble, this deck is best to start at 2 because it doesn't do much at 1 and if it is at 2 and you haven't pulled the hikari you have a chance to draw it and specially invoked it and dps summon a lady past or light, the best possible hand is a lady light or past, fortune lady calling, time passage, bending destiny is a solemn because you can invoke lady past or light and then use fortune lady calling to call fortune lady light then u activate the time's passage to raise the level of lady past by 3 so she goes to lvl 4 dps u activate the effect of lady past and select her as target monster and banish lady light to summon lady fire or lady water, here are 2 situations: if you started first you need to reduce the level of lady past by 1 for her to return to level 3 so with the effect of the lady light that when removed from the field by card effect she can summon any lady from the deck, then you invoke the lady water and with the dps you f az synchro summon of lady every in defense mode already if you are 2 and the opponent already has monsters on the field you summon lady fire instead of lady light and this you raise lady past level to 5 because lady fire is level 2 and in this you activate the lady fire effect and destroy an opponent's monster and still he takes damage equal to that monster's attack and with that you invoke lady every and dps can attack dnv depending on the monster you destroyed you can still OTK more if u with 2 time's passage"

This is a pure <strong>Mekk-Knight </strong>deck with some situation-depending monsters in the Extra Deck.  I highly recommend to take a few minutes to read this if you're new to Mekk-Knights.  <strong>Gameplay:</strong>  This deck is strongly depending on how many cards are on the opponent's side of the field. The basic Gameplay is to special summon all monsters, except for Mekk-Knight Orcust Girsu and Ash-Blossom (if needed). You have the best chances to win if your opponent starts the first turn of the duel.  As you can see I'm a big fan of control cards such like: <strong>Kaiju</strong>'s and <strong>Mind Control</strong>. Of course you can extend the deck to your play style, but I think adding more cards that will counter your opponent will also brick yourself. The Sidedeck includes what's playable and reliable. I wouldn't really recommend to go over 40 (max. 45) cards.  <strong>Combos:</strong>  First of all: place any of your Spell, Traps face-down in columns your opponent also occupied one place so you can start special summoning. Watch out what to place, could happen that your opponent activates a <em>Mystical Space Typhoon</em> or <em>Twin Twister </em>and that could interrupt your combo because your spells are also important.  <strong>Keep in mind: </strong>The Quick-Spell <strong>World Legacy's Memory </strong><em>can't be activated the turn you set</em> it and is also your only summoning restriction card! I would recommend to avoid playing it early in your turn and keep it as last resort, either as protection wall for the opponent's round or the last summon to get your Link monster out.  The basic starter includes getting a <strong>Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall </strong>out. It's basically your deck search and hand extender. If you can play him in your turn, activate his effect and banish himself, so you can keep him for your next round and just search for whatever you need, I would also recommend to search <strong>Mekk-Knight Blue Sky </strong>because he's your second ""extender monster"" in the Main Deck.  If you don't have him in the hand try getting out an <strong>Mekk-Knight Blue Sky </strong>or <strong>Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star</strong>.  <strong>Mekk-Knight Indigo Eclipse </strong>is basically a free special summon and in mid-game your protection and negation (more on this later), beside to <strong>Purple Nightfall </strong>(protection). Summon him and move him into another Main Monster Zone (MMZ) you can't special summon right now into it (e.g. no cards in the column) to make space for another special summon from your hand.  If summoning <strong>Mekk-Knight Blue Sky</strong> from your hand, by it's own effect, you should have in mind a priority order on what to search (effect), depending on your available (in hand and on the field) cards in that moment and the quantity of searchable cards . A few examples on priority search, orderer from 1-3 cards searchable: <ul>  	<li><strong>Blue Sky</strong> is the only monster you have available right now? <strong>Purple Nightfall, Indigo Eclipse, Orcust Girsu.</strong></li>  	<li>Added <strong>Blue Sky</strong>, due to <strong>Purple Nightfall</strong>'s effect? <strong>Indigo Eclipse, Orcust Girsu, </strong>other Mekk-Knight depending on Board constellation.</li>  	<li>Missing only a normal summon? <strong>Orcust Girsu, Purple</strong> <strong>Nightfall</strong> ,<strong> Indigo Eclipse </strong>(Purple and Indigo are for your next turn).</li> </ul> <em>Mekk-Knight Red Moon, Mekk-Knight Yellow Star, Mekk-Knight Green Horizon and Mekk-Knight Orange Sunset </em>are situation depending to activate their effects. Don't be scared to use Red Moon's and Yellow Star's effects, just keep in mind you can only return 2 of your banished cards, so again I would recommend a priority order what to banish to: If you are early in the game and don't have a big quantity on what to banish go with this priority order (first is less in value): <em>Orange Sunset, Green Horizon, Red Moon, Blue Sky, Yellow Star,</em> <em>Orcust Girsu, Purple Nightfall, Indigo Eclipse. </em>  After playing for a while you'll either understand the whole priority listing or do one on your own experience/game style.  <strong>Lib the World</strong> <strong>Keymaster </strong>should be if possible your first link summon. Keep in mind you can only summon her if a <strong>World Legacy</strong> card is in your GY. I recommend to summon her after summoning <strong>Orcust Girsu</strong> (send 1 <strong>World Legacy - ""World Crown""</strong> from your deck to the GY). Depending on your opportunities either set a negation Spell/Trap ( <strong>World Legacy Key, World Legacy Whispers, World Legacy's Secret</strong> ) or a Spell that allows you to special summon ( <strong>World Legacy's Memory, World Legacy Succession</strong> ).  Your goal should always be to end your turn with at least 1 negation ( I recommend <strong>World Legacy's Secret </strong>because it's the monster negation and you can special summon <strong>Indigo Eclipse</strong> from your GY after wasting him for a Link summon ), 1 <strong>Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star </strong>and an banished <strong>Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall</strong>. Everything that exceeds this is even better. If you succesfully reached this constellation on your side of the board you're already good to go, just repeat the process until you have 1 <strong>Mekk-Knight Avramax</strong>, 1 <strong>Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star </strong>and in every other column a Mekk-Knight and all 3 of your negation-spell/traps out.  <strong>Good to know:</strong>  Every <em>Mekk-Knight</em> can only be summoned once per Turn from the hand (hard OpT).  If using <strong>World Legacy's Memory </strong>and you haven't already played a <strong>Purple Nightfall</strong>, special summon him and use his effect on himself (decreases the chance to end up with 2 copies of him in your hand and only be able to special summon 1).  <strong>World Legacy's Memory </strong>restricts you from summoning anything else then Mekk-Knights after activating it!  <strong>Indigo Eclipse</strong>'s effect is a <em>Quick Effect </em>/ <em>Spell Speed 2</em>. You can react to every card except for restrictions and Counter Traps to move one of your Mekk-Knights into another Column to prevent the resolve of an effect. Example: You posses <em>World Legacy Whisper </em>(Spell negation) and <em>Indigo Eclipse in the MMZ next to your GY (first from right from your POV). Your Opponent activates Trade-In in the mid column. You could chain Indigo Eclipse's effect to target itself and move it into the mid column. The effect of Trade-In won't resolve.</em>  <strong>World Legacy Succession </strong>is your second <em>Monster Reborn.</em> Keep in mind that World Legacy's Secret only allows you to special summon a Lv5 or higher monster from your GY. So beside Monster Reborn, <em>World Legacy Succession </em>is your only way to special summon a Link/XYZ monster from your GY.  Link summoning  <strong>Knightmare Unicorn </strong>with <strong>Lib the World Keymaster</strong> and activating <em>Knightmare Unicorn</em>'s effect if summoned allows you to chain Lib's effect. In summary you can shuffle 2 cards from the field into the deck. Pay attention on your chain activation, because if your opponent can negate one of the effect's that resolved it shouldn't be Lib's (doesn't target).  <strong>Kaiju</strong>'s supposed to get rid of annoying monsters <strong>and </strong>change the board constellation! If you still have a Mekk-Knight in your hand you could possibly summon but there isn't any MMZ with 2 occupied card slots in the same column, special summon the Kaiju to your opponent's side of the field to your advantage."

A synchro based deck with focus on DARK Dragon Synchro monster mainly due to Crimson Resonator's effect. A really fun deck to play but not really meta worthy. It easily loses to hand traps which is why I am using 3 Called by the Grave's in the deck. Super Polymerization is also really nasty against the deck since my first turn usually ends with Super Nova and Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss on my field. Two DARK targets for Starving Venom. I am using Back to the Front to try and survive it but there is no countering it. I lost several times just to that one card. the Edge Imp engine is there because they are searchable with Command Resonator and because they can generate some much needed card advantage.

However, milling improves the speed of the Deck and many ""Lightsworn"" cards benefit from having many ""Lightsworn"" monsters in the Graveyard. A primary focus of this Deck is to quickly summon ""judgement dragon"", which may be Special Summoned while there are 4 or more different ""Lightsworn"" monsters in the Graveyard. ""Judgment Dragon"" can quickly clear the field and attack directly. This strategy is most useful when running a small Deck, and has the potential to turn the tables in your favor before your opponent can get too much of a foothold."

First use the hidden city for subterror guru, then use pre-prep for tarotrei and prediction ritual, activate prediction ritual sending the high level monster to summon tarotrei. use world legacy monstrocity to summon pot of the forbidden and deus-x-krawler from deck,  next because they both get destroyed anyways during the end phase link them away for a subterror behemoth fiendess. use fiendess effect to send a flip from the deck to the GY mostly umastryx then set either a high level flip monster you may have drawn in the zone she points to or set guru by her effect. Next use the hidden city to flip Guru face up, searching a subterror fiendess. Subterror behemoth fiendess other effect activates and you get to add a flip from GY or deck to hand, search ultramafaus or umastryx. Now you can normal summon subterror fiendess, activate her effect setting the Guru to special summon umastryx from GY in face up def position.  Now go to end phase and tarotrei activates her effect to set a flip from the gy or the hand, set Deus-x-krawler from the GY and during the oponents standby phase use tarotrei to flip Deus-X-krawler to face up atack mode, this makes deus-x live and your oponent can no longer use monster effects on their side of the field.  This is the absolute best opening you can hope for, you have a permanent skill drain from deus-x for your oponent, you have the omni negate from subterror fiendess in case they have spell/trap removal such as lightning storm or evenly matched and battle protection from the hidden city and your now set umastryx that banishes a monster when flipped by hidden city.  It is a really fun deck that I have been working on for almost 2 years and have played pretty sucesfully at locals and online. Build it if you want and thanks for reading this."

If too much Shaddolls are x3 or even x2 the deck would brick.  Beast is x2 because you don't want it in the hand when you start the duel since is a level 5, so is better having it in the deck and special summon it from there or send it to the GY. Still is a very good card since is a +1 and when flipped can send and activate another Shaddoll, but usually other plays are preferred.  Ariel, Falco, Dragon, and Hedgehog are all more situational and you special summon, set or send them to the GY depending on what you need the most at the moment. For this reason every single one of them is fine with x1 copy.  Mathematician is a great card, basically is another Squamata when normal summoned, a +1 when destroyed in battle and a fusion material for El Shaddoll Shekinaga.  As for the Performages, Damage Juggler and Trick Clown are precious fusion material for El Shaddoll Construct. Plus Trick Clown can special a Performage (even itself) when sent to the GY, while Damage Juggler allow you to add a Trick Clown from the deck to the hand.  Shaddoll Fusion, El Shaddoll Fusion and Super Polymerization are the cards you need the most together with the monsters of course, and you can recover the first and the second with Hedgehog, Core and El Shaddoll monsters when sent to the GY.  Foolish burial is another Squamata / Mathematician but is a spell, so you can use it with them (before or after) to activate more Shaddolls and speed up your plays (same for Resh Shaddoll Incarnation by banishing it from the GY, speed up your plays by flipping monsters you have set this turn, beside it's another Monster Reborn when used from the field).  Allure of darkness and Upstart goblin speed up your game too, but note than Allure is not always beneficial. As for Pot of avarice is a fantastic card since you will have a very big GY and fill it quickly, so you can fusion summon again and again.  Mind control (like Monster reborn and the traps) extends your plays by giving you more material for link summon and fusion summon, especially when you need su summon Cross-Sheep, since link summoning is not an effect and Shaddolls secondary effects would not activate, so you can use monsters you already activated in your GY or the opponent's monsters.  As for the Extra deck, El Shaddoll Construct is your main beater along with Borrelsword (but this one is more used to finish to opponent when you're certain you can do it), Winda (especially her), Shekinaga, Grysta, Anoyatyllis and Apkallone are your main control tools. Remember to summon Winda as last monster or you will lock yourself with her effect.  Violet chimera, Starving venom fusion dragon and Grysta (except if you add Ash blossom or Salamangreat Almiraj) are all Super poly targets.  Cross-Sheep is maybe the best extender you have in the whole deck (every time you summon a fusion in a linked zone you resurrect a material from the GY), Gravity controller is mainly used in combo with El Shaddoll Construct, Ariel and and Resh Shaddoll Incarnation to special summon again Construct (fusion), Shaddoll Construct (link) is another good extender, a El Shaddoll Construct material and another fusion spell in case you don't draw one (another one very good link who can fusion summon is Predaplant Verte Anaconda, upcoming in Duel Overload, so look into it in March).  Of course the Invoked Shaddoll version is more powerful, but some Invoked cards are probably being banned in few months, since this combination works too much well, so I preferred going with a pure build since I don't attend the biggest events at the moment but I'm just going at locals."

Don't summon until you used up your Gigantes and/or Seekers.  <a data-name=""Gigantes"">Gigantes</a> x2: Played more for what it is, rather then what it does. Easy to summon level 4 that will instantly get you to your important Synchros. Can be a decent beater in a pinch. Banish Seeker or Glow-up bulb to SS it if you can.  <a data-name=""Sentry Soldier of Stone"">Sentry Soldier of Stone</a> x2:  Good discard fodder and your main way to Naturia Beast, as it SS itself afterwards as long as you have at least one monster out.  <a data-name=""Doki Doki"">Doki Doki</a> x2: Decent NS if you have one of the level 4 Rocks in hand, as it lets you discard them and bring another one to the field for more plays.  <a data-name=""Glow-up bulb"">Glow-up bulb</a>: Its glow-up bulb, you play it so that you can access Naturia beast or Needlefiber easier. Run one because you can only use it's effect once per duel.  <a data-name=""Ash blossom &amp; Joyous spring"">Ash blossom &amp; Joyous spring</a> x2: Hand trap staple, use it to prevent your opponent from getting a big field out.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Analyzer"">Adamatia Analyzer</a> x3: Your best first turn option. She's level 4, so if you excavate any of the Rocks you have an instant Dragite. Her SS condition is really only useful if you go second, but it has saved me on more than one occasion.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Researcher"">Adamatia Researcher</a> x3: The best of the level 2 tuners, her SS condition is the easiest to fulfill, only needing a rock monster on field. She normally leads to a level 6 synchro or crystal wing if one of them is already on the field.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Seeker"">Adamatia Seeker</a> x3: Easily the worst of the 3 turners, requiring an Adamatia monster to SS itself. Other than that it's the same as Researcher.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Crysta - Leonite"">Adamatia Crysta - Leonite</a> and <a data-name=""Adamatia crysta - Raptite"">Adamatia crysta - Raptite</a> x2: Both of these function the same, use their SS effects to bring back another level 4 rock or a tuner for recycling. After their respective Synchros hits the graveyard, activate its graveyard effect to recycle them and keep the cycle going.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Crysta - Dragite"">Adamatia Crysta - Dragite</a> x3: Best of the non tuner rocks. Lets you draw more cards; really useful if you put something on the top of your deck you want. Even gets the draw off of Sign.  <strong>Spells</strong>  <a data-name=""Called by the grave"">Called by the grave</a> x2: Anti-hand trap for the most part, you can also use it to stop a floating effect or screw over cards that copy names.  <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> x2: Better MST, and it sets up your Graveyard.  <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>: Used to search the field-spell, kinda obvious though. Run at 2 if it ever gets unlimited.  <a data-name=""Adamatia sign"">Adamatia sign </a>x3: Archetypal monster reborn, use it to recycle your tuners to bring out more synchros, make sure to put one of the non tuners on the top of your deck so you can bring them out with Raptite or add them to your hand with Leonite.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Laputite"">Adamatia Laputite</a> x2: Not a super important card, but one that makes your plays way more consistent. Only bring one card you want to bring out to the top of your deck and put ones you don't want to see with it so that they'll be at the bottom of the deck after the one you actually wanted is used up. Combos really well with Dragite if you still have adamatia monsters in your deck, letting you bounce 5 cards back.  <strong>Traps</strong>  <a data-name=""Adamatia Relieve"">Adamatia Relieve</a> x2: Pretty useful, lets you destroy at least 2 of your opponents monsters. I only tend to use it if I have extra non tuner rocks on the field.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Resonance"">Adamatia Resonance</a> x2: The worst Adamatia card, run by preference but I like it. Especially if my opponents have annoying monster effects or handtraps.  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  <a data-name=""Crystal wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal wing Synchro Dragon</a>: Your main boss monster you go into after you use the level 6's effects. Negates everything and beats even harder.  <a data-name=""T.G. Hyper Librarian"">T.G. Hyper Librarian</a>: Nice level 5 to go into, you wanna try and summon this guy before anyone else if you can. Free cards man.  <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a>: Really easy to summon, negates problematic spells and sets up your graveyard.  <a data-name=""Martial Metal Marcher"">Martial Metal Marcher</a>: Mostly used as a target for Needlefiber's banish effect. Nice body, though not really useful for the Synchros that are in here. Run if you want.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Rise - Dragite"">Adamatia Rise - Dragite</a> x2: The best of the 3 synchro rocks, lets you bounce back cards without targeting. Negates spell and traps as well if you have its Rock form in the graveyard  <a data-name=""Adamatia Rise - Raptite"">Adamatia Rise - Raptite</a> x2: The deck's best play maker, you want to go into this synchro first as it can SS any rock monster it excavates. Ideal targets are Analyzer (for dragite), or one of the level 2 tuners (to go into Crystal wing)  <a data-name=""Adamatia Rise - Leonite"">Adamatia Rise - Leonite</a> x2: The worst of the rock synchros, as it only lets you add cards to your hand instead of SS them.

Combos for a board state with Winda, Apollousa, and either Invoked Caliga or Mechaba, or just plays it fair with fusion spells.  3 Aleister, 3 Invocation, 3 Meltdown. The Invoked engine helps increase consistency and find us fusion spells, and Invocation is also notable for not being once per turn on the play effect. This engine is both essential to the combo, and really good in the deck.  We need light monsters for Construct, so I'm on a Performage package of 3 Damage Juggler searching 1 Trick Clown. Damage Jugglers are a key piece of the deck's Appolousa Combo, which is why the 3 - 1 ratio.  For Shaddolls I have 1 Ariel, a combo piece, 2 Wendi, 3 Squamata, 2 Hedgehog, 2 Beast, 1 Dragon, and a Falco. Wendi is essential to the combo, and Squamata are essentially extra copies for those purposes. 2 Beast and 2 Hedgehog were to reduce the number of games you draw one and need the card draw. Falco still makes the cut as a free extender, (and a much poorer back-up Ariel/Wendi for the combo.)  3 Allure of Darkness give us extra card filtration, useful when we see too many copies of Aleister.  In addition to the Invocations, I run 3 Super-Poly, and 3 of each Shaddoll Fusion. Pretty self explanatory, these are the meat of your deck. Being able to run Super Poly maindeck is excellent, and I made room in the extra deck for a small package (including pieces which are easy to make using our own board.) Lastly, 1 Foolish Burial, to trigger any Shaddoll effect in the deck.  2 Resh Shaddoll Incarnation are run, almost exclusively for the combo, though I suppose being a Call of the Haunted is fine.  Made space in the Extra deck for a second Winda.  Cut the third Construct for Invoked Elysium.

To begin, the deck is cheap, and I always liked <em>Paleozoic</em>.  In 3 words I can describe the best qualities of the deck: <strong>consistency</strong>, <strong>versatility</strong> and <strong>synergy</strong>.  There is no main combo, but there is a lot of ways to achieve the stronger strategy which is controlling the board. <em>Paleozoic</em> is a Trap based archetype, so that means that if we would go second we would be in a more difficult spot. No exactly thanks to the <em>Volcanic</em> cards and the <em>Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician</em>. What differs this variant of <em>Paleozoic</em> deck with the already very known <em>Frog Paleozoic</em>, is that this deck takes the most advantage of the <em>Paleozoic Opabinia</em> and the <em>Paleozoic Anomalocaris</em>.  You will be summoning a lot <em>Paleozoic Opabinia</em>, and then <em>Paleozoic Anomalocaris</em>. (Only summon <em>Toadally Awesome</em> if you really have no option).  Lets proceed to the explanation of the cards I choose.  Firstly, you see a lot of trios, that is because of one of the strongest cards in the deck which is <em>Trap Trick</em>. We want to be able to search with this card whatever we want in this deck.  Secondly, <em>Paleozoic Opabinia </em>is a powerful monster that ables to proceed with the strategy that must suits us in the game state. It search the pieces needed to control the board. A good thing about <em>Paleozoic</em> while they are Monster Cards is that they are not affected by other Monster effects. Which means, Monster Hand Traps won't do much for the opponent (bad draws for your opponent if he draws of of those).  SPELL/TRAP CONTROL <ul>  	<li><em> Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician</em></li>  	<li><em>Paleozoic Olenoides</em></li>  	<li><em>Heavy Storm Duster</em></li>  	<li><em>Paleozoic Anomalocaris</em></li> </ul> <em>Mystic Mine</em> is a powerful card. Not only we have cards to get rid of that card your opponent might have, as we also have one of our own! Well... partially. But the best is that it will mostly all the time affect the opponent. I am talking about <em>Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician</em>. Since we are all the time setting Traps, the first effect is most likely not going to affect us. If the opponent is also playing with a Trap based deck, it can be a bad card (depending if you draw a lot of back row removal). Your opponent is going to try to set cards in order to be able to attack and activate their Monster effects that are on the field. And that is why we run a lot a Spell/Trap destruction, so that the opponent won't be able to make his strategies. We might even get rid of powerful Spells that he sets attempting to be able to continue. But as soon as he sets something we can shout ""NOT SO FAST!"" and we activate something to get rid of it.  VOLCANIC STRATEGY <ul>  	<li><em>Blaze Accelerator Reload</em></li>  	<li><em>Volcanic Scattershot</em></li>  	<li><em>Volcanic Shell</em></li>  	<li><em>Paleozoic Marrella</em></li>  	<li><em>Jar of Avarice</em></li> </ul> What do you think of the idea of having a (Quick Effect) <em>Raigeki</em>? Pretty enticing right? <em>Blaze Accelerator Reload</em> together with <em>Volcanic Scattershot</em> can give us that. And thanks to <em>Paleozoic Marrella</em> we can easily achieve that intention. But once we used it, we can no longer use it again, unless we recycle every thing with <em>Jar of Avarice</em> (<em>Jar of Avarice</em> can also target another <em>Jar of Avarice</em> that you might have in your GY, so it can make an infinite loop). It is possible to have the luck to counter <em>Called By the Grave</em> with <em>Jar of Avarice</em> in the moment you try to activate your <em>Volcanic Scattershot</em>'s effect. <em>Volcanic Shell</em> gives more value to the activation of both effects of <em>Blaze Accelerator Reload</em>.  Helpers: <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li><em>Paleozoic Dinomischus</em></li>  	<li><em>Paleozoic Leanchoilia</em></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <em>Volcanic Shell </em>is a weak monster, but with a cool effect. Not only he is a Level 1 Monster that can turn into <em>Linkuriboh</em>, which can protect an opponent's attack against your also weak 1200 ATK <em>Paleozoic</em> Monsters, but it also makes <em>Paleozoic Dinomischus</em> have less costing impact on you. <em>Paleozoic Leanchoilia</em> is mostly used to bring back <em>Blaze Accelerator Reload </em>or one of your possible banished <em>Volcanic Scattershot.</em> It is important to mention that <em>Paleozoic Leanchoilia </em>can also be used in your opponent banished cards (it can be used against opponent's Monsters that comes back to the field from the banished zone, like <em>Time Thief Rodeor</em>).  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><em>The Phantom Knights of Lost Vambrace</em></li> </ul> Is a very spicy card that can be used for many purposes in many occasions (the only bad thing about this card is that you cannot activate it against Xyz and Link Monsters, or even activate it at all if there isn't any valid targeted monster on the field): <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>it is a Normal Trap Card, which means it can be searched by <em>Trap Trick</em>;</li>  	<li>summon itself as a Level 2 Monster (which can be used for any Xyz Summon, considering it as a very useful Trap Card Material);</li>  	<li>it can make your other Monsters that are Level 1 into a Level 2, so it can be used for our Rank 2 Xyz Monsters;</li>  	<li>change an opponent's Monster's Level to 2 (in order to prevent an Xyz Summon of a certain Rank);</li>  	<li>prevent your opponent to attack your life points directly with their attacking Monsters (since when it is summoned, it cannot be destroyed by battle);</li>  	<li>stopping an opponent attack against one of your monsters that you want to keep (by decreasing his ATK);</li>  	<li>reduce an opponent's Monster ATK, so that you can defeat it.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <em>Paleozoic Canadia</em> -&gt; is just like a <em>Book of Moon</em>. I think I don't need to explain much about that.  <em>Foolish Burial</em> -&gt; it is mostly another copy of <em>Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician</em> since it can set itself when you set a card, but it can also be used to send <em>Volcanic Shell</em>.  <em>Imperial Order</em> -&gt; a very strong floodgate that not many decks can deal with it.  The last card in the deck is <em>Pot of Extravagance,</em> the most expensive card in the deck. We are mostly going for the same Extra Deck Monsters, which are the <em>Paleozoic</em>, so we can afford to play this card. It can either be increased to 3 copies in the deck (so you can see it more often) or even decreased to 0/1. If you decide to not use it at all, you will probably spend the same amount of money to fill your Extra Deck with other Monsters, but hey, if you want to have a richer Extra Deck full of choices, then go for it. You can always use <em>Paleozoic Leanchoilia</em> to bring back one of your Extra Deck Monsters, but in this last case, you would still have the work to have the need to put it back in the Extra Deck."

In a Highlander Format. It's either a meme or its gold,"This is a deck that started out as a meme, and remains a meme (cue the Side Deck). The deck's overall goal is to get access to <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Crimson%20Nova%20the%20Dark%20Cubic%20Lord"">Crimson Nova The Dark Cubic Lord</a> and win with his strong offensive pressure. I constructed the deck with all of the Cubic cards, because Crimson Nova needs 3 with different names, except for Cubic Rebirth and Cubic Mandala because I had no use for them. The rest of the deck consisted of goodstuff cards (Torrential Tribute, Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring, Etc.) and value engines (Heroes, Baobaboon, Dangers!) to allow the deck to have filler while you work your way towards its overall gameplan. I will say that its a super meme with Triple Vijam The Cubic Seed, but it works so I'm fine with it. It does struggle against some matchups like Blue-Eyes and Heroes, buts an all around strong deck that been able to take consistent wins over moderately strong decks."

With staple cards and hand traps that disrupt the opponent as well as cards that help swarm the field with Cyber Dragons, the deck can manage to pull off OTKs and summon powerful monsters, such as ""Constellar Pleiades"" and ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"".  <strong>MAIN DECK MONSTERS</strong>  <strong>Cyber Dragon</strong>  ""Cyber Dragon"" is essentially the ""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"" of our deck, in it that the deck essentially revolves around this card to function properly. Cyber Dragon isn't a bad card in itself, though, as it only requires your opponent to control a monster to special summon itself. Of course, this wouldn't work going first since your opponent can't even summon, unless they play something like ""PSY-Framegear Gamma"" or ""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"". That is one of the reasons why this deck prefers going second, and we run three of this card to respect said notion.  <strong>Cyber Dragon Core</strong>  ""Cyber Dragon Core"", outside of ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"", is probably the best monster in the deck. Upon normal summon, Core can get you a ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap from your Deck, an instant +1 in hand economy. Not only that, but Core can banish itself to get you a free Cyber Dragon monster on the field while only your opponent controls a monster. Moreover, Core counts as ""Cyber Dragon"" on the field or in the Graveyard (GY), but the importance of this will be explained later. Core is an instant three-of for its ability to produce advantage and to increase card economy.  <strong>Cyber Dragon Herz</strong>  Herz carries the same trait as Core, for it counts as ""Cyber Dragon"" on the field or in the GY; however, Herz adds a Cyber Dragon monster from the Deck or the GY when sent to the GY, not upon normal summon. This can be very useful to get back Core from the GY to reuse, and it can get a Cyber Dragon from the deck for possible usage. When Herz is Special Summoned, it can become Level (LV) 5 and can be used to XYZ summon Rank 5 monsters. Keep in mind that you are restricted only to Special Summoning Machine monsters after this affect, so be aware of its restriction when using this effect. Regardless, we run three of Herz to gain advantage and to make Rank 5 plays much easier.  <strong>Cyber Dragon Nachster</strong>  Another monster that makes Cyber Dragon much more than ""I can Special Summon myself to the field and that's about it"" has to be Nachster. When Normal/Special Summoned, Nachster can ""Monster Reborn"" a Machine monster with 2100 ATK or DEF from your GY. Obviously, this gets Cyber Dragon out of the GY and onto the field, but this can also be used to Special Summon other Machine monsters from the GY, such as ""Dingirisu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"" if you are playing the Orcust variant. Not just this, but Nachster can be summoned this way by simply pitching another monster from your hand to the GY. We run this card at three to get as much field presence as we can.  <strong>Cyber Dragon Vier</strong>  Our last main deck monster that is a Cyber Dragon is Vier. This card is mainly here to serve as an extender, for it can Special Summon itself from the hand or GY when you summon a Cyber Dragon monster. It also boosts 500 ATK/DEF to Cyber Dragon monsters, but this effect is kind of useless outside of that one time where your ""Cyber Dragon"" can FINALLY attack over a monster that was 500 ATK/DEF higher than your monster. This is only run at one because it does not give you any card advantage, outside from being a +1 in field advantage.  <strong>Galaxy Soldier</strong>  Now we get into one of our non-Cyber Dragon monsters of the deck. ""Galaxy Soldier"", while not being a Cyber Dragon monster, is a LV 5 LIGHT Machine monster that can Special Summon itself from the hand by discarding another LIGHT Monster. While not as easy to summon as Nachster, Soldier does add itself to its hand upon summon, and the Special Summon effect is NOT a hard once per turn. Sadly, it does not have 2100 ATK or DEF, so it can't be summoned by Nachster. Still, we run this at three to make XYZ plays much easier.  <strong>PSY-framegear Gamma/PSY-Frame Driver</strong>  Remember how I mentioned how Gamma can Special Summon itself on your opponent's turn? Yeah, we run three of those in this deck. Because Cyber Dragons want to go first, Gamma fits in the deck perfectly, for it can negate a monster effect as long as you control no monsters. This can be very useful if your opponent uses up a lot of resources to summon a monster, such as ""Saryuja Skull Dread"" and ""Dark Templar @Ignister"" (unless they chainblock you, but for the sake of an example I went with Templar). Moreover, ""Galaxy Soldier"" can pitch Gamma and Driver to summon itself, so the PSY-Frame monsters can be useful even if they don't negate a monster effect. Because of these benefits, we run a playset of Gamma and one Driver to disrupt our opponent on their first turn.  <strong>MAIN DECK SPELLS</strong>  <strong>Cyber Emergency</strong>  Our first ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap we'll go over for this decklist is Emergency, an important searcher for the deck. As stated before, ""Cyber Dragon Core"" can search any ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap from the deck, and usually, you go for this card (if you don't have it in your hand). All it does is search a Cyber Dragon monster (or a LIGHT Machine that can't be Normal Summon/Set) , but its ""Reinforcement of the Army""-esque effect is very useful since we only run 13 Main Deck Cyber Dragon monsters. Obviously, your opponent would want to negate such a powerful effect, but luckily, if it gets negated and sent to the GY, you can discard a card to get it back into your hand. Such a card deserves to be a playset in this deck.  <strong>Cyber Repair Plant</strong>  Some people run two of this card. Some run one. Some even run three! But I decided that Repair Plant is better off at 2. While it does search a LIGHT Machine monster from the Deck and/or return a Cyber Dragon monster from the GY to the Deck, a Cyber Dragon monster needs to be in the GY to activate the effect(s). Luckily, if you have three or more Cyber Dragons in the GY, you can activate both effects! Usually, you opt for the search effect, but returning a ""Cyber Dragon"" to the Deck is especially useful for the card that comes after these two other ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap cards.  <strong>Cyber Revsystem</strong>  Revsystem is basically Nachster reincarnated as a Spell/Trap, but a little more expansive. It is not restricted to Machine monsters with 2100 ATK and DEF, and it can Special Summon from the hand as well. Also, that monster can not be destroyed by card effects. Sadly, this card only Special Summons ""Cyber Dragon"", so be mindful when using this card. Although this card is very powerful, we only run one of this card. It gives you only field advantage, and it can be searched off of Core anyways, so putting two or three of this card would waste deck space.  <strong>Cyberload Fusion</strong>  Our only card that we can use to Fusion Summon ""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"" and ""Cyber Twin Dragon"" is this card. It shuffles ""Cyber Dragon"" monsters from your field and banished zone, which is useful if you have ""Cyber Dragon"" banished or Cyber Dragon monsters on the field. Only that monster can attack for the rest of the turn after you summon it, but it is a fine price to pay. We only run one because it can be searched off of Core. Also, if you want to run cards like ""Power Bond"" and ""Overload Fusion"" to help summon these Fusion Monsters, that's all fine by me.  <strong>Machine Duplication</strong>  You always want to see this card in your opening hand. Remember when I said that Core, Herz, and Nachster all count as ""Cyber Dragon"" on the field? Well, by using this card, you can Special Summon two copies of ""Cyber Dragon"" straight from your deck! Not only can you easily make ""Cyber Dragon Nova"" this way, but you gain +1 in field presence. I kind of went over why these monsters are important, but this gives another reason why they are all at three. With nine targets for ""Machine Duplication"", you can't go wrong. You run three of this for sure.  <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>  Coming right at you out of Ignition Assault is our awesome, mass-removal friend, ""Lightning Storm"". Like Gamma, it is a go-second card that disrupts the opponent. But unlike monster negation, it acts like a ""Lightning Vortex"" (without the discard) or a ""Harpie's Feather Duster"", just as long as you don't have face-up cards on the field. This is a very good card to either break your opponent's board or to bait out negation, and it is a three-of to make sure our Cyber Dragons can make good plays.  <strong>MAIN DECK TRAPS</strong>  <strong>Cybernetic Overflow</strong>  Although Cyber Dragons are a go-second deck, Overflow has snuck into our last one-of ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap to talk about. Basically, Overflow (after you banish Cyber Dragon monsters with different LVs from your hand, face-up field, or GY) pops cards on your opponents field for each card banished. This card can pop up to three cards for this decklist, but it you want to run ""Proto-Cyber Dragon"" or ""Cyber Dragon Drei"", then I salute you for sacrificing consistency for board-wiping abilities. Also, the banishing effect can work with Cyberload Fusion, so that's nice.  <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>  Outside of ""Lightning Storm"" and countless other cards, ""Evenly Matched"" is arguably one of the best going second cards in terms of board wipes. At the end of your Battle Phase, you can activate this card from your hand to make your opponent banish their cards face-down until they control the same amount of cards as you do (usually one). Ignoring cards like ""Knightmare Corruptor Iblee"" for simplicity, let's say your opponent has a card in their Extra Deck Zone and all cards in the Main Monster Zone, Spell &amp; Trap Zone, and Field Spell Zone. Assuming that ""Evenly Matched"" is the only card you control during activation and that your opponent can't negate said card, your opponent would be banishing ELEVEN CARDS!!! This card's power cannot be ignored, and we run this card at three to celebrate this amazing card.  <strong>Infinite Impermanence </strong>  This card, ""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"", and ""Called by the Grave"" all have one thing in common: they are side deck cards that players usually Main Deck. And who could blame them? Ash Blossom negates search cards, Called negates monsters that activate in the GY, and Impermanence negates a face-up monster on the field. However, Ash Blossom does not go well with Galaxy Soldier and the theme of the deck, and Called is a better card going first, so a playset of Impermanence makes sense for this deck, especially when it wants to go second.  <strong>EXTRA DECK</strong>  <strong>Cyber Dragon Nova</strong>  Before we discuss our key player of the deck, we must go over the card that is needed to summon it: Nova. This XYZ monster can be summoned with two LV 5 Machine monsters, such as ""Galaxy Soldier"", ""Cyber Dragon"", and ""Cyber Dragon Herz"" if it becomes a LV 5. Just like Nachster and Revsystem, Nova can Special Summon ""Cyber Dragon"" from the GY (by detaching an XYZ material). Moreover, a ""Cyber Dragon"" can be banished from your hand or field to boost this card by 2100 ATK to run over large monsters. Usually, after you summon Nova and activate its effect, you XYZ summon Infinity by attaching Nova and its materials to it. But in case Nova gets hit with something like ""Solemn Judgment"", Nova can bring out a powerful Machine Fusion monster, such as ""Chimeratch Rampage Dragon"". Although this card is quite powerful, it is run at 2 to leave space for the Extra Deck.  <strong>Cyber Dragon Infinity</strong>  This is our main playmaker. After XYZ summoning this card, you now have a 2100 ATK beater than can attach an Attack Position monster on field to it as material and can negate a card or effect by detaching a material. Simple as that. Yet, this card is still very viable even in decks outside of Cyber Dragons, such as Galaxy Photon and Infinitrack. Also, this card can interact with cards such as Nachster and Repair Plant. This card, like Nova, is run at 2 to leave deck space.  <strong>Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon/Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</strong>  Sadly, as we itch closer to Master Rule 5, the Chimeratechs are going to become less viable. But even with most Extra Deck monsters being able to be summoned to the Main Monster Zones, archetypes like Cyberse, Mathmech, SPYRAL, and Salamangreat may have monsters stuck in the Extra Deck zone. This is where Megafleet comes in, using it and a Cyber Dragon for a Contact Fusion. Fortress does the same, but with Machine monsters. Unless you are playing against Orcust, Infinitrack, or decks like that, Fortress will just sit in the Extra Deck. Yet, we play 2 Megafleet and 1 Fortress just in case they become viable in a match-up.  <strong>Chimeratech Rampage Dragon/Cyber Twin Dragon</strong>  These are the Fusion monsters that can be summoned off of Cyberload Fusion or Nova's effect. Rampage is the better of the two because it can pop backrow and can attack up to three times during the Battle Phase. However, if you don't want to commit to resources or if you have a monster that's a little stronger than 2100 ATK, Cyber Twin Dragon isn't a bad monster to summon either. It has 2800 ATK and can just attack twice. Both are one-ofs, but if you want to bump Rampage to two, that's fine.  <strong>Cyber Dragon Sieger</strong>  Sieger is an interesting link monster. It uses 2 Machine monsters, including ""Cyber Dragon"", for Link Material. Just using Core or Herz on the field is beneficial enough, but during the Battle Phase, similar to Nova, Sieger can increase a Machine monster with 2100 or more ATK on the field by 2100 ATK/DEF. We run this at one to rid of the low-attack monsters that might stick on the field.  <strong>Generic Extra Deck Monsters</strong>  I will now go over the rest of the monsters in short summaries. ""Constellar Pleiadas"" is a generic Rank 5 that bounces a card, ""Artifact Durendal"" is a generic Rank 5 that changes a monster effect and fixes hands, ""Qliphort Genius"" is a generic Link 2 that opens zones for Extra Deck Monsters, ""Linkuriboh"" sends Herz and Nachster to the GY, and ""Salamangreat Almaraj"" sends Core, Herz, and Nachster to the GY.  <strong>Side Deck</strong>  <strong>Artifact Lancea</strong>  Once in a while, you face an annoying banish dot deck that abuses ""Eater of Millions"" and ""Gren Maju Da Eiza"" to OTK you. Maybe you come across an Infernoid player that just can't stop banishing monsters from the GY to summon more monsters. Maybe you even an Orcust player that just doesn't stop abusing the GY. Well I say nay to all of that. Lancea is a great card to stop that rubbish, and amazingly, it is a LV 5. So if somehow you manage it to get on the field, you could be seeing some Rank 5 cheese.  <strong>D.D. Crow</strong>  Pretty much every deck in the meta abuses GY mechanics to get monsters out onto the field. Decks like @Ignister, Orcust, Invoked, HERO, Dark Magician, and Lunalight all use the GY in some sort of way to gain advantage. Well, I spit on all of them with my D.D. Crow. Easily, with this card, I can banish a card from my opponents GY to stop Special Summons, prevent cards from being set back (like ""Salamangreat Roar"" and ""Lost Wind""), and prevent your opponent from fulfilling their combos. It is just too good in today's meta that its impact can't be overlooked.  <strong>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</strong>  Once upon a time, this card made no impact on the meta game. Other cards like Red Reboot and Pankratops once ruled the Side Deck. And then, the banlist came. Soon, SPYRALs rejuvenated as a competitive deck (ugh) and abused ""Magicians' Souls"" like crazy. How can one stop this? Simple. Droll &amp; Lock Bird. Stop the searching, stop the pluses, stop everything. (As long as you don't get hit will Called, this card might win you games!)  <strong>Heat Wave</strong>  We run basically all the go second cards in the Main Deck, so the side deck can have room for go first cards, like ""Heat Wave"". This card just shuts down Effect Monster summons and can leave you to OTK next turn, if you have enough resources.  <strong>Prohibition</strong>  This card is great going first. When you know that an archetypes hinges on one card to function properly, like Dark Magician or Phantasm Spiral, Prohibition can just shut down a card and make decks unplayable. Simple as that.  Please let me know if I can improve upon any thing in this deck. I would love to hear some feedback on this!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

I would consider running 1 or 2 @Ignister monsters if the meta was Link heavy but currently they are hard to splash in Salad except for the ED monsters. Also, I was going to cut Rising Fire but then Gizmek Kaku happened. You could try Premature Burial and stuff that search Equip Spells aswell with it but I don't like increasing the deck size. I would play 3rd Circle if I went up to 45 though. This deck is still very good at doing a whole bunch of nothing."

All mine decks are well tested and optimized in terms of draw power, dead hand, synergy. balance &amp; combo.  All this to give you the best possible version of selected deck.

Then, if you're going first, you'll generally want Strahl out on the field for a negate and the special summon during their standby,  If going second, Strahl is still great, however, if House is on the field, your girls switch to their dragon forms at the start of battle, she will destroy opponents monsters on the field for each that switch, at the end of battle if they still have monsters and you switch back she can pop even more.  Guardragon Legacy is good after you fuse to bring your girls back out on the field for more swarming potential.  You can have one of your girls switch to a dragon then use Tinkhec to give it 2000 attack until the end of turn and then have another switch into the Tinkhec now in grave.  Send Off is good for either switching for the summon requirements or switching during their turn to activate Houses effect to destroy when one returns to hand  Good luck, they are extremely fun to use and you'd be surprised how many people forget they switch in battle!"

There's no Mystic Mine, there's no Obliterate, no Incarnate, and it's not a Burn De","<strong>Please note...</strong>  This deck is not like the others. There's no Mystic Mine, no Obliterate, no Incarnate, and this isn't one of those burner decks where you just burn cards to thin out your deck until you get all 5 pieces. All of those strategies are boring, no fun and everyone else uses them. They have ruined Exodia and have given the deck a bad name. No, this is a 100% original strategy to get all 5 pieces of Exodia legitimately. I spent months and months working on this deck and I'm honestly very proud of it. There are some things that need to be worked out but this deck is BY FAR the best Exodia Deck there is. I'll let everyone test the deck out for themselves and see what they think. But for this deck to be successful, you need to know a few things. <ul>  	<li>This deck has 2 huge strengths that are the main focus point. <ul>  	<li>Link Summoning - Summon either Blue Dragon Summoner, Witch of the Black Forest or Jester the Fiend Jester and use them with Magician's Circle. If you have Trap Trick, you can set magician's Circle and Activate it on the same turn. This lets you summon an extra monster. After doing that, switch to Main Phase 2 and Link Summon any of the Monster that you can. This sends both pieces to the GY, getting you 2 Exodia pieces on 1 turn. If you can, preferably Link Summon Wee Witch's Apprentice or Wynn, the Wind Charmer. When destroyed you get to add another Dark Spellcaster or Wind Monster to your hadn't which really comes in handy.</li>  	<li>This strategy works best if you have Inferno Reckless Summon in your hand. If you do, when it's time to choose a monster to Special Summon for Magician's Circle. <strong>MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE BLUE DRAGON SUMMONER! </strong>This is important because this will activate Inferno Reckless Summon. This lets you Special Summon 2 other Blue Dragon Summoner's to the field. Now you can link Summon all 3 of them (Blue Dragon Summoner's effect isn't once per turn) AND ALSO the first monster you attacked with Magician's Circle. That's 4 monsters being sent to the Graveyard which gets you 4 Exodia pieces.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>The 2nd Strategy is for Draw of Fate. But I'm going to keep that to myself for now. Comment or message me if you're curious on what the strategy is. I know you probably think you got it already. But there's a lot more to it then you think.</li> </ul> <strong>ENJOY!</strong> <ol>  	<li> <ol>  	<li></li> </ol> </li> </ol>"

You're almost ALWAYS going to want to bring Sera out to set up your combos, normal summon a Traptrix and link immediately.  If you don't have a Traptrix, thats why theres two Magical Mallet in the deck, also in case you draw into Double Or Nothing! you can reshuffle it for the Utopia combo later.  If you drew into Shade Brigandine first or second turn, then when you bring out Sera, activate after to activate Sera's effect to bring a Traptrix monster.  Myrmeleo's effect is MANDATORY, even if your opponent doesn't have a spell or trap to destroy, the effect still triggers.  Which triggers Sera to set a Trap Hole.  &nbsp;  Another big combo, is while you have Sera on your field, and a trap in the same column, if you get to activate the trap (Which activates Sera) you can Special summon Myrmeleo RIGHT BENEATH Sera in the same column.  Myrmeleo's effect triggers popping your opponents spell or trap, or triggers anyway. This triggers Sera and you set a trap RIGHT BENEATH Myrmeleo in the same column.  Now that you have three cards in the same column, Iron Dragon Tiamaton gets special summoned to another main monster zone, destroying all other cards in that column, neither player can use zones IN that column either.  Keep in mind that either player can have more than one Extra Monster Zone, if you have Sera out, they cant Link summon if Tiamaton is blocking the other zone.  Now they have to Normal or Special summon monsters the traditional way to get rid of Sera, or use a spell.  If you brought Rafflesia out, your opponent cant target Sera with effects anyways.  PLUS you have the Floodgate Traphole set by Sera in addition to other Traps you have, limiting them tremendously.  &nbsp;  If going first and can Xyz, then I recommend Raflessia,Tornado Dragon, Redoer, or Allomerus, but only if your opponent is using a deck that has many level 4 monsters.  If going Second then Borrelsword or the Utopia combo if set up right. Pentestag can allow either to pierce so keep that in mind.  Sera activates to ANY normal trap, even your opponents.  Sera is ALSO unaffected by traps in general, meaning you can use your own on her to get her effect to trigger.  Dionaea can target another Dionaea in the grave, which will activate her special summon effect.  Dionaea special summon effect is to set a Trap Hole from grave but banish it during your next turn if still on field, Mantis has a Quick effect however, to bounce one of your Spells/Traps to hand and set another. Getting rid of the bad effect of Dionaea.  Good luck, those are the main strategies I use while shutting down my opponent!"

Who knew that such a man could stack his way into making the number one most hated deck good again in February of 2020. Zoodiac is a deck that focuses on summoning Xyz monsters' using only 1 monster as material. Oh, you thought Galatea into Ding was an unfair combo - try a whole archetype revolved around that. Zoo is regarded by most players from the zexal era as a 'cancer' or 'tumor' in yugioh...but god is it fun! Watching your opponent's life drain out of the eyes as you whisper for the 5th time this turn, ""chain ash blossom"". While it may not be as powerful as it was in Master Rule 3 - Zoodiac can still stand its ground as a solid Tier 3 rogue deck (even if it lost Drident and Broadbull). So with that all out the way - here's all you need to know:  Let's clear things up - this deck will make another feature appearance soon. With Master 5 being released in just under two-or-so months, this deck won't have to rely on using Gravity Controller to free up zones. That being said: there are significant differences to the deck now that's been put through a new format. 1. The Link Monsters. Ignition Assault brought some new cards along, specifically the infamous link one, Gravity Controller. What it essentially does is clears up a spot for you to use, and then spins itself and a card, giving you two free spaces to Xyz summon in. The other monster, Megaclops, is slightly harder to pull off - but can be seen as your ace monster of sorts, obviously after Chakanine (the card you try to go into the most). Its tougher to pull off as you can't always meet its summon requirements - but if you open Cymbal Skeleton its a guaranteed 4000 right to your opponents face. Megaclops also recovers Xyz monsters for you - meaning you can continuously stack Zoodiac monsters even after making your beloved infinitrack.  I've had someone recommend playing a Crescendo as my Galatea target - but in my opinion that's useless. Not only do you have to run only one orcust card - you rarely see juxtaposed with the three desires. So playing it would ultimately be a brick in the end. Other than that - the only thing to address is the handtraps. It may seem a bit overkill but you usually need to run this many in order to provide disruption to your opponent. Surprisingly, two Droll seems like the optimal ratio right now as SPYRAL isn't too much of a threat as it was at the start of the format.  Overall: this deck is a cool 6.4/10. While it definitely won't take up all 16 spots of top cut like it once did, it's still a great deck to play at your locals. It has all the stacking capabilities like it use to, just not as optimal with its core extra deck monsters being banned and the zone rules put in place by Master Rule 4. I'd recommend this deck to those out there still cherishing the good old days of going 12-0 against pure mirror matches for the whole tournament. I mean listen - if Jay can top with it, what stops you from doing the same?"

Going first is no problem, going second can be OTK!","""Mathmech"" is a very underrated archetype that can explode on your opponent very quickly and end games and matches fast. The deck is tricky to beat around with constant increase and decrease of attack (which can also take place during the damage step), the deck can create pretty good hand advantage and has a pretty solid grave recovery from extra deck monsters/spells/and main deck monster effects. This version of the deck can go first and actually it has been better in my opinion to go first against meta decks because there are ways you can stop deck searching, and clear the field without destroying monsters/spells-traps all on your opponent's turn.  Going First,  The opening play is to get two monsters on the board. Usually you want to start with <strong>Balancer Lord</strong> and ANY other monster is fine but its better if you have one that can be S<em>S</em> just in case his effect gets negated for the extra normal summon, you'd then <em>SS</em> <strong>Mathmech Addition</strong>, <strong>Subtraction</strong> or <strong>Sigma</strong> (<strong>Note</strong>: When u <em>SS</em> S<strong>igma</strong> try to <em>XYZ</em> summon using him so he goes to grave and his effect can be activated from the grave otherwise he'll be banished). Next you go into your extra deck for links, <em>link</em> summon <strong>Link Disciple</strong> and then <em>Link</em> summon <strong>Link Devotee</strong>. Use effect of<strong> Disciple</strong> to tribute D<strong>evotee</strong> and then use D<strong>evotee's</strong> effect to summon 2 tokens. Next, you summon <strong>Cyberse Wickkid</strong> by <em>linking</em> one token and D<strong>isciple</strong>, and then use the other token to summon L<strong>inkuriboh</strong>. <strong>Wickkid's</strong> effect will then activate allowing u to add a ""Cyberse"" tuner from deck to hand by banishing a monster from grave BANISH TARGET WILL BE <strong>BALANCER LORD</strong> (<strong>Note</strong>: NEVER banish ""Mathmech"" monsters, with this effect only <em>link</em> monsters or <strong>B</strong><strong>alancer lord</strong>). If you already have <strong>Mathmech Nabla</strong> in hand add <strong>Mathmech Sigma</strong>. Then <strong>B</strong><strong>alancer lord</strong> effect will activate from being banished allowing you to <em>SS</em> one from the hand to which you <em>SS</em> <strong>Nabla</strong>. Use <strong>Nabla</strong> effect to tribute <strong>Linkuriboh</strong> to <em>SS</em> a ""Mathmech"" monster from deck. (Note: Selection is important, DO not <em>SS</em> <strong>Addition</strong> or <strong>Subtraction </strong>these are the monsters you want to draw into) (Note: Try and pick Mathmech monsters of different names, you want to have atleast 3 different named targets in the graveyard.) Next step is to <em>XZY</em> summon <strong>Primathmech Alembertian</strong> and use his effect to search the deck for <strong>Mathmech Superfactorial</strong>. Set it and any other cards and pass turn.  <strong>Mathmech Superfactorial</strong> is a game changer. This card is essentially your key to stopping plays because it allows you to <em>Synchro</em> or <em>XYZ</em> Summon on your opponents turn. Your main target for this card is going to be<strong> Primathmech Laplacian</strong> to send one monster/spell-trap/and card in hand to the grave.  Going Second OTK  Very Simple... Do what you can to make <strong>Geomathmech Final Sigma</strong> and beef him up! <strong>Final Sigma</strong> is a low-key broken AF card! cannot be effected by anything while in the extramonster zone, also he does DOUBLE battle damage. <strong>Geomathmech Final Sigma</strong> + <strong>Mathmech Billionblade Nayuta</strong> = GG  <strong>Mathemch Billionblade Nayuta</strong>  This card can be equiped to any ""Cyberse"" monster, and during the damage step you can send one ""Mathmech"" monster from your deck to the grave to increase your monsters attack by the attack of the sent monster. (<strong>NOTE</strong>: if you send <strong>Division</strong> to the grave you can halve your opponents monsters attack as well, if you send<strong> Multiplication</strong> to grave you can double your monster's attack *only if its in extra monster zone) This all happens during the damage step so its very hard to stop/counter."

Send Paleozoics to the GY to summon eldlich, I guess. I really made this deck because i noticed Eldlich uses a bunch of traps and spells, so just put them there.  I would probably increase the amount of El Dorodo Aledeltando, since I find my self not getting it very often. Hastor is just in case you get the level 2 ice barrier tuner in there. Doomking is there as a target for elixir spells/traps, and you can chain it off summoning Eldlich (there's no zombie world because it interfears with summoning Toad). Necro face is there because I like having a way to shuffle my banished cards.  Feel free to change the ratios of cards and let me know your experience"

There are some cards that I added to the deck which I like to explain:  <a data-name=""Apprentice Illusion Magician"">Apprentice Illusion Magician</a>: This card is actually perfect for the deck, it lets you discard any card in your hand and it is dark which makes it easier to go into <a data-name=""Curious, The lightsworn dominion"">Curious, The lightsworn dominion</a> which is the main part of your combo.  <a data-name=""Shinobi Necro"">Shinobi Necro</a>: I have never seen anyone use this card but let me tell you: it is actually insane. First of all it is a rank 2 tuner(also dark) which makes it a target for needlefiber. Second of all you can special summon him if you banish him with the effect of <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a>. He also lets you draw and discard 1 card if you special summon a zombie from your grave while he is on the field which is pretty good aswell. Also if you already have <a data-name=""Cyber-Stein"">Cyber-Stein</a> in your grave and you don't need 2 search him with <a data-name=""Rescue ferret"">Rescue ferret</a> you can actually summon <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a> and <a data-name=""Shinobi Necro"">Shinobi Necro</a> from your deck instead.  <a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a>: I don't really like him in the deck but I feel like you have to play him for 2 reasons: 1. It can happen that your only option will be to send him to the grave with <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a> or <a data-name=""Armageddon knight"">Armageddon knight</a> to go into needlefiber. 2. He is actually really useful if you have multiple <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a> in your hand.  <a data-name=""Burial from a different dimension"">Burial from a different dimension</a>: This card is actually broken with <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a>. It is the best feeling to get 3 Mezukis back into the grave.  <a data-name=""Pot of Acquisitiveness"">Pot of Acquisitiveness</a>: recycle your banished <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a>.  <a data-name=""Jewels of the Valliant"">Jewels of the Valliant</a>: just another foolish for the deck.  &nbsp;  Hope you enjoy the deck!  &nbsp;  <strong>Update:</strong> Í don't play plaguespreader, burial from a different dimension and pot of aquisitiveness anymore and I think the deck is more consistent now. The addition of <a data-name=""Union carrier"">Union carrier</a> is really good for the deck since it provides another way to dump <a data-name=""Necroworld Banshee"">Necroworld Banshee</a>, <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a>, <a data-name=""Glow up bloom"">Glow up bloom</a> or even doomking into your grave.  <strong>Siding:</strong> if you go second exchange:  <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>, <a data-name=""Cyber-Stein"">Cyber-Stein</a>, <a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> with <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>  <a data-name=""Jewels of the Valliant"">Jewels of the Valliant</a>, <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>, <a data-name=""World legacy succession"">World legacy succession</a> <strong>with</strong> <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> <strong>/</strong> <a data-name=""Twin-Twisters"">Twin-Twisters</a> <strong>/</strong> <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a><strong> /</strong> <a data-name=""Mind Control"">Mind Control</a>  <a data-name=""Naturia Exterio"">Naturia Exterio</a>, <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> with<a data-name=""Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon""> Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyovertum"">Predaplant Triphyovertum</a>  &nbsp;"

If you draw 2 combo Fire fists this is what you search. Only 1 because Red resonator and Kaleido Chick are your primary normal summons, but the deck would take a massive hit without atleast running the one Elephant</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Bear"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Bear </a>- You Never ever mind drawing this because its a combo piece of a hyper common combo, you want to draw this infact. I enter Tiger King loops 90% of games</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Rooster"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Rooster</a> - Another reason you need Elephant is to make Drawing Rooster amazing. You always need Rooster in a deck for Horse Prince, You also kinda need 2 in a deck for Tiger King. 3 would be bricky tho but my deck justifies running 2 better then any other incosistent Fire fist list you saw</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Buffalo"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Buffalo</a> - Commonly dumped of Eagle tho sometimes you dump bear to revive it off Eagle, just a free lvl 4 summon off Eagle. This is not a bad draw he is a combo piece, No lvl 4 fire fist is a bad draw, and tbh each fire fist monster in this deck is a fine draw. You really just dont wanna draw 2 rooster or 2+ Dragons.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Raven"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Raven</a> - Required combo piece for some combos. Sometimes you need Raven for Rooster, the card is good combo piece overall</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Dragon"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Dragon</a> - Because you literally summon this card sometimes 7 times a turn.. Yep 7, combo piece and an extender, Drawing 2 is horrid but it shouldnt happen in a 45 card deck.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Coach Soldier Wolfbark"">Coach Soldier Wolfbark</a> - Adopted by Fire fist familiy, he is needed for Tiger King loops, he is the first card you summon along with second bear. I showcased this 6 months ago everyone has cought up to it. You typically summon Bear + Wolfbark, Then 2x Dragon, then 2x rooster, then 2x Lunalight cards.</li> </ul> <strong>Fire Formation core 8 - Spells, 1 trap</strong>.  - You might think this is a little but keep in mind Resonator and Luna engine turbo out the fire formation spells via Either Horse prince or Tiger King, thats just smarter then running the bad formations or more of the Ok ones. <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Fire Fist Tenki"">Fire Fist Tenki</a> - better then in standard Fire Fist deck (In pure FF deck tensu is the most important FF spell) because it searchers Lunalight engine to which means this card became a better extender Tiger King summons Kaleido Chicks and sets tensu to net you Tiger (Certain loops)</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Fire Fist Tensu"">Fire Fist - Tensu</a> - just amazing, the activation is not OPT which matters, without this card the deck would suck at tiger king loops.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fire Formation Domei"">Fire Formation - Domei</a> - searchable extender, Usually rooster sends it to the graveyard so that you can revive a Dragon so that Dragon can revive again.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fire Fortress Atop Liang Peak"">Fire Fortress Atop Liang Peak</a> - 10 counters Turn 1, in some rare combos you cant do that but then you put 6 counters search Tiger and end on impressive board anyway, He summons Ancient warrior link Shuanglong or Gladiator beast Heraklinos if you arent Horse Prince restriction locked.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Ultimate Fire Formation - Sinto"">Ultimate Fire Formation - Sinto</a> - Hi dark ruler no more, bye. Its hopt, you can access 2 every game but I value consistency over power, you dont need more power</li> </ul> <strong><span>Lunalight Engine <span>-</span></span></strong><span><span><strong> You cant play just 7 monsters</strong>, you need a second lvl 4 sendable of Kaleido chick for some combos, because else you cant Revive anything since every lunalight is under xyz material, and it has to be lvl 4 because thats what makes Diamond Dire Wolf</span></span> <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Lunalight Kaleido Chick"">Lunalight Kaleido Chick</a> - this + tiger or red resonator is a long Tiger King loop which does like 7 negates + tornado + dweller.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Lunalight Tiger"">Lunalight Tiger</a> - Searchable of LiangPeak, Resonator combos, Just a great card tbh</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Lunalight Yellow Marten"">Lunalight Yellow Marten</a> - You either run 2 Marten, or 1 Marten + 1 any other lvl 4 Luna (Emerald being one of the better ones)</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Lunalight Emerald Bird"">Lunalight Emerald Bird</a> - This card adds mini consistency while Marten adds mini resiliency to d.d crow.. I ended up preffering consistency</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Luna light - Perfume"">Luna light - Perfume</a> - Just one keep in mind this deck is 60% Fire fist and it turbos out Fire fists, obviously a very good one off specially because of goods</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Lunalight Serenade dance"">Lunalight Serenade dance</a> - Main foolish burial goods target</li> </ul> <span><strong>Resonator engine</strong></span> <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Resonator call"">Resonator call</a> (Red resonator)</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Red resonator"">Red resonator</a> - Horse prince is the way, yes the restriction is stupid but this is Fire Fist 3.5 Lunalight axis deck, Shuanglong exists..</li> </ul> Often times I side 1 or 2 cards of this engine because they are so fragile going second.

A very liner deck that aims for the OTK with its boss monsters, Gaia The Magical Dragon Champion and Sky Galloping Gaia The Dragon Champion. Both these monsters are treated as Gaia the Dragon Champion when on the field which synergieses well with both new and old support. They both each also have unique effects which are optimal for different situations. The new Gaia The Magical Dragon Champion has the ability to destroy a card as a quick effect during the main phase at the cost of 2600 attack and gains 2600 attack after destroying an opponents monster by battle. On the other hand Sky Galloping Gaia the Dragon Champion searches Spiral Spear Strike upon summon and can change the battle position of opponents monsters it battles. The new fusion spell Spiral Fusion doubles the attack of both of these monsters and allows them to make up to two attacks on monsters per battle phase. Cursed Dragon - Curse of Dragon searches a spell or trap card that specifically lists Gaia The Dragon Champion in its text and when its used as fusion material can negate the effects of all your opponents monster with less attack than a Gaia The Dragon champion you control. It be special summoned from the hand or graveyard with Gaia the Magical Knight, who can be normal summoned without tribute if you control no monsters or your opponent controls a monster with 2300 or more attack. Bombarding Catapult Turtle acts as a Lonefire Blossom for the deck, tributing a monster in order to special summon a Gaia The Fierce Knight Monster or a level 5 dragon monster from the hand or deck. The field spell Charging Gaia serves as the main searcher of the deck, searching either a Gaia The Fierce Knight monster or level 5 dragon by revealing the corresponding card in your hand. Charging Gaia also has an additional effect that prevents your opponent from activating cards of effects during the battle phase, ensuring an OTK. The final piece of new support used in this deck comes in the form of Soldier Gaia the Fierce Knight. It can be brought out by tributing a dragon fusion you control and can change an attack position monster to defence when summoned. These effects are good for pushing for the OTK or dodging effects and attacks. It also has the additional effect to tribute itself to search out a level 7 or higher warrior type monster, making it a good utility one of. There were also traps released that supported Gaia, but I felt that they were unnecessary in a dedicated OTK strategy.  The other cards included in the deck were to clear the field for an easy OTK. Hand traps such as Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring and Infinite Impermanence as well as generic go second cards such as Lightning Storm, Instant Fusion and Super Polymerization. Some older support such as Curse of Dragonfire, Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of Beginning and Gateway to Chaos were also utilized to increase consistency.  The biggest weakness of the deck is being forced to go first, which is why I included a Dragun of Red-Eyes package in the side deck for when that happens."

The main strategy here is graveyard setup and big numbers. Uni-Zombie gives you access to synchro plays, so you can always blow up the field with Black Rose to nuke the field and attack directly with King of the Skull Servants (hopefully). You can actually summon BLS because Wightprincess is a Light attribute for some reason, but she is the only one in this deck so he can brick a lot. Lady in Wight makes King of the Skull Servants spell/trap immune, which is pretty cool.  I have Princessprite in the Extra Deck because she is the best generic rank 1, and Wightprince activates when detached as XYZ material, so that's a thing. Underclock Taker is good for setting up OTKs because it just gives you a 0 attack monster to swing into if he's pointing to King. Beelze because I can. Borrelsword because I own one, and I would be dumb to not use it.  As far as some of the techier options in this deck:  -Hey, Trunade! is a good bait card. you either waste an opponents negate or get rid of their Solemns, and if nothing else you can set it as a dud for them to pop.  -Final Attack Orders is actually really fun in this deck because it pretty much eliminates stall strategies outside of Waboku and Battle Fader.  -MST over Twin Twisters because I prefer to not discard on my backrow destruction.  -Grand Horn because of personal preference.  The side deck isn't an actual side deck, it's just some cards I've experimented with and had mixed results with. Opti-Camouflage Armor just made me feel bad, plus it doesn't work when Lady in Wight is on the field. Snowman Effect is just a win more card. Battle Mania is kind of pointless because if your opponent just gets rid of all of their monsters they don't have to attack, but when it works you pretty much win instantly. Shiranui Style Solemnity is actually pretty decent, but I don't like banishing all of my stuff (also why I don't run allure). Thunder Dragonduo would work really good with Solemnity if it returned banished monsters during both end phases, but since it works only on your opponent's end phase, it's too slow to do much. Creature swap gives your opponent a 0 attack King to swing into, and then revive to attack with, but you have to control two Kings for it to work."

Consistent Aromaseraphy Marjoram + Cross Rose + Black Garden with great recur,"<img src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/b/b1/Akiza_Izinski.png"" alt=""image"" />  Cross Rose Dragon is an underrated link monster coming in Duel Overload. This deck will fully utilize its potential at disrupting and recursion. I'm building this deck under current World banlist (OCG has Linkross but with Lonefire Blossom and Predplant Ophrys Scorpio on the list, while TCG has 3 Lonefire and Ophrys while still waiting for Linkross). So using one of the banlist is kinda even out the upside and downside.  Basic strategy is getting <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax + random level 3 monster</strong> on the field. To achieve that, the Predaplant package is very suitable, also they are plant monster which work with the rest of this deck. Scorpio + its fodder in hand can result you a full combo, making it your best card and one card starter. The route is similar to Releaser Dragun combo route (good route for generic synchro). Summon Scorpio, use Scorpio ss Cobra, use Cobra add Instant Fusion, use Instant Fusion ss Sea Monster of Theseus, link off Theseus + Scorpio/Cobra for Halqifibrax, use Halqifibrax ss O-Lion, link Halqifibrax off for Linkross, use Linkross ss token (we only need one token, can summon 2 but beware of monster zone getting clogged), tune O-Lion and token for Martial Mech Marcher, use O-Lion and Martial ss O-Lion again and a Mecha Phantom Beast Token, synchro summon Marjoram using Martial + Mecha Phantom Beast Token and Garden Rose Maiden using O-Lion+Cobra/Scorpio, use Marjoram and Garden Rose Maiden add Blessed Winds and Black Garden, link off Garden Rose Maiden + Linkross for Cross Rose Dragon.  It's hard to play the combo in MR4 because Linkross only provides one link arrow. The rest of the cards are just to turbo out Scorpio or being a lv 3 monster for Halqifibrax combo and bunch of power cards like handtraps and its prevention, and some breaking board/backrow card.  Expected first turn:  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/xJB9vci.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Very consistent combo, great recursion thanks to Cross Rose, Garden Rose Maiden, and Blessed Winds. Can include power cards like handtraps or to break board.  Cons: Very bad matchup against dino deck esp with Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, the Rose Dragon Synchros miss timing alot, like Black Rose Dragon cant activate if ss from Cross Rose activating during a chain link 2 and Black Rose Moonlight Dragon (not even a Rose Dragon) might miss timing too despite being an ""if"" effect."

You can read more about Trinity Format here.</a>  The idea behind this deck was both to provide a more solid and streamlined focus for the Cyber Dragon decks I've played in the past and attempt to adapt the strategy to a future where Megafleet will lose a lot of its luster.  The main plan was to create beneficial trades and eliminate threats in the opponent's board while building up to the win condition of the deck, <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>. (To be fair, Infinity himself only came up in two games and in one of them the opponent conceded instantly). The method to accomplish this was, of course, another key card of the deck: <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a>. Its milling effect is probably the most important thing in this deck because it opens up a lot of lines of play depending on your hand/field/GY. Namely, if summoned during the opponent's turn (with <a data-name=""Cyberload Fusion"">Cyberload Fusion </a>or <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion </a>for example) you can cheat the 3 summon limit and make infinity by milling <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz </a>and <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a>.  The ABCs exist as an alternative starter engine and potential mills for Rampage, with <a data-name=""ABC-Dragon Buster"">ABC-Dragon Buster </a>himself being quite a potent threat against a lot of strategies that rely on floating, thus earning the title of the alternative win condition.  As for the co forbidden/semi forbidden cards, unfortunately Infinity and ABC are semi and co respectively, increasing the deck's size substantially. For my second co forbidden I opted for <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster </a>and, finally, I decided to play trinities of <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core </a>and <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a>. Core himself is the starter of the deck and the extra copy both increases consistency of your plays and allows you to be less limited in his use, especially concerning his second effect. The double Herzes are quite interesting in that they provide more opportunities for recycling used Cybers or pseudo-searches with Rampage but they also create a perfect loop as discard fodder. A Herz in hand and one in the GY allows you to plus while using either Dragon Buster's effect or <a data-name=""Dark Factory of Mass Production"">Dark Factory of Mass Production</a> (which also has synergy with the ABC pieces).  Surely, the deck has not reached a perfect state and I'll keep trying to improve it, but for now, that's all folks."

Then your goal is to bring Frightfur Kraken and Frightfur Tiger out. Tiger will pop any cards on the field up to the number of materials used for its summon.  Kraken can attack twice and Tiger gives both 300 ATK for each Frightfur on the field. So with 600 to both Tiger and Kraken, Tiger popping their monsters and cards, when battle happens if you are not opposed then Tigers 2500 ATK and Krakens 2800 ATK x2 will be 100 life points over OTK.  &nbsp;  A major combo that helps is Bear, Toy Vendor, then WIngs.  Send Bear to the grave to set a Toy Vendor from deck.  Activate it.  Discard Wings from your hand to activate Toy Vendor.  Now, while Wings is in your grave, banish it, with Bear and send the Toy Vendor to grave. (It doesn't HAVE to be Bear, any other Fluffal works too)  This will let you draw 2 and search your Deck for any Fluffal or an Edge Imp Sabres.  &nbsp;  Frightfur Patchwork is an amazing card in this Deck, if it gets ""Ashed"" however, it really hurts.  Frightfur Fusion is great when the first strategy wont work, if you can get Tiger out or Sabre-Tooth, then use Frightfur Fusion while you have Edge Sabres in grave and a ton of Fluffals, then you can Fusion for Frightfur Wolf, who can attack up to the number of materials used for Fusion.  &nbsp;  Good luck"

Maybe Sunrise to support more then win :)","<p>Despite, this deck does not contain expensive cards like Evil HERO Malicious Bane or Evil HERO Adusted Gold or not even the so popular but pricy Vision HERO combo makers like Vision HERO Faris and Vision HERO Increase, this deck is amazingly fully functional. It relies on the several special summons that the variety of HERO monsters can engage into, the wide variety of fusion monsters the HERO archetype has to offer and all the necessary support in the correct ratio that allow the deck to perform the combos. The main floodgate this deck offers are Masked HERO Dark Law and Destiny HERO Plasma. Masked HERO Dark Law can keep the opponent from attempting GY plays, while Destiny HERO Plasma is the response to any on field monster effect. This deck can rely on many individual special summons, which makes the summoning of Destiny HERO Plasma a lot more easier. Once summoned, Destiny HERO Plasma can also absorb any 1 monster on the field, which by negating all monster effect on the field, it results in a guaranteed to get passed all in build protection that the monster may have and easily perform the steal. The link monster Xtra HERO Dread Decimator and the honest-like effect that Elemental HERO Honest Neos are used to give attack increase to flood gate monsters Destiny HERO Plasma and Masked HERO Dark Law and prevent that any monster can run over the low attack values that they individually have. Additionally the newest Fusion monster, at the time of me posting this deck, Elemental HERO Sunrise can give 1 in-battle protection to any 1 HERO monster being attacked except itself, by destroying any 1 card on the field during battle phase, between battle step and before damage calculation. I truly believe that this deck can perform well and achieve competitive results without going into big expenses. Most importantly hope it brings fun to anyone who wants to try this out.</p>"

Leave your comments please,"Hello, one and all once again to the land of Yu-Gi-Oh. Today I have prepared for your a Yu-Gi-Oh deck the likes of which have been seen before many times before. I have made a few choices that aren't necessarily spicy but they do divulge from the traditional HERO build. I ask for you to leave questions below because I have been playing this deck for a long time and I would love to answer your questions about the deck. Also, if you have any comments that can make the deck stronger do that as well.  &nbsp;  Here I will explain my main deck tech choices -  3x Twin Twisters -- I refuse to lose to mine and it can be helpful against other super important back row cards like Salamangreat Sanctuary, Lost World, Altergeist, and so on. It can also be a great way to bait out interruptions early.  Pot of Avarice - If you get the standard combo of Faris and any other HERO then you will have five monsters in the grave that don't necessarily need to be there. Extra deck monsters and one or two of's that you would rather draw can go back without hurting the deck at all. Just make sure that you don't get rid of miracle fusion material if thats a potential play for you. I usually do this when I cant search mask change in a turn and I really want to try to draw it.  Pot of acquisitiveness - More Malicious no problem. The same thing with the dynatag, or the cards you banish off vyon. I see it as a way to restart your play if your opponent draws one of their outs to your board. I will say that this and Avarice usually get sided out game two and three. What is important is that the first game has the most randomness to it, and it is always better to reload your resources just in case.  Destiny Hero Decider - I hear one guy say, ""If you need to use celestial then you're losing."" I though long and hard about this and decided to play this instead. You can add back plasma or honest neos which would otherwise be stuck in the graveyard. You can also slow down mystic mine if you can activate monster effects.  Elemental HERO Shining - I won't play Miracle fusion without more than one target. I chose this because you can miracle fusion a nibiru token for its summon. You can also banish Honest Neos from grave, and then when shining is sent to grave (ie linked off) you can add that Neos back. The only time i've wished I had something else was blast. I wouldn't play Anki but that is just me.  &nbsp;  This is where I discuss my side deck options -  Super Poly and its targets - It's Super poly I wont explain more. I play earth golem for spyral and salamangreat. I play Starving venom because it is a good card and many decks use two darks. The third I have is mudragon and it's iffy. I play him mostly for the madolche matchup I think, but there are other situations where you can hit spiral boards, or shadoll boards. It is the least often used choice but I like playing three to cover all the bases.  Red Reboot/Royal Decree - You don't play any traps and altergeist and paleo suck to play against. I side out the pots and reinforcement for these three and keep the twin twisters in.  Dark ruler no more I think I use mostly for Dino and the HERO matchup. Most HERO decks don't play well against other HERO decks. Dino is also this decks worst matchup and I will not debate that with anyone. Dropping a dark ruler on a dino board gives you free rein to destroy their board. I prefer to plasma the UTC off the board instead of just giving it back, and then the monster effects stay off. I try to make dark laws as fast as I can after using Dark Ruler so that their entire field gets banished. I have considered playing evenly matched over this, but it's too expensive.  Ash Blossom - Over all else Ash can kill every deck. Do not jump at the first search, unless it is like turn three. I held an ash against prank kids until mid combo to ash the summon and it stopped him outright. Unless its a normal summoned stratos, or something else that the opponent has to get off and is only once per turn wait to ash.

And thus, this hellspawn was born.  As a general rule, you want to go first and turbo out Tarotrei as fast as possible, and then abuse her effects to repeatedly summon/activate the effects of Pot of the Forbidden, Coinorma and Arsenal Summoner. Arsenal Summoner in particular is extremely helpful in building a bigger board, and if you can't get Pot onto the field somehow, you want to activate this guy's effect and search an Eatos or a Grarl. Just keep in mind both Eatos and Grarl are basically vanilla beaters with a nice summoning condition, so don't rely on them or anything; they're more so there to close up the game faster and make BLS."

After its release in december 2019 I changed a few things, for example I put in the new unchained monsters. You can find the original idea <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygorganization.com/unchainedscrap/"">HERE</a></strong>  The strategy guide came to me in the right moment: I was thinking about what could I do with the Unchained archetype, also one the older archetypes I really loved to play is Scrap. I didn't waste to much time, got myself the cards I was missing and gave it a try.  With the release of Scrap Factory back in 2014 I started playing the (pure) Scrap deck, because they got some nice floating (and good looking ultimate synchros). With the beginning of the Arc-V era until the release of the Unchained archetype I couldn't think of a way how to build a competitive deck around Scrap. Not only because Scrap Wyvern wasn't released until early december 2019 in the TCG.  The Unchained archetype itself is more of a control based deck. The Link-2 Unchained Soul of Rage is perfect for interrupting your enemie during their turn, to get yourself some nice big Link monsters.  Both of these archetypes are going pretty well together and if you stay cool you'll be able to have some pretty nice duels.  &nbsp;"

Guaranteed 100% opponent rage. (Under 100$),"The deck is very easy to use, gives a lot of fun and is very strong.  If you do not draw the mystic mine in the first round, you should choose this card through Metaverse, Left Arm Offering or Demise of The Land. The priority is to activate Mystic Mine, Field Barrier and set Dark Bribe. Then activate Cauldron of Old Man or Wave Motion Cannon. Then win.  <strong>Remember to summon cards when the opponent has more monsters on his field.</strong>  If the opponent is blocked and can't do anything, you can start to heal. If you have 2x Cauldron of the Old man in the field, you heal for 5000 life after 5 turns, after 6 turns you heal for 6000 life, etc. My record is accumulated 75,000 life points but the opponent almost didn't kill me because we played 30 minutes and the deck is annoying. :P  A good option is to activate Prohibition and remove Ash, MST, etc. from the game or cards that can remove Mystic Mine from field.

For people who are interested, use Hajun and Dakki for the synchro summon. Special summon Dakki from the GY every time you synchro summon. Use Absolute Zero when Dakki is summoned from the GY. When that happens, target an opponent's monster to make their ATK 0. If Absolute Zero is destroyed, special summon Gashadokuro from the GY for a 3300 ATK beat-stick that's unaffected by card effects. Use Yuki-Musume to send cards like Mezuki, Necroworld, and Doomking to the GY. Speaking of which...</span>  <span>Second strategy: Use Necroworld for a direct activation for Zombie World. For the standby phase for either player's turn, special summon Doomking in DEF position.</span>  <span>Other than that, that's it.</span>"

Ultimaya Tzolkin. Tap into the power of the crims,"I, like many other members of the community, really enjoy the yugioh 5d's anime. Synchro summoning is one of the best mechanics in the game - but it doesn't get the respect it deserves. Many synchro-based archetypes are simply cast away, or just forgotten as a whole. In 2017, a study showed that people would get PTSD flashbacks when exposed to the word 'X-Saber'. Oh god......not again! I already tributed for Gottoms' effect! Despite the injustice given to our white warriors (and dragons), many deck related around the mechanic have been appearing here and there. But you still want something fast-paced, something that can give you an end-board of 8 negates without breaking a sweat. Here I present: Tzolkin HERO.  Making an endboard is pretty easy - but there's no real combo to do so. The way you make Tzolkin most of the time is with Malicious and Coral Dragon. Getting malicious in grave is really easy - the challenge is summoning Coral Dragon. But don't worry; I promised a consistent deck. All of the hero monsters we run are warriors, so Isolde is definitely the ideal play. Since it pitches equip spells - and the new Magicians' Souls allows us to discard spells - we run a reasonable bamboo engine. It surprisingly works really nicely and lets you draw into more extenders like Synkron Resonator (which you mainly use to create Archfiend Abyss the second time you use Ultimaya's effect. Back on topic however - you can send four equip spells to the grave and get an Armageddon Knight + two free cards. Armageddon will send Destrudo and our not-so-new Crystron Halqifibrax (released recently for the TCG) will be put forward. With all the ways to summon in this deck, you simply use Plaguespreader and a level 4 and KABLAM! Your ultimaya. You obviously want to set a card and get that sweet Crystal Wing - but it doesn't end there. Draco-Equiste is a tech that drives this deck to top tier level. Not only can you summon it with your Coral Dragon and a warrior - it allows you to use Ultimaya a second time, as it copies its effect. Here I'd recommend having a void ogre or beelze in order to make abyss, but if you have no cards in hand Void Ogre is still great. And the cherry on top of this concoction of ours - Apollousa. You can use Needlefiber + the other monsters in your grave like Plaguespreader and Malicious in order to get those free negates.  So what do you do if you unfortunately don't draw Miracle Synchro Fusion? Well - keeping Ultimaya on the field isnt bad. Scrap-Iron Signal is a card that just got released, and optimises the build anyway. Its another negate in trap form - but the catch is that it sets itself, so you can activate Tzolkin on your opponents turn for <em>another </em>negate. You should play no more than two copies, because it does clog your deck and there are high chances of you getting what you need anyway with all the draw power in the deck.  In conclusion: this deck deserves a 7.9/10. It's quite old but manages to get the job done. If you think through your plays - you could end on some dope boards. The only downside; side-decking and bricks. Going Second against a deck like Shaddoll (with Winda absolutely killing the purpose) makes it hard for you to do something. Not only that - but you're not guaranteed to open well every game. While yes the ratios are somewhat in favour of good pulls, it still has a too high chance of bricking to be competitive. Its still a fun deck though, and I'll definitely try it out more. You should too."

There are 3 main OTK options in the deck, depending on what you draw, and what your opponents board is like.  The first OTK option is- of course- Final Sigma. For the OTK, all you need is Nabla and Multiplication. You can consistently get Nabla out through Cynet Mining or Alembertian(or simply by having him in hand already), and from there you can easily summon Multiplication through Nabla's effect. Alternatively, you could summon Alembertian with Multiplication as material if you have Monster Reborn or Equation in your hand, and simply revive Multiplication once you get Nabla. A simple play for a very strong monster.  The second OTK is the Transcode Talker/Update Jammer combo. This is fairly self-explanatory. Link summon for Jammer, then link summon again for Transcode. Jammer lets Transcode attack twice, and Transcode revives Jammer back to the field for a total of 8100 attack on board. This becomes even stronger if you use Multiplication or Code Radiator when link summoning Transcode. Multiplication can double Transcode's attack, and Radiator can reduce an opponents monsters attack to 0 AND negate its effects until it leaves the field. If Radiator was already on the field, it can do this to two monsters, which is even better.  The third of the main 3 OTK options is Masquerenamax. This play is done by Link summoning Link Disciple and Devotee. Disciple tributes Devotee for a draw(and place 1 on bottom of deck), and Devotee produces two tokens. Then, link summon for Wicckid, and use the final token and another monster to summon I:P(You can then search for a tuner from Wicckid's effect). Then on your opponents turn, link into Avramax, which has protection because of I:P. To achieve an OTK, equip this Avramax with Billionblade. Battling any monster with 1000 attack or more, and discarding Multiplication with Billionblade, instantly gives you a minimum of 8000 damage.  You could also potentially OTK with Earth Golem @Ignister by equipping it with Billionblade after summoning it with Super Poly. If it attacks a special summoned monster, it buffs to 4600 at the start of the damage step. Then Billionblade sends Multiplication, which bumps Earth Golem up to 10200 attack, giving you OTK on anything under 2200 attack, which includes Gameciel! This, however, doesn't come up too often, so I don't consider it to be a ""main OTK option"".  Ash Blossom, Ghost Belle, D.D. Crow, Effect Veiler, Pankratops, Impermanence, Reboot and Called by the Grave are self-explanatory. Note that you can discard Mathmech Sigma for Cynet Mining and Twin Twisters, and then special summon it back to the field if you don't occupy an extra monster zone. As of MR5, you can also do this with Super Poly, as long as you don't summon to an extra monster zone. Linkslayer is an extra special summon, and gives backrow removal. Backup Secretary is also an extra special summon. Gameciel is self-explanatory, and can facilitate your OTK if you go for Final Sigma or Avramax.  Light Dragon @Ignister and Red Reboot can swap with Superfactorial and Laplacian to give you extra negate, destruction and recovery. Topologic Bomber Dragon is self-explanatory.  Cyberse Gadget gets you a Disciple &amp; Devotee on its own, meaning you can get Wicckid and I:P with two Cyberse monsters instead of three.  Code Talker Inverted is in the extra deck as it assists the OTK when used with Code Radiator. If you have Nabla, Code Radiator and another Cyberse monster(Sigma, Addition, Subtraction), you can link summon the Code Talker Inverted using the Cyberse monster and Radiator, dropping one opponents' monster to 0 attack and negating their effects. From there, normal summon Nabla and tribute Code Talker Inverted to special summon Multiplication. Synchro into Final Sigma, and swing into the 0 attack monster for 12000 damage."

His ability to Special Summon himself by discarding another Zombie makes him an excellent tech choice. So needless to say, I had plenty of motivation to make this deck.  &nbsp;  Because of this deck uses 6 hand traps, as well as Instant Fusion, Super Poly, and Vampire Fraulien, it can function just fine going second. In the past, Zombie World decks had to go first to make some significant plays. But with 14 cards and 14 ways to screw over your opponent, this is no longer the case. Sea Monster of Theseus and Crystron Haqlifibrax are also in this deck to turbo out Doomking Balerdroch, and Verte Anaconda is in the side deck to get more use out of Super Poly.  &nbsp;  And if your opponent tries to activate a monster effect while you've got Balerdroch and Zombie World out, feel free to shout ""Muda"" to your heart's content. :)"

All you need to start the fun is a Noble Arms and a way to summon Medraut (Medraut, Merlin, RotA, etc) Summon Medraut, equip him with a Noble Arms, and use his effect to bring out Iyvanne. This will destroy your Noble Arms equip and then reattach said equip to Iyvanne, triggering Iyvanne's effect to summon a token. Use 2 of your monsters (usually the token and whichever other one you like) to summon Isolde. Use Isolde's effect to add a Noble Knight to your hand, then use her effect to send 4 equips to the grave (you want atleast 3 Noble Arms in grave to use with Artorigus (you need to send Clarent if you don't have it in hand) and you can/should probably also send a Cursed Bamboo Sword to add either a Broken Bamboo Sword or a Golden Bamboo Sword to get some draw power) and summon a Noble Knight to board. From here depends on what you have in hand. You could use Bamboo Swords to draw if you have the ability to do so, you could use Pop Up to discard and draw some cards, there are several options but in the end you want at least 2 out of the 3 of these in your hand: Mage Power, Glory of the Noble Knights, Twin Swords of Flashing Light. XYZ summon Artorigus and equip him with 3 Noble Arms equip cards (there are rare cases where you want to equip less if you, for example, opened with Clarent or have 2 Mage Powers in hand, etc) then use use Glory to equip Twin Swords/Mage Power (whichever you don't have in hand), then equip the other to Artorigus. By this point, rather typically, you should have Arorigus with Galatin, Clarent, Noble Arms of Destiny, Twin Swords, and Mage Power. This will allow you to spend 500 LP on Clarent to attack directly this turn, and Twin Swords will allow you to attack twice."

Now with bonus turn 1 board building, a still incredibly fragile combo game, and even more salt from people who","Hello everyone, Tranquilis here. Last year I submitted a decklist for pure Fur Hires that served me fairly well for the entirety of MR4. With MR5 just around the corner I figured it was time to give it a few updates, and the deck plays better than it ever has. A very low bar for Fur Hires, I know, but this version of the deck aims to swarm the field with a series of various members of the Furry Force to pull off a vast toolbox of effects.  The basic premise of the deck is that Fur Hires come in two shapes, the small monsters and the big monsters.  Once per turn all of the small Fur Hires have an effect to special summon any other Fur Hire monster from your hand, except for duplicates, and have an effect that activates when another Fur Hire, regardless of size, is special summoned to the field.  The big Fur Hires meanwhile are all high enough in level as to not be able to be normal summoned without a tribute, and cannot special summon additional Fur Hires from the hand, but have an effect that activates when they finally hit the board that scales in strength based on the number of Fur Hires you control with different names, and a secondary effect to either negate cards by discarding (Rafale and Wiz) or prevent your opponent from targeting your other monsters with battle or card effects (Dyna and Sagitta, respectively.)  At the absolute bare minimum the idea of the deck is to continuously summon the small Fur Hires with their effect to special summon another from the hand, and then end the proverbial chain of special summons with one of the big Fur Hires to get the best bang for your buck from their effect. Where the strategy gets more interesting than an exceedingly linear beatdown archetype is the things the deck is capable of busting out via the extra deck, namely their archetypal boss monster, Folgo, Justice Fur Hire, and the extreme variety of plays enabled by I:P Masquerena.  Folgo is a link 3 that can be made with any three monsters of different type, has three arrows pointing downward, and cannot be used as link material. His two effects are fairly simple, but open up a lot of possibilities depending on what kind of hand you open. His first effect is to summon a Fur Hire from the deck in defense position, so long as it doesn't share a type with any monster that was used to summon Folgo. The effect sounds restrictive, but as a whole two Fur Hires actually share a type, this in the vast majority of cases simply prevents you from summoning duplicates of whatever you made Folgo with, allowing easy access to either Rafale or Wiz, the two main deck monsters you're aiming to leave on your board, or a deceptive amount of play extension thanks to two factors. Do remember that the small Fur Hire effects activate on the special summon of ANY Fur Hire monster, not just from the hand, meaning Folgo being summoned period can proc these effects when you have no more Fur Hires to summon from the hand, and his easy access to their main deck boss monsters also equates to easy access to any other tool the archetype could suddenly need. So long as you have another Fur Hire in hand, or can proc the effect of Filo to summon a Fur Hire from the GY, you also have easy access to Beat's search, the face-up or face-down card popping of either Recon or Donpa, the discard and draw of Helmer, or the graveyard recovery of Seal. If no other options are left your best bet is to simply summon Rafale, or Wiz if he's already on board, but most times you can get the most mileage out of this simple summon from deck by bringing out one of the smaller Fur Hires.  His second effect has a comparatively much less complex amount of utility, but is still one of the main things that make him an amazing card. Once per turn, when an opponent's card is destroyed <span>which does include destruction they triggered with their own cards, and trust me be ready to watch people immediately trigger this effect of their own volition with zero thought, <span>Rafale can draw you one card. If you have three Fur Hire monsters on board with different names, this turns into drawing three cards. With the right set-ups I've come damn near decking myself out in the past with how much advantage this effect can net you, and it makes up the essence of what the deck tries to accomplish.</span></span>  &nbsp;  The deck's main playmaker for f a n c y set-ups is I:P Masquarena. Your ending board, no matter what effectively, should usually be an attempt at getting Folgo, I:P, and some combination of various main deck Fur Hires leftover. Masquarena can quick-effect perform a link summon on the opponent's turn, using herself and face-up monsters you control as material, and giving the summoned monster battle protection. For most turn 1 set-ups the dirtiest thing you can do is make a very quick and easy battle immune Appolousa, Bow of the Goddess, with three monster effect negations ready to go, possibly even 4 depending on how hard you popped off. Rafale and Wiz can discard a Fur Hire card from hand to negate a monster or spell/trap effect respectively, meaning that on an ideal day you can end up with 4-5 monster effect negates, and a backrow negate so long as you have the materials and requisite cards in hand to discard.  Alternatively, Masquarena has two other main options to quick effect link herself into: Either another copy of Folgo, or Unchained Abomination. By making Folgo you can get your free summon from the deck, and trigger the effects of your leftover Fur Hires on board during the opponent's turn, resulting in potentially quick pops, draws, searches, or surprise attack point boosts.  Unchained Abomination is a bit more of an edgecase, however. If the opponent has nothing really worth negating with Appolousa, a rarity that does periodically happen, Abomination can be worth making for his pseudo-battle protection of popping cards when another card is destroyed, when he gets destroyed by card effects, or simply a pop during the end phase, all to the benefit of triggering Folgo during the opponent's turn. Again, he should never really be the priority to make, but can be worth considering against backrow heavy decks Appolousa can't pester to the fullest.  &nbsp;  Otherwise your extra deck is a suite of various, random, toolboxy extra deck things you just happen to be able to make.  Your instant fusion targets are Millenium-Eyes Restrict for defending against hand traps, and Sea Monster of Theseus for being a free special summon to convert into Folgo that doesn't conflict with the typing of any Fur Hires in your deck, while also opening up a very small synchro engine. Feel free to substitute what you feel works best, just be mindful you are very hard-bound to non archetypal, completely generic 2 material synchros that you just happen to be able to make with the levels of your smaller Fur Hires +5. The Xyz line-up is also fairly open to interpretation, but do be warned that most all of your Fur Hires are also different levels which makes any choices here inherently incredibly inconsistent to make. I have Bagooska for emergency stalling, and Ronin Raccoon because the level 2s of the deck happen to be Beasts, so he just happens to be a powerful pick I can kinda make. Sometimes. not often.  And of all your links, we also run one copy of Borrelsword because...  &nbsp;  I mean it's Borrelsword. He does big number and OTK going second, and the deck can pop him out piss easy to shred boards.  &nbsp;  Otherwise, that's the gist of the deck. I may potentially return to this post to throw up some cherry-picked replays of the deck in action, and look forward to answering any questions about piloting the deck or specific card choices in the comments. Thank you for reading."

Before Jewel Beast - Argosaurus was revealed, I tried to make this before, but it was too inconsistent. But now that Argosaurus helps make Miscellaneosaurus more powerful and makes you less reliant on Souleating Oviraptor, I can afford to make this. It's just your typical Dinosaur deck, except it runs Foolish Burial Goods and Survival's End.  &nbsp;  Because of the artwork of Survival's End, I decided to name this deck ""Ice Ice Baby"", after the song by Vanilla Ice. Your goal is to turbo out Souleating Oviraptor and Ultimate Conductor Tyranno. And Survival's End's graveyard effect makes this easier, since you can use it to destroy Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon (or your opponent's Juraegg Token, if you control Lost World) to summon Oviraptor."

And one of its effects is that if a monster gets summoned to a zone Cross-Sheep points to while you control a Fusion, you can revive a Level 4 or lower monster. I named this deck after both Five Nights At Freddy's, and Sora Perse, the character in Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V who has a Fluffal deck.  This is the reason why I made this Fluffal deck. Cross-Sheep's effect can either help you Link Summon other monsters, or help you do other Fusion Summons. And given how often Fluffals OTK, this deck isn't going to need Borrelsword Dragon (I miss muh baby...), which is why I settled for Borreload instead.   Plus, there's the obvious fact that Cross-sheep's artwork fits in with the ""stuffed animal"" theme of Fluffals. Cross-Sheep is a great addition to Fluffals, both aesthetically and functionally."

Its hard to get everything you want to have on your end board but if develop a feeling for this deck you will soon get lots of fun with spamming your opponent to the surrender. For MR5 this deck works even better because you aren't limited to the link zones.

Basic strategy is aiming to resolve Halqifibrax effect to summon Deskbot 001 and make Auroradon, ss 3 tokens + 001 back from GY, use Auroradon tribute 2 tokens for Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing, use Coltwing ss another 2 tokens, synchro summon using 2 tokens + 001 for Karakuri Burei, make plays until you have 2 Karakuri Bureido and 2 lv4 (one tuner and one non tuner), overlay both Bureido for True King of All Calamities, and synchro summon both lv4 for Borreload Savage Dragon.  Follow up play we can use Accesscode Talker since we have unused Auroradon link3 on field and bunch of different attribute link in GY (can be Almiraj, Halqifibrax, Auroradon, etc.). The Dragun lineup is just precaution if we run out of plays. The tuner engine used works with both the brick Karakuri tuners because they both can go into Almiraj and we can summon Crusadia Arboria to its link point. The handtraps are just good tuners and we can use them as Crossout Designator fodder to ensure our Halqifibrax resolving.  Pros: Super consistent, bunch of handtraps, end board can choose between negation or removal, still has follow up play, and can OTK even going second.  Cons: drawing doubles either the Mecha Phantom Beast or Karakuris will make this combo totally offline, super poly and other power cards are still threats."

Not looking to reinvent the wheel here. I'm trying The Shining as a Miracle Fusion target when you loop it with Wonder Driver, a convenient LIGHT monster. I usually like decks that are 40 cards, but here I think decreasing the odds of seeing your bricks is good, and more than made up for by all the searching in the deck.  Trying an Isolde Package, with all the equip spells that can easily be put back into the deck before you activate her effect. To compensate for the extra bricks, we're running a full 3 of all the pieces which are now 1 card starters for Isolde. You can't use Cross-Crusader for anything on the turn you Isolde, but you can still essentially do the same thing of searching for a hero monster (via Stratos) while getting extra value in an Honest Neos. It makes Emergency Call and A Hero Lives way better, and improves access to mask change, which is key. So far testing is going well on the reworked Isolde variant.  Updated in advance for April ban list. It's hard to guess what the format will look like between new cards and MR5, so I'm packing a bunch of staples and some stuff for Invoked Shaddoll. Losing Malicious 3 sucks, but is probably fair, and I like the added utility Isolde brings to the deck so far."

HIGH CHANCE FOR OTKs. EASY TO SUMMON HERO BOSS MONSTERS.,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU GO SECOND TO GET THAT OTK.  You need to have Stratos and/or Faris on your opening hand. If you don't have neither, search it out with Emergency call or Reinforcement of the army. It's better if you have solid soldier in your hand so once you have stratos on your hand, you get to summon both.  If you have Faris, special summon it then use its effect to put Increase on your spell/trap zone. Then use Increase's effect to put Faris in the GY to summon Vyon. Once you have Vyon, put either Shadow Mist or Malicious in the GY (based on which effect you need more). If you have Malicious in your grave, summon him back to the field, then link summon Cross Crusader. Activate Cross Crusader's effect to summon back Malicious to the field and back to GY in order to search out a hero to your hand. If you dont have aduster gold yet, search him out using this effect. Activate Aduster Gold's effect to get dark calling. You can activate Vyon's effect to banish a monster from the GY (use Faris) to get polymerization. Before fusion summoning, link summon Decimator using your monsters on the field. Then summon malicious bane. If you have monsters left on your hand, (ideally two different attributes) you can summon Sunrise using polymerization. Activate Sunrise's effect to get miracle fusion. You should have at least 3 strong monsters with at least 3000+ ATK by now  OTK your opponent   The side deck contains the omni heroes so you can use super polymerization and add those heroes to your extra deck based on your opponent's monster attribute.  &nbsp;"

You get to your end by mainly using the 2 Slimes and using their effects to summon Genghis and have some way to get Lamia ither on the field or in the graveyard, which can then go into one of the level 7 Synchros and continue your combos from there. Thanks to Gilgamesh being released in DUOV the deck has a much easier time for a mid combo setup of scales at the cost of being locked into D/D/D's for the remainder of the turn, that is why sometimes you will be unable to go into a Halqifibrax.  One of the deck's biggest weaknesses is disruption, be it an Ash, Veiler or Lock Bird, which is why Called by the Grave is an absolute necessity, without it the deck can play through a single disruption max before you're forced to scoop. Nibiru is your worst nightmare also and recovering from being hit with that rock can be damn near impossible.  The side deck is for when your opponent forces you to go second as well as having a Riser dragon in there if you feel that he is more useful than the Formula Synchron, though it is recommended that you test both out before hand and replace his spot in the side with anything else you might find useful. Ash is also there because I couldn't think of any other card for the side so feel free to replace it as you see fit.  The deck has a quite high skill ceiling and memorizing combos and playing around certain cards can be daunting but feels very rewarding when you finally think of a way to establish a strong board, even if it did take you about 30 minutes into the match to think of it. On a side note the deck can do quite poorly in time as your continuous spells constantly drain your life points therefore I would suggest finding a way to negate it or get rid of it before your standby phase comes up.  &nbsp;"

Your obvious goal is to put Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon (or Ojamegazord) on the field with the insane support that Ojamas have. That rarely happens, but it is possible. This deck will either do the most impressive play you have ever seen or will do absolutely nothing, but that's what makes it fun.

I'm planning to use this at regional and updated it with my score. If I could change something I would switch different dimension ground with evenly match but I can't afford it since I bought 3 Magicians souls. But I'll describe why I run what I run.  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Dark Magician - The heart and soul of the deck, the <span class=""hiddenSuggestion"">ultimate</span> wizard in terms of attack and defense. Got to have him to make it work lol.</span>  Apprentice illusion magician - I run her at one Cause I don't want to see her to many or have to many in my starting hand. I don't want to have to many dark magicians in my hand but she does have a nice honest like effect.  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Dark Magician girl one of the 2 bricks. I run her so I can have +1 with soul servant. In case I need to send a monster with magician souls effect and I already have all my dark magicians out the deck. The magician combination is great for its negation effect. And so I can special <span class=""hiddenSuggestion"">summon</span> her if The Dark Magicians get destroyed</span>  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Magicians Rod - the only normal <span class=""hiddenSuggestion"">summon</span> and searcher of the deck. mainly uses to get cards I need/ haven't used yet</span>  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Magicians souls - the card that's makes a budget deck expensive. It's amazing how it makes the deck more consistent. I mainly use it to special <span class=""hiddenSuggestion"">summon</span> dark magician but if my hand is really <span class=""hiddenSpellError"">bricky</span> it helps unbrick it. </span>  Ash bloom &amp; D.D. Crow - I mean Ash is Ash, everyone and there moms run this. D.D. Crow is for an allure target and as well as the meta has graveyard effect.  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Allure of darkness z It's really meant to help me dig deeper in my deck. Sometime I'll banish Dark magician cause I'll make 2 work or rod if I already normal <span class=""hiddenSuggestion"">summon</span> him the same turn</span>  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Foolish burial goods - It send cards I need to help draw or the navigation to negate a spell/trap effect for a turn. Send <span class=""hiddenSpellError"">metalfoes</span> to shuffle and draw or soul servant to draw.</span>  <span class=""mceItemHidden""><span class=""hiddenSpellError"">Metalfoes</span> fusion z This card is great, like an upstart. If it's in the starting hand there are plenty of cards that will discard, souls being the best one cause you draw one and shuffle and draw another. </span>  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Soul servant - It's funny how its first effect let's you stack your deck. But it's great how it <span class=""hiddenGrammarError"">can be</span> any dark magician card (expect eye of Timaeus). Normally I just use DM to draw but if there's <span class=""hiddenSpellError"">DMG</span> than it well help draw more </span>  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Called by the grave - you have multiple ways to draw/add and monster effects going off. But stopping it all together is great. Cause stuff you didn't think about like navigation <span class=""hiddenGrammarError"">can be</span> ash.</span>  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Forbidden chalice - effect <span class=""hiddenSpellError"">veiler</span> better sibling. You can't active during the opponent turn unless it's set. But I prefer this over effect <span class=""hiddenSpellError"">veiler</span> because it can only be activated it during the opponent main phase, while Chalice <span class=""hiddenGrammarError"">can be</span> </span>activated when ever  Super poly - amazing board wiper so long as the targets match  <span class=""mceItemHidden""><span class=""hiddenSpellError"">Serect</span> of dark magic - it's a great card to get one of the 2 dark magician fusion</span>  Dark magical circle - I only run 2 cause you don't need 3. It's a good card but sucks when you can't add off it. And I have using circle to add circle.  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Magicians navigation - It helps get DM and <span class=""hiddenSpellError"">DMG</span> out there. But it's really meant for its dank graveyard effect. </span>  Eternal soul - it has been my favorite dark magician card for the fact that it makes DM immune to all card effects. And the graveyard revive.  Skill drain - no reason to not run it. Some problematic cards have ridiculous effects. So this helps a lot.  Magicians Combinations - The second brick of the deck. It's here so I can negate cards, and to switch back a forward between the Magicians. Also has a cool effect if it get a popped.  Solemn Judgment - the king of saying NO. But be careful to pay attention to life points"

On ""crystron needlefiber"" we SS ""Linkross"" we use his effect SS 2 tokens. On ""blackwing - Steam the Cloak"" &amp; ""Linkross"" we SS ""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"", we use ""blackwing - Steam the Cloak"" we SS token and effect ""Linkuriboh"" In GY on ""Link Token"". Now we are using effect ""blackwing - Steam the Cloak"" on the second ""Link Token"". On ""blackwing - Steam the Cloak"" &amp; ""Linkuriboh"" we SS ""union carrier"". We use ""blackwing - Steam the Cloak"" effect in GY we SS token. On two steam tokens we SS ""I:P Masquerena"". We use effect ""union carrier"" we equip ""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"" with ""dragon buster destruction sword"". Now we are using ""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"" effect and we SS  ""dragun of red-eyes"". Next turn we use ""I:P Masquerena"" we SS ""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"".  If something goes wrong e.g  : opponent will use set ""called by the grave"" on ""Jet Synchron"" or ""Glow-Up Bulb"" in GY , we can continue  combo if we have ""Crusadia Arboria"" in hand.  We can also create a similar but weaker combo using ""sangan"" &amp; ""Crusadia Arboria"". In this case we use ""Sangan"" effect to add 1 extra monster to hand  (e.g  : ""ash blossom &amp; joyous spring"" or ""droll and lock bird"".  Going second Combo :  At the beginning we clean the field as much as we can.  Further depending on the situation  or we do normal combo, or we start the same but later we combine into combos  ""knightmare"" links.  Very low death hand around 10%. Main combo chances around 75% .  All mine decks are well tested and optimized in terms of draw power, dead hand, synergy. balance &amp; combo.  All this to give you the best possible version of selected deck. <p class=""LC20lb DKV0Md"">Please check my other decks.

Also, a new Fusion monster, ""The Dark Magicians"" with materials pretty easy for the deck summon that offers draw power and recursion,a fusion/ritual Quick-play Spell Card ""Secrets of Dark Magic"" and a Continuous Trap by the name ""Magicians' Combination"".  Because ""Magicians' Souls"" is currently so expensive, I tried to make most of the deck without it, taking into consideration that the card's main reason is to quickly access Dark Magician. I made use of a 3rd Apprentice Illusion Magician and Dark Magic Veil, and the deck ran pretty smoothly.  The reason I decided to make this deck is because, I didn't like the whole idea of building a deck that is going to take all my wallet money to play, and still having no chance against the meta.  This is a video of the deck in action uploaded on my Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqakhuFzAec&amp;t=191s"

Its by far the main and best part of almost any Blackwing deck, but of course, you can only have 3. Maybe something like Black Whirlwind but when you normal summon it brings a monster with less attack from grave to hand? I don't know, just a thought. It could be called Black Ominous Wind or something.  &nbsp;  Anyways, first up hopefully you drew into Black Whirlwind, if not, you can use this strategy if you have Simoon in your hand.  Activate his effect to banish a Blackwing, then activate the Black Whirlwind from deck and get the Normal Summon from Simoon, Use Whirlwind to bring Breeze (or Gale if you'd like) and Special Summon them, then, Link Summon Barricade Borg and discard a card for his effect.  Now when the Whirlwind gets sent to grave due to Simoon, you can add it to hand from grave due to Barricade.  &nbsp;  There are a lot of easy small combos such as:  Normal Summon Blizzard to Special one of the many lvl 4 monsters you could have in grave, allowing you to Synchro for Nothung or Armed Wing  Normal Blizzard, Special Kris and Bora for an instant Full Armor Master  Whirlwind can let you even Normal Breeze or Gale and bring Gladius to hand, which you can Special (if all you have is one Blackwing) to create a lvl 6 Synchro.  Shura attacking and killing something allows for a Blackwing with 1500 or less attack to be Specialed from deck (Preferably with Glowing Crossbow)  If you can bring Nothung out, and you have Auster in hand, you can Normal it (Cause of Nothung) then Synchro for Full Armor, IF YOU DO, then you can Banish Auster to put a Black Wedge counter on all monsters your opponent controls for Full Armor.  You can of course do the Utopia Combo with any combination of the many lvl 4 monsters.  &nbsp;  Good luck and enjoy"

It should come as no surprise then that Timelords are one of my most favorite decks, with their strategy being summon no more than 1, max 2, monsters onto the field and keep reducing your opponents life points in the slowest way possible, or get rid of their on board that they took 20 minutes to build.  The deck is designed to go second, the deck has almost no first turn plays as most of your monsters gain effects whilst they're attacking, or after battle. Hence why 3 copies of Mystic Mine, a perfectly balanced and skillful card (sarcasm)  has amazing synergy with the deck, as stated above you will rarely have more than 1 monster on the field, so why not go the extra mile and insure your opponents hate you with a burning passion?  Strategy is very simple, first priority is to get Michion on field, halve your opponent's life points and stall until it's time on the round. Depending on your opponent's board you might want to prioritize getting rid of their back row or monsters which is where Zaphion and Metaion come in. The draw cards are self explanatory, Advance Draw is a fantastic card to get rid of a Timelord before the end phase so that mystic mine can be kept in play, the same goes for Celestial Transformation as it will destroy the said monster during the end phase. The traps help with consistency and add even more draw power, and activating Infinite Light is pretty much a game ender as your opponent will have a real hard time getting rid of your monsters. Unless they drop down a kaiju or something but hey, deck has to have a weakness.  Side deck is filled with stuff to help you get rid of really problematic cards, Extravagance is there as card to experiment with as the extra deck is of almost no importance, however it does prevent you from drawing more cards which could conflict with using an Advance Draw, feel free to make any adjustments to it, I suggest teching in an Artifact Scythe and Sanctuary for some turn 1 options.  As much as I'm hyping these guys up they don't win as often as you'd like, any form of effect negation or spinning or non-destruction removal will shut these things down harder than a beaten up toaster, however if you like your duels to be nice and slow you'll have a lot of fun with the deck on a somewhat casual level. Hell, you might even take some opponents by surprise and get a few wins on tournaments, who knows."

You wouldn't be looking up a Crusadia deck if that wasn't the case. This build focuses on going first and ending on a board with near infinite negates by utilizing the Guardragon engine. The ideal board you want to end on is Spheres, Savage and Gameciel, plus any other negation you can, be it a Dawn Dragster or a set called by the grave. The combo is as follows;  Normal any Crusadia, link into Magius, special Crusadia from anywhere, Magius search Draco (or any other Crusadia monster if you already have a Draco in hand), Link off for Spatha, special Draco, Draco effect to get a Crusadia from grave to hand, Link off for Elpy, Spatha effect, move Elpy 1 zone to the right, special Red-Eyes, Red-Eyes special Draco from grave, make Saryuja, draw 4, put 3 back and depending on your draws find a way of ending on Savage plus another negation and Spheres.  Most people are unawere that Gameciel has an effect that isn't the special summon, you see whenever a card is sent to the grave Kyoutou Waterfront gets a Kaiju Counter on it, remove 3 and you can add Gameciel to hand, simply summon him using Saryuja's effect and bam, you have near infinite negates as Gameciel removes 2 from anywhere on the field to negate a card. Combine that with making a Savage and attaching a Saryuja from grave to him for 4 Negates and when you opponents turn is up you can use spheres to summon Goliath to the field, meaning no extra deck summoning until they get rid of it somehow.  The combo has a bunch of choke points and if you get Nibiru'd or Drolled you're basically screwed. To ensure that the Droll or Ash doesn't go through we're main decking 3 called by and 3 Crusadia Power and  3 Dark Ruler in the event we're forced to go second in game 1, it doesn't matter that we can't do any damage, if we can set up that board and then proceed to clean out the opponent's field we can win without doing any damage as recovering from that will be near impossible. Even then Nibiru is still a nightmare to deal with so just try your best not to get hit with it and you should be fine.  Side deck consists of other going 2nd cards which can help you OTK if you don't want to rely on hard drawing Dark Ruler each and every game, many of those cards and easily;y bait out negates too so there shouldn't be many times where you can't make a big boy Equimax and attack for game, unless you brick or something. You can replace There can be or Evenly with a Nibiru of your own, or any hand trap that you feel would work much better in the side deck, as always these decks aren't 100% optimized, more of a skeleton to go by.  The deck does pretty well against meta decks, mainly thanks to outside engines, and you can build it real cheap, most expensive card here is Savage which is like £25 I think, and can get a good number of those fat juicy W's that make this game worth playing. Overall, I give Paper Mario 2 a 4/5, just a solid RPG."

They have a game plan, or an idea for one anyway but no real way of applying their effects quickly enough. Cubic counters are actually pretty powerful but the only way to distribute them is for your opponent to attack Vijam however most of the time he'll be taken care of with other removal effects rather than straight up battle which makes that strategy really inconsistent. On the other hand Nova is an extremely powerful boss monster who has a really good summoning condition but Cubics as a deck don't have enough search power to open 3 cubic with different names AND a Nova on a constant basis.  The new support greatly helps the archetype simply by existing because more cards with Cubic in the names means a higher chance to put Nova on the field. Dharma has a really nice effect where it lets you pitch a cubic to draw a card, as well as letting you add one of your monster back upon being destroyed, and it's battle protection can help you ram Vijam into the opponent's monster to spread cubic counters. Ascension and Causality would be perfect as spells but in trap form they're way too slow, also You rarely control more than 1, sometimes 2, Cubic monsters so the counter spreading effect is underwhelming to say the least, you can always send it to grave then normal Vijam, hit your opponent's monster with it then have Nova burn your opponent even harder but that combo requires way too much setup for what it's worth.  Your first priority should be to play a different deck. Second you want to focus on having 3 cubic cards with different names and a Nova in the hand, easier said than done believe you me. Worry not though, if you have around 300 Great British pounds burning a hole in your pocket you could spend that hard earned cash on a playset of Pot of Extravagance, why you'd play them in Cubics of all decks is beyond me however. Jokes aside Extravagance is the best draw card in the game at the moment and you will absolutely need it if you want the deck to perform somewhat OK. We're also playing 3 allure and 2 Dharma because a draw of some kind is absolutely necessary, Summoner Monk is also here due to being able to pitch a Karma or any other spell which in turn would special a Duza on the field, he would pitch a karma and we can then get an upwards of 2 searches, mind you the effects of both these monsters can be negated which is why we're playing Called by in main, only 2 though because I wanted to keep it 40 cards. Twin twisters destroys back row as well as helping with graveyard setup, and the Nibiru and Kaiju cards help with OTK'ing as efficiently as possible.  The deck is meant to go second, if you try to go first the cards will jam, start producing smoke, shit themselves, break down and die. It's an OTK deck that has trouble getting it's main damage dealer on the field, what do you expect? You might be able to end on an Abyss Dweller an nothing else, which is why the side deck is almost filled with going first cards.  Don't get me wrong, I love the simple big number play style and overall Hindu theme of the deck but as I hope i outlined above it has a lot of issues it needs fixing, mainly a better searcher and a more efficient counter spreader, something akin to the Alien Link monster. It's pretty nice that the deck is excelling in Trinity Format somewhat and I hope that Konami eventually cubes up and releases more support that will make the deck much more playable in the traditional format. I just hope Vishnu, the Cubic creator answers my Cubic Prayers sometime soon"

Do you want to win games with as little interaction with your opponents as possible? Do you want an easy win game button? Do hate yourself? If you answered yes to any of the questions above, go see a doctor. Then come back to this guide and start playing Mystic Mine Burn, a perfectly fair and well balanced card that was begging to have a whole deck made around it to piss people off to new heights previously thought to be impossible.  Oh, your opponent has a board with 8 negations on board? OK, cool you just drop that Dark Ruler/Lava Golem on them and proceed with setting up your own board. Blinding second is the name of the game here, you let your opponent do everything they want and all you gotta do is make sure Mine stays on field until Cauldron of the Old man can finish them off. You're essentially playing 11 copies of Mine as 8 of those cards help you search it, so getting it onto the field is easy as piss. Your win condition is Cauldron, a card that gets a counter for each Standby Phase it stays on your field and burns the opponent for 300 LP for each counter OR you could use it to heal yourself instead (although be aware that the latter strategy works best in competitive games when you're under a time limit).  Silent Wobby is in the main deck for 2 reasons, in case your opponent makes you go firs or if he tries to be a smart ass about it and summon no monsters on his first turn you just activate Mine, give him the Wobby and back to business as usual, have fun with a useless fish that's clogging up your board. Prohibition can be used turn 1 to make sure that no spell removal is played, great targets include Lightning Storm, Twin Twisters and most importantly Cosmic Cyclone as Field Barrier can't protect your Mine from being banished. Field Barrier also prevents Mine from being destroyed by it's own effect, and locks your opponent out of using a field spell of their own. and Skuld insures that your opponent will never reach his spell removal. Chain Energy is a piece of light spice that will burn your opponent even further for just trying to out mine but can be replaced with anything else you might fancy.  Extra deck exists mainly as Extravagance dump, though if you find yourself with tokens on your field you an always go into Linkuriboh or Link spider to link into Barricadeborg to try and minimize the risk of having the same or more monsters than your opponent, and if Mine does die you can discard a card in hopes of getting it back. Fusionist and Emperor can be replaced with literally anything, i just put them in because they're funny. Finally the side deck consists of some negates and removal which can boost your chances of safely putting Mine on the field, as always tailor it to your own preferences, these are just some helpful recommendations.  Final thoughts... well it's slow and degenerate, 2 of my favorite things which actually provides me with a lot of fun whenever I'm playing the deck. I enjoy having to think as little as possible when playing Yugioh now and again whilst getting some tainted victories along the way, so Mystic Mine burn was right up my alley. Now i just hope Konami doesn't ban it, because that really would make me go ""Awwww maaaan..."""

Prank-Kids is a really adorable archetype that focuses on link and fusion summoning and then using their graveyard effects to spam the board with even more kids and then proceeding to play on your opponent's turn, much like kids in real life, it's really annoying for everyone else involved.  All Kids monsters have an effect that lets you special summon another one with a different name if they're used as lionk or fusion material for extra deck Prank-Kids monsters, building a board can be an extremely easy task... if you happen to open well. As good as this archetype is it can brick harder than a Polish construction worker, leaving you to scoop and run off to cry in a corner. Prank kids have no 1 card combos, you need to open with at least 1 and either an Instant Fusion or Pranks, ideally you open 2 monsters and 1 Poly but that doesn't happen as often as you'd like. As long as you have 2 Kids on the field you can pop off pretty hard, Place searches you an additional monster as well as increases your monsters' attack and decreases the opponents', Pranks can help you link climb with only 1 monster as well as recycle materials at end step, Plan saves you from being OTK'd and can Link summon a monster on your opponents' turn and Pandemonium is a searchable quick play fusion although you most often want to activate that during the opponent's turn as it locks you into Prank Kid monsters if used on your turn.  The kids all have individual effects which are all quite good too, Fansies pitches a card from the deck to grave, in most cases you'll want to send Plan, Dropsies heals you for 500, Lampsies burns the opponent for 500 and Rocksies requires you to banish a card and you then get to draw another one. Rocksies' effect is easily the worst as more often than not you'll have to banish a combo piece and have a chance of either drawing something better or some absolute garbage.  The most basic of Turn 1 combos is making a Dodo, activating the effects of Kids in grave and making sure your Dodo's effect is chain link 1 so that it can't be Ashed and finally ending on a Bark and Washer with a Pandemonium set for next turn, where you can proceed to make even more plays, such as making Butler and blowing up your opponent's monsters. To help witch consistency we're playing 2 Fusion recycling plants that can further help us in getting a Poly in hand, as well as as 2 Instant Fusions and a Reasoning to help us get some bodies on board, finally 2 draw spells of Upstart and Void, the latter is a pretty safe card to sue as you'll rarely end with cards in hand. A good argument could be made for playing Desires, and while it is much better than the draw cards we're playing now, in practice it banishes important combo pieces much more often than you'd think, though feel free to replace those spells with Desires' if you personally think it works better.  The deck's most dreaded counter is Big Boy Nibiru which can stop us dead in our tracks, which is why we're playing 3 Koa'Ki Meru Guardians which can negate a monster effect once per turn, Prank Kids can afford to play without using their normal summon, which makes guardian a very good tech in the deck, after all , the best way to counter a rock is with an even bigger rock. Ash and Droll can also hurt us quite a bit, which is why we're playing Called by in main.  Finally, the extra deck is the real powerhouse, prepare to burn through almost all your copies of Prank Kids monsters that you can recycle with effects of Dodo, Bark and Pranks, so it never really runs out of steam. For extra power we're playing the OTK machine known as Borrelsword, a Borreload for some monster snatching, a Dweller and Toad for more versatility plus more disruption and a single Apollousa that we almost never go into so feel free to replace it with something else if you're playing on a budget.  Finally in the side deck we're playing some strong going second cards in the likely event we win game 1. Thanks to Master Rules coming into effect fairly soon Prank-Kids will receive a much needed boost, as well as an ability to spit a Toad out before the 5th summon, so Nibiru will be even easier to dodge as well as not needing to think of link marker position in regards to fusion summoning will help with ending on a Washer and Toad or Abyss much easier.  Prank-Kids can be an extremely fun and rewarding as well as a competitive deck in the right hands, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're willing to sacrifice hours of your life memorizing combos, or thinking up completely new ones in the middle of a duel, just like in real life it takes a lot of patience and dedication in order to guide a Kid to maximize their true potential."

Here ya go!,"Try to get at least 1 Ojama blue on your side on the field and you are ready to go. (By using Ojamatch or Rescue cat or just normal summon)  Attack one of your opponent's monsters and use its destruction eff to search Ojamatch and magic(as long as there are enough of your 3 Ojamas in your Deck) to your hand then you activate Match to add blue and normal summon it to attack again but this time you can add 1 Ojamissilation.  Repeat this step but then with adding red to hand so that you can normal summon red to summon all of your ojamas in your hand ;)  (magics eff triggers and you get Ojama black, green and yellow. These are necessary if you try to activate Ojamissilation.)  Link them away to a link monster of your choice (I personally would choose Apoullousa, Saryjuya (highly recommended), Borrelsword or Abomination )  then activate Ojamissilation to summon A, B, and C by banishing 3 Ojamas from the grave (don't forget to use Ojamissilations eff to draw 1 afterward)  link them away for cross sheep and another link 2 and then summon ABC buster.(Crosshep can special one rank 4 or lower )  and if you are lucky and can summon swamp boi you can summon A to Z.  I hope you guys like it and maybe help improving it.  Long live the Ojama!!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Considered tapping into the power of these purple phenomena? ,"One of, by far, the oldest broken cards to be printed - goes by the name of Cyber-Stein. Not only was it banned for a consecutive <em>sixteen </em>formats; it is one of the most overpowered (not to mention rare) cards in the game. However, with great power comes a whole lot of lifepoints. By paying over 5000 lifepoints: you are granted the summon of any fusion monster in the game. But with I told you there is a way to play the card without paying the price? Come with me - and I'll show you the magic of 2 minute turns!!  So how do you pull this off? Well its actually rather simple. Reprodocus is a link 2 that can change the typing of any card. Boom! Easy as that. All you need to do make Reprodocus, somehow summon Cyber-Stein under a zone the card points to and change it to psychic. <em>Well</em>.....you also need to equip it with a specific spell that can only be searched off of a certain card which can be summoned using a specific monster that you can make usi...okay. Maybe it isn't as simple as it sounds but let me elaborate. To start the combo: you can make Isolde. This is easily achievable using monsters like Junk Forward, The Neo-Spacian package, or your HERO monsters. Once you've made her - you can start to put together the pieces of your combo. By pitching Telekinetic Charging Cell - you are allowed to summon Renaud. Thanks to his effect: you add BACK the equip spell card and kablamo! That's one part done.  Step 2: make Saryuja. This is by far the hardest step, but you have to remember that you don't always need four monsters. Let me go into more detail: we mainly use Saryuja as a means of summoning rescue ferret. While the draw 4 is nice- you only necessarily want the summon ability. Here's the other roadblock I mentioned: Rescue Ferret. Since you are summoning from hand, the combo relies on you already having the adorable emancipator. But what if you don't manage to open him? Well, no need to worry, 90% of your spells are there to reset your hand. One one side you have cards like Reload and Magical Mallet that completely warp your hand to how you want it. And on the other you have generic draw power like the bamboo engine. I can see you shaking your hand thinking '47 card upstart, he's living life on the edge!'. While I am indeed a daring ladies man - the reason you play it is in order to have that lifepoint difference. If your opponent has higher lifepoints than you - you can activate Emerging Emergency Rescute Rescue..try saying that five times.  Okay - so you've got the ferret, but what now? Well you use its effect in order to summon from the deck: 'Steam the Cloak', 'Junk Anchor' and 'Dotscaper'. From there; you can synchro summon Herald of the Arc Light and get a free token off of Steam, as well as Dotscaper returning to the field thanks to its effect. Now that you have enough monsters - Junk Anchor replaces Road Synchron and Cha-Ching! Road Warrior is on the field. Using his effect you can summon Cyber-Stein, link Saryuja and Warrior into Reprodocus - change Stein's typing to psychic and <em>mic-dropped</em> you have the god board......What's that? Nibiru? Uh...game 2?  So that's the combo. You can use Millennium-Eyes and the two Ojamas + Repro to make Apollousa. Then summon two Cyber Twin Dragons to make Dingirsu - summon Exterio, Dragun and finally Last Warrior. Congratulations your opponent cannot activate spells, traps, or monster effects and cannot summon at all. Of course you can just make the two Ojama monsters and Exterio to get the same outcome but that's not as fun.  Overall: this deck is a spicy 8.2/10. With the ability to summon any fusion monster in the game you really can mess around with this. The downside is obviously the fact this is a turbo deck: so if, by any chance, you brick - well its best to just scoop. Stein is a fun card &amp; and Renaud adding the equip spell from grave makes this ever so easier to accomplish. I'd definitely give this deck a try - seeing as though it completely stops your opponent from playing. What an engaging deck am I right?"

This deck is focusing on the Goyos to beat your opponent down or have a legit 1st turn board thanks to Goyo Emperor which fits both category. We're using Deep Sea and Atlantean engine as it can snipe handtrap while peeking at opponent's hand going first, giving us great advantage while proceeding with one card combo. Another good one card starter is Righty+Lefty Driver as we need those to make Goyo Defender which is our heart and soul of this deck. I will explain the Goyo combo going 1st or going 2nd to OTK.  Going first, we need our starter like Diva or Righty, Diva is searchable through Deep Sea Minstrel+Atlantean Dragoons and we can snipe handtrap in the process. Normal summon Diva/Righty, use their eff ss Neptabyss/Lefty (dont use Lefty eff), if we go for Neptabyss route we can send Dragoons, add Dragoons, and add Minstrel to snipe. Then we ss Goyo Defender (using Righty+Lefty or Diva+Neptabyss), use Defender ss another one, repeat, and link off two of them for Isolde, use Isolde add God Phoenix Gearfried, use Isolde send Living Fossil ss Renaud, use Renaud add Living Fossil, use Living Fossil ss tuner from GY, link off Renaud+tuner for Halqifibrax, use Halqifibrax ss tuner from deck (count the level so we can make Martial Metal Marcher later with Linkross token(s)), link off Isolde for Linkross, use Linkross ss token(s), tune the tuner+token(s) for Martial, use Martial ss tuner from GY, link off Martial+tuner for Masquerena, link off Halqifibrax+Linkross for Verte Anaconda, use Verte send Miracle Synchro Fusion for Goyo Emperor using material from GY. Next main phase we can link off Masquerena+Verte for any generic link 4.  Going second, we need to ss lv2 tuner (like Diva) from Halqifibrax and 2 tokens from Linkross, then tune Diva+token for Martial, use Martial ss Diva, tune Diva+token for Mist Bird Clausolas, use Clausolas to negate effect and change 1 opponent's monster atk to 0, from there you can go for Goyo Predator, Emperor, or any link play you want.  <img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/c/c2/SectorSecurity-DULI.png/257px-SectorSecurity-DULI.png"" alt=""image"" />  Expected first turn:  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/PSGJCww.png"" alt=""image"" />  (can even extend for Mermail Abyssmegalo + its equip too)  Pros: Consistent and strong going first or second, bunch of handtrap and can snipe one of your opponent's, have follow up play thank to God Phoenix Gearfried or link/synchro play.  Cons: First turn board is not strong enough, Goyo Emperor returns the monster stolen if it leaves the field, possible bricking because running bunch of handtraps (not too bad)."

I always liked the theme behind Cyber Dragons as much as the Character who owned them, Zane Truesdale.  For many years the deck was ALL-OUT BEATDOWN with cards like Power Bond, Overload Fusion, and with monsters like Cyber Twin Dragon and Chimeratech Overdragon.  Later on, with the release of Cyber Dragon Revolution, it became more XYZ focused but still with the power to perform a great deal of damage. Cyber Dragon Nova helped a lot with this.  Now in the modern days, Cyber Dragon Infinity is a thing, and with so many Machine Duplication targets (Core,Nachster,Herz), the deck has became more combo-oriented, and Power Bond sees less and less play over time.  For this deck I tried to bring back the whole Power Bond theme but keep Cyber Dragons Combo-Oriented still.  The the deck is really consistent with the waves of support it got over the years, and can play through disruptions like Ash, Droll &amp; Lock or Veiler easily (most of the times)  This is my Deck List.  Note 1: Cyberload Fusion is one of the greatest finishers the deck has since it can bring out Cyber Twin Dragon after the attacks of all monsters, and attack twice for least damage through direct attack 5600 and if Sieger is on the field it intensifies.  Note 2: I found Cybernetic Overflow to be one exeptionally good card in terms of removal and searching since it can give you an edge in card advantage. (Notable Example: Opponent with 4 monsters goes into Phoenix and targets Cybernetic Overflow, Activated it --&gt; Broke his board --&gt; Got a free Search  Opponent is -3 while you maintain advantage). That's The Reason I ran 2.  If you want to see the deck in action, you can watch my newly uploaded video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6GgA-6oubs&amp;t=7s"

I'm posting this mix deck of zombie/danger as my first deck i've ever played. I love zombie, but my knowledge about zombie is still limited and i need some help improving my deck and skills.  Well, this deck has many strategies to play with but i think this is the most effective one. This is a two cards combo of Uni-Zombie and Necroworld Banshee. Firstly, u gonna summon Uni and discard Necroworld to get the Zombie World (but u can do this by using the Danger!s). Then, you send Glow-up to the GY by Uni's effect and Glow-Up gonna trigger its effect and ss Doomking. After that u can link out I:P or Vampire Sucker. Finally, in the next stanby phase Doomking will come back and we'll have 1 negate and 1 ban.  To be clear, this is just the basic combo that u can play. So do you best to improve it!

From the first time i played orcust, i've fell in love with it. Orcust deck is all about summoning Dingirsu in opponents turn and send their field to the GY, very simple. Thats why this is a going first deck.  The basic combo is: firstly, u summon Armageddon knight/Dark grepher/scap recycler or mekk-knight girsu and send knightmare to the GY; ban knightmare, send world wand to the GY and  ban world wand to summon back knightmare; link out galatea and set Babel; eventually, u get dingirsu easily. And u can use danger or other ways to summon another mons and link out I:P. In the next turn, u can ban knightmare, send skeleton to the GY and bring dingirsu back to send 1 card to the GY.  The full combo require: Scrap recycler, a Danger mons. Firstly, u summon recycler, send knightmare to GY; link out wyvern. ss recycler and destroy recycler; then, wyvern gonna trigger its effect to ss golem from the deck and destroy wyvern; use golem to ss recycler and send skeleton to GY. After that, do the same as combo 1 but before u ss dingirsu, ban skeleton and ss knightmare; then when u ss dingirsu it will attach ske as material. Finally, u link out I:P, still have 1 more mons on the field and your GY will have both ske and dingirsu.  If u successfully block your opponent deck, u can link out cards like zeroboros,borreload or borrelsword to end the game  So...as you can see, Orcust is a good deck with many cards to block your opponents field  Thank you for reading my work  &nbsp;"

When you have at least 4 Lightsworns in the graveyard you can bring out one of the boss monsters called <a data-name=""Judgment Dragon"">Judgment Dragon</a>. I put in <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> in case the opponent has set the field for them to just annihilate everything plus as an added bonus if you have any shaddolls on the field they were just sent to the graveyard by a card effect so their effects still work. <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> is in case you can't get out the nukes and if your opponent has a card in their spell/trap zones that is getting bothersome. I put in <a data-name=""Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend"">Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</a> for the same reasons as Judgment Dragon and Black Rose Dragon, BUT I prefer using this card because for each special summoned monster destroyed inflict 500 damage to your opponent plus this card still gets to attack and there are no drawbacks. <a data-name=""Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn"">Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn</a> is in this deck because; 1. He is a Lightsworn so why not put him in this deck. 2. Just by paying 1000 life points you can banish a card on the field, so use this ability to remove a card on the opponent's field that has been bothering you. <a data-name=""Decode talker"">Decode Talker</a> is in this deck because each time I use this deck I realize that this deck makes bringing out monster onto the field way to easy so he is in to make space on the field. I have <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a> in this deck mainly because she is a must-have for any shaddoll deck and a great card that can destroy any special summoned monster. <a data-name=""Shaddoll Construct"">Shaddoll Construct</a> is in this deck because I realized people don't even use her even though she just came out and because she can just keep on reviving herself as long as you have any shaddoll cards to spare. <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a> is in this deck because she just can't die from a fight and can negate a card effect when Special Summoned plus gives me a shaddoll card to discard when she is destroyed. <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a>, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Wendigo"">El Shaddoll Wendigo</a>, and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> are really just fillers. The Combos I use Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend/Black Rose Dragon/Judgment Dragon + Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn + El Shaddoll Construct/El Shaddoll Apkallone, this combo helps remove the field of anything unwanted or can build up a serious burn on your opponent and to set up your own field. Another Combo I use is Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend + Any Shaddoll Fusion monster +<a data-name=""Resh Shaddoll Incarnation""> Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</a> I put in my Side Deck @Ignister card for those annoying cyberse decks like ""Salmanagreat"" and <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier Envoy of the Beginning"">Black Luster Soldier Envoy of the Beginning </a>is in there for continuous attack. <a data-name=""Red Blossoms from Underroot"">Red Blossoms from Underroot</a> is in there to bring out lost allies. I maybe posting a version 2 of this deck to show the cards I am going to add."

With this deck, use the power of the 3 Egyptian God cards to there fullest. This deck is a combination of all my favorite original cards. Use clever traps like Gravekeeper's servant to stop your opponent from attacking, then, activate the abilities of mystic tomato or sangan to build up your dark card army, summoning enough cards to summon an Egyptian god! If you can't seem to get enough cards to summon a god, you can use Different Dimension capsule, or Gold Sarcophagus to get the cards you need, or use possessed dark soul's effect to steal your opponents monsters and use them to summon a god yourself! Meanwhile, you can use cards like Poison of the Old Man, Spirit of the Breeze, or Skull-mark Ladybug to gain more LP, either feeding that into Ra's attack power, or using it to outlast your opponent!"

Provided you have the Golden Lord out on the field, the Eldlixer quick-play spell and trap become quick-effect reborns for your Mayakashi synchros to provide additional disruption and recover from positions of disadvantage remarkably easy. Eldlixer of Black Awakening can also serve as an additional method of getting out Hajun, allowing you to access your synchro ladder turn 3 relatively easily if you failed to do so on turn 1. Dakki/Yuki-Musume provide recurring tribute fodder for the Everglorious Golden Land, and the deck is capable of easily getting out the Mayakashi synchros using either Hajun or Dakki + the Golden Land trap-monsters (who are level 5, excluding Guardian). Mayakashi Winter also serves as both a nice consistency booster with its draw effect and as good fodder for the Golden Lord's revival effect. Eldlich and Mayakashi complement each other extremely well, as Eldlich allows you to easily control the state of the game while the Mayakashi synchros enable you to output massive damage when presented with openings, compared to pure Eldlich's normally mediocre damage output.  &nbsp;  For the side deck, most choices are cards that aid in going second as this deck is overall weak to disruption early on and struggles to start up against established boards. I have additionally included a package of Generaider cards as they are a solid addition to the deck if you choose to play them (though they are main deck material). If you do decide to run the Generaider ""engine"", the ratios of Golden Land and Eldlixer cards should be adjusted slightly to provide room (cut Conquistador down to 2, Guardian down to 1, and Eldlixer of White Fate down to 2/1, by preference. Other cards to consider cutting for room are Ash Blossom, Dakki to 1, Yuki-Musume to 2/1, or Mayakashi Winter to 1). While Hela does provide good additional quick-effect revival, she is by no means essential to the deck and can often be somewhat clunky and unnecessary as the Eldlixer cards generally have the same utility while being far more consistent, thus I would suggest that you try out the Generaider cards and see if you like them before fully committing to the idea."

Let me introduce you Pot of Avarice. ,"Engage might be gone, but the engine is all there, and it allows you to go +1 every turn.  The main strategy is starting your Sky Striker plays going second, do the Hayate-Kagari play and end with Shizuku adding 2 cards on the process.  You need 3 Roze to draw them consistently. Hayate can send Raye to the GY and don't forget to use Roze's effect.  Ghost Belle and Called by the Grave are musts against hand traps because if your cards does not resolve you cannot control the board. (Keep in mind that Belle can negate Called so that your Raye will resolve)  This is basically the same thing we've been done during the last format, but now Pot of Avarice is unlimited, and in this deck you can basically call it Pot of Greed. Now you don't need to worry about using all of your Link monsters because your're going to take them back anyways. there's no need to run Hercules Base, whose equip effect was almost never used.  Foolish Burial goods is still alive and it helps you getting your widow anchor if forced to go first. Three copies of Area Zero will help you change brick spells for your engine cards and the field's second effect is more accessible with Zeke.  Please, don't run multiple copies random Striker cards like Jamming, Eagle, Vector, Scissors. I'm using 2 Cannon and 2 Afterburners because they are really useful, but there are no excuses for running Scissor or a Second Jamming Waves, keep in mind that if your Engine is disrupted you need defense and draw power, not a third Eagle Booster.  Sky Striker Ace - Zeke is the new Link monster, and that card's effects may not impress that much but it does so much for this deck. Now you can take you opponents monsters (shark and anchor) without fearing a field miss and link them off for another Sky Striker Ace monster ending the turn with your spells on full power. The Banish effect is really convenient because it helps you clearing the board, but also versatile once you can banish himself to always have a play or banish the monster you took with Shark Cannon, so that it can attack when it comes back. Not to mention that Zeke has a down arrow which helps you making Ningirsu.  The hand traps are really important because they can fulfill your graveyard with targets for Avarice and simplify the game state. Also you can normal summon them to link scale when needed.  Pankratops is a good body that can help you outing Imperial Order, link scaling and doing that extra damage Sky Strikers Need from time to time.  Of course this deck is not good going first, but it's one card engine allows you to side whatever cards you think will perform well on the format like TCBOO, but in this case i'm running Dimensional Barrier. Against Combo decks i'm running Sphere Mode and Dark Ruler no More, but if you don't want to give away your normal summon just use Nibiru instead.  On the overall Sky Striker might not be the most explosive deck available but you have a ton of in-theme disruptions and a lot of space for extra negates which makes it playable.  The deck could be even more powerful with Mystic Mine, but i don' like that card and i think you have to play the deck in a complete different way otherwise you will just be surprised when your opponent outs it and OTKs you :)  &nbsp;"

Now, u can deal with the rest card in your hand and GY to ss more mons to blk your opponent field. By the way, instead of summoning curious, u can also ss dante and send the top 3 cards of your deck to GY. After u successfully blk your opponent field, u can OTK them by cards like borrelsword, mekk-knight crus avramx,...  Basically, to play this deck, u have to know all cards in your deck and improvise.  Thank you for reading (and F**K COVID 19)  &nbsp;"

Handtraps like imperm, d.d. crow and ash provide more interruptions and prevent your opponent from getting to their ideal end board. 2 card OTK, pretty much any 2 level 4's =final sigma with 6k attack, ideally you will give your opponent a kaiju with slumber or if they leave a monster with 2k attack or less, final sigma can 1 shot kill your opponent since he does double battle damage. You can either boost your final sigma's attack with addition or weaken your opponent's kaiju/monster with subtraction to kill them with 1 attack."

Going 2nd is the best thing if you want to make a disaster, but if you go 1st you could block your opponent summoning both Rafale and Wiz, so you will have 2 negation. You could play cards as There Can Be Only One or some Solemn cards to block opponent's combos.  The main combo is:  Normal summon Beat, Special Summon another Fur Hire Monster with Beat's effect and search for Rafale (or another Fur Hire if you already have Rafale in your hand), Special summon Another Fur Hire Monster and special summon Rafale as the 4th monster triggering his effect and adding a card to your hand choosing between 3 cards (better a Fur Hire monster or Eschatos). Special summon Folgo using the three Fur Hire monsters on the field (do not use Rafale) and triggering his effect special summoning Wiz. Trigger wiz's effect and gain 1000LP. So, special summon Eschatos by banishing the 3 monster you used to link summon Folgo, active his effect to cleaning the oppenent's side of the field and triggering Folgo's effect to draw 3 cards! So you can attack with Folgo (2400), Rafale (2800) and Eschatos (3000) and win the mach!  If you go 1st you can stop at the summoning of Wiz, so you will have 1 monster's effect negation and 1 spell/trap's negation. If you set cards like Called By The Grave or Solemn Warning/Strike or There Can Be Only One to block other opponent's combos, you are quite sure to start your second turn without problems.  &nbsp;  Other little tips:  If you want you can start with Reasoning. Your monsters are all of different levels and guessing the correct level will be very hard to your opponent. You can use Reasoning to restart the effects chain after a nagation too.  If your opponent negates one of your Fur Hire monster's effect, you can use Monster Gate to ""switch"" the Fur Hire monster on the field with another one and restart with the effects chain.  If you haven't enough monster to link summon Folgo, you can use One-Time Passcode to summon a cyberce-type Token and have a free material to summoning Folgo.  For the same problem, you can siding One For One and use it to sending a monster to the GY and special summon Filo from the deck, then special summon another monster from your hand and trigger Filo's effect to special summoning the monster you sent to the GY with the effect of One For One, thus having 3 monster for link summoning Folgo.  I suggest you summon Rafale under Folgo, so you can link summon Underclock Tacker on his right and active his effect to make one of your opponent's monster lose 2800 ATK and make easier to you to destroy that monster by battle.  the extra deck isn't very important: Borreload and Topologic Bomber are only supports 'cause you won't need them too much."

Once the Mine is activated, the next step will be to leave the support cards such as Dark Bribe (denier), Field Barrier (obviously, field protector), Threatening Roar (insurance in case the mine is destroyed) and Demise of the Land or Metaverse (so that if the mine is destroyed we can bring another one immediately). Obviously we cannot play all of them, we will have to be smart to know which ones should be left on the field; the optimum is 2 although as long as we have no more than 3 it will be fine although we can have complications with cards that need to stay on the field like Shard of Greed. To help us find the cards we need, we have a good variety of draw cards (be careful, you should not underestimate the draw power of the deck, I have mistakenly burned it all for activating cards without seeing how many cards were left in the deck).  Last and most importantly, the win conditions. Of course we have Exodia, the king of the Deck who with so many draw cards and our safeguard strategy will not be very difficult to get, and we have Final Countdown too that gives us an extra win condition (I do not recommend activating it without at least 25 cards remaining especially if they are in a tournament and there is little time left since we could lose for LP).  The Extra Deck can be anything since we will only use it to activate Pot of Extravagance although we can make a good security strategy with Linkuriboh, Almiraj and Gardna although we will have activated Final Countdown or have done side deck Dark Factory (or both) or practically we can give up (in any case I don't recommend summoning monsters since that could give our opponent the opportunity to purposely keep a single monster to destroy the Mine by its own effect in case we don't have Field Barrier, it's difficult but it is not about giving opportunities to our opponent).  Finally, the Side Deck does not need much explanation; Dark Factory in case our opponent has what to send the exodia pieces to the cemetery with, foolish burial is by itself only one piece was sent to the cemetery we can send another to activate the effect of Dark Factory, Cosmic Cyclone can help us to activate Hope for Escape and the rest of the cards you just have to be wise to know what to change, it is what will help us win.  NOTE: I know that Pot of Extravagance is very expensive so if you don't have it and you can't afford it I suggest Jar of Greed to replace it. Of course it is not the same but the strategy of activating 3 Reckless Greed at the same time will not be difficult and sending 10 cards from the deck to the cemetery with Pot of Desires is not a very good idea playing Exodia so I consider it the best option (I accept suggestions).

Kuriborhn's Gy effect also provides more Xyz and link material to help go into some of the other bigger creatures that you can utilize in the extra deck,"

ABC and Dangers have such amazing synergy it's shocking that it's been overlooked in favour of the Infinity build with the upcoming Union support. Given that almost every player anticipates the Infinity build being the main ABC build for the new format, this version often ends up being a deadly surprise.  What surprised me most when testing this build was how flexible the extra deck is. The Dangers, Destrudo and Gizmek allow the opportunity to use so many cards for going both first and second that at times I've struggled to find a permanent setup. Once the meta defines itself, the extra can be tailored to be a lot more specific.  The side deck is pretty general right now. Can easily be tailored to the format, but i'm pretty happy with it as an initial start.  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li>Feel free to like, comment e.t.c. I can also go through some hands and combos this deck has and what boards they generate too.</li> </ol>"

Tried to make a more competitive MW deck and this was the result. Still a prototype.,"This deck revolves mostly around getting out the big boss, Emperion Magnum the Superconductive Battlebot. Tons of search power. It helps to go second, in case you get Adamatia Analyzer to your hand for extra search power on your first turn.

The beaver's cause I'm Canadian ;),"Just building Merfae for casual fun, seeing how well the archetype might hold up. The deck does seem to get a fair number of interactions up on the opponent's turn, but struggles to actually close games. Then again, with Merfae Hide-and-Seek the deck has a really solid plan to win in the grind-game. I feel like the deck would struggle at the competitive level, largely because of the timer, but also because it's weak, and also highly skill-intensive to pilot, since your plays happen on your opponent's turn. You have to finish setting up while they're setting up, and then know when to do everything to get the most value and that also means understanding your opponent's deck. So if that sounds like your kind of game plan, you could probably pilot it to moderate success. They ARE cute AF tho, and stronger in practice than they look on paper."

If they don't negate anything, Normal Summon Darklord Morningstar using Condemned Darklord's effect and try to get some Level 8s (Superbia/Zerato) or Level 10s (2 Ixchels) to go into Xyz plays. If the opponent isn't immune to destruction effects, Xyz Summon Number 35: Ravenous Tarantula to get rid of all their monsters, otherwise, summon Dingirisu, use its effect, and then Rank Up into Number 77: The Seven Sins by summoning Number 84: Pain Gainer.  I picked Dangers! as a side engine for more draw power and the ability to get rid of certain cards in your hand, which Darklords can use in the GY. Bigfoot and Thunderbird were chosen specifically because they're Allure of Darkness and Trade-In targets and they can also pop cards if you need them to.  Monster Gate and Reasoning serve as potential millers for the deck, which can also lead into easy Special Summons. Be aware that any Nasten or Ixchel that you already Special Summoned this turn will just get milled if Monster Gate or Reasoning got it. Morningstar will always be milled because it can't be Special Summoned. For Reasoning, your opponent will most likely guess Level 8 if they know the Darklord matchup.  The most common way to turbo out a Morningstar is by using Ixchel and discarding another Darklord monster, drawing 2, and then using Darklord Contact to Special Summon Ixchel and then the other Darklord. Do this the other way around if you discard Superbia with Ixchel's effect. Link those 2 Darklords into Condemned Darklord, then use its effect (preferably discard a Darklord Trap or a Danger! Monster) and search for Morningstar. Use Morningstar's effect to swarm the board with huge Darklords and then go into your plays from there.  The main weaknesses to Darklords as an archetype are basically backrow removal and their dependence on Special Summoning and draw power. DROLL &amp; LOCK BIRD IS REALLY ANNOYING FOR THIS DECK. Zombie World changes your gameplan of Summoning Morningstar because Condemned Darklord requires Fairy Monsters. This means Zombie World also makes Superbia's effect not work. Because the deck is mostly Dark-Attribute, that does mean your opponent can use Super Polymerization to summon Starving Venom Fusion Dragon, so be aware that they can disrupt your plays that way.  However, they are really good at non-targeting effects, as all of their Trap cards don't target and Dingirsu has non-targeting removal. They're also really great at summoning a bunch of high ATK/DEF monsters to the field if your opponent isn't the strongest against high ATK/DEF swarm.  For the side deck, I have 3 Twin Twisters for the backrow removal issue, 2 Darklord Tezcatlipoca if you need an extra Darklord with the Spell/Trap effect, 2 The Sanctified Darklord in case I need to search for effect negation or mill it with Ukoback, 2 Archlord Kristya for another Trade-In target and in case I need to lock my opponent out of Special Summoning, and 2 Michion, the Timelord for another Level 10 and for huge damage (Xyz into Gustav Max in MP2 to do even more).  Other side deck cards (these might change later on) are Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe, Number 23: Lancelot, Dark Knight of the Underworld, Five-Headed Link Dragon (it does come up sometimes), and Topologic Bomber Dragon."

Use cards like Nightmare's Steelcage and Gravity Bind to stop your opponents from attacking with there most powerful monsters. The get a revival jam on the field. You can activate Jam Defender and place some more monsters on the field, like Humanoid slime or Man-Eater Bug as a defense, and then you can summon and attack with Jinzo #7, who won't be effected by Gravity Bind, and can attack directly. By this time you might have Wave-Motion Cannon, and this can pretty much make you auto win if you've waited enough turns. After some more turns go by, you can use a combined effort of Wave-Motion Cannon and Gem flash (and also Jinzo#7) energy to deplete your opponents LP, and keep using Revival Jam as the ultimate defense, continuing to revive it! Of course, things might not always go this way, and we have XYZ's and Links, who don't have levels. You can easily destroy these monsters with Raigeki, plus you have other good spell and trap cards to foil your opponents plans as well, like Mystical Space Typhoon and Divine Wrath. If you don't have Raigeki, or it gets destroyed some how, you can use a better alternative to get rid of your opponents monsters: Lava Golem. Lava golem gets rid of two of your opponents monsters AND does 1000 damage to them turn after turn. And if you still have a Gravity Bind on the field, It won't be able to attack. If none of that works though, and you don't get lucky enough for the perfect strategy above, believe in the heart of the cards more! And try this next strategy. Using some new strategy, you can get Metal Reflect Slime on the field fairly easily, and with it protecting your LP get some more monsters on the field, protecting them with spells and traps. The easiest way to get quick monsters with this deck it to activate Jam Breeding Machine, summoning you some little jam tokens every turn. Now, once you have some Jams on your side, activate Mystical Space Typhoon, and get rid of your ow Spell: Jam Breeding Machine. With that card of the field, you can summon Slifer the Sky Dragon! If you don't have or have already used all your Mystical Space Typhoons, wait until your opponent destroys Jam Breeding Machine with one of there effects. People do that a lot when I duel them with this deck for some reason. Next use fusion sage if you've got it from the side deck, or use polymerization if you have it to fuse Slifer and Metal Reflect Slime to summon Egyptian God Slime! This card is practically unbeatable, not being able to be destroyed by battle, or targeted by card effects. This card can then destroy your opponent (with some help from the rest of your amazing deck) insuring victory. I know that you probs won't always be in the best position for one of these strategies, but there are many more inside the deck to explore. Have fun with this deck. It's surprisingly good. Btw in the extra deck a Fiber Jars, they are a banned card but if your playing for fun with no banned cards it's cool to have in the deck."

The deck is relatively consistent and you will likely have a Redoer turn 1 at least though you can set up far more than that if the cards in your hand are good enough. the real issues for the deck mostly come in the form of towers monsters which the deck can really struggle to beat over outside of utopia double or in draguns case trying to bounce it with Redoer's trap effect. Other than that the deck has the same good/bad match ups as strikers and thief typically do with the exception of shaddoll which Redoer's effect will trigger when detached.  The 2 widow anchor is definitely nice to have back but the deck will need more to ever make a splash on the meta again besides new main deck stuff."

This deck is unfortunetly not a budget option (rip destrudo), in this deck I play more Rokkets than other monsters.  Like in most decks You must play a few bricks.  Galactic Spiral Dragon is not a brick here but a ""free cost"",  You can discard him for Dragon Ravine, Twin Twister or Quadborrel and then return him from the gy to the field to make Harbinger.  &nbsp;  Basic combo start for Dummies:  1. Summon any Rokket or best case scenario Seyfert.  1.1. Special summon if You are able Absorouter.  1.2. If you summoned Sefert you go ""one card combo"".  1.2.1. Tribute Seyfert for Collapserpent -&gt; banish Seyfert -&gt; Link Collapserpent into Striker -&gt; add Boot Sector -&gt; special Wyverbuster -&gt; etc.  1.1.2 Link monster into Striker -&gt; add Boot Sector -&gt; link Absorouter and Striker into Romulus -&gt; chain1-Romulus chain2-Absorouter -&gt; etc.  2. At the end You usually have board with Spheres, Harbinger and Savage.  I could probably commit some grammar crimes, I'm not a native speaker.  Have fun and remember Dragon bullets for live~"

More flexible and strong extra deck. (Added Number 29 and Number 22.) Increased deck consistency. (10 copies of golden castle.) Improved chances of defeating unbeatable monsters. (2 copies of Lava Golem). Less chances of getting bricked. (Magical mallet) Overall 77% increase in fun and enjoyment.  Other tactics: (read first the original strategy <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/fun-castle-combo-deck/"">here.)</a> ◘ If somehow you didn't got 4 cards to summon saryuja skull dread, summon bow of the goddess. ◘ When there is atleast 20 banished cards you can summon topologic zeroboros for an epic finish. ◘ Use trade-in with 'Danger!' cards or Gizmek Orochi so you can activate their effects.  List of things that can still beat this deck: ◘ First turn shaddoll deck. ◘ First turn herald of perfection deck. ◘ Skilled salamangreat user. ◘ Kaiju-Lunalight deck. ◘ That combined time-thief with heraldic beasts and psy-frames deck. ◘ That power rangers quantum layer deck. ◘ Handtraps."

Really devastating buster blader deck. comment what you think. And enjoy. ,"okay so the strategy is pretty straight forward, the goal is to have a finish board of Buster dragon, Dragon destroyer and Vortex for negate. easiest way to get there is:  either normal summon or special summon (using its effect) Darkwurm to bring Gate zero to your hand. ( if you use darkwurm as a discard for pendulum call, it’s an easy plus 2; bringing harmonizing and white wing to your hand).  If you still have a normal summon summon a level 4 or lower dragon monster. Buster welp’s effect adds destruction fusion to your hand. But if it dracoslayer that’s fine too. Link summon into Romulus, adding dragon ravine to your hand. Discard a card a send tempest to your graveyard (unless it break your scale)  use gate zero and any 8 scale apart from harmonizing magician for your pendulum scale. (harmonizing is to valuable when pendulum summoned but if it has to be done it has to be). Pendulum summon the harmonizing, darkwurm from your extra deck and dracoslayer if you have it, white wing magician if you have it and leave a zone open.  Upon pendulum summoning harmonizing special summon dragoncaller from you deck. And sychro summon Star eater. (Due to dragoncaller a effect if it attacks a dragon monster then it’s attack becomes 6400).  link summon Elpy and pisty using darkwurm and other level 4 or lower dragon monster. Special summon another darkwurm from your deck. Sychro Summon Buster dragon in defense using white wing and darkwurm. (This turns all opponents monster to dragons). Then special summon another dragon from your grave yard using pisty.  link summon skull dread using pisty, Elpy, Romulus and dragon to break guardragon lock. Drawing 4 cards, if you don’t already have destruction fusion in your hand then hopefully you draw it. If not add level 7 monster. (If you have another card in your hand so you can have a level 7 and destruction fusion then that’s the best) skull dreads effect to special summon level 7 and activate tempest effect banishing Elpy and pisty to special summon itself. Xyz summon odd-eyes absolute then link summon into galaxy satellite using absolute and skull dread. Which special summons odd-eyes vortex. attack if you feel like.  if galaxy satellite is still on the field at the end of your opponents turn put buster blader or destruction fusion on top of your deck.  next turn is simple fusion summon dragon destroyer. Attack. ( if you are not going to end the duel by attack or it’s negated don’t worry) in main phase 2 pendulum summon any monster and link into protector welp, if you did not attack with dragon destroyer upon ending your turn protector welp then does damage to your opponent equal to dragon destroyers attack (which if there’s dragons on the field or graveyard then that’s quite a lot).  but that’s it, get your game on and high five the sky."

The deck's main offensive feature is the bouncing of threats with The Weather Thundery Canvas, which can lead to your opponent's boards being made completely obsolete.  Another useful feature of the deck is that it is difficult for your opponent to prevent the activations of your spells and traps because usually you won't be activating them, you will insteaed be ""placing"" them directly from your deck which doesn't count as an activation, thankfully.  You also have access to The Weather Painter Sun, which can be used to make The Weather Painter Rainbow and then make its negation clause live almost immediately. Allowing you quick access to what is, in essence, three omni-negates and a copy of Solemn Warning with 2400 attack points.  Also in the deck you have access to both Borreload and Borrelsword, which can both lead to quick OTKs with their high attack points and steal effect.  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRSTjoKGBA4</a>"

Hero Malicious, Destrudo, etc.,) I have been experimenting with using more cards from the zombie archetype. Since the deck has two natural targets for Cyrstron Halqifibrax's effect to summon a level 3 or lower tuner to your field in the form of Glow-Up Bloom and Uni-Zombie the number of brick-hands has been practically eliminated. The ideal going-first board can be achieved with a relatively consistent 3 combo;  Drawing a play starter (Shiranui Solitaire, Uni-Zombie, or Gozuki,) discard fodder (Necroworld Banshee, or Mezuki,) and any other extender/ free summon (Jack-o-Bolan, Danger! Mothman!, etc.) With a variation of these 3 cards alone it is possible to achieve an end-board of Zombie World, Doomking Balerdroch/Jack-o-Bolan (whichever you want to make off of Glow-Up Bloom,) Artifact Dagda, Artifact Scythe in the spell/trap zone and a Crystron Halqifibrax. During your opponent's main-phase you can activate Halqifibrax to summon T.G. Wonder Magician and destroy the set Artifact Scythe, triggering its effect to summon and lock your opponent out of their extra deck. Whenever your opponent summons or activates a card you can use Wonder Magician's effect to synchro summon with Scythe and make Shiranui Sunsaga, allowing an additional disruption in the form of destroying an opponent's card by shuffling back the Wonder Magician (not to mention at any time during all this you can chain to a monster effect to banish a monster from the field or grave, or negate a monster effect with Balerdroch.)

If you are going up against a Mystic Mine Stall/Burn deck (which didn't get hit at all on the banlist), you can use Exodia, because you can draw out your entire deck very quickly. In each game I tested the deck with, I ended on at least 1 of the Sacred Beasts, plus the either the Trap or Field Spell or both."

This deck isn't exactly perfect, so you can mess with the ratios if you want. It's a godless combination of Relinquished and a small Blue-Eyes engine. It does things. You can use White Stone of Ancients to either ritual Relinquished off of the actual ritual spell, or synchro into Formula Synchron, which will give a Blue-Eyes in the end phase to make Leo with on your opponents turn. Relinquished Fusion is a quick play, so you can summon Thousand-Eyes during the battle phase to save you a turn. Chaos MAX is in there because as long as I have Advance ritual art and Blue-Eyes, why not. Honestly this deck can do some cool things, but can brick harder than my jumpshot. Try it out if you want to have some fun."

This is the rokket link dragon deck after the 25/3 banlist. Although Destrudo is banned, the banlist doesn't affect rokket a lot. Elpy is unlimited, unlike in the OCG. So, this deck is still one of the most powerful decks in 2020. This is a going first deck with max 8 interruptions and the 2 cards combo have 5.  Requires: <a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a>, <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a>.  First, normal <a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a>, destroy itself, add <a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>, ss <a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>, link out <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a>, add <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a>, add <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a>, ss it, link out <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Romulus"">Dragunity Knight - Romulus</a>, activate <a data-name=""Dragon Ravine"">Dragon Ravine</a>, discard a card, send <a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon"">Absorouter Dragon</a> to GY, add <a data-name=""Silverrokket Dragon"">Silverrokket Dragon</a>, activate <a data-name=""Boot Sector Launch"">Boot Sector Launch</a>, ss <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> and <a data-name=""Silverrokket Dragon"">Silverrokket Dragon</a>, link out <a data-name=""Guardragon Elpy"">Guardragon Elpy</a> and <a data-name=""Guardragon Pisty"">Guardragon Pisty</a>, use Elpy to ss <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a>, ss Striker Dragon, destroy Darkness Metal Dragon, add Silverrokket Dragon , use Pisty to ss Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, ss Rokket Tracer, use Striker, Pisty, Elpy, Tracer to ss <a data-name=""Dillingerous Dragon"">Dillingerous Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Quadborrel Dragon"">Quadborrel Dragon</a>, destroy Dillingerous Dragon, discard Silverrokket and ss 2 rokket from your GY, Dillingerous Dragon gonna trigger its effect and ss itself, use Romulus and Quadborrel to ss <a data-name=""Unchained Abomination"">Unchained Abomination</a>, use Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, Dillingerous, Silverrokket to ss <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>, use Tracer to destroy Boot Sector Launch and ss <a data-name=""Magnarokket Dragon"">Magnarokket Dragon</a>, use Magnarokket and Tracer to ss Borreload Savage Dragon. And thats the end of the combo with 5 interruptions.  There are so much more different combos u can do with this deck. Like when u use Elpy, u can ss Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms or when u send a dragon to the GY, u can send <a data-name=""Keeper of the Shrine"">Keeper of the Shrine </a>if u already have Silverrokket, use Tracer to destroy Silverrokket instead of Boot Sector, and ss Keeper back...

Enough with the introduction, let's discuss the strategy.  <strong>FIRST TURN PATHS: </strong>1. Golden Castle -&gt; Iron Hans -&gt; Isolde -&gt; Armageddon Knight/Black Luster -&gt; Hero Kids -&gt; Number 29/Apollousa/Unchained/Zeroboros 2. Phantom Knight -&gt; Armageddon Knight -&gt; Plaguespreader -&gt; Crystron Halqifibrax -&gt; Ghost Sister/Ghost Ogre -&gt; --&gt; Crystron Quandax -&gt; Psy Framelord Omega (Inspector Boarder - block the opponent's combo  with a single monster card for maximum troll)  SECOND TURN PATHS: 3. Glife -&gt; Twin Twisters + Thunderbird -&gt; Golden Castle -&gt; Iron Hans -&gt; Isolde -&gt; Armageddon Knight/Black Luster -&gt; Hero Kids  -&gt; Number 29/Unchained 4. Glife -&gt; Twin Twisters + Danger Thunderbird -&gt; Golden Castle -&gt; Hexe Trude -&gt; Galaxy Eyes Cipher  -&gt; Galaxy Blade 5. Armageddon Knight -&gt; Plaguespreader -&gt; Brionac/Goyo Predator 6. Twin Twisters + Thunderbird -&gt; Lava Golem -&gt; Gizmek Orochi / Hexe Trude (effect) 7.  Golden Castle -&gt; Iron Hans + Iron Knight -&gt; Exciton Knight (Effect)  FINISHERS: 8. Black Luster Soldier (effect) -&gt; Gizmek Orochi/Danger! -&gt; Galaxy Cipher/Galaxy Blade 9. Gizmek Orochi + Danger! -&gt; Number 22 10. Hexe Trude (effect) and/or Black Luster (effect) and/or Danger! (effect), Topologic Zeroboros w/ 20+ banished cards  Explanation: Combo #1: The main combo that can lock or restrict the enemy's action. Combo #2: Summons the prince of synchro monsters (psy framelord omega) which gives you huge advantage. Combo #3: Destroys atleast 3 trap/spell cards and gives you a nice amount of firepower. Combo #4: Destroys 2 trap/spell cards, 1 set card, 2 any card on your enemy's field. Destroys a total of 5 cards your opponent controls. Combo #5: A weak combo which can return most of your opponent's cards to the hand by discarding your own hand. Combo #6: Destroys 2 trap/spell cards,  1 set card, 2 unbeatable boss monsters, and almost clear the enemy's field. Combo #7: Nukes your opponent's field (use it against altergeist decks, sky strikers, subterrors) Combo #8: Banishes 1 face-up monster, destroys 1 monster/spell/trap,  and destroys another monster. Combo #9: Destroys a boss monster, and deals good damage. Combo #10: Destroys enemy cards then ends the game dealing 10000+ damage to your enemy.  Tips: Armageddon Knight/Dark Grepher targets: Orcust Knightmare, Plaguespreader Zombie, Gizmek Orochi. Always check your graveyard and banished cards to see if you have any cards left before using Golden Castle. Try to use l:P Masquerena when using link summon on strong monsters. Use your side deck against annoying decks. Be intelligent in choosing which monsters to discard."

This particular build is more designed for going second and stealing the opponent's monsters with Red Baron/Zombie Necronize, but do know that this deck struggles to play through most interruptions so you may find going first to be preferable depending on the opposing deck. Most plays involve milling a Vampire Retainer/Familiar, using it to get a search, and tribute summoning/reviving stuff until you have enough to make Links, Xyzs, or just smack into the opponent for big damage. There's not a whole lot going on here, just mill as much as you can and get as many bodies on the field as possible to steal back some precious life points. If you want to up the power level of the deck some, the Zombie World support synergizes well with this deck and 1x Doomking Balerdroch, 2x Necroworld Banshee, +1 Glow-up Bloom and 2-3x Zombie World allow you to make some pretty strong boards when going first as compared to this going-second build."

Barkion is there just for exterio, and to give valfawn some use.

Also if paired right with extra deck and spell and trap very meta. ,"Contrary to belief Fur Hire decks are a good deck to GO FIRST.  I know, I know, that’s sounds crazy. The strategy to this, is to combo on the 3rd turn. Due to fur hire effects they can all special summon each other among other effects and if you can keep your normal summon for a tuner monster, then you can build more negates and control the board better.  the fur hire combo is an easy combo to understand but be careful as it is easy to forget effects that you can activate because there is soooo many. The draw power is crazy and paired with skull dread it’s amazing.  summon a monster activate its effect and special summon another and continue the cycle until you can’t summon more or you reach the amount you wish to have based on the combo you want. I suggest always leaving a zone open because if you draw a tuner then you have a zone, otherwise you might brick. Dark ruler no more is a great card to prevent negates from stopping your combo.  It’s also very important to watch what attributes you summon as to link summon Folgo, you must have 3 different attributes and plan which monster you need to effect wise to continue the combo. Example: if your goal is to special summon dompa with Folgos effect and the special summon destroying a card on the field activating folgo’s drawing effect, then make sure you don’t summon a beast monster.  Rafale is also very important as it has a negate effect and I draw effect, which can continue the combo.  Soul levy is easily one of the most underated cards that recently came out. For every monster your opponent special summons they send 3 cards to the grave yard. Imagine going against a Shaddoll deck, Lightsworn deck or a pendulum deck and just destroying their deck in one turn. Because when cards in their deck are sent to the graveyard they special summon. In a meta game that lasts 2-4 turns swarming and surviving a turn but destroying your opponents deck can be very beneficial.  This is really just a guide, build decks that you have fun playing. Get your game on and high five the sky."

Flood the field with the big boys, Unicore and Amorphactor are Master Rule 5 ready like no other cards  5. Zaborg just for sh*ts and giggles  6. Use observatory to recycle talsimandra so you can draw 2 after you're done searching (so you dont draw into blue-eyes white D. or candoll/talismandra that only work when they are in your deck; yes Im looking at you Pot of Extravagance)  7.

Depending on your hand, you can summon him during your first turn, or your second turn.  Once it is on the field, I'm not saying that's an instant win but your opponent will have trouble dealing with it since it can't be targeted or destroyed by effect, and every turn, you can destroy up to 3 card on the field (monsters and/or spell/trap).  A basic combo is to use dragon shrine,then send to the graveyard a <a data-name=""Blue-eyes White Dragon"">Blue-eyes White Dragon</a> then <a data-name=""The White Stone of Ancients"">The White Stone of Ancients</a>. At the end of your turn, special summon <a data-name=""Deep of Blue-eyes"">Deep of Blue-eyes</a>. With his effect, add 1 polymerization to your hand, then depending on your other card a <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a><a data-name=""Blue-eyes White Dragon"">. If you already have another blue-eyes monster in your hand, on your second turn, use the second effect of </a><a data-name=""The White Stone of Ancients"">The White Stone of Ancients</a><a data-name=""The White Stone of Ancients""> to send back to your hand </a><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a><a data-name=""The White Stone of Ancients"">. Then summon your boss Monster. </a>  There are other combo which allows you to summon it on  your first turn or summon two copies but it depend too much of your starting hand.  For example, if you have a <a data-name=""Dragon's Mirror"">Dragon's Mirror</a> or <a data-name=""The Melody of Awakening Dragon"">The Melody of Awakening Dragon</a>."

With alpha searching berserkion then linking them all off and finishing with berserkion affect wrecking your opponents defense to easily OTK your opponent.  now I will explain every card and why I use it.  <span>Monsters</span>  <a data-name=""Adamancipator Analyzer"">Adamancipator Analyzer</a>  this card is super useful when going second because you pretty much get two free monsters for linking off or taking a synchro without using the normal summons. It is a very nice building block to get to the boss monsters for the deck.  <span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Seeker"">Adamancipator Seeker</a></span>  this card I only play one copy of because the only time I use it if I do not draw into it is for <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> to take out then synchro summon or link it off. Another little bonus for this card if you used Crystron Halqifibrax to get seeker out then you can use sign if it's in the GY to take it back out and use sign's affect to place any non tuner rock on the top then summon it with seeker's affect it is weirdly common to use this combo.  <span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Researcher"">Adamancipator Researcher</a><a data-name=""Adamatia Researcher""> </a></span> this card is super easy to bring out and does a lot for creating your board. because of its affect you can bring it out pretty much every time since basically every monster is rock then get another summon to keep expanding your board.  <span><a data-name=""Alpha the Electromagnet Warrior"">Alpha the Electromagnet Warrior</a>  </span>this card is essential to the deck because if summoned you can search berserkion which sets you up for success. Also, using its second affect lets you get more cards in the GY and on the field. (all electromagnet warriors have this affect)  <span><a data-name=""Beta the Electromagnet Warrior"">Beta the Electromagnet Warrior</a> </span> this card lets you search any magnet warrior from your deck this is useful to get the missing pieces for berserkion or just maximizing your board. Also as mentioned above its second affect  <span><a data-name=""Gamma the Electromagnet Warrior"">Gamma the Electromagnet Warrior</a>  <span>this card lets you bring out another magnet warrior warrior from your hand if it is summoned to keep expanding your board and bringing link materials or synchro materials. Also, the second affect mentioned above. </span></span>  <span><a data-name=""Delta the magnet warrior"">Delta the magnet warrior</a>  <span>this is the only original form of the magnet warriors that I play. this is another monster that gets all the pieces ready to bring berserkion out by sending one to the GY when summoned. when it is sent to the GY, you can banish 3 magnet warriors from your GY to summon Valkyrion the magna warrior from your hand or deck. which really sets up the OTK.</span></span>  <span><a data-name=""Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior"">Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior</a>  <span>this is the boss monster for the electromagnet warrior archetype. To summon berserkion you need to banish the electromagnet forms of alpha, beta, and gamma from your hand, field, or GY. Berserkions affect lets you destroy one card your opponent controls by banishing one magnet warrior from your GY. And for the icing on top, if it is destroyed by your opponent, you can special Summon the cards you banished to summon berserkion.</span></span>  <span><a data-name=""Valkyrion the magna warrior"">Valkyrion the magna warrior</a></span>  the only reason I play this card is for Delta to use its affect to special summon this and since it has 3500 attack it can blast some of your opponents monsters very easily or defend you well with a wopping 3,850 defense.  <span><a data-name=""Gorgonic Gargoyle"">Gorgonic Gargoyle</a> <span>this card is essentially a free summon since the only card you will summon will be rock type. Also it is level three like the electromagnet warriors to synchro summon consistently.</span></span>  <span><a data-name=""Sentry Soldier of Stone"">Sentry Soldier of Stone</a>  <span>this card lets you special summon itself when it is in the GY if all cards you control are rock type. This card is easy to summon and easy to link off or use as synchro material to farther build your board.</span></span>  <span><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> <span>this card is really useful to trash the opponents field and replace it with a token while taking out another monster. Another reason I play this card is because it is rock type which lets you do even more with it.</span></span>  <span>Spells</span>  <span><a data-name=""Adamancipator sign"">Adamancipator sign</a> <span>this card lets you summon a rock monster from your GY and if it is an adamancipator monster you can place one rock monster on the top of your deck then summon it with the Analyzer, seeker, or researcher you just pulled out of the GY. Another option with this card is to just get a magnet warrior out to keep building your board. </span></span>  <span><a data-name=""Foolish burial"">Foolish burial</a> <span>there are two ways I use this card one way is to send the missing piece of the berserkion to the GY, or my favorite one to send Sentry Soldier of Stone to the GY for essentially a free summon to link off or use a material for a synchro summon and I can use this affect every turn to repeatedly get extra materials out.</span></span>  <span><a data-name=""Magnetic Field"">Magnetic Field</a> <span>magnetic field lets you special summon a magnet warrior from the GY if you have a level 4 or lower rock monster on the field. Also if an earth rock type monster battled a monster and it was not destroyed you can return it to the hand which is super easy to wreck the opponents board</span></span>  <span><a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> <span>basically negates an ash or droll or banishes something like gizmek or banishes a monster that would be special summoned from the GY. Called by the Grave is very diverse allowing you to do many things with it.</span></span>  <span><a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> <span>destroys two of your opponents spell and traps by discarding one card. This card is used to clear the opponents spell and trap zone or nock of their best spells/traps.</span></span>  <span>Trap</span>  <span><a data-name=""magnet conversion"">magnet conversion</a></span> <span>allows you to target up to three magnet warriors in your GY and add them to your hand and if it is in the GY you can banish it and summon one of you banished monsters. this card is useful to recover monsters before they are banished or simply add cards to your hand to increase card advantage.</span>  <span>Extra Deck</span>  <span><a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a> <span>in my opinion this card is one of the most underrated cards, why play  <a data-name=""Crystal wing synchro dragon"">Crystal wing synchro dragon</a> when Draco Berserker of the Tenyi exists it's just better. This card is usually brought out by analyzer and delta or seeker/researcher and 2L3's. This card can absolutely devastate the opponent first when their boss monster activates its affect just banish it with Draco berserker and for its second affect keep devastating there field with its attacking capability.</span></span>  <span><a data-name=""Black Rose moonlight dragon"">Black Rose moonlight dragon</a> <span>this card is really useful if you are playing a deck with tons of high level monsters because you can keep putting them back in your opponents hand or extra deck.</span></span>  <span><a data-name=""Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"">Clear Wing Synchro Dragon</a></span> this card is basically Black Rose moonlight dragon that sends the level 5 or higher monster to the GY instead of the hand but also gets an attack boost.  <a data-name=""&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;F.A. Dawn Dragster&lt;/span&gt;""><span>F.A. Dawn Dragster</span></a> <span>this card is able to destroy 3 of your opponents spell and traps while negating them but it does get weaker every time you use this affect. It is very useful against a stall deck if you can bring it out.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Rise- Raptite"">Adamancipator Rise- Raptite</a></span> this card is here for the rare case you have seeker/researcher and Delta but if you can summon it it's a wonderful way to build your board.  <span><a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a></span> this card lets you negate a spell by sending the top two cards of your deck to the GY. This card is a must when playing pendulum decks. It also gets cards in your GY to use for summoning berserkion or just to re-summon.  <span><a data-name=""Apollousa Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa Bow of the Goddess</a> this card lets you negate an opponents monster affect by decreasing its attack by 800. If monster affects are getting in the way you should summon this to clear a few of them away.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> this is the go to OTK card with its insane ability to inflict damage and destroy monsters this is a very nice way to end combos by tributing the electromagnet warriors then banishing them to take berserkion out to finish the play.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> this is a very easy card to take out then taking out a seeker with it to just keep synchro summoning. I really recommend summoning this card before any synchro summons just to increase capability.</a></span>  <span><a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> this is like borrelsword without the attacking capabilities but abilities to help all other monsters you control and bring out more. I tend to use this card in the beginning of combos unlike borrelsword which is for the end.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Notes</span>  I am still a tween (10-12 years old) so there may be some glaring grammer errors.  if you have any suggestions feel free to ask me  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This sets up the Avian lockdown by getting thunderbird on the field with Carrier's effect, and summoning Avian through Ninjitsu art of transformation.  Your main goal is to get two hanzos in the grave before you use Getsuga the Shogun, so you can search two Twilight Ninja Jogen to make Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon, to protect against monster attacks, and summoning Apollusa for the wind target of Union Carrier.  There are multiple setups to work with, such as using yellow ninja as a target for carrier, since he's a wind attribute.  Youtube link: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf3Wn6sVxTk</a>"

Discard Nidhogg to activate <a data-name=""Double Attack"">Double Attack</a> for a <a data-name=""Phantasm Spiral Dragon"">Phantasm Spiral Dragon</a> that's equipped with all the necessary equip spells and attack three Effect Monsters to win the duel. <a data-name=""Double Attack"">Double Attack</a> can also be used for <a data-name=""The Tripper Mercury"">The Tripper Mercury</a> if you feel like it's necessary to do so. Two <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>s if you want to XYZ <a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a>. <a data-name=""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</a> is a must for this deck. Should be easy to activate both of its effects. A 2000/2000 Token monster is helpful and if you normal or special summon a Normal Monster, you're able to search your deck for Phantasm Spiral cards. One <a data-name=""D.D. Warrior"">D.D. Warrior</a> and One <a data-name=""D.D. Warrior Lady"">D.D. Warrior Lady</a> (both for variety) so you can banish your opponent's monsters, if attacked. Two <a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a> so you can protect your Equip/Field Spells. Lastly, since <a data-name=""Gagagigo"">Gagagigo</a> is my favorite card out of this deck, I went ahead and added his XYZ form (<a data-name=""Gagagigo the Risen"">Gagagigo the Risen</a>). You'll most likely not play him, but he's awesome regardless of being playable for this deck."

It's also very consistent and you'll almost always have the necessary cards. Basically for the infinite negate combo, you just need to be able to summon at least 3 blackwings if you have black whirlwind out OR 4 blackwings at once if you don't have black whirlwind. But even if you won't be able to make the full board, you can still summon out Simorgh using Crystron and the tuner that it summons out. At the end phase, summon out Avian using Simorgh's effect.

Uria/Armityle/Dimension Fusion are really just there for personal flavour and the deck would probably be a lot better if they were cut. The Scorpio/Cobra package does make Army more consistent because the fusion spell is then more searchable without sacrificing looking for your more important cards and then they can be used to summon Verte - Dragun. BUT i'm not overly sure I like them in (Scorpio/Cobra not Verte/Dragun) so they can probably be cut in favour of cards that actually do something.  Triples of Beckoning, Chaos Summoning and Spirit Gates because the search is just brilliant. I like 2 Sky Fires and Awakenings just so there's more chance of you getting them and not losing them to Desires, also nice to have extras incase they get destroyed.  2 Fallen Paradise, super easy to search it out and it provides brilliant prot/draw power. Could probably take it to 3 if you want but I think 2 is plenty. 2 Summoning beast, it's the weaker of the summoning cards but by no means useless.  Upstart, double Allure and double Desires because you love drawing cards in this deck, gotta get a hold of those summoners as quick as you can. Double Ash and Crackdown just because. I think the deck is fine going over 40 cards because there's so much draw, and almost all the cards are searchers so having that bit of extra protection cards in the mix I feel helps out without diluting the deck.  &nbsp;"

There are still some classic combo with <a data-name=""Ahrima, The Wicked  Warden"">Ahrima, The Wicked  Warden</a> and <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord of The Lair</a>. The Danger! monster are here to help get rid of some annoying monsters and Spells/Traps. Or you can special summon them and make a rank 8 XYZ with the classic Galaxy-eyes package.  To protect your field spell, you can summon <a data-name=""Beat cop from The Underworld"">Beat cop from The Underworld</a> using link spider and another token.  The card advantage is quite hard to maintain sometimes so two copies of <a data-name=""Recurring Nightmare"">Recurring Nightmare</a> can be useful.  If you don't need Nibiru, you can still discard him to the Graveyard (there are plenty of card effect for that in the deck) since it's a light Attribute target for <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>.  I'm playing one copy of <a data-name=""Fantastic Striborg"">Fantastic Striborg</a> because since it bounce to your hand the tributed mosnter. You cans for exemple send back to your hand Danger! Bigfoot!, summon Striborg. Then discard Bigfoot to bounce back to your opponant hand one or two cards on his field, then destroy a third with bigfoot's effect.  In the future, I'm planning to replace striborg with <a data-name=""Archnemesis Eschatos"">Archnemesis Eschatos</a> (available in eternity code ) since it  can be searched with <a data-name=""the melody of awakening Dragon"">the melody of awakening Dragon</a> and have  a quite interesting effect in my opinion.  The only traps I'm playing are the <a data-name=""Eradicator Epidemic Virus"">Eradicator Epidemic Virus</a> since it can be quite effective against lot of decks like Shadoll, ... and if you tribute your own monster you'll be able to summon Diabolos.  I wouldn't recommend playing others virus card because there are too specific.

Gain advantage with continued destruction.,"The most simplest of strategies, go second and blow-up the field! And keep blowing it up!  In addition to that, Fire Kings, in the beginning of a game at least, is reliant upon the normal summon (at least your traditional builds). The deck will eventually be able to spit out special summoned monsters after the first turn, but it needs set up. This is why this is not a ""go first deck"" most of the time. There are some ""go-first"" cards, but first turn openings are sub-par. This is why I have tinkered with the deck through the years, adding Fire Fist-Leopard (to search Fire Formations), a Fire Formation Tensu (extra normal summon), and Caninetaur (dump a monster in the graveyard). Now with the addition of Gizmek Yata,  you are able to get an additional normal summon, plus a monster card in the graveyard for a special summon (note the restriction on the special summoned monster due to Gizmek Yata's effect).  I also included Naglfar, Generaider Boss of Fire into this build as a way to control the destruction ability of the High Avatar Garunix, plus give a level of protection against battle and card effects that you don't want to hamper your board (either through your opponents effects of your own). This in effect allows you to control your side of the field in a more pin-pointed way, and not just rely on blowing up the filed over and over. Which is still so fun! Plus, Naglfar is a level 9 beater that can be used with Agnimazud to bring out True King of all Calamities from you extra deck.  Please note than I am still trying to figure out the right ratios with these inclusions. Plus I would like to add some draw power to the deck, but not with Supply Squad seeing it can be a huge dead draw (personal experience)."

Use Dragon Shrine on Background Dragon to unbrick your hand, on Router to fix your hand, or on Spiral if you want to go into something else with Elpy.  At any point, make Queen Dragun Djinn and reborn Absorouter or Noctovision if you need it.  Brotaur's discard one card condition/World Chalice Guardragon's normal monster reborn didn't really work for me.  Needlefiber too inconsistent in this deck, not enough tuners.

It ended up kinda cool. It's a fun deck not based on one big boring combo.,"<span>Hello! I'm Nightingale! I am but a simple bird getting back into Yu-Gi-Oh! And ever since I got back I've only had one thing in mind, making this deck work:</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>I. </strong>Purpose</span> <ul>  	<li><span>This deck doesn't follow normal combo conventions, at least that's not how i use it. Instead of having one big combo, you have multiple small combos. For example: if you have ""Red Resonator""+ ""Foolish Burial"" + Any other Level 2 tuner, you can consistently end on a board of ""Knightmare Unicorn""+ ""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane""</span></li>  	<li><span>If your board has at least 1 HRDA Monster, you can pretty easily get another one, ""Return of the Dragon Lords"" works well for this if you used Scarlight to reach Bane. If not, I recommend Synchro-ing into ""Red Rising Dragon"" since he can summon another tuner. What all of this leads to is the effect of ""Galactic Spyral Dragon"" to summon himself and lead to either ""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"" or ""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"". Which you use is up to your better judgement regarding your situation.</span></li> </ul> <span>From what you can see, this deck is not really competitive, or at least not now. Having an empty hand with this card is death. However this is really fun to play and experiment, just don't expect many OTK's. The two examples above are just the most used of the many small combos. Currently I'll keep working on it until I reach a definitive Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Deck.</span>"

The new Dino deck after the April 2020 banlist is here. Although dino hasn't been touched at all, but it still need a little bit modification to fit the new format. Because mr5 allow us to ss synchro, xyz, fusion,...in the Main mons zone, so it's necessary to add some more xyz into the deck. But the combo doesn't change a lot. This deck can go either first or second. For the going second style, we have <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>. For the going first style, we have these combos.  Combo 1: <a data-name=""Babycerasaurus"">Babycerasaurus</a> + <a data-name=""Dragonic Diagram"">Dragonic Diagram</a>  Firstly, use Diagram to destroy Baby, add <a data-name=""True King Lithosagym, the Disaster"">True King Lithosagym, the Disaster</a>; Baby effect triggers, ss <a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a>, add Baby2, normal Baby2, use oviraptor to destroy Baby2 and ss Baby1 from the GY, Baby2 effect triggers, ss <a data-name=""Petiteranodon"">Petiteranodon</a> , use True King Disaster to destroy Baby and Petiter , ss itself and ban 3 cards from your opponent's extra deck, Baby and Petiter effects trigger, ss <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a> and <a data-name=""Giant Rex"">Giant Rex</a>, use 4 mons to link out Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess; use Miscellaneousaurus effect to ban 4 cards from the GY include Giant Rex and ss Miscellaneousaurus2, Giant Rex effect triggers, ss itself. Now u can summon 1 of the rank 4 xyz depent on what u see in your opponent extra deck, to do that correctly, u must know a lot of deck strategies. So this combo has at least 5 negates  Combo 2: <a data-name=""Lost World"">Lost World</a> + <a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a> + <a data-name=""True King Lithosagym, the Disaster"">True King Lithosagym, the Disaster</a>  Firstly, activate Lost world, normal Oviraptor, send miscellaneousaurus summon a token, use oviraptor to destroy the token and use Lost world to protect it by destroying Baby from the deck, Baby effect trigger, ss another Baby, use miscellan to ban itself and baby to ss the third baby, ss True King disaster by destroying 2 baby, ss giant rex and miscellan, use disaster and giant rex to ss I:P, now u can summon a xyz mons depent on what u see in your opponent extra deck. This combo has 2 negates  After that, in your next turn, u can use miscellan to ban 4 dino include Giant rex and ss another oviraptor, send <a data-name=""Overtex Qoatlus"">Overtex Qoatlus </a>to the GY, add <a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a>, ss <a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a>, Giant rex effect trigger and ss itself. U can easily OTK your opponent with this combo.  Dino is still a very strong deck in 2020 and its very easy to play. It can terminate many decks that only play 1 copy of a card in the extra deck with True King disaster, OTK easily with Ultimate Conductor Tyranno.  Thank you for reading  &nbsp;"

The best thing to do is to try and get Madonna in the pendulum zone ASAP through Hyper Director, Extras, or just drawing her. Try and save Madonna's pendulum effect until you're sure you need it because it locks you out of summoning any non-main deck Abyss Actor cards (Which means you can't even bring out Hyper Director). The Abyss Scripts all have quite the overpowered second effect but are difficult to get working, but there are two ways this deck can trigger them. First you must understand that to activate the second effects of all of the Abyss Scripts they must be destroyed, while set, by an opponents effect, while you have an Abyss Actor face-up in the extra deck. All of that sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through but there are two ways like I said.</p>  <ul>  	<li>First the most obvious way is to use the field spell which changes the first monster effect during your opponents turn to: (Destroy one set spell or trap your opponent controls) so I recommend using Extras monster effect to tribute itself or go into Hyper Director and use his effect to fill the Extra quota, then use the Madonna that Extras or Hyper Director searched to build a high scale and summon one monster setting yourself up for at least 1 Abyss Script second effect trigger.</li>  	<li>Second is a bit more....interesting, and it is also my preferred method. For this method you need your opponent to have 1 monster on board and have 2 Comic Relief available, one to summon and one to use its pendulum effect. Comic Relief has the unique monster effect of destroying 1 set Abyss Script when his control is shifted but if he is switched to the opponents side to activate this then it counts as an opponents card, fulfilling most of the requirements. For the last requirement to trigger the Spells (have a face-up Abyss Actor in the Extra) we must look to our second Comic Relief in the pendulum zone who has the effect of tributing himself (which sends him to the Extra deck) to switch control of one of your monsters and an opponents. Just like that, you took a preferably big monster from your opponent, gave him a 1000 attack monster, and if you had a set Abyss Script its effect was triggered.</li> </ul>"

It relies on the several special summons that the variety of HERO monsters can engage into, the wide variety of fusion monsters the HERO archetype has to offer and all the necessary support in the correct ratio that allow the deck to perform the combos. The main floodgate this deck offers are Masked HERO Dark Law. Masked HERO Dark Law can keep the opponent from attempting GY plays, while Destiny HERO Plasma is the response to any on field monster effect, the ladder being sided due to being a brick sometimes. This deck can rely on many individual special summons, which makes the summoning of Destiny HERO Plasma a lot more easier. Once summoned, Destiny HERO Plasma can also absorb any 1 monster on the field, which by negating all monster effect on the field, it results in a guaranteed to get passed all in build protection that the monster may have and easily perform the steal. The link monster Xtra HERO Dread Decimator and the honest-like effect that Elemental HERO Honest Neos are used to give attack increase to flood gate monsters Destiny HERO Plasma and Masked HERO Dark Law and prevent that any monster can run over the low attack values that they individually have. Additionally, Elemental HERO Sunrise, which on summon gives you access to miracle fusion, can give 1 in-battle protection to any 1 HERO monster being attacked except itself, by destroying any 1 card on the field during battle phase, between battle step and before damage calculation. By using Miracle Fusion Elemental Hero Absolute can act as a Raigeki on your opponent's turn. I truly believe that this deck can perform well and achieve competitive results without going into big expenses, and now that mr5 in in play, it gains full potential in a fusion, syncro and xyz spamming metagame. Most importantly hope it brings fun to anyone who wants to try this out."

Starting with the big stuff. Eldlich the Golden Lord is central to the deck, a great combo starter in its own right, sometimes an extender in its own right. It's also decent interaction in its own right. Even though it's searchable it is an obvious 3 of that you want to see in your hand. This is also your main boss monster. His ability to summon other zombies from the hand is sometimes key to really extending your combos with Gozuki, and his ability to send your own cards to the graveyard is similarly useful. The protection can be useful with Balerdroch sometimes. With 2 of these you can go into Superdreadnought Railcannons for easy OTKs, and with Guardian of the Golden Land that's an easy OTK against a single attack position monster.  2 of Doomking Balerdroch. He's amazing and central to the deck, serving as your main lines of interaction and best boss monster, and you do want 2 copies, but since it is so very easy to get him onto the field in this deck 2 copies will serve you well. His downside is that he requires running a Zombie world package, but there's a whole lot of upside and Zombie world is easy enough to search in this deck. With Guardian of the Golden Land you can make Dingirsu with these.  3 Uni-Zombie are your main starter. Often your best hands are more spells and traps than monsters, but this card helps mitigate hands with high monster counts. Being a level 3 tuner that can easily turn into a level 4 tuner is also highly relevant. This is basically a better Dark Grepher for Zombies, so it seems worth all 3. This makes Rank 4s, Rank 5s, Level 8 Synchros, it is a very versatile card that helps you access your extra deck. It also helps make Needlefibre.  3 Shiranui Solitaire gives us extra copies of Uni-Zombie. That's basically it, sometimes you can also search Glow-Up Bloom, but generally you want Uni-Zombie.  1 Gozuki is a little weird. I see people trying Mezuki as an extender, and the nice part of that is that it is relatively easy to get Mezuki in the bin and get the value off of it. Gozuki is an extender you want to see in your hand, however, and combos nicely with Golden Lord to get an extra zombie in the GY in exchange for protection and stats.  1 Necroworld Banshee is essential, since we're running Zombie World. Space is tight, but I could be convinced 2 of these is correct for more security in the grind game. 3 was good, but I had too many cards I wanted.  1 Glow-Up Bloom is enough. The card helps facilitate both your beaters, and is good without Zombie World and insane with it. Sometimes its weirdly actually better without Zombie World for the Golden Lord. A zombie specific better Glow-Up Bulb? I can see the appeal of modern Zombies.  Then we have a couple of ""utility"" zombies we can search easily off of our main Eldlixirs. Vampire Fraulein is mediocre as a hand trap, but being able to use its effect on the field off of Eldlixirs seems good enough. Additionally, you need level 5 zombie monsters to make Level 7 Synchros with off of Needlefibre - this way any search for a Golden Land or Eldlixir spell should meet the requirement.  Jack-O-Bolan is theoretically a decent value engine, and could be pretty good if you put your opponent's beater in the bin with Zombie World out. It's actually here as a form of spell-speed 2 interaction, since if you have Zombie World you can resurrect your opponent's combo pieces from the GY to deny them access to them. Not an amazing card, but the deck needed another zombie that could form an extra line of interaction off of an Eldlixir, and this was the best bet.  We're a little light on creatures and devoid of hand traps. This is because a lot of the deck's interaction comes from Trap Monsters with effects when they activate. ) 0 Ash Blossom might strike some as wrong, given that the card is a zombie monster, but I'd rather run more Golden Land traps, which double as combo pieces and from lines of interaction, than run Ash, who while reliable and powerful, doesn't actually do much for the deck, despite being a Zombie Tuner. Could be wrong, it's hard to argue that it's a mistake to run Ash pretty much ever. We do have 3 Called By The Grave, just so that our Uni-Zombie goes off, as well as being a line of interaction and helping summon the Golden Lord (if under less than ideal situations).  The black Eldlixir is pretty good on the face of it. The deck needs its Eldich cards, and the card is searchable. But surprisingly, you often want to be using your Eldlixirs on your opponent's turn anyways, so you don't end up seeing this card too often. Still, it's a 1 card starter that summons from the deck on a spell, so I'm running 3 of them. The white Eldlixir, the quickplay one, is actually often more valuable, despite seeming more limited. This deck has good grind game. 2 of them still seems enough, especially since they're searchable.  3 Cursed El Dorlando are obvious. The card searches for Eldlich and gives you a good target to send to the GY with it, and can add 1 card to your hand per turn, which is crazy good. You can't search this card, and it might get cut in game 2 for SB tech because some of those cards might be more impactful when you do see them in a given matchup, but this is a crazy starter.  2 Zombie World is enough. The deck can put the searcher in the bin or on the field very easily, and 2 should cover you for a given game. Very essential to have 2 I think.  1 Super Poly goes with the Zombie World package. You can also use Verta Anaconda to pull this out of the deck, and discarding a card is often an upside in this deck. There are more in the side for where they are good.  The Traps are in some ways a part of the deck. The Red Eldlixir, the Philosopher's Stone, is the best of them all by far, and the added redundancy helps keep the deck's engine humming. Like the other Eldlixirs, you can banish this from the gy to set a Golden Land card.  Conquistador of the Golden Land is a clear 3 of. Searching for an Eldlixir card in the end phase by banishing it keeps the deck rolling in resources, and the ability to destroy monsters is key. This is simultaneously interaction and a combo piece. It's brother, Huaquero, is a D.D. Crow on a trap. Not quite as good as a Called by the Grave in terms of interaction, but it's also a trap monster and a combo pieces. The weakest of these is guardian, but it might be key to some OTKs and its searchable, so 1 of makes sense. The last Golden Land card is the Everglorious Golden Land, a counter-trap that Omni-negates but requires a tribute. It's a searchable countertrap that omni-negates so it has to make the cut as at least a 1 of. I could be persuaded 2 of these is correct, the card is just solid.  Side Deck is a bunch of options to bring in going second to break boards, as well as the Adelantado which seems good in grindier matchups, and a Mystic Mine package. Mystic Mine is cool here, since you can get rid of it by searching zombie world. This is just a pile of cards that will win you games going second against creatures/spellw and traps, and then Adelantado.  You could run Pot of Extravagence, and it is hard to argue that it would be wrong, but I just didn't like how Extravagence felt in the deck. I like running a bunch of situational 1 ofs in the extra deck rather than piling in multiples of the stuff I need to see. 2 cards is great, but you need access to a bunch of stuff for different situations. I guess you could consider Magicians' Souls, since there are synergies there. But I don't know, the card is good, but I feel overrated without those synergies. They're believable here, since your want your spells/traps in the GY, but personally I like running them alongside Spellcaster Synergies in decks that want cards in the GY rather than running them as just generic draw support. They meet 1 of those requirements, but not both.  EDIT* Testing Performapal Popperup. Synergies seem high in this deck, actually, like a Magicians' Souls without the bricks. Also trying a single Ghost Ogre, to get an extra interaction off of Needlefibre. Reasonable, since if you see it it's a valuable hand trap.  So far, Popperup ranges from hand neutral to a +5 depending on your hands, and provides reasonable fixing even in the low end. It is easy to lose 3000-4000 life points off of it, which might mean taking them out if you're worried about going to time. I love the +5 hands enough to take the hand neutral ones, but you could be excused for running Extravagance instead. I think Popperup is better than Magicians' Souls in the deck by far however. The more I test with it the better it feels. Ranging from being an Upstart Goblin to a +5 is a pretty sweet consistency boost.  Dropping Dingirsu for Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand. There are a few reasons - it gives me one more monster negate, it protects monsters from more kinds of effects, and most importantly, you can detach one material at any time to get your Doomking back in the graveyard.  Cut Jack-O-Bolan. He's good, but space is tight, and Fraulein is more essential to make Zombie Necro.  Added Instant Fusion with just Millennium-Eyes, as a 4th way to protect against Ash."

Making use of various engines, Orcusts just refuse to die even after Harp Horror's ban. With 3 Dark Armed Dragon, I've taken one of the most infamous decks of all time and modernized it with the Orcust Engine to revive Tele-DAD.  Magicians' Souls also is definitely the new Brilliant Fusion when combined with Apprentice Illusion Magician, except even less of a brick due to how safe it is to run multiples of Apprentice. Combining this Engine with Krebons &amp; Emergency Teleport allows the deck to have a lot of options and can power through several negates while having enough of their own to disrupt the opponent whether going first or second.  This is going off of the April 2020 banlist as well."
